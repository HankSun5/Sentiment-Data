After years of uncertainty around liability for coders and software developers, officials are now drawing a clear line between creating technology and committing a crime. The US Justice Department has announced it will no longer target software developers who build Defi platforms without proof of criminal intent. Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti made the remarks Thursday during a digital assets summit in Wyoming. He said that writing code alone does not constitute a crime. This signals a significant change from earlier enforcement strategies where prosecutors charged developers for operating unlicensed money transmission businesses. Debate Over Money Transmission Rules Regulators have long applied stringent rules to companies in the money remittance business, but the rise of Defi systems is putting those standards to the test. Traditional payment platforms face clear obligations, while DeFi projects say those same rules don’t make sense in a code-driven environment. Money transmitters such as PayPal and Cash App must secure licenses and comply with anti-money laundering obligations. They also have to verify customers and report suspicious transactions. But decentralized exchanges argue these rules don’t fit their model since they have no control over user activity on their platforms. NEW: US DOJ’S ACTING AAG MATTHEW GALEOTTI SAYS “OUR VIEW IS THAT MERELY WRITING CODE, WITHOUT ILL INTENT, IS NOT A CRIME. INNOVATING NEW WAYS FOR THE ECONOMY TO STORE AND TRANSMIT VALUE AND CREATE WEALTH, WITHOUT ILL INTENT, IS NOT A CRIME” https://t.co/iyGVBr0BCZ — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) August 21, 2025 On Defi, Hiding Money & Ill Intent The issue came under the spotlight after a New York jury recently convicted Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash, on conspiracy charges linked to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Tornado Cash is a privacy service specifically designed to make Defi and cryptocurrency transactions more difficult to trace. Jurors could not reach a decision on whether Storm committed money laundering or violated sanctions. Prosecutors said the service allowed illicit finance, while critics of the case argued Storm had only written code. Prosecutors Will Prioritize Evidence Of Intent According to Galeotti, future cases in the Defi and crypto space will require proof that a developer knowingly aided fraud, sanctions evasion, or laundering. “Innovating new ways for the economy to store and transmit value and create wealth, without ill-intent, is not a crime,” he said. He added that laws banning unlicensed money transmission will not apply to developers unless there is evidence of deliberate wrongdoing. The focus of the US justices will remain on fraud, Ponzi schemes , and global laundering networks, including those based in China and other countries suspected of carrying out illicit transactions.

With several months to go in 2025, analysts are highlighting a number of projects as the best altcoin to buy now. While analysts’ watchlists would often feature established tokens such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink, a newcomer, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has made its way into the list, indicating its potential to deliver massive returns to investors. XRP and ADA Outlook XRP is trading around $2.89, but recent pullbacks haven’t scared off long-term holders. Ripple’s slowed token release schedule and its position in cross-border payments suggest room for growth, with some predictions calling for $4.78 or more in the next cycle. Cardano is sitting close to $1.00 and has whales quietly buying up nearly $100 million in ADA this summer. That kind of confidence, paired with upgrades like Hydra that improve speed and scalability, makes ADA a strong contender on lists of the best altcoins for 2025. LINK’s Continues to Gather Strength Meanwhile, Chainlink recently climbed above $26 after a series of buybacks and high-profile partnerships with names like ICE and Google Cloud. With nearly 40% of its supply staked, LINK continues to look like a long-term infrastructure play. Analysts following the token highlighted its potential to deliver gains but noted such gains may be incomparable to that of newer and emerging altcoin contenders. Analysts Predict Up to 5000% ROI For MAGACOIN FINANCE Holders XRP, ADA, LINK—and now MAGACOIN FINANCE —are topping analyst lists of best altcoins to buy for 2025. However, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only project that could deliver up to 5,000% ROI for investors. The reasons are clear. The slowdown in the market appears to have no effect on the project as momentum is building. Traders following the token say its trajectory mirrors life-changing rallies from previous bull cycles. That sounds bold, but experts argue it’s not out of the question. Why? Because MAGACOIN FINANCE combines a rare mix of utility, hype, and community backing, and these are factors investors look for when markets heat up. Bottom Line If 2025 plays out like past bull runs, the winners may not only be Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP, ADA, LINK, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are on track to deliver strong narratives and, potentially, explosive gains. However, for investors hoping to make massive returns on their investment, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned the pick as the best altcoin to buy in 2025.

Based on reports, Bitcoin was trading at about $113,240, down 3.4%, on August 22, 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop For 2025? $175,000, According To SOL Strategies Boss Crypto Analyst Flags Inflation Risk According to Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone, the simultaneous rise in equities, Treasury yields, gold and Bitcoin looks unstable and could push inflation higher if it continues. He warned that stronger risk-asset gains might nudge the Federal Reserve toward tighter policy, not easing, which would be the opposite of calls from US President Donald Trump to loosen policy this year. Reports have noted that Bitcoin fell from a local high of $120,050 to roughly $112,990, a decline of about 6% since last Friday, and that the crypto lost just over $1,000 in a few hours during the move. A Lot May Be Riding on Bitcoin/Gold Going Up – The simultaneous rise in equities, Treasury bond yields, Bitcoin and gold appears unsustainable, and at a minimum due for some volatility post-summer doldrums. A scenario my graphic highlights is that if risk assets keep rising,… pic.twitter.com/7xCLbw7DXy — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) August 22, 2025 Price Action And Market Moves Markets reacted quickly. Some traders booked profits after the spike, and others trimmed positions ahead of key Fed commentary at Jackson Hole. The pullback was not extreme by historical standards, but it shows how quickly sentiment can change. Markets have been watching Treasury yields and Powell’s comments closely, since those signals help decide whether risk assets will keep drawing fresh money. What The Numbers Mean For Investors Based on reports, the recent fall understates how much volatility persists in crypto. A 6% move in a few days is normal for Bitcoin’s history, yet it still matters for big holders and funds that move money in and out quickly. Some support levels around $112,000 were being watched by crypto tacticians, while traders said downside protection would likely be tested if yields continue higher. Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ Analysts’ Price Targets Analysts are split on where Bitcoin goes from here. Bernstein strategists, for example, have floated a scenario where Bitcoin could climb as high as $200,000 within months if certain on-chain flows and institutional demand persist. Other market players see a more modest path, with some guessing at a peak near $140,000 to $150,000 as the most realistic upside in the near term. At the same time, veteran voices like McGlone warn that downside scenarios remain possible if the Fed tightens.

Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, has officially submitted an S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed XRP ETF . This significant development, first reported by Watcher Guru on X, marks a crucial step toward potentially bringing XRP, the digital asset powering Ripple’s payment network, into a more mainstream investment vehicle. For many, this filing signals a growing institutional interest in diversifying crypto investment options beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Does Grayscale’s XRP ETF Filing Mean? When Grayscale files an S-1, it is essentially a registration statement required by the SEC for new securities offerings. It provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed fund, including its structure, investment objectives, and risks. This move indicates Grayscale’s serious intent to launch an XRP ETF , making it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the digital asset. The SEC’s review process for such filings can be lengthy and involves thorough scrutiny. An S-1 filing is a necessary prerequisite before any ETF can be considered for approval. It is a formal declaration of intent and a detailed blueprint for how the fund would operate. Why is an XRP ETF a Game Changer for Investors? The potential approval of an XRP ETF offers several compelling benefits. First, it simplifies access. Investors can buy shares of the ETF through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the complexities of crypto wallets, exchanges, and private key management. This ease of access significantly lowers the barrier to entry for many. Increased Liquidity: An ETF often brings greater liquidity to the underlying asset, making it easier to buy and sell. Regulatory Clarity: SEC oversight provides a layer of trust and regulatory clarity, appealing to institutional investors and those hesitant about the unregulated nature of some crypto markets. Diversification: It allows investors to diversify their crypto holdings beyond the dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This development could unlock substantial capital from institutional funds and retail investors who prefer regulated products. It truly represents a new era for digital asset investment. Navigating the Path: Challenges and Regulatory Hurdles for the XRP ETF While the prospect of an XRP ETF is thrilling, the path to approval is not without its challenges. The SEC has historically been cautious with crypto-related products, especially those involving assets that have faced regulatory scrutiny. XRP’s legal status in the U.S. has been a point of contention, with the SEC previously suing Ripple, alleging XRP is an unregistered security. However, recent court rulings have provided some clarity, distinguishing between institutional sales and programmatic sales on exchanges. This legal progress might pave a smoother way for an XRP ETF , but the SEC’s final decision remains uncertain. Grayscale must convince regulators that the fund meets all investor protection requirements, a task that demands meticulous detail and compliance. Looking Ahead: The Potential Impact of an Approved XRP ETF Should the SEC grant approval for an XRP ETF , the implications for the broader cryptocurrency market could be profound. Such an approval would not only legitimize XRP further as an investable asset but also set a precedent for other altcoins to follow suit. It would signal a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly integrated into traditional finance. We could see a surge in demand for XRP, potentially impacting its price and market capitalization. More importantly, it would represent a significant win for crypto advocates pushing for broader institutional adoption and regulated investment products. The market will be watching closely as this unfolds, eager to witness the next chapter in crypto investment. Grayscale’s S-1 filing for an XRP ETF is undeniably a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores the relentless drive towards integrating digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. While the journey to approval may be complex, the potential benefits for investors and the broader market are immense. This move highlights a future where accessing innovative digital assets like XRP becomes as straightforward as investing in traditional stocks. The crypto world holds its breath, anticipating the SEC’s next steps with great anticipation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an S-1 filing? An S-1 filing is a registration statement required by the U.S. SEC for new securities offerings. It provides detailed information about a company or fund looking to go public or offer new investment products, like an ETF. Why is an XRP ETF significant? An XRP ETF is significant because it would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP through a regulated and easily accessible investment vehicle, potentially boosting liquidity and institutional adoption for the asset. What are the main benefits of an XRP ETF? Key benefits include simplified access for investors, increased liquidity for XRP, and enhanced regulatory clarity and oversight, which can attract more institutional capital. What challenges does an XRP ETF face? The primary challenges include obtaining SEC approval, which has historically been cautious with crypto products, and navigating the ongoing regulatory discussions surrounding XRP’s legal classification. How does this impact XRP’s legal status? While an S-1 filing does not change XRP’s legal status directly, an SEC approval of an XRP ETF would implicitly acknowledge XRP as a legitimate asset for a regulated investment product, building on recent positive court rulings.

The complaint, submitted Thursday in federal court in San Jose, says sensor systems architect Chen Shi covertly drew on Apple’s health-sensing work to support his new role at the Chinese company. The filing states that Shi accessed restricted materials tied to Apple’s wearable program before leaving the company in June. Apple says those actions were taken for Oppo’s benefit while a rival product was being prepared. “Concealing his impending employment with a direct competitor, Dr. Shi set up and attended dozens of one-on-one meetings with Apple Watch technical team members to learn about their ongoing research,” the complaint states. Apple contends the activity intensified in the days immediately before his departure. The suit says that “late at night just three days before leaving Apple, Dr. Shi downloaded 63 documents from a protected Box folder.” It adds “He then transferred them to a USB drive one day before his departure.” as mentioned in a Bloomberg’s report . Apple alleges Shi lied about Departure, shared secrets with Oppo Apple says it often goes to court when others misuse its intellectual property. The complaint says that in recent years at least three former engineers from Apple’s now-ended self-driving car project were charged with crimes for taking secrets to China. The company has also been litigating with Irvine, California based Masimo Corp. over smartwatch technology since 2020 . Apple says Shi concealed his move to Guangdong Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp. by telling colleagues in Cupertino that he was returning to China to care for his aging parents. Apple says Shi violated his confidentiality and IP obligations, and that Oppo was aware of and encouraged his actions. In one alleged message sent in Chinese to Oppo’s vice president of health before he quit, Shi wrote that he had been “reviewing various internal materials and doing a lot of 1:1 meetings in an effort to collect as much information as possible — will share with you all later.” The Oppo executive replied “alright” and sent an “OK” emoji, according to the complaint. Apple warns of damage to innovation and fair Play Apple argues that letting the conduct by Shi and Oppo “to go unpunished would undermine Apple’s commitment to innovation and its substantial investments in pioneering technologies like Apple Watch.” The complaint continues stating “It would also risk destroying the value of Apple’s trade secrets and provide a competitor with an unfair advantage.” After his departure, Shi joined Oppo’s Silicon Valley research arm, which operates under the Oppo and InnoPeak names, the complaint says. The lawsuit is titled Apple Inc. v. Chen Shi, Guangdong Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp Ltd., and InnoPeak Technology Inc., No. 5:25-cv-7105, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division. The venue places the dispute in federal court in San Jose. The complaint details the alleged conduct in that filing. Get seen where it counts.

Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, recently achieved a remarkable milestone, hitting an Ethereum all-time high . After nearly four years, ETH surged past the $4,868 mark on major exchanges like Binance. This incredible rally signals renewed confidence in the network’s potential and its pivotal role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. Currently, CoinMarketCap reports ETH trading around $4,805.9, reflecting a significant 13.02% increase in just 24 hours. What Propelled This Ethereum All-Time High? Several key factors have converged to fuel Ethereum’s impressive ascent. Understanding these drivers helps paint a clearer picture of the network’s growing strength and market position. The journey to this Ethereum all-time high wasn’t a single event but a culmination of sustained development and increasing adoption. Explosive DeFi Growth: The decentralized finance sector, largely built on Ethereum, has seen unprecedented expansion. Billions of dollars are locked in various DeFi protocols, driving demand for ETH as the primary gas fee and collateral. NFT Boom: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the digital world by storm. The vast majority of high-value NFTs are minted and traded on the Ethereum blockchain, significantly increasing network activity and ETH utility. Anticipation of “The Merge”: The upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0, often referred to as “The Merge,” promises enhanced scalability, security, and energy efficiency through a proof-of-stake consensus. Investors eagerly await this major upgrade. EIP-1559 Implementation: The London hard fork introduced EIP-1559, changing Ethereum’s fee structure by burning a portion of transaction fees. This deflationary mechanism reduces the supply of ETH over time, making it scarcer. Institutional Interest: Major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly exploring and investing in Ethereum-based solutions and ETH itself, adding significant capital and legitimacy. Why is This ETH All-Time High So Significant for the Market? Reaching a new peak after such a long period is more than just a price number; it’s a powerful statement about Ethereum’s resilience and future prospects. This ETH all-time high reinforces its position as a dominant force in the crypto space, beyond just being a speculative asset. This milestone indicates robust investor confidence, suggesting market participants believe in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition and long-term viability. Moreover, it can trigger a positive feedback loop, attracting more developers, users, and capital into the ecosystem. The sustained growth of the Ethereum network is a testament to its innovative spirit and the dedication of its global community. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Ethereum’s Continued Growth? While the mood is certainly optimistic, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges Ethereum faces, even after reaching an Ethereum all-time high . No rapidly evolving technology is without its hurdles, and ETH is no exception. Addressing these issues will be vital for sustained growth. Scalability: Despite “The Merge” being on the horizon, current network congestion and high gas fees remain a concern for everyday users. Layer 2 solutions are helping, but a full solution is still under development. Regulatory Scrutiny: As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream adoption, regulatory bodies worldwide are increasing their focus. Potential regulations could impact how Ethereum operates or is traded. Competition: Other smart contract platforms, often dubbed “Ethereum killers,” are emerging with promises of faster transactions and lower fees. While Ethereum holds a significant first-mover advantage, competition is always a factor. Investors must remain informed about these aspects to make well-rounded decisions. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and understanding both opportunities and risks is paramount. How Can Investors Navigate This Exciting Ethereum Landscape? For those interested in the Ethereum ecosystem, the current market dynamics present both opportunities and considerations. It’s essential to approach the market with a clear strategy, especially after an Ethereum all-time high . Always conduct thorough research and consider your personal financial situation. Actionable Insights: Long-Term Perspective: Many experts view Ethereum as a long-term investment due to its foundational role in Web3. Consider a long-term holding strategy if you believe in its future. Diversification: While ETH is strong, diversifying your crypto portfolio can mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of network developments, such as “The Merge” updates, and broader market trends. Reliable news sources are key. Understand Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for rapid price swings. Be prepared for potential corrections even after significant gains. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Always consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The recent achievement of an Ethereum all-time high is a powerful testament to the network’s enduring innovation and its critical role in shaping the future of decentralized technology. This remarkable surge, after nearly four years, marks not just a price point but a significant vote of confidence from the global market. As Ethereum continues its evolution with upcoming upgrades and expanding use cases, its journey remains one of the most compelling narratives in the digital asset space. The future looks incredibly bright for this pioneering blockchain.

This scenario highlights the effectiveness of dollar-cost averaging (DCA), a strategy that involves buying fixed amounts of an asset at regular intervals regardless of short-term price movements. The DCA Approach Applied to XRP Dollar-cost averaging is often used to reduce the impact of volatility and avoid the risks of investing large sums at once. To assess how this strategy would have performed with XRP, we examined a case in which an investor allocated $10 per day to the token from July 2015 through July 2025. In mid-2015, XRP was priced around one cent and later dropped even further before beginning its climb. The asset remained below $1 until the end of 2017, when it briefly surged past that milestone before retreating again in 2018. Since then, XRP has experienced repeated attempts to reclaim higher price levels, including moves above $2 and $3, but has historically spent much of its existence trading under $1. Total Investment and Accumulated Tokens Over the ten years, an investor following this plan would have contributed $36,540 in total. The relatively low price of XRP during much of this period meant that each purchase secured a significant amount of tokens. According to calculations provided by Uphold’s DCA tool, the strategy would have resulted in ownership of approximately 1,066,678 XRP. When compared to everyday spending habits, this figure is notable. Research from Ramsey Solutions shows that the average American spends about $3,768 annually on impulse purchases, or $37,680 across ten years, slightly higher than the total $36,540 that would have been allocated to XRP in this investment scenario. Unlike discretionary spending, however, the steady commitment to XRP would have produced remarkable long-term value. At present market conditions, the 1.066 million XRP accumulated through this strategy would be valued at more than $3.04 million, given XRP’s trading price of roughly $2.85. Uphold’s calculator provides a slightly lower estimate of $2.35 million, but both figures underscore the scale of returns possible from disciplined long-term investing in the cryptocurrency market.

Market commentators continue to encourage similar approaches for the future. For example, Coach JV recently emphasised that investors who adopt a dollar-cost averaging strategy with assets such as XRP over the next decade may still achieve transformative results. Analysts have suggested that XRP could significantly surpass its current valuation, with some projecting potential long-term price targets of $50 or higher . If such forecasts materialise, initiating a DCA plan today could still yield notable returns. This case study demonstrates how consistent buying during both highs and lows can accumulate large holdings over time. While this example highlights exceptional historical performance, it is important to acknowledge that cryptocurrency markets remain unpredictable. Nonetheless, the data reinforces why many investors continue to view dollar-cost averaging as a disciplined and effective long-term strategy.

HBAR, LINK, and SUI are already catching attention for their strong setups, but there’s also growing buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE as analysts point to it as the best altcoin to buy right now . Here’s a closer look at 10 altcoins worth watching. 1. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera uses its unique hashgraph technology to run fast, cheap, and secure transactions. With over 10,000 transactions per second and backing from companies like IBM and LG, it’s carving a place in real-world use cases like supply chain, payments, and DeFi. For 2025, prices are expected to range from $0.18 to $0.54, with possible spikes reaching $0.75. According to long-term predictions, it will be more than $1 by 2030. 2. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink powers smart contracts with real-world data feeds—making it essential for DeFi and cross-chain applications. Many blockchain communities depend on it because it is so reliable. The price will range between $7 and $14 in 2025, and the long-term goal is for it to be over $20 in price. 3. Sui Network (SUI) Sui focuses on scalability and simple user experiences for Web3. It’s building around gaming, dApps, and fast transactions at low cost, giving it a growing role in the space. Price outlook: $0.50–$2.00 in 2025, with long-term growth possibly above $5. 4. Polygon (MATIC) Polygon makes Ethereum faster and cheaper through its Layer 2 scaling solutions. It’s widely used for DeFi and NFTs, helping reduce congestion while keeping fees low. Price outlook: $0.50–$1.50 in 2025 and $3+ by 2030. 5. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche is built for speed and scalability, giving developers a cheaper alternative to Ethereum. It’s well-suited for dApps and enterprise use cases. Price outlook: $15–$40 in 2025, with a possible climb past $60 by 2030. 6. Algorand (ALGO) Algorand delivers fast, low-cost transactions with its pure proof-of-stake system. It’s active in enterprise adoption, payments, and DeFi. Price outlook: $0.20–$0.70 in 2025, with longer-term potential of $2 by 2030. 7. Tezos (XTZ) Tezos stands out for its self-amending blockchain, avoiding hard forks by upgrading through on-chain governance. It’s well-known in NFTs and smart contracts. Price outlook: $1.50–$3.50 in 2025, with targets above $5 by 2030. 8. Cosmos (ATOM) Cosmos lets blockchains communicate and share data securely. With interoperability becoming more important, it’s one of the main projects pushing cross-chain growth. Price outlook: $10–$30 in 2025, with $50+ possible by 2030. 9. VeChain (VET) VeChain has a focus on supply chain and product tracking. Its blockchain is designed for business, making it suitable for anti-counterfeiting and supply chain. Price outlook: $0.03–$0.12 in 2025, and up to $0.30 by 2030. MAGACOIN FINANCE—Analysts See a 70x Surge Potential While HBAR, LINK, and SUI are looking strong, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as the hidden gem of this cycle. Forecasts indicate that it might jump 70x, and early adopters are already feeling the FOMO . Adding to this is a 50% extra bonus thanks to code PATRIOT50X—early investors get more upside before the market gets going. People don’t want to miss out on MAGA in 2025 because of its growing community and appeal. Final Outlook The pursuit of the hidden gems is gaining momentum as the next bull market approaches. HBAR, LINK, and SUI all stand on the verge of great breakouts, but the altcoin on everyone mind at the moment is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Investors are keen on this one while it is still young to get an edge.

50515066,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=790391,1755905706,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50515066.jpeg,Wall Street eyes strong August finish with Powell speech behind and Nvidia earnings ahead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-eyes-strong-august-finish/,"Wall Street closed out this week with a surge that wiped out most of August’s usual misery, after Jerome Powell dropped what may be his final comments from Jackson Hole, confirming the Federal Reserve is leaning toward cutting interest rates in mid-September. That speech, delivered Friday in Wyoming, sent stocks flying across every sector, including tech, semiconductors, small caps, and regional banks. It gave investors what they’ve been waiting on for weeks — a clear signal that monetary policy is about to loosen. “Powell delivered a final Jackson Hole speech to be remembered,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “He essentially gave investors what they had been hoping for, which was a dovish outlook on future Fed policy.” Sam added, “It has removed an important restraint that was tied to investor optimism. In that the Fed now seems fairly clear that they will, or are leaning toward, cutting rates in mid-September.” Markets react to Powell’s comments and Nvidia’s upcoming earnings On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 900 points, or about 2%, during intraday trading, enough to register a new all time high, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. The Russell 2000 surged by over 3%, and the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index broke past its previous high set in November 2023, according to data from CNBC. Semiconductors shot higher, regional banks moved; even large-cap tech saw a big snapback. The Magnificent Seven had their best session since May, with nearly $370 billion in market value added by the close, roughly the same size as Procter & Gamble. The next test for this rally hits next week when Nvidia releases earnings. Analysts expect the chipmaker to beat expectations again, as it has throughout the artificial intelligence boom. But these results are coming at a tense moment. The company’s exposure to China has become a problem, thanks to policy moves under President Donald Trump’s administration and regulatory pushback from Beijing. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed on Friday that he is now talking with the U.S. government about shipping a different version of its H20 chip to China, one that complies with updated export controls. Nvidia is also preparing to give 15% of its China chip revenue to the U.S. government in return for a license to keep selling there. Despite the geopolitical risk, analysts are still bullish. Harsh Kumar, semiconductor analyst at Piper Sandler, said, “We anticipate a meaningful uptick in estimates on the Street for Nvidia, when these earnings are done.” Harsh still maintains a buy rating on the stock. July inflation data could support September rate cut Also landing next week is the July Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which the Fed uses as its preferred measure of inflation. Economists expect core PCE to rise 2.9% year-over-year, just slightly above June’s 2.8% reading. This uptick is expected to reflect new costs coming from tariffs, but nothing that would derail the case for a rate cut. Even if inflation edges higher, Wall Street doesn’t seem too worried. Sam said, “Investors are well aware of short-term hurdles. So, next week, I think, should end up being a positive week.” With Powell’s tone already leaning dovish, and signs of cooling inflation, markets look ready to brush off minor bumps. As of Friday, the Dow is up over 3%, leading the major indexes. The S&P 500 has gained 2%, while the Nasdaq Composite, home to the big tech names, is lagging behind with a rise of just over 1%. Even that gain is notable, given the pressure tech stocks have faced all month. With Powell’s speech behind them, Nvidia’s report on deck, and inflation data coming soon, traders are betting August could close out a winner for once.

The document in question was originally filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and registered in December 2013. It covered the brand name XRP for use in financial services, such as “providing secure payment options to members of an online community via a global computer network through the use of traditional currency and virtual currency.” BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! An unknown document has been revealed, showing that the United States of America has already patented #XRP and has classified it as a payment method for financial services! 💥🔥 pic.twitter.com/dfxKgAHzA4 — JackTheRippler ©️ (@RippleXrpie) August 20, 2025 The resurfacing of the old document, however, came with misinterpretations that the application was filed by the U.S. government, which means an endorsement of Ripple or XRP. Does the U.S. government own the XRP patent? While the document is legit, it wasn’t filed by the federal government, nor is it a patent application. It’s nothing more than a trademark registration filed by OpenCoin, Inc., which is now known as Ripple. OpenCoin was founded in September 2012 by Chris Larsen and McCaleb. It rebranded to Ripple Labs in 2013 and was shortened to Ripple in 2015. Trademark registrations are not a vote of approval. It’s something a company does to seek protection for its brand names and stop everyone else from using them. In this case, Ripple filed to protect the “XRP” word name, and it’s just one of the many applications initiated by the company. Earlier this year, Ripple filed a trademark application for “Ripple Custody,” raising speculations that the firm could launch a crypto wallet or custodial services. It had also filed for “Ripple Payments,” “RLUSD,” and “Ripple USD” trademarks in 2024, in anticipation of launching its stablecoin, RLUSD. According to the USPTO , Ripple Labs currently has 67 trademark applications. Elsewhere, a report shows Ripple Labs has issued a total of 39 patents globally, with only 18 having been granted. Of all the 39 patents, more than 62% patents are active. XRP becomes the third-largest crypto XRP, meanwhile, has reclaimed the third spot in the crypto market. At the time of writing, it was trading at $3.08 on Coingecko, with a $183 billion market cap. The price has been soaring so far this year, as investors began to see an end to the years-long legal tussle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP/USDT ID price chart Cryptopolitan reported Friday that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has approved an agreement for both sides to drop their appeals.

Her exit leaves the IRS crypto office without a clear leader as major tax changes near. Turner’s move follows the IRS putting new rules and forms in place to guide tax duties for individual crypto investors and for their brokers. The departure follows exits by two other crypto leads, Seth Wilks and Raj Mukherjee, who left earlier this year amid the Trump administration’s budget cuts. It is not yet clear who will serve as interim leader of the digital assets unit. The tax arm of the Treasury Department is bracing for a flood of crypto-sector filings while also dealing with deep budget and staffing cuts in excess of 20,000 employees. The agency’s workforce, often criticized by Republican lawmakers, has shrunk from roughly 113,000 about 30 years ago to around 76,000 in the latest count. New 1099-DA forms signal bigger filing demands One of the biggest changes is the new 1099-DA form that millions of investors will get from their crypto brokers. Roughly 3 million filers have reported making crypto trades, a figure widely seen as low, suggesting many more people will newly disclose crypto activity as the rules take effect. The IRS did not respond to questions about Turner’s exit or who will lead the unit next. “Digital assets have shifted from a niche issue to a core focus for global regulators, and I am proud to have helped lay the foundation for oversight in this fast-changing space,” Turner said in a statement to CoinDesk . “Now, I’m excited to be moving to the other side of the table to help taxpayers, businesses, and institutions understand their obligations and navigate those same rules with confidence.” Turner said she will take private-sector roles that include serving as tax director at CryptoTaxGirl, a tax firm that specializes in crypto transactions, and doing work with the U.K. firm Asset Reality. Laura Walter, CTG’s founder, said in a statement that Turner’s arrival will help “ensure our clients receive the highest level of guidance, protection, and confidence in their filings.” Crypto tax compliance still clouded For years, crypto investors and businesses have faced U.S. tax uncertainty, with no third-party documentation that clearly spelled out what they needed to file. Many digital-asset holders did not compute or report their crypto taxes in prior years, adding to the IRS’s challenges. Because the new 1099-DA forms will start flowing from accounts at firms such as Coinbase and Kraken early next year, those recipients will be under more pressure to calculate and disclose their tax positions. However, in April Cryptopolitan reported that Congress overturned an IRS measure that would have classified some DeFi platforms as brokers, leaving tax treatment for that part of the market unclear.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $106.33 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $319.75 by 2031. The Ethereum Name Service is a network that enables crypto enthusiasts to rename their cryptocurrency addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031.

The RSI at 53.24 suggests neutral momentum, leaving room for further upside if buyers sustain pressure. Price is approaching the mid-Bollinger Band at $26.95, and a break above could open a path toward $30.32 resistance. However, the MACD remains negative, signaling that bearish forces are not fully exhausted. Holding above $26.50 is key for a continuation, while a rejection could trigger a pullback toward $24. Short-term sentiment leans cautiously bullish with overhead resistance to test. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENSUSD chart by TradingView Ethereum Name Service (ENS) on the 4-hour chart shows a sharp bullish breakout, surging to $27.82 with strong buying momentum. Price has pierced the upper Bollinger Band at $27.08, suggesting temporary overextension but also confirming bullish strength. The MACD is strongly positive at 0.43, reflecting accelerating upward momentum, while the Balance of Power at 1.00 indicates complete dominance by buyers. If the momentum holds, ENS could attempt a push toward $29–$30 in the near term. However, if profit-taking occurs, support lies at $25.01, where consolidation may stabilize price before the next leg. Short-term sentiment remains strongly bullish. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $22.26 BUY SMA 5 $23.95 BUY SMA 10 $26.21 BUY SMA 21 $ 27.43 SELL SMA 50 $23.30 BUY SMA 100 $ 22.40 BUY SMA 200 $19.47 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 25.66 BUY EMA 5 $24.30 BUY EMA 10 $ 22.15 BUY EMA 21 $20.02 BUY EMA 50 $19.98 BUY EMA 100 $ 22.22 BUY EMA 200 $23.51 BUY What to expect from ENS? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows mixed signals across the 1-day and 4-hour charts. On the daily timeframe, ENS has rebounded strongly from support near $23.58, climbing above $27.42 and breaking through its mid-Bollinger Band at $26.95, which signals renewed bullish momentum. RSI at 53 suggests room for growth before overbought levels. On the 4-hour chart, ENS surged aggressively to $27.82, closing above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating strong but potentially overheated buying pressure. MACD remains highly bullish, while the Balance of Power at 1.00 shows buyers in full control. Short-term volatility is expected, but overall bias leans bullish. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $130.79 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $319.75 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest.

This DeFi project, which has garnered attention due to its reported links to the Trump family, is set to make its token tradable. The crucial WLFI token unlock event is scheduled for September 1, marking a new chapter for the platform. For those tracking new digital assets, understanding these developments is key. What Does the WLFI Token Unlock Entail? World Liberty Financial recently confirmed via an announcement on X that its native token is now live on the Ethereum mainnet. This means that starting September 1 at 12:00 UTC, the WLFI token will become fully tradable and transferable. Upon launch, 20% of the total WLFI tokens will be claimable by eligible participants. This initial distribution is a significant step towards decentralization. The remaining 80% of tokens will not be immediately available; instead, their release will be determined by a community governance vote at a later date. This approach emphasizes community involvement in the project’s future. It is also important to note that tokens allocated to founders, team members, advisors, and partners will remain locked, preventing immediate sell-offs and promoting long-term commitment.

In a notice dated August 22, the intergovernmental organization stated that it will join forces with Angolan officials to close down 25 crypto mining operations illegally operated by 60 Chinese citizens. Following the Angola crypto crime, equipment worth over $37 million was seized. The relevant authorities in the country highlighted that this equipment will be distributed as financial support to vulnerable areas. The measures taken against mining in Angola are part of a big cybercrime operation conducted across several African countries. So far,1,209 individuals have been arrested, and around $97 million has been recovered under this operation. Apart from Angola, Zambia has also been exposed to a fraud scheme . This was revealed after officials in the country identified a scenario whereby 65,000 individuals experienced significant financial losses amounting to $300 million following fake promises of higher returns upon making crypto investments. Authorities implement mining regulations to address power supply issues The population of Angola is estimated to be roughly 39 million. Power supply and distribution are the country’s primary problems in these regions. The government has predominantly pointed the accusing finger at crypto miners for this scenario, resulting in a crackdown on their operations. This led to a ban on mining in April 2024 amid concerns about energy use . That said, digital assets are not entirely prohibited in Angola. Following the ban implemented on mining, a translated notice was released from the Chinese embassy in Angola stating that cryptocurrency mining under this law was considered illegal. It also warned that individuals possessing any equipment or infrastructure used for virtual currency ‘mining’ could be imprisoned for about one to five years, and the equipment might be taken away. This law illustrates a growing trend among countries globally, aiming to limit or completely ban crypto mining to address how power is shared among citizens. A good example is the Republic of Buryatia, which is part of Russia, that recently applied these measures, and authorities discovered the existence of around 95 mining rigs and a mobile transformer hidden inside a truck that was unlawfully using electricity. In the US, laws governing the mining sector differ from state to state. That has pumped “friendly” locations like Texas, where businesses like MARA Holdings, Riot Platforms, and CleanSpark do business. As of 2022, New York’s state government prohibited proof-of-work mining in the state for two years. Electricity theft related to crypto mining intensifies as power shortage increases During a regular power line inspection in Pribaikalsky District, officials in Russia’s Republic of Buryatia discovered the existence of a cryptocurrency mining operation that operated illegally, which was concealed in a KamAZ truck. The operation was to acquire an unauthorized electricity supply from a nearby village. According to the Russian state news agency TASS, this setup acquired electricity from a 10-kilovolt line to provide power to a small village. After being recognized, two people familiar with the situation revealed that the operation escaped in an SUV before police officers arrived. This scenario is the sixth case of electricity theft related to crypto mining in Buryatia this year, Rosseti Siberia’s Buryatenergo unit said. Get seen where it counts.

CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that the company has had to adapt its policies significantly to counteract these threats from North Korea. Coinbase CEO Warns Of North Korean IT Workers Armstrong highlighted the alarming trend of North Korean information technology (IT) workers attempting to exploit Coinbase’s remote work policy to gain employment and access sensitive systems within the exchange. He noted that the threat posed by these hackers is escalating, reflecting a continuous influx of new talent emerging from North Korea. “It feels like there’s 500 new people graduating every quarter from some kind of school they have,” Armstrong remarked. In response to these security concerns , Coinbase has mandated that all employees travel to the United States for in-person orientation. Additionally, anyone with access to sensitive information must be a US citizen and undergo fingerprinting. The FBI recently issued an updated warning regarding North Korean IT workers who engage with private companies to generate illicit revenue for the regime. These workers reportedly collaborate with both “witting and unwitting” accomplices in the US, facilitating their activities by reshipping company laptops, attending virtual interviews on behalf of North Korean candidates, and even setting up front businesses. New Facility In Charlotte And Stricter Employee Controls To further secure its hiring processes, the crypto exchange has implemented measures such as requiring prospective employees to activate their cameras during interviews. This step is intended to ensure that candidates are genuine and not being coached or manipulated by external forces. Armstrong emphasized that the need for rigorous security protocols has led Coinbase to enhance its customer support operations, particularly with the establishment of a new facility in Charlotte, North Carolina. Armstrong also pointed out the increasing importance of verifying physical presence in an era characterized by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deepfake technology. He noted that as the stakes in cybersecurity rise, certain aspects of remote work may need to be reevaluated. In addition to external threats, Coinbase is actively working to mitigate internal risks. Armstrong mentioned that malicious actors have offered significant bribes to customer service agents in exchange for sensitive information. To combat this, Coinbase has implemented strict controls over the information its employees can access and has made it clear that any violations will have serious consequences. Armstrong stated, “When we catch people, we don’t walk them out the door; they go to jail.” He reiterated that no amount of money is worth the risk of losing one’s freedom.

50515364,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79770,1755907207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Predicts XRP Could Exceed Expectations. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-predicts-xrp-could-exceed-expectations-heres-why/,"A recent policy change in the United States could reshape the cryptocurrency market, particularly for XRP. Following an executive order from President Donald Trump that permits the inclusion of alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans, market commentators believe XRP may be positioned to gain significantly through the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Potential Impact of 401(k) Policy Reform The adjustment to retirement account rules could allow everyday investors to gain exposure to digital assets earlier than before. Analyst Paul Barron emphasized that the flow of retirement capital into crypto is most likely to occur through structured investment vehicles like ETFs. With proposals for XRP ETFs under review and potential approval expected in the coming months, Barron argued that XRP stands to benefit directly from this regulatory shift. He raised the question of whether including XRP in ETFs and retirement accounts could elevate Ripple into the category of leading next-generation financial firms while providing substantial value to long-term holders. Trillions in Retirement Assets Could Enter the Market Rupert, a commentator from AllinCrypto, expanded on this argument by noting that U.S. 401(k) plans currently hold between $7 trillion and $9 trillion. He explained that the introduction of crypto ETFs into these accounts would unlock vast pools of liquidity, much of which has traditionally remained limited to equities and bonds. According to Rupert, this development has the potential to transform the trajectory of XRP. He emphasized that while not all of the retirement capital would move into XRP specifically, even a fraction could have a major impact on price and liquidity. Why XRP May Outperform Expectations Rupert also compared XRP’s potential to the success of existing crypto ETFs . The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF quickly became the most successful ETF launch in history, while Ethereum ETFs reached $10 billion in record time. In his view, XRP could outperform these benchmarks because of the way institutional players already perceive its long-term utility as a global payments solution. He further revealed that conversations with exchange-traded product providers suggest approval for an XRP ETF could arrive as soon as September. Such an outcome, he argued, could spark significant growth in the second half of 2025 and potentially disrupt the typical four-year market cycle by creating a more sustained growth phase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 To reinforce his perspective, Rupert pointed to historical examples, such as Microsoft’s rise from a $39 billion valuation in the 1980s to its current value of nearly $4 trillion, demonstrating that market caps do not necessarily limit growth potential. In addition to Rupert’s commentary, Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, outlined how ETFs could directly influence XRP’s market performance. He explained that XRP would not need a substantial price increase to qualify for an ETF. Instead, the listing itself could create a supply squeeze, leading to upward price pressure once the funds are live. Claver added that other catalysts, such as treasury allocations, exchange liquidity shortages, or potential instability in stablecoins like Tether, might trigger market movements earlier. However, he stressed that the introduction of XRP ETFs would act as a significant accelerant for future price growth. The alignment of new retirement fund policies, anticipated ETF approvals, and institutional recognition has led analysts to believe that XRP could play a central role in the next phase of cryptocurrency adoption. While the scale of investment inflows will depend on investor behavior, the possibility of tapping into trillions of dollars in retirement assets underscores the importance of upcoming decisions around XRP ETFs . If approved, these funds may establish XRP as one of the most strategically positioned assets in the digital economy.

If you’re searching for the best cryptos to buy that combine upside potential with real-world engagement, this list is a solid place to start. These four picks aren’t just climbing charts, they’re driving user growth and transforming how people interact with digital finance. BlockDAG (BDAG): Mobile Mining for Millions BlockDAG is topping investor watchlists for good reason. It’s not just another token trying to get listed; it’s building an entirely new model of how crypto works from the ground up. At the center of its growth story is the X1 mobile miner app, which already has over 2.5 million users. This app lets anyone earn BDAG coins by simply tapping a button once a day. No mining rigs. No energy costs. No complexity. Just pure accessibility. BlockDAG is onboarding everyday users from around the world, especially in regions where traditional mining or buying crypto isn’t feasible. And this isn’t just early hype. The project has already raised $380 million in its presale, with over 25 billion coins sold and 29 batches completed. Each batch increases the price, with the current one sitting at $0.0276, up 2,660% from batch 1. With a listing price set at $0.05, early buyers are still in strong profit territory with plenty of room to grow. The simplicity of the X1 app is redefining what it means to mine. It’s no longer limited to those with expensive ASIC hardware. Now, anyone with a smartphone can join the network, making BlockDAG not just a crypto investment, but a daily habit. For anyone looking for the best cryptos to buy right now with strong user metrics, BlockDAG’s combination of low entry cost and massive adoption gives it clear frontrunner status. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still the People’s Coin Dogecoin is a classic that refuses to be forgotten. While it started as a meme, it has become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. It’s widely accepted for tipping, small transactions, and even retail purchases thanks to integrations with platforms like BitPay. Its loyal community and frequent social media momentum make it hard to ignore. Despite its joke origins, Dogecoin has stuck around longer than many high-profile projects. That’s because people actually use it. With low fees and fast transactions, it remains one of the easiest cryptos to send and receive. Investors continue to keep a close eye on DOGE for its sudden spikes, driven by both community enthusiasm and celebrity mentions. If you’re building a list of the best cryptos to buy for consistent relevance and real-world use, DOGE still deserves a place. Stellar (XLM): Speed Meets Simplicity Stellar has carved out its place in the payments space with one of the fastest and cheapest transaction systems available today. Its primary goal is to simplify cross-border payments, especially for unbanked populations. This focus has attracted partnerships with major financial players, including MoneyGram and Circle, giving it a real foothold in global finance. The native token, XLM, powers the network and acts as a bridge currency for fast asset swaps. It also plays a vital role in Stellar’s growing number of remittance and micropayment solutions. XLM has remained a steady performer in the mid-cap range and continues to be a strong option for those who want exposure to crypto that solves real-world problems. For buyers interested in utility over hype, Stellar stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy this year. Tron (TRX): The Content Economy’s Power Token Tron is focused on decentralizing the web by allowing users to create, share, and monetize content without middlemen. The network is optimized for high-throughput and low-fee transactions, making it ideal for powering entertainment platforms, gaming apps, and decentralized file storage systems. The TRX token is central to this entire ecosystem. It fuels everything from staking and governance to in-app purchases and reward mechanisms. Tron’s strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region and its ability to onboard millions of users through platforms like BitTorrent and SunSwap have made it one of the more robust ecosystems in the space. What makes Tron compelling is how deeply it’s integrated into real user applications. It’s not just sitting in wallets; it’s flowing through platforms that people use daily. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy with long-term infrastructure backing and a growing decentralized web presence, TRX is a smart bet. Final Thoughts All four of these projects stand out for more than just hype. BlockDAG is building a daily crypto habit through mobile mining. Dogecoin continues to thrive through community power. Stellar delivers on cross-border efficiency. Tron powers an active, content-driven ecosystem. If your goal is to invest in projects that people are actually using, and that still have room to grow, then these are the best cryptos to buy right now. BlockDAG especially stands out for combining early-stage entry with real traction. With the presale nearing its cap, the clock is ticking for buyers who want in before listing day.

For the first time ever, the token has soared past the $900 mark, marking a truly remarkable moment for its holders and the broader Binance ecosystem. This impressive surge reflects strong market confidence and growing utility. What’s Fueling This Remarkable BNB All-Time High? Several key factors are contributing to BNB’s incredible ascent. The robust growth of the Binance ecosystem, including the BNB Chain, plays a crucial role. This network supports a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps), attracting more users and developers to its platform. As activity on the BNB Chain expands, demand for the native token naturally increases. Moreover, Binance’s strategic token burn programs consistently reduce the total supply of BNB. This deflationary mechanism creates scarcity, which can drive up the token’s value over time. Increased utility across various Binance services, from trading fee discounts to participation in launchpad projects, also makes BNB an attractive asset for many crypto enthusiasts. Ecosystem Expansion: Growth of BNB Chain and its dApps. Strategic Token Burns: Reduction in total BNB supply. Increased Utility: Wider adoption for various Binance services. Market Sentiment: Overall bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. The Journey to a New BNB All-Time High: A Closer Look The recent price action saw BNB trading at $900.12, representing a substantial 7.05% increase over the past day, according to CoinMarketCap. This rapid climb showcases the dynamic nature of the crypto market. Historically, BNB has demonstrated resilience and consistent growth, building a strong foundation for its current success. This new BNB all-time high is not an isolated event but rather a culmination of years of development and strategic positioning. Investors are keenly watching how this momentum will sustain. The market’s reaction to this milestone is overwhelmingly positive, with many seeing it as a validation of Binance’s long-term vision. However, it is always wise to remember that cryptocurrency markets can be volatile, and price movements can change quickly. What Does This BNB All-Time High Mean for Holders? For existing BNB holders, this BNB all-time high translates into significant gains in their portfolios.

After reaching multi-year highs, XRP now faces selling pressure from some of its largest holders. On-chain data shows that wallets with millions of tokens are unloading their positions, a move that often signals an upcoming downturn. For traders, this wave of whale sell-offs raises concerns that XRP’s latest rally could be losing steam. Many of these large holders are also exploring new opportunities, with some looking at emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for diversification and stronger upside potential. Whale Activity Signals Trouble Ahead Whale activity has always been a critical factor in XRP’s market behavior. In the past, accumulation during dips supported rallies, but now the trend has flipped toward distribution. This reversal suggests that whales may believe XRP’s latest run has reached its peak, at least in the short term. Their actions often set the tone for retail traders, and the current selling wave could amplify downward pressure if demand fails to absorb the supply hitting the market. Market and Regulatory Pressures Weighing on XRP At the same time, broader market conditions are not helping. Bitcoin and Ethereum are under pressure, dragging altcoins lower, while uncertainty in global markets has made investors more cautious. Regulatory clouds are also hanging over XRP, with delays on spot ETF approvals and continued scrutiny from regulators dampening institutional demand. Why Whales Are Exploring Alternatives Amid this uncertain backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the projects catching investor attention. Early participants are already seeing strong momentum, with demand far outpacing supply. What makes it stand out is its rapid community growth and potential to deliver life-changing gains – a $2,500 position could turn into more than $50,000 for early entrants if growth continues at its current pace. With whales diversifying into such opportunities, smaller investors are watching closely to secure their own spot before wider adoption. Will XRP Crash or Recover? Looking ahead, the critical question is whether XRP can hold its current levels or if selling will accelerate. While a sharp crash is not guaranteed, the combination of whale sell-offs, weak technicals, and regulatory uncertainty is keeping sentiment fragile. A sudden positive catalyst could still reverse the trend, but for now, traders are bracing for more downside. In short, XRP faces a crucial test in the coming weeks, while investors are increasingly looking to diversify into fast-growing alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE that promise bigger upside potential in the next market cycle.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared his insightful thoughts on safeguarding Ethereum base layer neutrality . He warned against the dangers of excessive centralization in block production, a topic crucial for the network’s future. Buterin’s vision emphasizes a robust defense strategy to keep Ethereum’s foundation fair and open for everyone. This isn’t just about preventing bad actors; it’s about building a system that can withstand future challenges and ensure true decentralization. Why is Ethereum Base Layer Neutrality So Important? The base layer of any blockchain is its fundamental infrastructure. If this layer becomes centralized, even slightly, it opens the door to potential censorship, manipulation, and a loss of the very trustless nature that cryptocurrencies promise. Buterin understands this deeply, and his recent post on X (formerly Twitter) outlined three key defenses to protect this crucial aspect: Strengthening the Public Mempool: Imagine a public waiting room for all transactions. Buterin advocates for making this mempool so strong that blocks can be built without relying on any single, centralized entity. This ensures that everyone’s transactions have a fair chance of being included. Developing Distributed Block-Building Technology: Instead of a few large players building most blocks, this approach aims to spread the block-building process across many participants. This makes it much harder for any single group to gain too much control. Introducing Additional Inclusion Channels: Even if a small number of professional builders dominate block production, there should be alternative ways to guarantee your transaction gets included. This acts as a safety net against potential censorship. These strategies collectively aim to make the network more resilient and ensure that Ethereum base layer neutrality remains a cornerstone of its design. How Will Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) Help? One of the innovative proposals Buterin highlighted is Fork-Choice enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL). This mechanism is designed to actively promote transaction inclusion and combat the risk of an ‘oligopoly’ – where a few powerful block builders could veto transactions they don’t like. Here’s how it works: FOCIL proposes selecting 17 proposers per slot. One proposer has the final say on transaction ordering. The other 16 are ‘auxiliary proposers’ whose transactions must also be included in the block. This design significantly reduces the workload for auxiliary proposers while still ensuring a broader range of transactions are processed. It’s a clever way to distribute power and enforce fair play, directly supporting Ethereum base layer neutrality . Extending Censorship Resistance with Account Abstraction The conversation around FOCIL doesn’t stop at just block builders. Buterin also touched upon how account abstraction upgrades, such as EIP-7701, could further enhance censorship resistance. Account abstraction aims to make smart contract wallets as powerful and flexible as regular accounts, opening up new possibilities. With these upgrades, the benefits of FOCIL and other neutrality measures could extend to a wider array of users and applications. This includes smart contract wallets and even privacy protocols, making the entire Ethereum ecosystem more robust against unwanted interference. The ultimate goal, as Buterin stated, is to prevent any block builder oligopoly from having the power to veto legitimate transactions. The Future of Ethereum’s Decentralized Core Buterin’s proactive approach to discussing and proposing solutions for Ethereum base layer neutrality demonstrates a strong commitment to the network’s foundational values. By continuously exploring and implementing mechanisms like FOCIL and leveraging upgrades like EIP-7701, the Ethereum community aims to build a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant platform. This ongoing effort ensures that Ethereum remains a public good, accessible and fair for all participants, rather than falling prey to the pitfalls of centralization that plague traditional systems. It’s a complex challenge, but one that the community is actively working to overcome, securing a vibrant future for the network. FAQs: Q1: What does “Ethereum base layer neutrality” mean? A1: It refers to the principle that Ethereum’s core infrastructure should not favor or discriminate against any specific transactions, users, or applications. It must remain unbiased and open to all. Q2: Why is centralization a threat to Ethereum’s base layer? A2: If block production becomes too centralized, a small group of entities could potentially censor transactions, manipulate the network, or extract unfair value, undermining Ethereum’s decentralized ethos. Q3: How does a public mempool help maintain neutrality? A3: A strong public mempool ensures that all pending transactions are visible and accessible to anyone building a block, reducing reliance on private transaction channels and promoting fair inclusion. Q4: What is FOCIL and how does it support neutrality? A4: FOCIL (Fork-Choice enforced Inclusion Lists) is a proposed mechanism that requires block proposers to include transactions from auxiliary proposers. This distributes transaction inclusion power and prevents a single entity from vetoing transactions, thereby enhancing Ethereum base layer neutrality . Q5: How do account abstraction upgrades relate to censorship resistance? A5: Account abstraction, through upgrades like EIP-7701, makes smart contract wallets more capable. This allows for more sophisticated and flexible methods of ensuring transaction inclusion and privacy, extending censorship resistance to a broader range of users and protocols. Q6: What is Vitalik Buterin’s overall goal with these defenses? A6: Vitalik’s main goal is to prevent the formation of a ‘block builder oligopoly’ – a small group of powerful entities that could control transaction inclusion. He aims to ensure Ethereum remains a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant platform. Did you find this article insightful?

According to the report , Apple recently approached Google to build a custom AI model to power its refurbished Siri next year. This comes as the iPhone maker has delayed release of the revamped Siri voice assistant. Alphabet shares rise on Apple’s Siri collaboration In response to the news, Google’s parent company Alphabet’s shares went up 3.7% while Apple’s stock rose by 1.6%, both tech giants extending gains in afternoon trading. According to the reports, Apple is yet to decide if it should stick to its in-house Siri models or switch to an external partner. The company has not yet chosen that external partner. The search engine giant said that it did not have a comment over the report while Apple also remained muted about the matter. Apple is trying to play catch up with peers in the AI race. The report further shows that Apple has lagged smartphone makers like Google and Samsung in deploying generative AI features which have rapidly integrated advanced assistants and advanced models across products. This comes after delays to a long promised overhaul of the Siri voice assistant designed to execute tasks using personal context and enable full voice-based control. Reports indicate that the upgrade, which was initially slated for this last spring was pushed back by a year as a result of engineering setbacks. As a result of the failure, Apple sidelined AI chief John Giannandrea from Siri development. The project, according to Seeking Alpha , is now being handled by software head Craig Federighi and Vision Pro headset creator Mike Rockwell. These are considering using external help as a possible way forwards. The update was reportedly developed around technology developed by the Apple Foundation Models team, the same group that also developed the on-device large language model that supports the Apple Intelligence features like summarizing text and creating custom emoji. Apple is also said to be simultaneously developing two versions of Siri. One of the model is known as Linwood, that is powered by its models and another one known as Glenwood, which runs on outside technology. Management favored Anthropic as their preferred option for collaboration but the startup set financial terms that forced Apple to broaden its search and bring others to the table, while it has also not ruled out sticking to its own models. According to Seeking Alpha, these discussions are separate from other previous agreements to integrate chatbots into Apple Intelligence. In 2024, the company added ChatGPT as a Siri fallback for general knowledge questions. Apple and Google have both publicly revealed plans for a similar Gemini integration. Apple lags behind peers in AI race According to Reuters , Siri has historically lagged behind and less capable than Alexa and Google Assistant at handling complex, multi-step requests and integrating with third party apps. Apple also explored potential partnerships with Anthropic and OpenAI earlier this year, considering whether Claude of ChatGPT could power a revamped Siri, as per earlier reports. As for the Siri partnerships, third-party models would run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers that use Mac chips for remote AI processing, which means the external Siri models would not run on devices themselves, according to reports. CEO Tim Cook declined to comment on the use of third-party models during the company’s quarterly earnings call, saying that any discussions would reveal the tech firm’s plans. The iPhone maker has already begun enlisting partners for some consumer features and its internal operations. The company is offering ChatGPT option for generating images in the iOS 26 operating system. It also ended a publicly announced project to develop its own generative AI-based coding system, and the company is reportedly using ChatGPT and Claude.

More than $350 million in short positions were liquidated in a single day, according to reports from Zerohedge on X. This massive financial upheaval occurred precisely as Ethereum (ETH) surged to an astonishing new all-time high, catching many traders off guard. It highlights the inherent volatility and rapid shifts that define the digital asset landscape, reminding us that in crypto, fortunes can change in an instant. What Exactly Happened to Ethereum Shorts? For those new to the trading lexicon, “shorting” an asset like Ethereum means betting its price will fall. Traders essentially borrow ETH from an exchange, sell it at the current market price, and hope to buy it back at a lower price later. They then return the borrowed ETH, profiting from the price difference. However, this strategy carries significant risk, especially in a market known for its sudden surges. When the price moves dramatically against a short position, substantial losses can occur, leading to what’s known as liquidation. What is Liquidation? Liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. It’s triggered when the market moves unfavorably, and the trader’s margin (collateral) can no longer cover potential losses. This mechanism prevents traders from incurring debts beyond their means. The $350 Million Event: As ETH’s price soared to its new peak, the value of countless short positions plummeted. Exchanges automatically closed these losing bets, effectively buying back the ETH to cover borrowed amounts. This cascade of forced buying further intensified the upward price pressure, contributing to the staggering $350 million figure. This day truly became one of the worst on record for Ethereum shorts , illustrating the brutal power of a market rally. Impact on Market Dynamics: Such large-scale liquidations can create a “short squeeze.” The forced buying by liquidations pushes the price even higher, trapping more short sellers and perpetuating the cycle. This dynamic can lead to rapid and explosive price movements, making the market even more unpredictable. This dramatic event serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks associated with highly leveraged trading in volatile markets. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for any serious participant. Why Did ETH Price Skyrocket? While the pain for Ethereum shorts was palpable, the underlying reason was ETH’s impressive ascent. Several factors likely contributed to Ethereum’s surge to a new all-time high, painting a picture of robust fundamental strength and growing investor confidence: Broader Market Optimism: A general bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market, often led by Bitcoin’s performance, tends to lift major alternative assets like ETH. Anticipation of Network Upgrades: Ethereum is constantly evolving. Ongoing developments and upcoming network upgrades, such as the transition to Proof-of-Stake (Ethereum 2.0 or “The Merge” and subsequent upgrades), aim to improve scalability, security, and efficiency. These advancements generate significant positive investor sentiment. Growing Institutional Interest: Increasingly, institutional investors, hedge funds, and traditional financial institutions are exploring and investing in Ethereum. Their entry brings substantial capital and lends legitimacy to the asset, driving demand and price appreciation. Dominance in DeFi and NFTs: Ethereum remains the foundational blockchain for a vast and expanding ecosystem of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Continued innovation and growth in these sectors naturally increases the utility and demand for ETH. This powerful combination of technological progress, market dynamics, and growing utility created a perfect storm for price appreciation, turning bearish bets into costly lessons. Navigating Volatility: Essential Lessons for Crypto Traders The recent liquidation event offers crucial insights and actionable advice for anyone involved in cryptocurrency trading, especially those considering leveraged positions. It’s a stark reminder that while potential rewards are high, so are the risks. Understand Leverage Thoroughly: While leverage can significantly amplify gains, it equally increases risk. Even small price movements against your position can lead to substantial losses or full liquidation. Always start with a clear understanding of how leverage works. Risk Management is Paramount: Never enter a trade without a clear risk management strategy. Always utilize stop-loss orders to automatically limit potential losses. Furthermore, never invest more capital than you can comfortably afford to lose. Diversification across different assets can also help mitigate overall portfolio risk. Market Sentiment and Analysis: Keep a close eye on overall market trends, fundamental news, and technical analysis indicators. A strong bullish trend, driven by positive news or major upgrades, can quickly overwhelm short positions, as vividly demonstrated with the recent Ethereum shorts event. Understanding the prevailing sentiment is key. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before entering any trade, thoroughly research the asset, its underlying technology, market fundamentals, and prevailing economic conditions. Avoid making decisions based solely on social media hype or unverified tips. Informed decisions lead to better outcomes. Adhering to these principles is vital for long-term success and protecting your capital in the fast-paced, often exhilarating, and sometimes brutal world of cryptocurrency trading. Conclusion: The Unpredictable Dance of Crypto Markets The spectacular liquidation of $350 million in Ethereum shorts serves as a vivid illustration of the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic and often unpredictable nature. While ETH’s surge to a new all-time high brought jubilation to many long-term holders and bullish traders, it simultaneously delivered a harsh and expensive lesson to those betting against its rise. This event underscores the critical importance of prudent risk management, a deep understanding of market mechanics, and the continuous need for adaptability among traders. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, staying informed, exercising caution, and embracing a disciplined approach remains paramount for navigating its exhilarating highs and challenging lows. Always remember that the market rewards patience and informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Ethereum shorts? Ethereum shorts refer to trading positions where an investor bets on the price of Ethereum (ETH) falling. They borrow ETH, sell it, and aim to buy it back at a lower price to profit from the difference. What does it mean for a position to be liquidated? Liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against their bet, and their margin (collateral) is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. It prevents further debt accumulation. Why did Ethereum’s price increase so dramatically? Ethereum’s price surge was likely driven by a combination of factors, including broader crypto market optimism, anticipation of significant network upgrades (like the transition to Proof-of-Stake), increasing institutional interest, and the continued growth of its DeFi and NFT ecosystems. What lessons can traders learn from this event? Traders can learn the critical importance of risk management, understanding leverage, using stop-loss orders, conducting thorough research (DYOR), and staying informed about market sentiment. Over-leveraging in volatile markets carries extreme risks. Is shorting cryptocurrencies always risky? Yes, shorting cryptocurrencies is inherently risky, especially due to their high volatility. While it offers profit potential in bearish markets, the possibility of rapid price increases (like the one that impacted Ethereum shorts ) can lead to significant and swift losses, including liquidation.

You are not alone! The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index recently surged to a score of 60, officially moving out of the ‘Neutral’ zone and firmly into ‘Greed.’ This shift signals a significant change in investor sentiment across the digital asset landscape. But what does this really mean for your crypto investments and how should you interpret this exciting development? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index acts as a crucial barometer for market sentiment. It provides a daily snapshot of how emotional crypto investors currently feel. Ranging from 0 to 100, the index gives us a clear picture: 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’: This often indicates that investors are overly worried, potentially leading to panic selling and undervalued assets. 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed’: This suggests investors are getting too excited, possibly leading to ‘FOMO’ (Fear Of Missing Out) and overvalued assets. The index helps you gauge whether the market is behaving rationally or is driven by strong emotions. What Factors Drive the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index compiles data from several key sources to calculate its daily score. It offers a holistic view of market dynamics. These factors include: Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin price volatility and drawdown compared to average values. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with historical averages. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment and engagement from various social media platforms regarding crypto. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) Previously gathered investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market cap share can indicate fear of altcoins or a flight to safety. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to spot interest trends. Each factor contributes to the overall score, providing a comprehensive assessment of market psychology. Decoding the Shift: From Neutral to Greed The recent jump of 10 points, moving the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from ‘Neutral’ to ‘Greed’ at 60, reflects a notable improvement in market confidence. This shift suggests that more investors are feeling optimistic and are willing to take on more risk. Historically, periods of ‘Greed’ often coincide with rising prices and increased buying activity. However, it is vital to approach such sentiment with caution. While ‘Greed’ can fuel further upward movement, it also often precedes market corrections. When everyone feels confident, it might be a sign that the market is becoming overheated. Therefore, understanding this sentiment is key to making informed decisions. Navigating the Greed Zone: Opportunities and Risks Entering the ‘Greed’ zone presents both exciting opportunities and potential pitfalls for investors. It is crucial to balance enthusiasm with a strategic approach. Here’s what you should consider: Opportunities: Positive Momentum: Increased investor confidence can lead to sustained price rallies for various cryptocurrencies. Broader Market Participation: A greedy market often attracts new capital, expanding the overall crypto ecosystem. Potential for Gains: Those holding assets may see their portfolios grow as buying pressure increases. Risks: Market Overextension: Extreme greed can lead to irrational exuberance, pushing asset prices beyond their fundamental value. Increased Volatility: While positive, rapid price increases can also lead to sharp pullbacks or corrections. FOMO-Driven Decisions: The fear of missing out can cause investors to make impulsive, high-risk purchases at market peaks. Smart investors use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a guide, not a definitive trading signal. They avoid getting swept away by emotion. How Savvy Investors Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index For experienced crypto participants, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as an excellent sentiment indicator rather than a direct buy or sell signal. They often use it in conjunction with other analytical tools: Contrarian Strategy: Some investors believe that when the index shows ‘Extreme Fear,’ it might be a good time to consider buying, and when it shows ‘Extreme Greed,’ it might be a good time to consider selling or taking profits. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ score can prompt investors to tighten stop-losses or reduce exposure to highly speculative assets. Emotional Discipline: The index reminds investors to check their own emotions and not let fear or greed dictate their decisions. By understanding the underlying sentiment, you empower yourself to make more rational and disciplined investment choices. Conclusion: A Powerful Gauge for Crypto Sentiment The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 60, signaling a move into the ‘Greed’ zone, is undoubtedly a positive indicator of current market sentiment. It reflects increased optimism and buying interest among investors. However, this powerful tool also serves as a crucial reminder to exercise caution and maintain a balanced perspective. While positive sentiment can drive growth, extreme greed often precedes market adjustments. By understanding what drives the index and how to interpret its signals, you can navigate the volatile crypto market with greater insight and make more informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a ‘Greed’ score of 60 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A score of 60 means the market has moved into the ‘Greed’ zone. This indicates that investors are feeling optimistic, confident, and are generally willing to take on more risk, often leading to increased buying activity and rising prices. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily, providing a fresh perspective on market sentiment each day. Q3: Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows ‘Greed’? The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. While ‘Greed’ can accompany rising prices, it can also signal an an overheated market ripe for a correction. It is wise to combine this insight with your own research and strategy, rather than making decisions based solely on the index. Q4: What factors contribute to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six main factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. Q5: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s data significantly influences the index due to its market dominance, the index is generally seen as a reflection of overall sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market.

Solana continues to impress with record-setting speeds and growing institutional backing. Cardano is gaining momentum with whale activity and long-term adoption narratives. Yet, a new name — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is drawing attention, with early entry seen as one of the rare crypto presale opportunities before the market surges. Solana: Setting Records and Eyeing $482 in Forecasts Solana has become a standout candidate when searching for the best crypto to buy before bull run . The blockchain smashed a technical barrier with 107,664 transactions per second, a milestone that few rivals can touch. The Alpenglow Upgrade aims to cut finality to 150 milliseconds, which could cement Solana’s role in high-frequency trading and institutional DeFi. SOL 7D price Institutional demand is growing too. Upexi’s acquisition of 1.9 million SOL, valued at more than $320 million, shows growing corporate appetite. Gov Capital projects a Solana price prediction 2025 at $364.24, while DigitalCoinPrice forecasts an average of $482.56. For many traders, these forecasts place Solana among the top altcoins for 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Star in Early Market Entry While Solana and Cardano dominate headlines, the hype around MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is building rapidly . This project is turning heads because early investors see it as one of the best presales to buy before the market’s next major surge. The entry point is still favorable, but with growing chatter in investor circles, momentum could pick up fast. Solana and Cardano may already be recognized giants, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rising star. For traders seeking crypto presale opportunities ahead of Q4, this project could be the rare window to secure gains before prices shift upward. Many already consider it among the best crypto to buy before bull run, adding fresh diversity to portfolios built on established names. Cardano: Whale Moves and Long-Term Expansion Cardano has always drawn attention from patient investors, but 2025 has brought an added spark. More than $73 million flowed into ADA through institutional channels, bringing total holdings above $900 million. The surge highlights growing confidence in ADA’s long-term role. ADA price chart 7D The global Cardano Summit tour is another boost, alongside Hydra’s mainnet launch set for Q4. Hydra’s scaling potential could power real-time gaming and micropayments, making ADA one of the top altcoins for 2025 . Analysts suggest ADA could average $1.36, with price bands stretching between $2.46 and $3.17 in the medium term — giving the project strong Cardano upside potential if adoption keeps pace. Final Word: Where the Next Big Moves May Come From The market is filled with speculation, but three names stand out when weighing the best crypto to buy before bull run . Solana continues to lead with speed and Cardano is carving its own path. Then comes MAGACOIN FINANCE presale , the surprise factor attracting attention as investors seek fresh crypto presale opportunities. With the potential to become one of 2025’s most talked-about tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something Solana and Cardano no longer do — a rare entry point at ground level.

As Bitcoin hit $20,000 for the first time in 2017, retail investors rushed into Ethereum and Ripple. In 2021, meme tokens like Dogecoin and SHIBA INU reached crazy high prices, not because of their fundamentals but because of the excitement of the community and viral stories. By the middle of 2025, early evidence point to the FOMO wave coming back. Bitcoin has already reached new highs, institutional demand through ETFs is steady, and retail interest is slowly coming back into search trends, forums, and trading volumes. But as we’ve seen in the past, the real fun doesn’t start until FOMO spreads to other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. That’s when altcoins take center stage and initiatives with compelling stories and community support start to grow. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names that has already caught the attention of several analysts. It is being called one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 , with ROI predictions of over 45x. Understanding the Power of FOMO People frequently say that FOMO is just emotional trading, but it has caused some of the biggest crypto rallies in history. When investors think they’re going to miss out on “the next big thing,” money flows in at an alarming rate. It was Ethereum’s ecosystem in 2017. It was meme coins and NFTs in 2021. Analysts say that by 2025, FOMO may be further spread out, with real-world asset tokenization, smart contract platforms, and new ventures with cultural branding all playing a role. The main point is that the same assets don’t usually lead cycles twice. New leaders come to power when stories that captivate people’s imaginations at the perfect time come out. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Anchors of the Market Bitcoin is what starts the FOMO wave. Its dominance is still the guide for the rotation of liquidity. When Bitcoin reaches a new high and then settles down, traders start looking for chances in altcoins. Ethereum is the first to benefit since it keeps getting better with updates that make staking more efficient, wallets easier to use, and the network bigger. Every cycle is built on these two stable assets. But because their market caps are so big, the kind of spectacular growth that retail investors look for is less likely. Historically, smaller-cap altcoins that have a lot of hype about them, are hard to find, and have novel stories are what really drive FOMO. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity Meets Narrative MAGACOIN FINANCE has made a name for itself here. Analysts and trading models are already saying that it is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy before the next bull run. It’s easy to see why. There aren’t many presale slots available, and rounds have sold out rapidly, which shows that people are really interested. The project’s branding, which is politically relevant and community-driven, offers it cultural staying power that most new tokens can’t match. Most crucially, ROI predictions are now over 45x , thanks to the presale momentum, whale accumulation, and the structural rotation that should happen when Bitcoin’s supremacy starts to fade. This mix of scarcity and story is similar to what happened in the beginning that made Dogecoin and SHIBA INU famous. Solana and Ethereum may be the most talked about cryptocurrencies in technical circles, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting a lot of attention in the areas where retail enthusiasm really thrives: stories and identity. Timing the Wave: Why Preparation Matters One thing is evident from history: if you wait for mainstream FOMO headlines, you will likely be too late. The people that got in before the hoopla started were the ones who made the most money in each round. By 2021, meme tokens were all over the news, and early adopters had already made their positions bigger. That involves keeping a tight eye on Bitcoin’s dominance in 2025. Once it settles down, liquidity usually moves into Ethereum, then Solana, and finally into other altcoins. This is when presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE frequently make their big break. People who plan ahead might take advantage of the market’s natural rhythm instead of reacting to it after the fact. Global Ripple Effects of Crypto FOMO Crypto FOMO isn’t just a problem in crypto markets anymore; it affects the whole world. In 2021, more money flowed into meme tokens from U.S. retail investors than into traditional stock funds. By 2025, when institutional adoption is the norm and governments are trying out digital asset reserves, the effects could be substantially worse. As liquidity cycles move across asset classes, a fresh spike driven by FOMO could affect everything from the prices of tech stocks to commodities hedging. This interconnectedness makes it necessary for investors all across the world to grasp crypto, not only as a hobby. Conclusion: Preparing for What’s Ahead As 2025 goes on, the question isn’t if bitcoin will have another FOMO wave, but which assets will do the best on it. Bitcoin and Ethereum will always be important, but history shows that the biggest stories emerge from other places. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of those rare candidates that has a forecasted ROI of more than 45x and a presale scarcity that makes people want to buy it right away. It can grow like crazy at the core of altseason by using cultural branding, community enthusiasm, and intelligent timing. Established giants couldn’t do that. The message is clear for investors who are getting ready now: expect the FOMO before it happens and get in where the momentum is growing.

For some, this downturn sparks fear of further losses. For others, it represents a golden opportunity. Savvy investors know that volatility has always been part of the game – and those who buy during the dips are often the ones who end up with the biggest gains. While established assets like BTC and ETH continue to show resilience, new projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching attention as rare early-entry opportunities during this waiting period before the next altcoin boom. Why Buying the Dip Still Works The idea of “ buying the dip ” is simple but powerful: accumulate assets when prices fall, and profit when they rebound. In crypto, this strategy has proven successful across multiple cycles. Each major crash has historically been followed by fresh all-time highs as adoption grows and new narratives take over. With Bitcoin ETFs now approved and Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades strengthening its fundamentals, the long-term trend remains bullish – even if short-term moves spark fear. Smart Strategies for Investors Jumping into the market without preparation can be risky. That’s why seasoned investors stick to strategies such as: Doing solid research (DYOR): Strong fundamentals and real-world use cases separate lasting projects from short-lived hype. Using dollar-cost averaging (DCA): Spreading investments over time helps smooth out volatility. Following sentiment indexes: Extreme Fear has historically been a strong buy signal, while Extreme Greed often signals overheated conditions. Exploring altcoins cautiously: While Bitcoin and Ethereum form the backbone of most portfolios, carefully selected altcoins often outperform in bull runs. How This New Altcoin Takes the Market by Storm While investors are patiently waiting for the altcoin boom, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a rare opportunity for those who get in early. The project has already raised millions , drawn a fast-growing community, and completed audits, making it one of the few newcomers that is consistently compared to some of the top tokens . Early adopters have seen major returns, and many believe this could just be the beginning as future exchange listings unlock wider access. In a market where timing is everything, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a name that forward-thinking investors don’t want to overlook. The Bigger Picture Despite the short-term volatility, institutional interest in crypto continues to grow, and blockchain technology is embedding itself deeper into global finance. If history is any guide, today’s dip will one day look like a massive discount. The key is patience, strategy, and the courage to act when others hesitate.

This Could Be The Signal To Watch,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bottom-could-be-the-signal-to-watch/,"On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed how the Bitcoin price often forms local bottoms when this holder group shows capitulation. Bitcoin STHs Are Currently Participating In Mild Loss Realization In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about how short-term price action is often dictated by the top buyers’ reaction to post-ATH drawdowns. As the price slides down, these holders quickly get into losses and can become prone to making panic moves. Related Reading: Altseason Things: Ethereum Perps Volume Sets New Record Against Bitcoin Bitcoin is currently in such a phase, with a notable amount of supply having a cost basis in the zone between the latest spot price and $120,000, as the below chart shows. The indicator in the graph is the Cost Basis Distribution, which tells us, as its name suggests, how much of the BTC supply last changed hands at the various price levels. From the metric’s data, it’s apparent that investors have slowly been building up a dense supply cluster below $120,000 as the asset has been trading inside the range since early July. The recent Bitcoin price plunge naturally put these investors underwater, so the question is: how have these holders been reacting? An indicator that can help shed light on the matter is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). This metric compares the amount of profit and loss that the investors as a whole are realizing on the network. When the value of the SOPR is greater than 1, it means the average holder is selling their coins at a profit. On the other hand, it being below the threshold suggests loss-taking is dominant on the network. In the current discussion, the SOPR of the entire market isn’t of interest, but rather that of a specific part of it: the top buyers. These would be the investors who got into the cryptocurrency over the last three months. Here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR for the investor cohorts falling in this age range: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR has dropped for all three of 1 day to 1 week, 1 week to 1 month, and 1 month to 3 months groups following the price decline. The indicator is now floating between 0.96 to 1.01 across these cohorts, indicating these investors have started selling at a mild loss. “If pressure builds, local bottoms often form when this group capitulates, typically when SOPR drops below ~0.9,” notes Glassnode.

Four Major South Korean Financial Groups Looking Into Stablecoins As reported by YonHap , major South Korean financial groups will see their top executives meeting with Tether and Circle this week. Tether and Circle are the issuers of the two largest stablecoins : USDT and USDC, respectively. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that have their price pegged to a fiat currency. This means that unlike assets such as Bitcoin, these tokens normally don’t face any major fluctuations, hence the “stable” in their name. South Korea has been making a push toward digital assets and stablecoins under the leadership of pro-crypto President Lee Jae Myung. One of the promises made by the President was to establish a market for Korean won-based stablecoins. The country’s financial regulator is expected to release its stablecoin framework in October, as Bitcoinist reported earlier in the week. Now, it seems major players in the country are also laying the groundwork for diving into the space. As per the report, Shinhan Financial Group CEO Jin Ok-dong and Hana Financial Group CEO Ham Young-joo are set to have separate meetings with Heath Tarbert, the president of Circle, on Friday. The latter is also expected to meet with a Tether official. Two other big financial groups, KB Financial Group and Woori Bank, will also see executives meeting with Tarbert, but the details of their talks aren’t yet known to the public. YonHap notes, The banking heads are expected to discuss areas of partnership, including the distribution and transactions of dollar-pegged stablecoins in South Korea, as well as the issuance of won-backed stablecoins. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong launched its legislation on stables at the start of this month. Big names like Standard Chartered in its joint-venture have lined up to obtain an issuer license in the city. Speaking of stablecoins, on-chain data shows the Tron network has observed huge shifts from USDT mega wallets in the past day, as explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post . As the above chart displays, 57% of the latest USDT transactions on the blockchain involved a size greater than $100 million, indicating elevated activity from institutional-grade entities. In total, the largest of USDT wallets on Tron have seen a balance change of a whopping $6.95 billion alongside these transactions. BTC Price Bitcoin fell under $112,000 earlier in the day, but it appears the cryptocurrency has found a slight rebound as its price is back at $113,700.",Stablecoin|Circle|South Korea|South korea stablecoins|Stablecoins|Stables|Tether,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|ASIA|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 01:00:53

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic place, constantly shifting between periods where Bitcoin leads the charge and times when altcoins shine. Understanding these cycles is crucial for any investor. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index, a key metric, stands at 49, indicating we are firmly in a ‘Bitcoin Season’. This means the market’s momentum is heavily favoring Bitcoin over other digital assets. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap. It helps investors gauge the overall sentiment and performance across the broader crypto market. Essentially, it tells us whether Bitcoin or altcoins are currently outperforming. The index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing purely on the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization over the past 90 days. For the market to be in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day period. Conversely, if 25% or fewer altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is considered to be in ‘Bitcoin Season’. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. The current reading of 49, as reported on August 23rd at 00:30 UTC, signifies that less than 75% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin recently. This clearly places us in a Bitcoin-dominated phase. Why Are We Currently in Bitcoin Season? The Altcoin Season Index registered 49, up seven points from the previous day’s figure. Despite this slight increase, the number remains below the critical 75 threshold required for a true Altcoin Season . This suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance is currently robust, influencing the entire market. Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin Season: Market Uncertainty: During periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer, more established asset compared to the higher-risk altcoins. Bitcoin Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin tends to lead market rallies, especially around its halving events, before capital eventually flows into altcoins. Institutional Adoption: Increased institutional interest, such as Bitcoin ETF approvals, often bolsters Bitcoin’s price and market share first. Consequently, many altcoins might experience sideways movement or even declines while Bitcoin consolidates its gains or continues its upward trajectory. Understanding this dynamic is vital for making informed investment decisions. Navigating the Current Market: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? Being in a Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean altcoins are without potential, but it does suggest a different strategy might be necessary. It’s a time for careful consideration and perhaps a shift in focus. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Holdings: Consider if your portfolio is overly exposed to altcoins that are underperforming. Diversification remains key, but a temporary tilt towards Bitcoin might be prudent. Research Projects: Use this period to research promising altcoin projects with strong fundamentals, solid roadmaps, and innovative technology. These could be the first to rebound when Altcoin Season eventually returns. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market fluctuations. This strategy can help mitigate risk and build positions in quality assets over time. Monitor Key Metrics: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index, Bitcoin dominance charts, and overall market sentiment for signs of a shift. Remember, market cycles are a natural part of the cryptocurrency landscape. Patience and strategic planning are your best allies. When Will Altcoin Season Return? Predicting the exact return of Altcoin Season is challenging, but historical patterns offer some clues. Typically, after a strong Bitcoin run, capital tends to ‘rotate’ from Bitcoin into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. This rotation often begins once Bitcoin’s dominance peaks or shows signs of consolidation. Key indicators to watch for a potential shift: Bitcoin Dominance Chart: A sustained decline in Bitcoin dominance (the percentage of the total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin) often signals the start of altcoin outperformance. Increased Trading Volume in Altcoins: A significant surge in trading volume for a wide range of altcoins, especially those outside the top 10, can be an early sign. Breakout in Major Altcoins: When Ethereum (ETH) and other large-cap altcoins begin to make significant gains against Bitcoin, it often precedes a broader altcoin rally. While the Altcoin Season Index at 49 suggests we are not there yet, the crypto market is always evolving. Staying informed and prepared will allow you to capitalize on future opportunities. The Altcoin Season Index provides a clear snapshot of the current crypto market dynamics. With the index at 49, it’s evident that Bitcoin currently holds the reins, leading the market. However, this period offers a valuable opportunity for investors to refine their strategies, research emerging projects, and prepare for the inevitable return of Altcoin Season . Understanding these cycles is not just about knowing where we are, but also about anticipating where we might be headed next. Stay informed, stay strategic, and be ready for the next wave of innovation and growth in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does the Altcoin Season Index measure? A1: The Altcoin Season Index measures the percentage of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps indicate whether the market is in a Bitcoin-led or altcoin-led phase. Q2: What index score indicates a true Altcoin Season? A2: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season, the index needs to register 75 or higher. This means 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Q3: How does Bitcoin Season differ from Altcoin Season? A3: Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. In contrast, Altcoin Season means 75% or more altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Q4: What should investors do during Bitcoin Season? A4: During Bitcoin Season, investors often consider re-evaluating their altcoin exposure, researching promising projects, practicing dollar-cost averaging, and monitoring key market indicators for signs of a shift back to Altcoin Season. Q5: Can the Altcoin Season Index change quickly? A5: Yes, while the index considers a 90-day period, market sentiment and performance can shift relatively quickly. Daily updates help track these movements, though a sustained trend is needed for a full season change. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

Their rise is no accident. Community-driven hype, viral trends, and explosive tokenomics have transformed meme coins from internet novelties into high-potential assets. Investors are now flocking to presales, where early access often results in exponential returns. Among this surge of contenders, one whitelist is stealing the spotlight. MoonBull, Mog Coin, Neiro, and Notcoin are drawing sharp attention as the top cryptos to join in 2025. With whitelist activity heating up, the opportunity to get in early could be the game-changing move that separates MoonBull ($MOBU) from other projects. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull ($MOBU) is an Ethereum meme coin engineered for those who thrive on volatility, culture, and high-stakes returns. Crafted for meme coin enthusiasts and degen traders, MoonBull taps into the viral energy of crypto while offering a deeply rewarding ecosystem. The real headline? The MoonBull whitelist is officially live, creating a rare gateway to a presale that feels more like early access to a digital gold rush. This isn’t just a signup – it’s an opportunity vault. Whitelist members gain exclusive early entry to Stage One at the lowest available price point, long before the public gets a glimpse. But that’s only the beginning. Benefits of joining the MoonBull whitelist include: Secret staking rewards with high-yield potential Bonus token allocations are available only to whitelisted wallets Private hints and previews of upcoming roadmap milestones Advanced notice of the exact Stage One launch date Priority access before the general public The clock is ticking. This is a first-come, first-served opportunity with limited spots available. Once the whitelist closes, this window shuts permanently – those left out may end up watching from the sidelines as MoonBull takes off. Reality Check: What If You Miss the Whitelist? Picture a trader watching SHIB skyrocket in 2021 after skipping its presale. Regret lingers. Now imagine a similar story unfolding – but this time, it’s MoonBull. Ignoring the whitelist could mean missing out on the year’s most talked-about launch. MoonBull’s ecosystem is structured to reward early movers. Staking incentives and secret drops are strictly reserved for whitelist users. Unlike traditional presales, MoonBull isn’t broadcasting details to the public. Everything remains under wraps until it’s too late. This creates an environment of high value and limited access. It’s engineered for rapid sell-outs. This exclusive system explains why MoonBull is dominating the conversation about the top cryptos to join in 2025. It combines the cultural firepower of meme coins with DeFi-grade infrastructure. Ethereum’s smart contract reliability meets a token built for virality and value. Why MoonBull made this list: It provides the earliest access, highest rewards, and most private launch insights in the meme coin sector. Few tokens offer this level of exclusivity and upside potential. 2. Mog Coin ($MOG) Mog Coin ($MOG) was created with one simple idea: let memes rule the markets. Born on Ethereum, MOG is built for fast-moving traders and community-driven energy. What makes Mog stand out is its organic virality. Without the need for centralized endorsements or elaborate tokenomics, it gained traction purely through meme culture. Its liquidity is strong, thanks to a dedicated base of holders and near-constant social media buzz. This has created a positive feedback loop – more hype drives volume, and more volume keeps MOG trending. What really sets MOG apart is its simplicity. The tokenomics don’t promise the world. Instead, they ensure accessibility and reward community loyalty. That authenticity is rare in a sea of overengineered coins. Why Mog Coin made this list: Its unmatched community energy and proven viral mechanics make MOG one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. 3. Neiro ($NEIRO) Neiro ($NEIRO) is carving out a niche few meme coins dare to approach: AI-powered engagement fused with meme culture. Neiro introduces an ecosystem where users interact with AI-generated companions, earning tokens and upgrades through conversations, games, and missions. Neiro’s tokenomics are also worth noting. The supply curve is designed to reward early adopters with increased yields and access to premium AI features. Strategic partnerships with NFT platforms and gaming protocols add another layer of utility, something many meme coins lack. Its upcoming roadmap includes metaverse integrations and custom AI personality upgrades. This innovation, coupled with meme coin aesthetics, creates a hybrid model that feels both fun and functional. Why Neiro made this list: It combines meme coin appeal with next-gen AI engagement, making it a standout among the top cryptos to join in 2025. 4. Notcoin ($NOT) Notcoin ($NOT) plays with crypto’s sense of irony. It markets itself as the “coin that does nothing,” yet in doing so, it’s become one of the most interesting meme coins of the year. Built on the Telegram Open Network (TON), Notcoin leverages gamified mining and viral campaigns to engage users directly through Telegram bots. Notcoin’s campaign mechanics include time-based mining, team competitions, and loyalty rewards. This dynamic has converted casual users into long-term holders. Behind the scenes, the TON blockchain provides scalability and low fees, making mass participation sustainable. Its roadmap hints at monetizing attention with ad-based models and micro-tipping features – putting user activity at the center of token value. Why Notcoin made this list: It turns simplicity into strength and has onboarded millions into crypto with a meme-first, user-centric model. Clearly, one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. Final Words Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to join in 2025 include MoonBull, Mog Coin, Neiro, and Notcoin. Each token brings something unique to the table – Mog’s meme momentum, Neiro’s AI innovation, Notcoin’s Telegram simplicity – but MoonBull stands above the rest with its first-come, first-served whitelist model. Early adopters are lining up to grab a spot before the details go public. Presales provide access to high-ROI entry points, and MoonBull’s whitelist is opening the door for serious traders and curious newcomers alike. Those who miss it might be watching from the sidelines as Moon Bull hits the next level. For those who act now, it could be the most strategic entry of the year. For More Information: Website: https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram: https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter: https://x.com/MoonBullX Frequently Asked Questions for Next-Level Moves, Next-Level Gains What makes MoonBull’s whitelist unique compared to other presales? MoonBull’s whitelist offers the lowest entry price, exclusive staking rewards, bonus allocations, and private roadmap hints, creating a distinct advantage for early supporters. Why are meme coins still relevant in 2025? Meme coins remain relevant due to their cultural resonance, community engagement, and potential for rapid value appreciation in both retail and speculative markets. How can new investors manage risk in meme coin investments? By diversifying holdings, entering projects with strong communities and utility, and securing early-stage positions such as presales or whitelists. Which meme coin is best to buy now? MoonBull stands out for its whitelist access, lowest entry price, and exclusive rewards, making it a strong contender for early-stage gains. How to pick a good meme coin? Look for strong community engagement, transparent tokenomics, and unique utility that can sustain value beyond initial hype.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, MATIC, Arbitrum, and Aave are being ranked among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. Here’s why traders are watching them closely. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Community-Driven Altcoin With Security at Its Core MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining traction as one of the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. Built on a zero-tax and transparent framework, the project has attracted wide interest for its community-first approach and verified smart contract audits. With early metrics already surpassing other meme-inspired assets, MAGACOIN combines cultural appeal with real DeFi use cases. Analysts argue that the blend of meme culture and serious utility gives it staying power in a crowded market. Traders looking for early-stage altcoins are paying close attention to MAGACOIN as listings approach. Cardano Sentiment Amid Market Moves Cardano is also ranked among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. The token surged over 130% since July before cooling off near $0.85. While some see this as a healthy pause, others worry the uptrend may be losing steam. At the same time, debates inside the Cardano community around treasury allocation and governance have created a split in sentiment. With a pending audit report due to address older financial concerns, ADA’s next move could be shaped by both price action and community confidence. Polygon (MATIC/POL): Strength in DeFi and Enterprise Adoption Polygon remains in focus as one of the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook, driven by fresh growth in DeFi and corporate adoption. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) hit $1.23 billion in 2025, fueled by activity on QuickSwap, Polymarket, and record stablecoin settlements. Polygon Labs is also pushing for enterprise use cases, framing the network as a reliable backbone for tokenized assets and on-chain finance. With more than 97% of holders upgrading from MATIC to POL, the project continues to solidify its place in the market. Arbitrum (ARB): Expanding Into Public Finance and GameFi Arbitrum is earning its place among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook thanks to new partnerships and ecosystem growth. The state of Wyoming selected Arbitrum to help launch its stablecoin FRNT, a U.S. Treasury-backed digital asset — a first for blockchain-based public finance. Beyond this, a proposal to integrate Ronin, the network behind Axie Infinity, into Arbitrum Orbit could introduce over 1 million new users. These developments highlight the network’s growing relevance in both institutional finance and gaming. Aave (AAVE): Growing Through Institutional Collaboration Aave is also ranked among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. The DAO recently partnered with Kraken’s Ink Foundation, enabling its V3 protocol to power lending on Kraken’s new Layer 2 network. This deal includes a revenue-sharing model, marking a fresh pathway for predictable returns. At the same time, integration with Pendle Finance has fueled billions in fixed-income exposure, boosting Aave’s role as a key DeFi infrastructure. Its mix of enterprise adoption and yield-driven strategies continues to draw interest from traders. What Traders Should Do Next For traders seeking exposure to the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook, diversification across proven ecosystems and community-driven projects is key. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as an early-stage opportunity with momentum building quickly. With listings expected soon, timing could be critical.

This is the incredible story of an anonymous ETH whale , a colossal holder of Ethereum, who recently saw their dormant holdings swell by an astonishing $120 million in unrealized profits. This significant event, brought to light by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X , highlights the immense potential of long-term cryptocurrency investment and the power of patience in the digital asset space. How Did One ETH Whale Achieve Such Astonishing Profits? This particular ETH whale address, after lying dormant for an incredible seven years, has suddenly shown signs of life, revealing its massive gains. Over just the past four days, the unrealized profits surged by a staggering $120 million. This monumental jump in value is directly tied to the address’s substantial holdings. The whale currently holds 105,599 ETH in spot holdings. The average cost basis for this impressive stash is reported at $4,284 per ETH. Considering current market movements, the address now boasts an unrealized profit of $50.03 million on these specific holdings alone. Such figures are not just numbers; they represent a dramatic shift in wealth for a single, patient entity. What Impact Could This ETH Whale Have on the Market? When an ETH whale stirs, the crypto market often pays close attention. These large holders possess enough capital to significantly influence price action, whether through buying pressure or selling pressure. However, it’s crucial to remember that this whale’s profits are currently ‘unrealized,’ meaning the ETH has not yet been sold. This dormancy, followed by such immense gains, sparks curiosity among investors. Will this whale decide to take profits, potentially introducing a large sell-off into the market? Or will they continue to hold, signaling strong confidence in Ethereum’s future trajectory? Potential Market Ripple: A large sell-off could create downward pressure. Investor Sentiment: Continued holding might boost confidence. Liquidity Implications: Any movement impacts the overall market liquidity. The actions of such a large holder can send ripples across the entire ecosystem, affecting investor sentiment and overall market stability. Monitoring these movements provides valuable insights into potential market shifts. Is This ETH Whale a Blueprint for Long-Term Crypto Success? The story of this ETH whale serves as a powerful testament to the ‘HODL’ philosophy in cryptocurrency investing. Holding assets for extended periods, even through volatile market cycles, can lead to truly remarkable returns. Seven years is a lifetime in the fast-paced crypto world, yet this whale’s patience has paid off handsomely. This case study exemplifies how long-term conviction, combined with an early entry point, can transform an initial investment into a fortune. It encourages investors to consider the potential benefits of looking beyond short-term fluctuations and focusing on the foundational strength and adoption of assets like Ethereum. Key takeaways from this strategy include: Patience is Paramount: Avoid panic selling during dips. Conviction in Assets: Believe in the long-term potential of your chosen cryptocurrencies. Early Entry Advantage: While not always possible, early investment can yield significant returns. How Do Analysts Track an ETH Whale ‘s Dormant Fortune? The transparency of blockchain technology makes stories like this ETH whale ‘s journey discoverable. On-chain analysts, like @ai_9684xtpa , continuously monitor public blockchain data to identify significant movements and patterns. Every transaction, every holding, is recorded on the distributed ledger, albeit anonymously. This level of transparency, while preserving the privacy of the individual, allows for deep insights into market dynamics and investor behavior. It underscores the power of data analytics in understanding the often-complex world of decentralized finance, providing a clear window into even the most dormant of crypto fortunes. The saga of the dormant ETH whale and its stunning $120 million in unrealized profits is more than just a headline; it’s a vivid illustration of the transformative power of long-term crypto investment. It highlights the potential for immense wealth creation, the strategic importance of patient holding, and the invaluable insights provided by on-chain analysis. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, these whale movements remain a fascinating barometer of market sentiment and future possibilities, offering both lessons and inspiration for investors worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions About ETH Whale Profits Q1: What is an ETH whale? A: An ETH whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). Their significant holdings can potentially influence market prices and trends due to their buying or selling power. Q2: What does “unrealized profits” mean? A: Unrealized profits are gains that an investor has on paper from an asset that has increased in value, but which they have not yet “realized” or converted into cash by selling the asset. The profit only becomes realized once the asset is sold. Q3: How can an address remain dormant for seven years? A: An address can remain dormant if the owner chooses not to move or interact with their funds for an extended period. This often indicates a long-term investment strategy, where the investor holds their assets with the expectation of significant future appreciation. Q4: How do analysts track these large holdings? A: Analysts use blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics tools to monitor public blockchain data. Since all transactions and holdings are transparently recorded on the blockchain, they can track the movement and balances of large addresses, even if the identity of the owner remains anonymous. Q5: Does an ETH whale’s activity directly impact the market? A: Yes, the activity of an ETH whale can significantly impact the market. Large purchases can drive prices up, while large sales (taking profits) can cause prices to drop. However, if profits are unrealized and the whale remains dormant, the direct market impact is limited to sentiment rather than immediate price action. Q6: Is it common for crypto investments to yield such high profits? A: While not guaranteed for everyone, early investments in rapidly growing cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, held over long periods, have historically yielded substantial profits for many investors. This particular case highlights an extreme example of such success. Did this incredible story of the ETH whale captivate your interest?

Ondo Finance (ONDO), a prominent blockchain technology firm, is making waves with its recent announcement. They are set to launch tokenized stocks on the Ethereum network, marking a significant milestone for decentralized finance (DeFi). This exciting development, shared via an update on X, confirms the launch date for these innovative assets as September 3. At the time of this publication, ONDO’s native token is trading at approximately $0.9954, showing an impressive 8.49% increase in just the past day, according to CoinMarketCap. This surge highlights the market’s positive anticipation for Ondo Finance’s move into tokenized stocks . What Exactly Are Tokenized Stocks, Anyway? You might be wondering, what are tokenized stocks ? Simply put, they are digital representations of traditional company shares, existing on a blockchain like Ethereum. Think of them as blockchain-based derivatives that mirror the value and performance of real-world equities. When you own tokenized stocks , you effectively hold a token that represents a share in a company. This allows for fractional ownership, meaning you could potentially own a small piece of a high-value stock, something often difficult in traditional markets. This innovative approach blends the best of both traditional finance and the decentralized world. The Compelling Benefits of Tokenized Stocks The introduction of tokenized stocks brings several exciting advantages to the table, transforming how investors can interact with the stock market: Increased Accessibility: These digital assets can lower barriers to entry for global investors. People from various regions might access markets previously unavailable due to geographical restrictions or high minimum investment requirements. Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy fractions of expensive stocks, making high-value assets more affordable and diversified portfolios easier to build. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional exchanges with fixed hours, blockchain-based assets can potentially be traded around the clock, offering greater flexibility. Enhanced Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, providing a transparent and immutable record of ownership. Faster Settlement: Blockchain technology can significantly reduce settlement times from days to mere minutes or even seconds, improving capital efficiency. Ondo Finance’s Vision: Bridging TradFi and DeFi with Tokenized Stocks Ondo Finance has established itself as a key player in bringing real-world assets (RWAs) onto the blockchain. Their decision to launch tokenized stocks on Ethereum aligns perfectly with their mission. Ethereum, being the leading smart contract platform, offers robust security and a vast ecosystem, making it an ideal choice for such an endeavor. This move signifies a deeper integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Ondo Finance aims to unlock liquidity and create new investment opportunities by making traditional equities available in a programmable, permissionless environment. This could attract a new wave of investors who are comfortable with digital assets but also seek exposure to established companies. What Challenges Might Tokenized Stocks Face? While the prospects are bright, the path for tokenized stocks is not without its hurdles. Key challenges include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized securities is still evolving globally. Different jurisdictions may have varying rules, creating complexities for issuance and trading. Liquidity: Initial liquidity for these new assets might be a concern. Building sufficient trading volume will be crucial for their widespread adoption and efficient price discovery. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of these digital assets and protecting against cyber threats remains paramount for investor confidence. Integration with Existing Systems: Seamless integration with traditional financial systems and data providers is essential for broader acceptance. Despite these challenges, the innovation driving tokenized stocks suggests a future where financial markets are more inclusive and efficient. A Glimpse into the Future: The Impact of Tokenized Stocks The launch of tokenized stocks by Ondo Finance could set a precedent for other financial institutions. As blockchain technology matures and regulatory frameworks adapt, we might see a surge in the tokenization of various assets, from real estate to commodities. This shift has the potential to democratize investment, offering unprecedented access and flexibility to a global audience. Ondo Finance is not just launching a product; they are contributing to a paradigm shift in how we perceive and interact with financial assets. This initiative underscores the power of blockchain to innovate beyond cryptocurrencies, bringing tangible value to traditional markets. In conclusion, Ondo Finance’s upcoming launch of tokenized stocks on the Ethereum network on September 3 represents a significant step forward for the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. This development promises increased accessibility, fractional ownership, and 24/7 trading, while also navigating important regulatory and liquidity considerations. As the market eagerly awaits this launch, it is clear that the future of finance is becoming increasingly digital and decentralized, offering exciting new avenues for investors worldwide.

As of today, the cryptocurrency is priced around $115,347, reflecting a 7.7% drop from its peak and a 3% decline over the past week. The downturn highlights a loss of momentum, with market data suggesting reduced demand from buyers on major exchanges. According to recent analysis shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, the decline is closely tied to shifting activity on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume. The analyst, known by the pseudonym Arab Chain, explained that Bitcoin’s downward trajectory this month corresponds with fading buying pressure on Binance. The pattern indicates that sellers have been able to exert more control in recent sessions, with spot market data showing a liquidity exit from buyers. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Volume Signal Nailed The Top & Bottom: Analytics Firm Bitcoin Exchange Data Highlights Reduced Demand Arab Chain’s analysis noted that between early August and August 22, Bitcoin slipped from levels above $123,000 to near $113,000. During the first half of the month, strong waves of buyer activity supported upward price moves. However, as the month progressed, indicators such as Binance’s Volume Delta shifted negative, reflecting a reversal in the balance between buyers and sellers. At one point, net outflows from buyers reached levels close to -$600 million, suggesting that sellers were absorbing liquidity without enough counter-pressure. The analyst emphasized that Binance data carries weight given the platform’s depth and liquidity. A decline in buying activity despite stable overall volume points to a cautious stance from large traders and institutions. Some of the selling may be linked to profit-taking at resistance zones near $120,000, while the lack of strong follow-through buying reduced the likelihood of sustaining higher prices. This pattern reflects how spot market demand remains critical for price stability at elevated levels. Miner Behavior Points to Accumulation Shift In addition to exchange data, unusual activity between miners and Binance has drawn attention. Arab Chain also highlighted an increase in transfers from Binance to miner-linked wallets, a reversal of the more common pattern of miners sending Bitcoin to exchanges for sale. Past episodes of such flows, averaging more than 10 BTC per transaction, preceded rebounds in the market earlier this year. This may suggest that miners are holding back supply or preparing reserves in anticipation of future price strength. The implications of these transfers depend on interpretation. If miners are moving Bitcoin to cold storage, it indicates reduced short-term selling pressure and could support the market by lowering available supply. Related Reading: Why August Could Be Remembered As A Major Trap For Bitcoin And Crypto Market On the other hand, if the transfers represent profit redistribution or eventual liquidation through other channels, the effect may be neutral or even negative. Still, the data points to a strategic shift in miner behavior, adding another layer of complexity to the current correction phase.

The asset has faced repeated resistance levels, slow growth periods, and regulatory uncertainty. Despite these obstacles, some analysts argue that XRP is poised for another significant upward move. Among them is Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-known commentator on X, who recently described the current cycle as “the hardest XRP bull market ever.” Steph congratulated the community, predicting that the faithful XRP holders will soon become rich. XRP Historical Breakout Patterns Steph’s chart highlights a recurring pattern of consolidation below descending trendlines followed by strong breakouts across several years. In 2022, XRP broke out from a prolonged downtrend, initiating a short-lived rally. A similar occurrence followed in 2023, when the pivotal ruling that determined XRP is not a security caused a notable breakout above another descending trendline. While 2023 only saw a brief upward push, the pattern repeated in late 2024 with a stronger move, carrying XRP above the $3 level before entering another consolidation phase . Each breakout has been followed by price surges, although their duration and scale have varied. According to Steph, XRP may now be positioned for a larger move in 2025, potentially mirroring or exceeding past performances. This is the hardest #XRP bull market ever.

XRP remains a divisive asset in the crypto space. While it has many supporters, it has vocal detractors in the form of Bitcoin maximalists, who refuse to acknowledge XRP’s value and other altcoins. However, XRP’s growing community and increasing adoption worldwide have proven its detractors wrong. Other cryptocurrency experts have also weighed in on the asset’s future, with one recent projection suggesting it could reach $60 within a year . XRP has shown notable strength in 2025. The consensus among many top analysts and experts is that it could soon reach double-digit prices. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The market may have hit a slowdown, but investors and traders have continued their never-ending search for the next opportunities. With altcoin and Bitcoin dragging, attention has moved to presale opportunities, especially the best crypto presale to buy now, as the 2025 bull cycle takes shape. Expectedly, established names continue to dominate, but newer entrants with strong narratives are taking over. Three projects in particular—XRP, HBAR, and MAGACOIN FINANCE—are being watched closely for their ability to deliver explosive upside. XRP brings regulatory clarity and institutional support, while HBAR rides on enterprise innovation. A newer player, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is surging on presale momentum to form a trio of the most talked-about lineups for investors this year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rises on 12,500% Opportunity Presale hype is returning to the crypto market, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is the project getting all the attention. Granted, XRP and HBAR are established tokens, but analysts are picking MAGACOIN FINANCE over the two in their list of breakout tokens in 2025. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its community-driven branding and institutional-grade ecosystem. Renowned experts who track early-stage projects say everything about MAGACOIN FINANCE is different when compared with other meme tokens now. Analysts predict investors who get in early could see an incredible 12,500% return on their investments. That explains why crypto market attention is turning to the project by the minute. Even whale investors have picked up, indicating that the price of MAGACOIN FINANCE may explode anytime now. In a market that rewards only those who act fast and smart, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the token everyone is looking at as the best crypto presale to buy in 2025. The window of opportunity to act is fast closing. XRP Holds Investor Attention Meanwhile, XRP is once again in the spotlight, even after recent price declines. While some see the weakness as a buying opportunity, all eyes are on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC recently delayed its decision on multiple XRP ETF applications until October 2025 — a date that could prove decisive for Ripple’s future in U.S. markets. If approved, ETFs would signal major institutional support, potentially lifting XRP back above $3. HBAR Expands Enterprise Reach Hedera (HBAR) is building momentum through enterprise-focused partnerships and ecosystem growth. Despite showing volatility in August, HBAR’s July rally of 85% reminded investors of its upside potential. Analysts warn August has historically been weak for HBAR but highlights bullish catalysts ahead, including speculation around potential BlackRock-linked ETF activity and new tokenized stock launches via Swarm. With steady trading volumes and strong corporate ties, Hedera remains one of the best altcoins to invest in 2025 for those seeking long-term enterprise plays. Conclusion For investors scanning the market for the best crypto presale to buy now, XRP, HBAR, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out for very different reasons. XRP offers regulatory-driven upside, and HBAR brings enterprise adoption. However, crypto traders said MAGACOIN FINANCE’s potential to deliver massive returns to investors makes it a clear winner among the three.

Pennsylvania Lawmakers Push New Ban,https://bitcoinist.com/no-crypto-in-office-pennsylvania-lawmakers-push-new-ban/,"According to reports, a Pennsylvania Democratic lawmaker on Aug. 20 filed a bill that would tighten rules around elected officials and cryptocurrency. Rep. Ben Waxman of District 182 introduced House Bill 1812 with eight Democratic co-sponsors. The measure would bar public officials from profiting from crypto while they hold office, and it carries clear penalties for violations. Who The Bill Would Cover If enacted, HB1812 would change Title 65 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes . It would forbid public officials and their families from making crypto-related transactions over $1,000 while in office and for one year after leaving. Officials who already hold crypto would have to divest within 90 days of the law taking effect. Penalties include fines up to $50,000 and, in serious cases, prison terms of up to five years. The bill now sits in the Pennsylvania House and must clear committee review before a full floor vote. JUST IN: Pennsylvania to ban public officials from owning Bitcoin or crypto if new bill passes. Violations would result in fines or jail time. pic.twitter.com/EUUp7GuqaL — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) August 21, 2025 The Move Ties To High-Profile Crypto Activity Based on reports, Waxman framed the bill as a response to high-profile crypto ties at the federal level. He singled out US President Donald Trump, saying the president’s growing crypto ventures — from memecoins tied to his name to projects under World Liberty Financial — raise ethical concerns. Critics in Waxman’s camp argue these ventures can blur the line between public duty and private gain. Allegations have circulated that the Official Trump token and related projects cost investors large sums, and those claims have helped fuel calls for tighter rules. Federal Proposals Mirror State Effort Democratic lawmakers in Congress have floated similar ideas, including the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act and the COIN Act. Those bills would bar the president, vice president, members of Congress, and their families from issuing or promoting tokens while in office. Reports disclose that figures like Rep. Maxine Waters have warned that tokens tied to political figures could be used by foreign actors to influence or exploit markets. That warning has been part of the broader push to add guardrails around digital currency and public office. What Supporters And Critics Say Supporters of HB1812 say the measure is a straightforward ethics rule: no public servant should enrich themselves through crypto schemes while in office. They argue the sector’s volatility and light regulation make it especially prone to abuse. Opponents are likely to call the bill overly broad or say it could chill private investment by public servants, though formal Republican responses to the bill were not detailed in the initial filing.

Still, he believes recent movements in the market signal a change for digital asset treasury (DAT) firms determined on stockpiling. “Bitcoin treasury companies have been an incredible innovation for the space. What may be fading is the ability to get a 3x return,” Reeds told The Block on Friday. “MicroStrategy in the last five years did 24X versus Bitcoin, which did 10X. I can’t see that happening again.” Bitcoin Treasury boom cools as market cap slides below $4 trillion Signs that the once red-hot Bitcoin treasury boom is cooling have been visible for over a week. Inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy playbook, many firms have rushed to load up on BTC, but some are now trimming their holdings or even buying back stock. After crypto’s total market capitalization recently peaked at nearly $4.3 trillion, it slid below $4 trillion, with the combined market cap of DATs dropping under $150 billion. The aggregate value of Bitcoin treasuries also slipped from $165 billion a month ago to $134 billion, despite BTC’s price remaining relatively stable. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Bitcoin dropped 2.2% to about $115,000, while Ether slid 4% to below $4,300. Bitcoin had set a new all-time high of $125,514 just days earlier, and Ethereum came within $100 of its November 2021 peak. The surge was fueled by strong institutional demand, led by crypto treasury firms. Strategy remains the most aggressive player, holding nearly $73 billion of Bitcoin. Strategy’s stock price, which reached a July high of about $455, has since fallen to around $359 as of Friday, while Tokyo-listed Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has seen its shares plunge over 30% in the past month. Saylor has never sold a token since his company began buying in 2020, making it the largest Bitcoin holder in the world. Others quickly copied his strategy, like Metaplanet, a Japanese hotel firm that shifted into Bitcoin and accumulated $2.2 billion, now down 50% since mid-June. “What’s fading is the ability to create unique propositions,” Reeds said. “Most CEOs of digital asset companies claim their mission is to generate more Bitcoin per share than the market — but do they really have the management teams or capital connections to outperform the underlying asset?” Still, broader market sentiment improved on Friday as the total crypto market cap rebounded above $4.1 trillion. Ethereum (+13.33%), Solana, and Dogecoin all rallied following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s strongest signal yet of an upcoming interest rate cut. Ledn expands with private wealth program amid growing demand for BTC-backed loans Ledn, the Bitcoin-focused lending platform co-founded by Reeds, recently announced that it has processed more than $10 billion in loans to date. The firm also launched a Private Wealth program designed for high-net-worth individuals and institutions seeking to unlock liquidity from long-term BTC holdings without selling. According to a press release, the program caters to clients with at least $250,000 in active loans. It offers benefits such as faster processing, personalized service, and access to dedicated account managers. “Bitcoin-backed loans are going mainstream. Our most sophisticated clients are using them to fund everything from real estate to new businesses, while keeping upside exposure,” said Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Ledn. “The Private Wealth program gives them the tools, speed, and trust to operate at scale.” The launch arrives when Bitcoin-collateralized lending is gaining increasing interest from traditional finance companies. JPMorgan recently showed an interest in crypto-backed loans, underscoring the sector’s trend toward mainstream finance. Ledn says it has already established the infrastructure for custody, risk management, and loan liquidation to ramp up. The program offering includes preferential rates for loans $1m+, automatic loan rebalancing for loans when the collateral value increases relative to the loan for all clients , and private wealth clients receive an additional complimentary rebalance once per month, in addition to the standard feature. Ledn clients are also given access to the company leadership team and exclusive events. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

While the Solana price (SOL price) hovers near $182, attracting attention with bullish chart setups, a new challenger named A rctic Pablo Coin (APC) is racing through its presale stages with unprecedented excitement. Stage 37, dubbed Ice Ice Baby, is already over 98% filled, making this a make-or-break moment for investors who want in before the listing climbs to $0.008. Even more enticing, APC is offering a limited 100% bonus with the code BONUS100, doubling tokens instantly for early entrants. Meanwhile, other meme-driven projects are stirring the waters. Bonk (BONK), once the Solana ecosystem’s breakout meme coin, is wrestling with sell pressure and Fibonacci retracement levels. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) recently saw whales scoop up and dump massive positions after a sharp rally to $1.10, raising eyebrows across the crypto crowd. But it’s the Arctic Pablo Coin presale that’s creating genuine frenzy, combining mythical storytelling with eye-watering ROI projections. This article takes readers through the latest journeys of Arctic Pablo Coin, Bonk, and Fartcoin, while weaving in updates about the Solana price momentum that links them all together. Arctic Pablo Coin’s 100% Bonus Presale and the Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential Could Arctic Pablo Coin be the breakout story the market has been waiting for? At its heart lies a mythical narrative: the adventurer Arctic Pablo uncovers shimmering APC tokens in icy worlds, offering gateways to prosperity unlike anything the crypto market has seen. Beyond the imaginative tale, the presale economics are engineered to excite even the most cautious investors. Stage 37 is now nearly complete, with APC priced at just $0.00088. Over $3.55 million has already been raised, and whales have started buying heavily, signaling momentum that smaller investors rarely ignore. At launch, APC will be listed at $0.008, locking in an immediate 809% ROI for today’s buyers. Analysts, however, are pushing the narrative further, eyeing an 11,263.63% ROI if APC climbs to the projected $0.1 target. To sweeten the deal, investors who enter now can use BONUS100 to double their holdings. That means a $5,000 investment today at $0.00088 buys 5.68 million APC, instantly doubled to 11.36 million APC with the bonus. At listing ($0.008), this stash is worth around $90,880. If the analyst’s forecast of $0.1 holds, the same tokens could balloon into $1.13 million, turning modest investments into millionaire-level outcomes. Time to Charge Ahead With Arctic Pablo Coin or Regret it Later Every presale has a hook, but Arctic Pablo delivers a cocktail of fantasy, tokenomics, and sustainability. The 66% APY staking program adds passive income after launch, while its deflationary burn mechanism permanently eliminates unsold tokens each week. This keeps the circulating supply scarce and enhances long-term value for holders. APC accepts multiple currencies, including BTC, ETH, SOLANA, and XRP, making it accessible to a broad investor base. What makes APC stand out is not just the math of gains but the urgency. With Stage 37 at 98% complete and the limited-time 100% bonus hanging in the balance, investors are sensing that this meme coin presale is nearing its inflection point. Once the presale closes, APC jumps to $0.008 at listing, and the easy multipliers vanish. That’s why the buzz around APC feels electric—it’s a chance to enter a presale where whales and retail buyers are aligned, and the rewards are too big to ignore. BONK at Critical Support While Solana Price Shapes Its Next Move While Arctic Pablo Coin prepares for liftoff, Bonk (BONK) is trying to hold the line. Currently priced near $0.0000214, BONK has dipped 13% in the past week and sits at a critical support level around $0.000025. Technical charts show a potential “cup-and-handle” setup, meaning BONK could rebound if bulls return. However, the heavy supply of tokens continues to weigh it down, making the dream of $1 valuations mathematically impossible given its trillion-level supply. Still, BONK maintains deep liquidity on the Solana ecosystem, with strong integration into Solana DeFi apps like Jupiter and NFT platforms like Magic Eden. Institutional moves, including a $25 million injection from Safety Shot Inc., show there’s still faith in BONK’s narrative. But for now, BONK’s trajectory will likely mirror the Solana price momentum, making its short-term fate tied to how SOL handles support and resistance. Fartcoin Volatility as Whales Dominate Price Action Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) has epitomized meme coin volatility. Priced around $0.88–$0.89, it has seen 14–21% weekly declines after peaking near $1.10 in mid-August. That rally was fueled by nearly $650 million in volume and a wave of whale inflows. Yet, within days, whales unloaded 32.75 million coins, stripping away some of the momentum and leaving smaller holders nervous. Despite this, analysts are eyeing another run. Some suggest FARTCOIN could test the $3–$5 range, potentially offering 2–5x returns from its current level. With a near $890 million market cap, FARTCOIN is still one of the bigger meme coins in play, but its swings show how fragile meme-driven projects can be once large holders dominate. Like BONK, its movements often rhyme with wider market signals, particularly Solana price trends that drive liquidity. Solana Price Momentum Signals New Highs Ahead The Solana price (SOL price) is currently hovering near $182.75, after dipping slightly in the past week, but traders are closely watching its next move. Despite short-term pullbacks, Solana remains one of the year’s strongest performers, still up more than 27% since January. Technical charts are hinting at a potential breakout, with a bull-flag pattern forming and support levels holding steady in the $175–$180 range. If SOL can clear resistance between $190 and $205, analysts believe it could run toward $225 to $260—levels not seen since its earlier peak cycle. Momentum indicators like RSI and moving averages also suggest strength is returning to the asset, adding to the optimism. However, weaker trading volumes and drying liquidity leave some investors cautious, with bears arguing that a drop to $160 is still on the cards if key supports fail. Beyond technicals, Solana continues to attract attention from U.S. investors eyeing possible altcoin ETFs, as well as retail users exploring its DeFi and NFT platforms. For meme coins like BONK that are tightly connected to the Solana ecosystem, every movement in the SOL price can alter liquidity flows. That’s why SOL’s momentum is more than just a headline—it’s a barometer for risk appetite across the meme coin sector. Wrapping Up: Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential Is Here for the Grabs Every bull run needs its defining story. BONK is wrestling with support, FARTCOIN is proving just how wild meme coins can get, and Solana is trading at $182, eyeing a potential run toward $260 if bullish momentum continues. Yet, the most compelling narrative belongs to Arctic Pablo Coin, with its presale frenzy, deflationary burns, and irresistible BONUS100 offer. Based on investor activity and analysts’ targets, APC is shaping up to be the best crypto coin with 100x potential for this cycle. The presale is closing in on its final bonus stage, and those who wait could miss out on gains that transform a modest $5,000 into six or seven figures. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a story of mythical adventure, wealth creation, and urgency rolled into one. For those ready to act, the presale door is still open—but not for long. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions for the Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential Which meme coin to buy right now? Among trending coins, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out due to its presale ROI potential of 11,263.63% and a 100% bonus offer for early buyers. How does the Solana price affect meme coins like BONK and Fartcoin? BONK is directly tied to the Solana ecosystem, while Fartcoin often mirrors broader market liquidity. When SOL price rallies, these meme coins tend to gain strength. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin unique? Its 66% APY staking, deflationary burns, and bonus stage presale structure set it apart, blending mythical storytelling with practical tokenomics. Is Fartcoin still a risky investment? Yes, Fartcoin’s whale-driven sell-offs show it can surge quickly but also collapse just as fast, making it speculative for most investors. What is the biggest crypto presale in 2025? Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as one of the biggest presales of 2025, raising millions in stage 37 and offering a limited bonus for early entrants. Summary Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is storming through its presale, offering investors massive ROI potential of 11,263.63% and a 100% bonus with code BONUS100. While Solana price momentum influences market trends, BONK and Fartcoin face mixed fortunes. BONK is stuck at critical support, and Fartcoin is swinging wildly on whale trades. The clear front-runner for those seeking the best crypto coin with 100x potential is Arctic Pablo Coin, with its storytelling, staking, token burns, and presale bonus making it an unmissable opportunity.

While BNB and Ethereum continue to dominate market capitalization and adoption, analysts are now spotlighting MAGACOIN Finance as the standout candidate for exponential gains. With institutional players and whale wallets steadily accumulating, forecasts are stretching as high as 55x returns, making MAGACOIN one of the most closely watched tokens heading into the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Whales Drive Rotation Into High-Upside Presales As price predictions tighten, large investors are increasingly positioning into MAGACOIN Finance. Analysts say this rotation reflects a calculated bid to capture early-stage multiples that majors like Ethereum and BNB can no longer deliver. Whale wallet accumulation has been a consistent theme, and retail inflows are following suit, creating steady demand pressure in the presale phase. Market sentiment has shifted as projections have grown more ambitious. Some forecasts place MAGACOIN Finance within the 33x to 35x range, while others stretch to 50x and even 55x returns if adoption catalysts align. For many analysts, the conviction behind these projections is not simply about hype. MAGACOIN Finance benefits from presale structures designed to attract both retail and institutional participation, and the combination of whale inflows with grassroots momentum is seen as a critical driver of potential exponential growth. Compared to the majors, the smaller cap and earlier positioning of MAGACOIN Finance offer the kind of upside that has historically fueled some of crypto’s biggest stories. BNB — Blue-Chip Stability, But Limited Multiples BNB remains a cornerstone asset for many investors, backed by the Binance exchange ecosystem and a track record of sustained adoption. It continues to serve as a utility token for trading discounts, launchpad allocations, and ecosystem governance. However, analysts are quick to note that BNB’s large-cap status limits its upside in percentage terms. While BNB has the infrastructure and liquidity to remain relevant through 2025, the likelihood of it delivering more than 5x to 7x returns is considered low compared with emerging presale opportunities. This has prompted institutions and high-net-worth investors to diversify into projects like MAGACOIN Finance, where potential multiples are significantly higher. Ethereum — Institutional Favorite With Predictable Growth Ethereum still serves as the foundation of decentralized finance and smart contracts, and its role is unlikely to be displaced in the near term. The network’s recent upgrades have improved scalability and reduced costs, while spot ETH ETFs have attracted billions in institutional inflows. Analysts continue to forecast price targets in the $5,000–$7,000 range for 2025. Yet, for many investors, Ethereum’s predictability is also its limitation. With a market cap firmly in blue-chip territory, Ethereum is less likely to deliver the kind of exponential multiples that smaller, early-stage tokens can. This reality has further fueled the rotation toward MAGACOIN Finance, which is positioned as a high-risk, high-reward alternative. Why Analysts See MAGACOIN as the Smartest Play in 2025 The case for MAGACOIN Finance rests on timing, positioning, and momentum. Institutional players are treating it as a speculative hedge against the limited upside of majors, while retail communities are rallying around its presale structure and narrative. Analysts underline that if upcoming exchange listings and DeFi integrations are executed on schedule, MAGACOIN could enter 2025’s bull market with a unique mix of liquidity, hype, and adoption. This alignment of institutional conviction and community energy is what drives projections as high as 55x ROI. The gap between MAGACOIN and the majors may be wide in scale, but in terms of percentage growth, the presale coin is increasingly seen as the smarter play for investors willing to accept higher volatility in exchange for the possibility of life-changing returns.

While the anticipation is building, smart investors are already positioning themselves in projects primed to lead the charge. As in all crypto cycles, large-cap tokens are getting the most attention. However, on-chain data reveals a segment of the market is quietly building up their position in MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts are placing on top of their list of the best altcoins to buy now before the market heats up. 1. Solana: Scaling and Adoption Solana’s reputation as one of the fastest blockchains remains intact. Recent network stress tests showed it can handle over 100,000 transactions per second, far ahead of rivals. With a thriving DeFi ecosystem valued above $12 billion and strong developer interest, Solana is positioned to recover quickly from short-term pullbacks. Institutional exposure through futures and ETFs adds another layer of strength for the upcoming bull run. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Spotlight Presale Analysts have placed Solana, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE among the 5 Best Altcoins to Buy before the bull run starts — but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the token stealing the spotlight. So far, the project’s presale has attracted thousands of investors, cementing it as one of the most popular new crypto launches this year. While the momentum is still brewing, early movers can take advantage of a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the exclusive code PATRIOT50X. The window is open, but not for long. Those who remember the early days of Solana and Ethereum will see the similarities between MAGACOIN FINANCE and these established tokens. For those who missed out on previous breakout opportunities, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the next token to shock the market. 3. Ethereum: Institutional Favorite Ethereum continues to prove its staying power as more than just a cryptocurrency. With over $13 billion in spot ETF inflows and corporate treasuries holding billions in ETH, institutional adoption is stronger than ever. Large wallets are steadily moving ETH off exchanges, hinting at long-term accumulation. Despite recent volatility, Ethereum’s role in DeFi and smart contracts makes it a consistent answer for anyone asking what’s the Best Altcoin to Buy Now. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Utility at Scale BNB powers the world’s largest crypto exchange ecosystem and consistently ranks in daily transaction volume. Priced just below $830, it has shown resilience during volatile market weeks. With new projects launching on the BNB Chain and analysts predicting a push toward $1,000, it remains a core altcoin for diversified portfolios. 5. Hyperliquid (HYPE): DeFi Innovator Hyperliquid is gaining traction as one of the most innovative decentralized exchanges. Its multi-quote spot trading upgrade and permissionless liquidity pools have pushed its total value locked close to $3 billion. Whale interest is increasing, and analysts see potential for HYPE to rally toward $60–$70 if momentum continues. For investors willing to take on a newer, higher-risk project, Hyperliquid offers exposure to the next wave of DeFi growth. Conclusion The market is already shaping up and smart investors are racking up their positions in the altcoins highlighted as breakout contenders. Established leaders like Ethereum and Solana will no doubt attract the most excitement, but the strongest excitement is around MAGACOIN FINANCE. For those asking what the best altcoin to buy now is, the answer may lie in balancing proven giants with emerging contenders such as MAGACOIN FINANCE ready to surprise the market.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency has notably fallen below the critical $116,000 mark. This recent movement sees BTC trading at approximately $115,934.27 on the Binance USDT market, a figure that has sparked considerable discussion among traders and investors alike. What does this mean for the market, and how should you navigate these turbulent waters? Understanding the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop This latest Bitcoin price drop isn’t just a number; it reflects broader market dynamics at play. When BTC dips below a psychological or technical support level like $116,000, it often triggers a chain reaction. Investors frequently monitor these key levels, and a breach can signal a shift in market sentiment from bullish to more cautious or even bearish. This particular dip follows a period of heightened volatility, a common characteristic of the crypto landscape. Market Sentiment: A drop often signals a shift in investor confidence. Technical Levels: Breaching key support levels can accelerate downward trends. Liquidation Events: Significant drops can trigger automatic sell-offs for leveraged positions. What Factors Are Driving This BTC Price Decline? Several factors could contribute to such a swift Bitcoin price drop . While no single cause is usually responsible, a combination of macroeconomic trends, whale activity, and technical indicators often plays a role. For instance, global economic uncertainties can push investors towards safer assets, reducing appetite for riskier ones like cryptocurrencies. Similarly, large institutional players, often called “whales,” executing significant sell orders can create considerable market pressure. Moreover, the crypto market is highly reactive to news and regulatory developments. Any hint of stricter regulations or negative sentiment from influential figures can lead to immediate price corrections. Technical analysis also plays a part; if key resistance levels are not breached, or if bearish patterns emerge on price charts, traders might opt to take profits, further contributing to a decline. Impact of the Bitcoin Price Drop on the Broader Crypto Market Bitcoin’s dominance means that its price movements often ripple across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. When there’s a significant Bitcoin price drop , altcoins frequently follow suit, albeit sometimes with greater volatility. This phenomenon is often referred to as “Bitcoin’s gravity.” Investors holding diversified portfolios might see declines across their holdings, prompting a re-evaluation of their strategies. However, it’s not always doom and gloom. Some analysts view these dips as potential buying opportunities, especially for long-term investors looking to accumulate assets at lower prices. The market’s resilience has been tested many times, and historically, corrections are often followed by periods of recovery. Therefore, understanding the broader market context is crucial. Altcoin Correlation: Most altcoins tend to mirror BTC’s movements. Investor Psychology: Fear can lead to panic selling, while others see opportunities. Long-Term Perspective: Historically, market corrections are part of the crypto cycle. Navigating the Volatility: Your Strategy During a Bitcoin Price Drop For many, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling. However, having a clear strategy can help mitigate risks and even uncover opportunities. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any decisions, understand the underlying reasons for the dip. Is it fundamental or purely speculative? Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions often lead to losses. Consider your long-term investment goals. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. Dips can be good entry points for DCA. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For traders, setting stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the price continues to fall. Diversify Your Portfolio: While BTC influences altcoins, a diversified portfolio can spread risk. Remember, the cryptocurrency market is known for its extreme price swings. Maintaining a calm and analytical approach is key to navigating these periods successfully. Look for credible sources and expert opinions to inform your decisions, rather than reacting solely to short-term fluctuations. The recent dip below $116,000 for BTC serves as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility within the crypto market. While a Bitcoin price drop can be concerning, it also underscores the importance of informed decision-making and a well-thought-out investment strategy. The market is constantly evolving, and staying updated with reliable information is paramount. Whether you see this as a challenge or an opportunity, understanding the dynamics behind such movements empowers you to act wisely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the recent Bitcoin price drop below $116,000? Several factors can contribute to a Bitcoin price drop, including macroeconomic trends, significant sell-offs by large holders (whales), negative regulatory news, and technical indicators signaling bearish sentiment. 2. How does a BTC price drop affect other cryptocurrencies? Due to Bitcoin’s market dominance, a significant BTC price drop often leads to corresponding declines in altcoin prices, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “Bitcoin’s gravity.” 3. Is this Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy BTC? For long-term investors, market dips can present buying opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices. However, it’s crucial to conduct your own research and consider your personal financial situation and risk tolerance before making investment decisions. 4. What strategies can investors use during a volatile Bitcoin price drop? Effective strategies include avoiding panic selling, implementing dollar-cost averaging (DCA), setting stop-loss orders for traders, and diversifying your investment portfolio to manage risk. 5.

The , which accused the popular crypto exchange of violating Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), is now on hold. This pause raises compelling questions about user data, privacy, and the future of Know Your Customer (KYC) processes in the digital asset space. What’s Happening with the Coinbase Privacy Lawsuit? The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division recently issued an order to temporarily halt the lawsuit against Coinbase. This case centers on allegations that the exchange improperly collected and shared biometric data. According to a report by Cointelegraph , the court explained its decision by stating that a stay would: Simplify the issues at hand. Streamline the trial process. Reduce the burden of litigation on both the court and the parties involved. Not unduly prejudice or tactically disadvantage the plaintiffs. This decision means that while the lawsuit isn’t dismissed, its progress is paused for the time being. Understanding the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) To truly grasp the gravity of the , it’s essential to understand BIPA. The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act is a pioneering state law enacted in 2008. It is considered one of the strictest biometric privacy laws in the United States. Essentially, BIPA mandates that companies must: Obtain informed consent before collecting, storing, or sharing biometric data (like face scans, fingerprints, or voiceprints). Provide a publicly available retention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric data. Not profit from a person’s biometric data. This law gives individuals the right to sue companies that violate its provisions, leading to potentially substantial damages. Allegations Against Coinbase: Why the Lawsuit? The lawsuit against Coinbase was initially filed in May. It brought forth serious accusations concerning the exchange’s handling of user data. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase engaged in the “wholesale collection” of faceprints. This collection allegedly occurred during its mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Moreover, the lawsuit asserted that Coinbase shared these sensitive biometric data points with third-party authentication companies. Crucially, these actions were allegedly carried out without obtaining the explicit consent of its users, a direct violation of BIPA’s core requirements. The outcome of this could set a significant precedent for how crypto platforms manage user identity verification. What Does This Suspension Mean for Crypto Users? The temporary halt in the doesn’t diminish the underlying concerns about digital privacy and data security. For Coinbase users, it means the legal battle regarding their biometric data is in a state of limbo. However, it also highlights the increasing scrutiny crypto exchanges face concerning their data handling practices. This case serves as a powerful reminder for all users to carefully review the privacy policies of platforms they use. It emphasizes the importance of understanding what data is collected, how it is used, and with whom it might be shared. The crypto industry, known for its focus on decentralization and privacy, must navigate these legal challenges carefully to maintain user trust. Looking Ahead: The Path Forward While the proceedings are suspended, the is far from over. The court’s decision for a stay suggests a desire to streamline complex legal arguments, perhaps awaiting clarity on related legal matters or allowing parties to explore settlement options. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, so too will the legal frameworks governing it. The resolution of this case will undoubtedly influence how other crypto exchanges approach biometric data collection and privacy compliance moving forward. Summary: A Pause, Not an End, for Coinbase’s Privacy Battle The U.S. court’s decision to temporarily suspend the marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing discussion about digital privacy within the crypto sector. While the immediate legal pressure on Coinbase might be eased, the core issues of biometric data collection and user consent remain paramount. This case underscores the growing importance of robust privacy practices and transparency for all companies operating in the digital realm, especially those handling sensitive user information. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Coinbase privacy lawsuit about? The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase violated Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting users’ faceprints for its KYC process and sharing them with third-party companies without explicit consent. 2. Why did the U.S. court suspend the proceedings? The court suspended the proceedings to simplify issues, streamline the trial, reduce litigation burden, and avoid prejudicing or tactically disadvantaging the plaintiffs. 3. What is the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)? BIPA is an Illinois state law requiring companies to obtain informed consent before collecting, storing, or sharing biometric data, and to have clear data retention and destruction policies. 4. How does this suspension affect Coinbase users? For now, the legal battle regarding user biometric data is on hold. It highlights the importance for users to review privacy policies and understand how their data is handled by crypto platforms. 5. What happens next in this Coinbase privacy lawsuit case? The lawsuit is temporarily paused, but not dismissed. The court may lift the stay at a later date, or the parties might explore settlement options. The case’s eventual resolution will likely set precedents for the crypto industry’s privacy practices.

Among the notable developments, the market’s leading altcoin skyrocketed above the $4,700 mark while recording double-digit gains and edging closer to the $4,878 record highs it reached during the last crypto bull cycle four years ago. After enduring a prolonged phase of consolidation and breakdown, ETH’s recent gains reflect renewed optimism in the market, particularly following comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell. Ethereum, XRP, And BNB Surge Powell’s remarks during his speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium suggested that rate cuts could be on the horizon, a sentiment that tends to favor assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Lower interest rates make investments in stocks and digital currencies more attractive compared to traditional interest-yielding options, such as bonds. Additionally, a reduction in rates typically weakens the dollar, further enhancing the appeal of cryptocurrencies.

XRP rose by 5%, Solana (SOL) saw a 4% gain, and Binance Coin (BNB) surged by 8%, reaching a new record price beyond the $882 mark, which now serves as a resistance level for the token. Manuel Villegas, an analyst at Julius Baer, noted in a research report that the correlation between cryptocurrencies and equities is currently strong. He emphasized that the market mood is likely to be highly responsive to comments from the Jackson Hole meeting of monetary authorities and any subsequent reactions from fiscal authorities. ¿A Bullish Q4 Ahead? On social media platform X (formerly Twitter), market experts weighed in on the implications of Powell’s statements highlighting what could come next for the broader cryptocurrency market. Doctor Profit remarked that Powell’s announcement was the most anticipated event for both the stock and crypto markets, suggesting that the market had already priced in the likelihood of upcoming rate cuts. He cautioned that a “sell the news” reaction could soon occur, as traders might capitalize on the gains made in anticipation of these developments. Related Reading: Dogecoin About To Explode?

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is still far from the record $124,000 level reached last week, despite its 4% surge in the last 24 hours. Trading at $116,000, Bitcoin is still 6% below its all-time high.

Together, they represent meme coin virality, institutional adoption, payments innovation, and early-stage presale hype. But while all four are attracting strong investor interest, MAGACOIN Finance has become the standout, with forecasts pointing to potential substantial gains and presale incentives that are still live for early buyers. XRP (Ripple) — Institutional Tailwinds and Utility Growth Ripple’s XRP remains firmly on analysts’ lists thanks to a wave of institutional momentum. Large investors are leaning into XRP as regulatory clarity improves across multiple regions, and speculation over an eventual ETF approval continues to swirl. These factors have given XRP a renewed position as a lower-risk, utility-driven altcoin for 2025 portfolios. At the same time, XRP maintains its leadership in cross-border transactions, where its fast settlement and low fees make it one of the most efficient blockchain solutions for payments. The token is also pushing further into DeFi, with integrations designed to expand its use beyond simple remittances. Analysts see this mix of regulatory progress and technological expansion as the key to unlocking higher price targets, with many forecasting between $6 and $10 by the end of 2025. SHIB (Shiba Inu) — Community Power and Shibarium Expansion Shiba Inu remains a top-tier meme coin, supported by one of the most active communities in crypto. Shibarium, SHIB’s Layer-2 network, continues to add real utility through DeFi protocols, gaming projects, and an aggressive burn mechanism designed to reduce circulating supply. These developments have kept SHIB relevant long after many meme tokens faded. Analysts suggest that if positive momentum continues, SHIB could approach the $0.00010 mark this cycle. Still, SHIB is considered a high-risk, high-reward play. Some whales have already begun rotating profits from SHIB into emerging presales like MAGACOIN Finance, highlighting a shift from mature meme coins to earlier-stage projects with greater upside potential. DOGE (Dogecoin) — Brand Recognition and Payment Potential Dogecoin remains the cultural giant of meme coins, benefiting from unmatched brand recognition and one of the largest global followings in crypto. DOGE’s value often reacts to social media sentiment and broader meme coin rallies, creating periodic surges that traders continue to capitalize on. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s biggest advantage may come from payment adoption. If mainstream applications or large e-commerce platforms expand crypto payment options, DOGE is likely to be among the first tokens supported. Analysts still classify DOGE as a strong liquidity play, capable of delivering bursts of performance when sentiment aligns. MAGACOIN Finance — The Standout Presale of 2025 Among the four, MAGACOIN Finance is being ranked as the standout pick for September 2025. Analysts project gains as high as 9000%, positioning it well above DOGE, XRP, and SHIB in terms of potential upside. Momentum is accelerating quickly, with early investors already rotating profits from established coins into MAGACOIN’s presale, signaling confidence in its early-stage trajectory. Part of the appeal lies in its presale status, which offers the largest asymmetrical return potential compared with more mature assets. MAGACOIN Finance has captured attention through viral marketing and a unique political meme narrative that sets it apart from standard meme tokens. As capital shifts into the project, whales and retail investors alike are treating it as the year’s most explosive presale opportunity. Investors are also responding to the limited-time entry incentives. A 50% EXTRA bonus is still available through the PATRIOT50X code, but analysts caution that the window is narrowing as allocations sell out. For those willing to accept the risks of presale investing, MAGACOIN Finance represents the clearest chance at parabolic returns in 2025. Key Takeaways from Analysts’ Rankings Across the four leaders, analysts see distinct narratives shaping September 2025. XRP is gaining institutional trust through regulatory clarity and payment integrations, while SHIB continues to demonstrate the power of community and ecosystem expansion. DOGE holds its position as the cultural face of meme coins, offering bursts of liquidity and attention-driven rallies.

CFTC Launches New “Crypto Sprint” Phase On Thursday, CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham announced that the agency would begin the next phase of its initiative to advance President Donald Trump’s vision and is seeking the public’s feedback on the recommendations in the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets report. Pham highlighted that the Trump administration has “made it clear that enabling immediate trading of digital assets at the Federal level is a top priority,” adding, “The Trump Administration has ushered in a new dawn for crypto, and it’s up to market participants to seize this opportunity to be a part of the Golden Age of innovation.” The agency has initiated stakeholder engagement and invited all interested parties to submit feedback and suggestions on all recommendations for the CFTC in the White House’s recent digital assets report by October 20, 2025. “The public feedback will assist the CFTC in carefully considering relevant issues for leveraged, margined or financed retail trading on a CFTC-registered exchange as we implement the President’s directive,” Pham stated. As reported by Bitcoinist , the CFTC unveiled its “Crypto Sprint” on August 1, which started with a spot crypto trading initiative. Following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) launch of its “Project Crypto,” Pham revealed that the agency would work closely with SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce to provide regulatory clarity and foster innovation in the digital assets market. “I am pleased with the many thoughtful letters from stakeholders in support of the CFTC’s listed spot crypto trading initiative, which, in coordination with the SEC’s Project Crypto, answers President Trump’s call to action for American leadership,” said the CFTC acting chair on Thursday. Chaos In The Regulatory Agency? The CFTC’s initiative comes amid rumors of chaos in the regulatory agency. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, affirmed that “turmoil continues as the agency’s responsibilities, and the potential market risks, are multiplying.” According to the report, enforcement has significantly slowed, and the commissioner’s shortage has allegedly made it difficult to carry out critical agency business. “The CFTC’s curtailment coincides with a looming expansion of the agency’s responsibilities,” Bloomberg noted, as the highly anticipated market structure bill is expected to shift most of the crypto market oversight to the CFTC. A White House spokesperson denied that the agency is in disarray, telling the news media outlet that “President Trump has made it a priority to make America the crypto capital of the world, and in doing so has called for the revitalization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to play a larger role in securing this promise. Acting Chairman Caroline Pham has done a good job beginning this effort, and the Trump Administration is thankful for her leadership and dedicated public service.” Meanwhile, the agency also remains in a leadership limbo after the US Senate Agriculture Committee delayed the vote on President Trump’s nominee for CFTC chairman, Brian Quintenz, days before the August recess. The committee reportedly delayed the vote following a request from the White House. Notably, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini exchange co-founders, allegedly pressed President Trump in July to reconsider his CFTC nominee, arguing that Quintenz wouldn’t “shake up the CFTC enough” and is not “aligned with Trump’s agenda.” Earlier this week, a group of crypto organizations sent a letter to the US President in support of Quintenz, arguing that installing a permanent chairman is “absolutely critical” to realize the agency’s goals. “Mr. Quintenz possesses a singular capacity to advance sound and clear regulation that will foster responsible growth and innovation. He is, quite simply, the right person at the right time to lead the CFTC,” the letter concluded.","Crypto News|""Project Crypto""|bitcoin|Brian Quintenz|btc|BTCUSDT|Caroline Pham|CFTC|CFTC acting chair|crypto market structure bill|crypto regulation|Crypto Sprint|Crypto Sprint initiative|Donald Trump|President Donald Trump|US SEC",EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 03:00:55

The move follows multiple infiltration attempts by North Korean IT workers trying to access the exchange's critical systems. “It feels like they have 500 new people graduating from some school every quarter, and that’s their only job,” Armstrong told Stripe co-founder John Collison on the Cheeky Pint podcast. Now, all new hires must complete an in-person orientation in the U.S. Those who require access to sensitive infrastructure must be U.S. citizens and undergo fingerprinting. The stricter measures aim to block deepfake interviews, fake identities, and bribery attempts—all of which have reportedly been used to gain insider access at crypto firms. FBI Warnings, Real Arrests & $900K Heists: The Bigger Picture The FBI has repeatedly warned that North Korean operatives are posing as freelance developers and engineers to infiltrate U.S. companies, including those in the crypto space. In July, the agency revealed that these actors were working with both knowing and unknowing Americans, using fake businesses, company laptops, and even attending online interviews on behalf of others. In one high-profile case, a District of Columbia court sentenced an American woman to 8.5 years in prison for helping North Korean nationals secure tech jobs under fake identities. Meanwhile, Armstrong disclosed a separate but growing problem: bribery. “The attackers offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to our support agents to photograph sensitive information,” he said.“When we catch people, we don’t just walk them out the door — they go to jail.” This crackdown has also led to Coinbase expanding domestically, including the launch of a new customer service hub in Charlotte, North Carolina. Deepfakes, Coaching & Coercion: How Hackers Game the System To combat AI-powered fraud and impersonation, Coinbase now requires all interviewees to keep cameras on during calls. The goal? To detect if a candidate is being coached, assisted offscreen, or even replaced by a deepfake or AI bot. “It’s not worth going to prison,” Armstrong warns, emphasizing that even high bribes aren’t worth the risk. The company has become hyper-aware of these tactics after hackers reportedly used scripted coaching and real-time assistance during interviews to fool HR teams.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-23 03:02:48

Reports from PR Newswire confirm that AMTD Group is set to integrate AMTD Group cryptocurrencies into its substantial $240 million liquid asset portfolio. This strategic decision signals a growing acceptance of digital currencies within traditional finance, and it’s a development that cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are watching closely. What is Driving AMTD Group’s Cryptocurrencies Adoption? AMTD Group’s decision to add digital assets is a clear indicator of the evolving financial landscape. The conglomerate will prioritize the addition of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) to its crypto portfolio. This move isn’t just about diversification; it represents a forward-thinking approach to asset management. By including these specific cryptocurrencies, AMTD Group is tapping into established and liquid digital assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum are market leaders, known for their strong communities and significant market capitalization. Tether, as a stablecoin, offers a bridge between traditional fiat and volatile crypto markets, potentially providing stability within the digital asset allocation. The Strategic Advantages of Embracing Digital Assets Why would a major financial player like AMTD Group venture into the often-volatile world of cryptocurrencies? The reasons are compelling and rooted in strategic foresight: Portfolio Diversification: Cryptocurrencies offer a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, potentially enhancing portfolio resilience. Growth Potential: Despite volatility, digital assets have shown remarkable growth over the long term, presenting opportunities for significant returns. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Engaging with crypto positions AMTD Group at the forefront of financial innovation, preparing for a future where digital assets play a larger role. Liquidity: With a $240 million liquid asset portfolio, AMTD Group can leverage the high liquidity of major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH for flexible asset management. This proactive step by AMTD Group highlights a growing trend among institutional investors to explore and integrate digital assets, moving beyond initial skepticism. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Considerations for AMTD Group Cryptocurrencies While the benefits are clear, investing in AMTD Group cryptocurrencies also comes with its share of challenges. The digital asset market is dynamic and requires careful navigation: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price fluctuations, which can impact portfolio value significantly. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving across different jurisdictions, posing compliance challenges. Security Risks: Protecting digital assets from hacks and cyber threats requires robust security infrastructure and protocols. Custody Solutions: Securely holding and managing large quantities of cryptocurrencies necessitates specialized custody solutions. AMTD Group, with its extensive financial expertise, is likely to have considered these factors thoroughly, implementing strategies to mitigate potential risks. This measured approach is crucial for successful institutional entry into the crypto space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Investment? AMTD Group’s move sends a powerful signal to the broader financial industry. When a NYSE-listed conglomerate, managing substantial liquid assets, allocates a portion to digital currencies, it validates the asset class. This could inspire other traditional financial institutions to seriously consider or accelerate their own crypto adoption strategies. Moreover, increased institutional participation, such as this embrace of AMTD Group cryptocurrencies , often brings greater stability, liquidity, and legitimacy to the crypto market. It could also pave the way for more sophisticated financial products and services built around digital assets. This is not just an investment; it’s a testament to the maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In conclusion, AMTD Group’s strategic decision to add cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether to its $240 million liquid asset portfolio marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the undeniable shift towards digital assets in mainstream finance and positions the group as an early adopter among traditional conglomerates. This move reflects confidence in the long-term value and utility of cryptocurrencies, paving the way for further institutional integration into the exciting world of digital finance.

The surge captured global attention, but the momentum quickly unraveled as reports of insider trading and highly concentrated token ownership surfaced. Within hours, the token’s value collapsed to around $1.05 billion, reinforcing concerns about sustainability and investor trust. Investigations into YZY Coin’s launch revealed that insiders controlled over 94% of the supply. This raised questions about whether the rally was fueled more by manipulation than by organic demand. The fallout left many retail investors wary, with some calling YZY one of the most volatile celebrity-backed launches to date. However, that shifted attention to the token with the best upside this year: MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Analysts’ Top Crypto Presale Pick While YZY Coin captured headlines with its explosive but unstable debut, analysts say the real momentum is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE. Thousands of investors are shifting into the best crypto presale , drawn by forecasts of massive ROI potential that could make it one of the best-performing altcoins in the next bull cycle. Experts consistently rank it among the strongest presales of 2025, citing both its early traction and its structured rollout. The presale has already raised more than $12.5 million, underscoring the demand from retail and whale investors alike. Beyond its presale growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining credibility with audited contracts and a transparent supply model that sets it apart from tokens plagued by insider distribution issues. Early adopters are also responding to unique presale incentives. The PATRIOT50X code, which unlocks a 50% extra allocation, has accelerated inflows as investors look to secure positions before allocations close. Analysts warn that time is limited, and momentum is only likely to intensify as the broader market turns bullish. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just a speculative play but a strategic positioning move for 2025. It offers exposure to meme-driven enthusiasm without sacrificing transparency and sustainability — a balance that makes it stand out against high-profile but unstable launches like YZY Coin. Conclusion — Two Very Different Stories Kanye West’s YZY Coin may have captured attention with its celebrity-driven hype and explosive launch, but its volatility and insider concentration have cast a shadow over its long-term potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, is emerging as the consensus choice for investors seeking both high upside and structural credibility. As the second hald of the year unfolds, analysts are clear: YZY Coin might have been the loudest debut, but MAGACOIN FINANCE looks set to be the most sustainable winner.

OpenAI has subpoenaed Meta as part of Elon Musk’s ongoing lawsuit over a potential $97 billion deal to acquire the ChatGPT developer. According to OpenAI (and Sam Altman), Meta, or even CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally may have had backchannel communications with Elon Musk and his AI startup xAI about acquiring or investing in OpenAI. The subpoena aims to uncover documents or messages showing any involvement, direct or indirect, from Meta in the transaction. This comes after Musk allegedly promoted the deal publicly in February 2025. A $97B Power Play, Legal Tensions, and the Future of AI OpenAI’s legal team revealed they first requested documents from Meta in June 2025, but it remains unclear whether any evidence has been submitted. The defense argues Musk discussed xAI’s offer directly with Zuckerberg, including possible financial terms. Meta has officially denied involvement, stating it neither took part in such communications nor signed any letter of intent regarding a deal with Musk or xAI. This legal wrangling is closely tied to OpenAI’s transformation from a for-profit to a public corporation, a change Musk says goes against its original mission. Behind the Scenes: Why Meta Is Still a Key Player in This AI War OpenAI is now requesting broader documentation, including anything related to restructuring, recapitalization, or strategic changes at Meta. The court battle is as much about corporate control of AI as it is about transparency and competition. Meta previously pushed back, arguing its internal talks were irrelevant and that Musk and xAI could supply the needed details themselves. Meanwhile, analysts point to Meta’s aggressive push into AI—developing its own models and allegedly recruiting OpenAI engineers, including some who worked on ChatGPT—as proof of a deeper rivalry forming between tech giants.",News|Ai,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-23 03:31:55

This follows Gemini’s previous approval under MiFID II, which enabled the exchange to trade derivatives in the same jurisdiction. With both licenses, Gemini can now operate more broadly in over 30 European countries, solidifying its place among the most compliant and expansion-ready crypto platforms. Why MiCA Licensing Is a Game Changer for Gemini and the Crypto Industry In a statement, Gemini emphasized that this milestone reflects its long-term commitment to regulatory compliance and sustainable growth in Europe. “We believe clear regulation is the foundation for global crypto adoption, and Europe’s MiCA framework is a major step forward in providing clarity and investor protection.” The exchange also highlighted its June launch of tokenized stocks on the Arbitrum blockchain for European users. These blockchain-based tokens mirror real-world equities and are available for 24/7 trading, offering flexibility far beyond traditional markets. Gemini Isn’t Alone: Other Crypto Giants Now Licensed Under MiCA Gemini joins a growing list of crypto platforms that have already obtained MiCA approval, including Kraken, Bitvavo, Bybit, and Coinbase.

50523925,563662,1755921600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50523925.jpeg,$41M Crypto Scam Exposed: Taiwan Indicts 14 in BitShine Fraud Case,https://bitcoinist.com/41m-crypto-taiwan-indicts-14-in-bitshine-fraud-case/,"Taiwanese authorities have wrapped up a major investigation into one of the country’s most high-profile crypto-related fraud cases, filing charges against 14 individuals linked to the BitShine exchange. Prosecutors allege the group conspired with criminal networks to siphon NT$1.27 billion (approximately $41 million) from more than 1,500 victims through a scheme that combined fraudulent investment pitches with unlicensed cryptocurrency operations. According to Taiwan’s Central News Agency, BitShine operated under the cover of legitimacy, having reportedly passed financial compliance checks , while using its brand to conceal the activities of another firm, Biying Technology, which had not been approved by regulators. Investigators allege that the two entities worked in tandem to funnel customer deposits into crypto purchases, particularly USDT, before moving the funds overseas through a series of complex transfers designed to obscure their origins. Structure of the Fraud Network Prosecutors identified a man surnamed Shih as the head of the operation in Taiwan, with his wife serving as Asia-Pacific director and another suspect, surnamed Yang, responsible for business management. Working with organized crime affiliates, the group allegedly instructed victims to transfer funds into wallets controlled by the network. The tokens were then routed through multiple layers of transactions in what officials described as deliberate efforts to launder the money and evade detection. Between January 2024 and April 2025, investigators estimate the operation laundered more than NT$2.3 billion ($75 million). Of that, NT$1.27 billion was directly tied to 1,539 identified victims. Law enforcement seized NT$60.49 million in cash, 640,000 USDT, additional digital assets, and luxury items including cars during raids earlier this year. Authorities stated that the group misled investors by claiming to be the only exchange authorized by Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), a tactic that helped attract significant deposits. They also reportedly established more than 40 franchise-style storefronts across Taiwan under the names CoinW and BiXiang Technology Co., Ltd., collecting over one million yuan in fees and deploying “deposit machines” to process victims’ cash. Indictments and Sentencing Requests The Shilin District Prosecutor’s Office indicted Shih and 13 others on charges of fraud, money laundering, providing unregistered virtual asset services, and organizing a criminal enterprise under Taiwan’s Organized Crime Prevention Act. Prosecutors are seeking a 25-year sentence for Shih, citing his refusal to plead guilty and lack of remorse. Other defendants who confessed or pledged to return illicit gains may face reduced penalties. In addition to confiscating the seized digital assets and cash, prosecutors have asked the court to order the forfeiture of NT$1.275 billion in criminal proceeds. The case was overseen by Chief Prosecutor Luo Weiyuan, who emphasized that the suspects had conducted unlicensed financial operations in violation of Taiwan’s anti-money laundering laws. The investigation also uncovered a separate fraud targeting the BitShine operators themselves. Prosecutors said a man surnamed Gu defrauded Shih and his associates of NT$3 million by falsely promising he could secure anti-money laundering registration approvals. Gu has also been indicted.

Bitcoin dominance holds, altcoin rotations are getting stronger and institutions are sustaining the flow in the direction of mainstream adoption. As far as many investors are concerned, it is no longer a question of whether it is going to occur at all in 2025, but how to position themselves to reap the most benefits when the bull run takes place. In the dynamic environment, along with reputable projects such as Ethereum and Solana, new presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction as prospective early-cycle beneficiaries. Lessons from Past Bull Runs Looking back provides clear guidance. The 2017 rally resulted in Ethereum increasing in value by over 1,000% after liquidity ran out of Bitcoin. In 2021, meme tokens such as Dogecoin and SHIBA INU surprised markets by generating some of the most considerable returns of the cycle. The unifying factor was timing, investors that got in before mainstream awareness bottoms had a huge winning capture as momentum investors ride the exponential wave. This pattern is why analysts are emphasizing preparing early. Anticipating the headlines to signal a bull run is likely to mean a missed opportunity. In 2025, the strategy will focus on the assortment between mature players, cross-checking Bitcoin dominance as an indicator of rotation, and investing in good presale propositions. The Role of Presales in Bull Markets Presales have historically offered unique opportunities. They enable investors to invest before exchange listing and at reduced valuations, as projects gain traction and community support. When the larger altcoin season hits, these presales will have the ability to provide multiples that other larger-cap tokens will not be able to match. The risks of presales are, of course, present, but teams have to come through with what they promise, communities have to remain engaged, and further utility has to develop. Of the bull runs, though, at least a few tokens in the presale phase have become household names, minting fortunes to early adopters. That is why presales are being treated more and more as the high-reward element of gearing up for the next bull run. In this presale story, one of the most talked-about opportunities is MAGACOIN FINANCE. What is special about it is the scarcity of supply, branding, and timing. Allocation rounds are limited and they sell out fast, making the need to be positioned early especially important to investors. It has cultural currency, with a politically motivated brand that makes it stand out even outside tech and crypto communities. Analysts note that forecasts predict a 55x–65x ROI as presale momentum accelerates with early buyers securing bonuses. This projection is made together along the aspect of scarcity and increase in whale-interest in proportion to the privacy of long holders who build up in anticipation of the availability of an exchange. The ecosystem that is growing around the project is supportive of the sentiment that MAGACOIN FINANCE is more than just the hype- it is a narrative-driven project that follows structural market trends. Timing the Market: Why Preparation Matters Markets rarely reward hesitation. By the time it is in full retail swing, much of the upside may already be reflected in the price. Getting ready for 2025 suggests paying attention to rotation signs, Bitcoin consolidating after new peaks, Ethereum getting stronger with institutional flows, and liquidity starting to overspill to altcoins. This is the time when presale initiatives such as MAGACOIN FINANCE find the project stories catch fire. The advantage of having a position secured in advance is that the investor is not anxious to get green candles but is in a position to ride out this natural cycle. Practical Steps for Investors Not just token selection can get people ready to experience a bull run. Risk management remains vital. Limits of setting allocations, balancing between previous and emergent assets, and the use of secure wallets are available in constructing a sustainable plan. Investors should also monitor any regulatory solutions: welcomed explicitness could quicken the take-up. Findings narratives are equally important to metrics at the same time. In 2017, DeFi was barely on the radar. By 2021, it was central to the cycle. The process of tokenization of real-life assets, meme culture, and politically appealing branding could be such factors in 2025. A project such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, compatible with these stories, can be one of the largest beneficiaries. Conclusion: Positioning Ahead of the Curve The bull run of 2025 is on the horizon, and being prepared will mean average good gains or big ones. It is shown time and again that the first mover, the one who understands how to diversify, and those who align themselves with breakout narratives in the market tap into the greatest riches. As the forecasts indicate, its ROI is expected to be 55x65x, and each of the presale rounds is selling out especially fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates the philosophy of being ahead of the curve. For investors seeking to reposition themselves for the next cycle strategically, it presents one of the most interesting opportunities in an already competitive market.

Analyst Spot Bullish Trends in Netflow Data,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/could-ethereum-be-eyeing-new-highs-analyst-spot-bullish-trends-in-netflow-data/,"Ethereum’s price has maintained notable strength in recent weeks, giving many investors reason for cautious optimism. The asset briefly traded near $4,700 last week, close to its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021, before correcting to its current level around $4,633. Despite this pullback, Ethereum is still up nearly 30% over the past month, according to CoinGecko data, putting a majority of holders back into profit. Alongside these price developments, analysts continue to monitor exchange data for signs of broader market sentiment. One such analysis comes from PelinayPA, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, who examined Ethereum’s netflow patterns on exchanges. This indicator measures whether more ETH is moving onto exchanges (inflows) or off of them (outflows), providing insight into potential selling pressure or long-term accumulation behavior. Related Reading: Altseason Things: Ethereum Perps Volume Sets New Record Against Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Data Points to Reduced Selling Pressure According to PelinayPA, the current netflow picture suggests that Ethereum investors are largely removing coins from exchanges. Historical data indicate that significant inflows, accompanied by substantial amounts of ETH being transferred to trading platforms, often precede price corrections as investors prepare to sell. Conversely, notable outflows have historically appeared before bull market surges, reflecting confidence in holding or long-term storage. “In past cycles, strong exchange outflows occurred just before major uptrends in 2017, 2021, and again in 2024,” PelinayPA explained, adding: What we’re seeing now is consistent negative netflow, meaning ETH is leaving exchanges. This generally reduces immediate selling pressure and supports the case for ongoing bullish momentum. The analyst noted that while inflows can still trigger short-term pullbacks, the current outflow-dominant environment suggests that Ethereum retains significant upside potential in the medium to long term. The price action aligning with these signals reflects a market where participants are more inclined toward accumulation than distribution. Ethereum Institutional Demand and Technical Outlook Ethereum’s strong performance is also being interpreted through a technical lens. Several traders have pointed out that ETH has broken out against Bitcoin after years of relative underperformance. A crypto analyst known as CryptoBatman on X highlighted the significance of this trend, arguing that Ethereum’s rally could be entering a new phase of market recognition.

Investment funds and exchange-traded products tied to Ethereum have seen steady growth in holdings, with large investors maintaining exposure even during periods of volatility.

Ethereum continues to dominate as the institutional favorite, Shiba Inu maintains its cultural footprint in the meme sector, but a new name—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is capturing the sharpest attention. With ROI projections climbing as high as 20,000%, it has become the token analysts are calling the most ambitious presale of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Forecasted 20,000% ROI As Ethereum attracts institutional inflows and Shiba Inu works to reignite its community base, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out its own spotlight in 2025. Its capped crypto presale is rapidly shrinking in availability, and the combination of scarcity and early demand has fueled forecasts that now stretch as high as 20,000% ROI for early entrants . This surge of attention reflects more than meme-driven speculation. Analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the cycle’s clearest asymmetric bet, drawing both whales and retail investors eager to capture the type of exponential gains that defined earlier meme phenomena. The project’s rise is increasingly being compared to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, when hype and timing created generational returns for early adopters. In the same way, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is being framed as a rare window where risk and reward align for those willing to step in early. While the volatility and liquidity risks are undeniable, the growing consensus is that MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the boldest speculative opportunity heading into 2025 — one that could either fizzle quickly or rewrite the meme coin leaderboard. Ethereum (ETH) — Blue-Chip Altcoin Growth Ethereum is unlikely to deliver 20,000% gains, but it continues to anchor portfolios as the dominant smart contract platform. Spot ETH ETFs have driven billions in institutional inflows this year, helping ETH surge past $4,475 and cementing its reputation as a long-term hold. Its appeal lies in predictability. With strong developer activity, billions in DeFi liquidity, and expanding real-world adoption through tokenization and NFTs, Ethereum remains the safest high-cap altcoin play for 2025. Analysts forecast steady price targets in the $5,000 to $7,000 range, making ETH a core choice for investors seeking stability. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — Community Power, Limited Upside Shiba Inu retains one of the largest meme coin communities and continues to build around its ecosystem through Shibarium and DeFi integration. However, analysts are clear that SHIB’s days of exponential growth are behind it. The token’s enormous supply makes another 20,000% rally virtually impossible, and whale activity has cooled compared to its early surge years. That said, SHIB remains relevant as a lower-risk meme option, backed by a strong base of holders and ongoing development. For new capital, though, much of the speculative momentum is rotating into emerging plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion — Speculation Meets Stability Choosing the best crypto to buy in 2025 comes down to strategy. Ethereum offers security and steady growth, Shiba Inu delivers community power with limited upside, and MAGACOIN FINANCE presents the riskiest but potentially most rewarding opportunity. Its presale buzz, whale participation, and 20,000% ROI projections have made it the center of market speculation heading into the next cycle. For risk-tolerant investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the token that could define 2025.

Ethereum, the asset of choice, has meanwhile been garnering considerable attention from institutions and retail investors alike. Change of Heart A dormant BTC whale has resurfaced today, as reported by the Lookonchain market watcher page. The team traced the original purchase from seven years ago, when the wallet received 100,784 BTC (~$642M), which was sold for Ethereum (ETH) today. At the start of 2018, the leading cryptocurrency was trading at roughly one-tenth of its current price (approximately $113,000 now, compared to around $13,000). If we assume that they bought in at that price, this has netted them a tremendous 1,613% return on the investment. The trader purchased 62,914 ETH (~$267 million) from the spot market using their substantial earnings and opened a long position of 135,265 Ether, worth approximately $577M. The blockchain trackers noted another holder from 2018 who sold their Bitcoin on Hyperliquid to buy ETH. The data shows that the wallet originally received 85,947 bitcoins at that time, worth approximately $547 million, and they believe it’s the same entity. A total of 6 BTC-containing wallets were identified, which hold the impressive 83,585 units, valued at around $9.42 billion, considering the prices at the time of printing. ETH in The Spotlight The top altcoin has been receiving significant attention in 2025, currently up over 60% from the same time last year and trading at around $4,300. This is a modest 8.5% decrease from the recent local peak of over $4,700 it achieved last week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Source: CoinMarketCap Institutions are pouring capital into the recently emerged trend of ETH treasury companies, along with exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Notably, Tom Lee’s BitMine leads treasuries, while BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF has the lion’s share among the funds . The entities hold 1.5 million ETH and 3.54 million ETH, respectively, in their coffers, and current data from StrategicEthReserve indicates that over $44 billion in Ether is split between treasuries and ETFs, representing almost 9% of the total supply.

According to Degen, Mastercard, XRP, and WebBank have converged in a partnership that will introduce a mainstream credit card product running on XRP rails. He stated that the official launch is scheduled for August 25, 2025, a date he framed as the beginning of a new era for cryptocurrency integration into daily finance. Ahead of the launch, a billboard at 29th and Broadway in New York City unveiled the campaign, promoting what he described as the first true credit card using XRP and signaling the entry of digital asset payments into everyday financial life. MasterCard x XRP⁰MASS ADOPTION IN 3 DAYS Millions will use crypto every day without even knowing it. Here’s how $XRP kills the “crypto is hard” narrative pic.twitter.com/akPh38hRt6 — Smart Degen (@smartsdegen) August 21, 2025 Details of the Mastercard and XRP Integration In his tweet, Smart Degen clarified that this product is not a crypto debit card with conversion fees nor a DeFi-based solution requiring seed phrases and manual wallet setup. Instead, it is positioned as a standard Mastercard credit card, issued by WebBank, that uses XRP as the settlement layer. He emphasized that this distinction makes it easier for everyday consumers to participate in crypto without needing to understand the technical processes behind blockchain. Degen pointed out that users of this card would interact with it just as they do with any traditional credit card, requiring only a swipe to complete transactions. The Significance of WebBank’s Role The tweet highlighted the role of WebBank, a recognized institution that already issues cards for PayPal Credit, Apple Card, and Google Pay Card. Smart Degen framed this association as crucial for establishing legitimacy, contrasting it with what he called crypto experiments of the past. He presented this as evidence that XRP is now positioned as part of established financial infrastructure rather than a niche or experimental tool. Timelines and Adoption Phases Smart Degen linked this development to a broader timeline of cryptocurrency adoption. He described 2009 to 2017 as the time when crypto was primarily used by enthusiasts, 2017 to 2021 as the early adopter stage, 2021 to 2024 as the period of institutional entry, and 2025 as the year of mainstream integration. He identified the XRP Mastercard as the bridge into what he called the “everyone” phase of adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Elimination of the “Crypto is Hard” Narrative In his explanation, Smart Degen compared the traditional crypto experience with the new model. He listed tasks such as downloading wallets, securing seed phrases, managing gas fees, and bridging assets as barriers that have historically deterred mass participation. By contrast, he summarized the new Mastercard experience as a three-step process of swiping, purchasing, and completing the transaction. He concluded that this shift removes the complexity associated with using digital assets and makes them accessible to a broader audience. Broader Implications for Financial Infrastructure The tweet also projected the long-term effects of this partnership. Smart Degen outlined what he described as an upcoming network effect, beginning with the launch of the XRP Mastercard, followed by millions of daily users, and eventually leading to other banks adopting XRP infrastructure . He envisioned a progression in which XRP becomes a standard component of global banking systems and ultimately underpins a majority of payment flows. According to Smart Degen, August 25, 2025, represents a milestone for crypto adoption. With Mastercard , XRP, and WebBank involved in delivering a product that resembles traditional credit cards, he suggested that this move could finally make cryptocurrency usage seamless for the general population.

Among the 10 best cryptos to buy now, Ethereum, XRP, and Avalanche are standing out — but a hidden gem presale is capturing even more attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the conversation, with analysts forecasting staggering returns that rival the early days of major altcoin breakouts. Ethereum: The Market’s Anchor Ethereum remains the top altcoin in crypto markets. Even though its price is down to $4,150 with recent volatility, Ethereum remains the backbone of the entire DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 adoption. With ETH ETFs gaining over $1 billion in inflows and strong institutional confidence, analysts expect ETH to rally toward $5,000 in the months ahead. Long-term investors see Ethereum as essential for any portfolio because of its developing dominance and network effect. XRP: Legal Clarity and Institutional Traction XRP has achieved regulatory clarity after years of uncertainty as confirmed not to be a security in secondary sales. Mature whales residing on exchanges have increased their accumulated funds to around $2.90, adding strong support for XRP. Even though there is perpetual volatility, analysts are expecting a surge in price towards $3.39 in September as ETF speculation builds and retail interest strengthens. Avalanche: DeFi and Real-World Assets Growth Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining a lot of popularity among retail and institutional investors. There are presently $300 million in tokenized hedge funds and $188 million in tokenized real-world assets on the blockchain. Currently trading close to the $23 mark, AVAX is showing strong support. If it manages to hold its momentum, we could see higher levels in the $32–$37 range. Avalanche is a strong buy for investors positioning themselves for the next cycle amid rising developer activity and the network’s scalability. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem Thousands of investors have already joined the wave into MAGACOIN FINANCE, with analysts forecasting a staggering 20,000% ROI in the next bull run. Ranked among the best altcoins to buy right now , momentum is accelerating quickly. Early buyers using PATRIOT50X unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are running out fast. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its capped supply, transparent audits, and heavy whale-backed demand. Analysts believe that these fundamentals position it not only as a meme-driven play but also as one of the most strategic accumulation opportunities heading into 2025. TRON and Chainlink: Driving Real-World Connectivity TRON (TRX) has become a strong backbone for stablecoin transaction volume, surpassing $668 billion. TRX is trading at about $0.35 but long-term holders are taking profits. As DeFi activity grows, TRON may look to hit $0.38 in the near-term as yields near 10%. Chainlink (LINK), which has been on the rise since mid-April, recently surged to yearly highs near $25.60. Specifically, the price was up 8% in a span of just one day. A collaboration of wallet businesses and oracle technology has contributed to the rise of the Chainlink coin. If momentum continues, analysts see long-term upside by 2025 to $50-55. Hedera, SUI, and BNB: Scaling Adoption Hedera (HBAR) is maintaining long-term stability in the $0.23–$0.26 range thanks to new partnerships and app launches. SUI is trading today at $3.48 and could test its yearly high of $5.37 on-chain engagement. At the same time, Binance Coin (BNB) attains strength at the level of $829. The coin is still near yearly highs and has witnessed some solid buying. Litecoin and Polkadot: Recovery and Value Plays Litecoin (LTC) has shown a recovery and now trades beyond $112. Over the last year, Litecoine (LTC) has increased by almost 70%. Analysts consider it a strong mid-cap buy, with the target set at $138. Polkadot (DOT), currently valued at about $3.89, might indicate a potential rally in the months ahead as prices are hovering above lows with increasing volumes. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and Avalanche are likely to be the clear leaders in the next bull cycle. Meanwhile, tried and tested TRON, LINK, and BNB also have their share of strong fundamentals. However, analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is the real breakout candidate, with predictions of a staggering 20,000% ROI prompting unmatched presale demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving to be impossible to ignore for investors who want stability with high upside.

The asset’s price has also staged a remarkable recovery following the recent local bottom, especially after yesterday’s update on the legal case against the securities regulator. ETF Updates Recall that just earlier this week, the SEC delayed making a decision on several XRP ETF applications filed by companies such as Bitwise, Canary, Coinshares, and Grayscale. These entities were quick to respond, according to Bloomberg’s ETF expert James Seyffart, as they have already updated their respective filings. He believes this is “almost certainly” due to the feedback received by the Commission. The cryptocurrency community is familiar with this process, as the BTC and ETH ETF issuers had to endure essentially the same procedures before their respective funds saw the light of day. Consequently, Seyffart categorized these updates as a “good sign, but also mostly expected.” Bunch of XRP ETF filings being updated by issuers today. Almost certainly due to feedback from SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected pic.twitter.com/GiSL1kc6lt — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 22, 2025 Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett shared Seyffart’s post, adding that these updates “make sense” to be done now, as the new deadline for the SEC is set for October, and it is approaching fast. SEC Legal Case and XRP Moves Ripple and the SEC had another interaction yesterday. As reported, the Second Circuit finally approved the two parties’ joint stipulation of dismissal, which was filed earlier in August. According to experts, this is most likely the final step needed before the official conclusion of the case. The duo had filed such dismissals in the past as well, but Judge Torres denied them at first. XRP’s price reacted immediately to the news yesterday. The asset had tumbled to a multi-week low of under $2.80 but skyrocketed to $3.10 within minutes. It’s worth noting that it also benefited from the overall market revival following the Jackson Hole speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Despite retracing slightly since that local peak, XRP still trades above $3.00, which is a crucial support-turned-resistance-turned-support level.

50526231,563720,1755925209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50526231.jpeg,Australia Cracks Down On Binance: Orders External Audit Over Money Laundering Concerns,https://bitcoinist.com/australia-cracks-down-on-binance/,"After navigating significant challenges in the United States regarding money laundering allegations that led to the resignation of its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), cryptocurrency exchange Binance finds itself under scrutiny once again, this time in Australia. Binance’s AML And CTF Controls Under Fire The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the nation’s financial intelligence agency, has mandated that Binance’s local arm appoint an external auditor due to “serious concerns” about its anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls. AUSTRAC’s concerns emerged following a recent independent review of Binance Australia’s operations, which the agency described as “limited in scope relative to its size, business offerings, and risks.” The agency highlighted alleged issues from the exchange such as high staff turnover, inadequate local resources, and insufficient oversight from senior management. In a statement, AUSTRAC emphasized the need for robust systems that align with local regulatory requirements , particularly given the global nature of the exchange’s operations. Brendan Thomas, AUSTRAC’s chief executive, stressed the importance of effective customer identification, due diligence, and transaction monitoring in a high-risk environment. Thomas stated: This is a global company operating across borders in a high-risk environment. We expect robust customer identification, due diligence and effective transaction monitoring. Global Regulatory Challenges Binance has been given a 28-day window to nominate external auditors to address these concerns. In response to the situation, Matt Poblocki, the general manager of Binance Australia and New Zealand, stated that the exchange has been engaging openly and transparently with AUSTRAC throughout recent months. The exchange’s executives reassured stakeholders and users in the country about the company’s commitment to maintaining high compliance standards and improving its capabilities. Founded in 2017, Binance has rapidly ascended to become the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. However, its journey has not been without difficulties. After initially operating in China, Zhao moved the company’s operations internationally due to a crackdown on the crypto sector by Chinese authorities. Despite its growth, Binance has faced accusations in multiple countries of facilitating the laundering of funds for criminal organizations. Zhao pleaded guilty to violating US anti-money laundering laws in late 2023, resulting in a four-month prison sentence in 2024. However, Bitcoinist has reported that despite being banned from taking charge of the exchange, Zhao might be seeking a pardon from pro-crypto President Donald Trump. These legal challenges have compounded the scrutiny on Binance with the exchange taking a new direction with its new CEO Richard Teng as regulators worldwide increasingly focus on ensuring compliance. Despite recent scrutiny from Australia’s Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, Binance’s native token, BNB, reached an all-time high of $882 on Friday. The cryptocurrency has consistently surged over the past month, even as the broader market struggled.

Moreover, they have identified altcoins with institutional support that are likely to break out. This year’s best altcoins to buy already have some clear front-runners. Among them are Binance Coin (BNB), XRP, SEI, and fast-rising MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is a presale project. BNB Maintains Strength Near Yearly Highs BNB remained resilient today, presently trading at around $829 with a market cap of more than 120 billion dollars. Price action has been constant, where it hovers around its yearly high at $869. According to analysts, Binance is performing strongly because its exchange is dominant and continues to burn tokens while BNB is involved in DeFi and staking. Several investors think of BNB as a safe bet due in 2025 despite the volatility. XRP Consolidates With ETF Speculation XRP has stabilized around the $3 mark after weeks of regulatory delays over ETF approvals. The asset has proven resilient despite uncertainty, as over 93% of the circulating supply remains in profit. According to analysts, an XRP ETF approval could send prices back to its all-time high of $3.84. If institutional flows accelerate, it could also be $4.50. Traders looking for exposure to a primary settlement asset will find XRP a compelling option. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned as the Breakout Play BNB and XRP are established leaders, while SEI is gaining traction — but analysts say the real breakout lies in MAGACOIN FINANCE, still trading under $1. With forecasts of 55x upside and as much as 10,000% ROI potential, it’s being ranked among the best altcoins to buy in 2025. Early buyers are rushing to accumulate the token at the cheapest price, though supply is running out quickly. Analysts highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE capped supply, verified audits, and whale-backed inflows give it the kind of fundamentals that fueled the earliest breakouts of BNB and XRP. If momentum continues at its current pace, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025. SEI Gains Momentum With Adoption SEI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 blockchains, recently surpassing 1 million daily active wallets and leading EVM-compatible chains in weekly activity. With strong traction in both DeFi and gaming sectors, analysts highlight SEI’s scalability and adoption curve as signals of long-term growth. Near-term volatility from token unlocks has not stopped whale accumulation, keeping SEI firmly on analyst watchlists for 2025. Conclusion: The 2025 Bull Market Leaders Institutional players are piling BNB and XRP in their wallets while SEI is fast catching on as a future blockchain leader. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, has the greatest speculative upside according to analysts who predict exponential returns if momentum continues. For investors looking for stable yet high-growth opportunity, these four altcoins could be the best plays going into the 2025 bull market.

XRP has clung tightly to its $3 support level despite inflation-driven volatility. Tron’s on-chain and futures metrics are signaling more room to climb, and BlockDAG has become the project many are watching for very different reasons. With $380 million raised in presale, a Batch 29 price of $0.0276, and a set of high-profile updates, BlockDAG is turning into a headline driver. Its Dashboard V4 is giving participants a live trading experience before official listings, sports partnerships are pushing the brand into global audiences, and the Ambassador Program is building grassroots momentum. Together, these moves make BlockDAG more than a presale story, it’s shaping into an ecosystem with both presence and engagement. XRP Holds Firm at $3 Support XRP has managed to keep its footing at the $3 support line despite broader market turbulence. Inflation data from the U.S. came in hotter than expected, with the Producer Price Index up 0.9% in July and 3.3% year-over-year, raising concerns that the Federal Reserve could delay expected rate cuts. This pressure rippled across markets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum slipping, and XRP sliding nearly 5% to $3.12. Around $62 million in long positions were liquidated during the move. Yet, volumes jumped 30% to $12 billion as participants defended the $3 mark. Analysts are now looking at $3.40 as a key resistance that, if broken, could unlock moves toward $4. The fundamentals are also supportive, with Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD expected to enhance settlement demand. With regulatory uncertainty mostly cleared, long-term forecasts still point toward $4.50–$6 by 2025, with potential upside beyond the decade. Tron Metrics Show Upward Pressure Tron (TRX) is holding steady momentum, trading around $0.357 after notching a 5.48% gain over the week and nearly 19% over the month. While it saw a slight daily pullback, the Futures Volume Bubble Map suggests there’s still upside available, as activity is far from overheated. Analysts note that the last time metrics were in a similar position, TRX jumped from $0.26 to $0.45. Open Interest has eased from $340 million to $313 million, indicating weaker positions are closing out. However, the Funding Rate has been positive for four straight days, pointing to stronger longs holding steady. Spot demand also looks healthy, with the Spot vs Perp Premium climbing to 0.0014 and the RSI at 74, both signals of buying pressure. If demand continues, TRX could retest $0.37 and possibly hit $0.40. A failure to hold momentum could bring it back toward $0.33, but for now, the bias leans upward. BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4, Sports Deals, and Ambassador Push BlockDAG is standing out not through speculation but by delivering tools and building visibility. With over $380 million raised in presale and a Batch 29 price set at $0.0276, its progress is already impressive. But what’s truly setting it apart is Dashboard V4. This interface replicates the look and feel of a live crypto exchange, offering real-time BDAG charts, order book data, wallet balances, and referral tracking before any listings go live. This transparency is rare in presale projects and has helped build confidence in the ecosystem. Global exposure is also expanding through sports. Partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves in rugby and the Seattle Orcas in cricket have added visibility on the international stage. These collaborations come with NFTs, collectibles, fan coins, and interactive content, bridging crypto with entertainment and culture in ways that resonate with broad audiences. Alongside these moves, the BlockDAG Ambassador Program has gone live, mobilizing community leaders worldwide. Ambassadors are rewarded with incentives, access, and recognition for driving awareness and engagement. It’s a grassroots effort designed to amplify BlockDAG’s reach and strengthen community ties. Together, Dashboard V4, sports partnerships, and the Ambassador Program create a framework of delivery, credibility, and visibility. With presale progress already strong, these additions give BlockDAG the depth and traction to stand apart. Wrapping Up XRP is holding critical support while aiming for higher resistance, Tron is building momentum on strong trading metrics, and BlockDAG is rewriting what a presale can offer by delivering tools and building community ahead of launch. The combination of $380 million raised, Dashboard V4’s transparent trading environment, international sports alliances, and an engaged Ambassador Program signals more than hype; it signals progress backed by proof. XRP and Tron are showing their technical strength, but BlockDAG is showing what structured delivery looks like before day one on exchanges.

As the cryptocurrency is attempting to reclaim this crucial area, some analysts suggest that a new all-time high (ATH) is imminent. Related Reading: Another Celebrity Scam? Kanye West Memecoin Launch Leaves 60% Of Investors In The Red Ethereum Hits New Multi-Year High On Friday, Ethereum broke above the $4,800 resistance for the first time since 2021, hitting a multi-year high of $4,834. The cryptocurrency has rallied over 14% over the past 24 hours, driven by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s annual address at Jackson Hole. In his speech, Powell signaled the possibility of an interest rate cut, affirming that “with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” Following Powell’s remarks, the market soared, with Bitcoin (BTC) jumping from its local range low to the $117,000 area. Meanwhile, Ethereum initially climbed from the $4,200 support to reclaim the crucial $4,700 barrier. In a statement to CNBC, Jordi Alexander, CEO of crypto trading firm Selini Capital, suggested that crypto traders were caught completely offside by Powell’s dovish comments. “The market positioning in recent sessions has seen clear risk-off moves in assets like crypto and tech, and today’s setting up of a September rate cut is causing a panicked repositioning, which could continue through the illiquid weekend as shorts get squeezed,” he affirmed. Meanwhile, Joseph Chalom, Co-CEO of SharpLink Gaming, asserted that “the markets are loving Powell’s dovish speech. September rate cuts seem imminent. We’re at a pivotal moment in the market cycle.” ETH Ready For More? Notably, ETH has been consolidating between $3,762 support and $4,631 resistance since the early August breakout, retesting the $4,000-$4,100 mid-zone of this week’s pullback. On Friday afternoon, Ethereum continued its climb above the $4,800 resistance. This level was unsuccessfully tested last week, when the King of Altcoins hit a local high of $4,788 before being rejected. Analyst Crypto Jelle highlighted a one-week falling wedge pattern on ETH’s chart, which targeted a breakout to the $4,600-$4,800 area. Following today’s price jump, the analyst suggested that Ethereum is ready to target its all-time high of $4,878 after the breakout. Additionally, he noted that ETH already broke out of an 18-month bullish megaphone this month, which targets the $10,000 level. He explained that the cryptocurrency has successfully retested the key resistance level, around $4,000, during this week’s pullback and has “hardly any resistance left.” Related Reading: Chainlink Eyes Crucial Resistance After $25 Reclaim – Breakout Or Breakdown Next? Nonetheless, he warned that a pullback is likely to come following the massive pump but added that “the intent is clear. This market wants higher.” Similarly, Ted Pillows affirmed that volatility was expected after Powell’s speech, noting that it had happened in previous years. However, he suggested that a big ETH rally will follow, “just like the last time.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,799, a 32.6% increase in the monthly timeframe.

This change enables funds to exchange underlying assets directly with authorized participants, improving efficiency and helping ETFs more closely track their spot markets. In parallel, the SEC granted and then stayed accelerated approval for a Bitwise multi-asset conversion. This brings more uncertainty and breaks its cautious approach to broader crypto exposure. The Future of Spot XRP ETFs The SEC recently extended review periods for multiple crypto ETF filings, pushing decisions into October . This included XRP products such as the 21Shares Core XRP Trust, which has to wait till the October 19 deadline. Other pending XRP proposals share similar dates, meaning the Commission could address several digital asset filings within the same month. These delays do not signal outcomes but give regulators more time to review disclosures, surveillance arrangements, and the operational details required under the new framework. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of Approval If the SEC approves Grayscale’s XRP Trust or another spot XRP ETF, it would expand access to XRP across regulated markets. Approval would enable investors to gain exposure through brokerage platforms and retirement accounts, thereby opening the asset to institutional investors . The ETF format provides standardized structures, audited reporting, and clear custody arrangements. The adoption of in-kind creation and redemption further supports liquidity and enhances the correlation between fund shares and the spot market. Together, these features could encourage broader participation while integrating XRP more firmly into traditional investment channels. Grayscale’s filing has furthered the race for a U.S.-based spot XRP ETF, and with October quickly approaching, we might see these products launch soon.

That has prompted asset managers to call for new all-time highs for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and select altcoins. What Powell said? In one of his most important speeches, Powell suggested that the labor market could benefit from lower borrowing costs, having held the benchmark interest rate steady at 4.25% for eight months. “Downside risks to employment are rising,” Powell said in prepared remarks for his keynote speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium, adding that the possibility of President Donald Trump’s tariffs having only a short-lived effect on inflation is “reasonable.” “With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he noted. Cryptocurrencies and stocks soared, and the probability of the September Fed rate cut jumped to 90% following the speech. Most analysts expect the momentum to continue in the days ahead. Analysts see new highs for BTC and ETH above $5K Analysts at Monarq Asset Management anticipate that ether's price will rise above $5,000 in the coming days. ""We maintain our overall bullish stance. Market internals remain constructive, with few signs of overheating and, as you point out, a clear path to new all-time highs in both BTC and ETH,"" Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, told CoinDesk. ""Our house view is that Powell’s dovish pivot has cleared the way for $5,000+ in the near term (also not the hardest call to make). Demand from treasury vehicles should increase into the fall as many of the deals announced this summer close or de-SPAC, in addition to ongoing institutional and retail inflows,"" Gaer added. Ethereum's native token ether has already gained nearly 10% in 24 hours, hitting record highs above $4,800. As of writing, it changed hands at $4,700, according to CoinDesk data . Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin traded near $115,600, slightly down from the overnight high of $117,400. Data from Deribit-listed options shows that ether's rally has sparked renewed demand for upside bets, or call options. At press time, risk reversals were positive across all tenors, implying relative richness of calls. The sentiment wasn't so bullish in BTC options. Gaer stated that over-the-counter desks and market makers are experiencing stronger demand for ETH compared to BTC, suggesting that ether may outperform ahead. That said, BTC looked strong on its own too. ""The BTC pullback from ATH was ~9.6%—far less than earlier drawdowns this year—indicating strong demand, as evidenced by whale wallet accumulation around the $113k level,"" Gaer said. Spencer Yang, managing partner at BlockSpaceForce, a crypto treasury advisory firm, said more rate cuts could happen after September, ensuring the momentum extends well into the year-end. ""We’re now fully expecting rate cuts to happen in September. It will be the first cut since Trump became President this year. This is significant, and many more will come,"" Yang said, calling new highs in the crypto market. ""The major 5 that we pay attention to: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, LINK. These will do well given the various parts of the crypto industry they impact,"" Yang added. Focus on ETF flows Steve Lee, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital and investor in BlockTower Capital, called Powell's dovish turn a short-term constructive development for cryptocurrencies while stressing the importance of continued inflows into bitcoin and ether spot ETFs. ""I see this as constructive in the short term, and it may help reverse this week’s sell-off. The key question is whether this momentum holds beyond the low-liquidity weekend. Since BTC and ETH price action is increasingly institutionally driven, spot ETF flows today and Monday will be a strong indicator of whether we are set for another leg higher,"" Lee told CoinDesk. Lee highlighted Base, Monad, Story, and SUI as key projects of interest that he is closely monitoring in his capacity as an early-stage venture capitalist. Gaer, meanwhile, favored Solana and the SOL ecosystem, including high-beta SOL tokens such as JITO and JUP. Raydium and PUMP on both a ""fundamental and forward-demand basis."" Potential headwinds While Powell’s dovish stance has set the stage for a rally, traders should remain cautious about potential pitfalls from corporate treasury cryptocurrency adoption and volatility in equity markets. ""Digital asset treasuries (DAT) are an innovative vehicle for public market investors to gain exposure to the digital asset space. However, we have started to see the quality of DAT deals – from banking relationships, compliance, management team, and deal structure perspectives — dropping, which shows early signs of a 'bubble,"" Lee said. Naqsdaq-listed Strategy started this trend of corporate BTC adoption in 2020. Since then, more than 100 publicly-listed firms have accumulated a total of 984,971 BTC, according to data source Bitcoin Treasuries. ""The trend may continue, but it is obvious that the risks associated with this are not ignorable,"" Lee added. Gaer called for closely tracking risks from an overheated equity market and ""potential for macro or geopolitical shocks.""",Markets|Bitcoin ETF|Ether|Markets|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-23 05:15:06

With inflation eating into purchasing power, it is important to examine assets that can not only defend savings but also have upside potential. The emergence of cryptocurrency means hedging your bets is more important than ever. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most talked-about projects in 2025 among them. The Inflation Challenge: Safeguarding Wealth Inflation is a tax that eats away at savings every time something’s price rises. In order to combat this, investors are turning towards assets that have historically remained the same or increased in value in inflationary scenarios. Real estate and commodities are often strong hedges. For instance, property tends to generate rental income while the latter benefits from improving global demand. Gold, along with other precious metals, still appears in the top tier of asset classes, but this has become less frequent and much less certain to occur as the market cycle evolves. Companies able to increase prices without losing many customers, known for pricing power, also provide protection. Stocks that pays dividend offers value share and many more equity strategies for protection. For direct hedges, government-issued inflation-linked bonds, such as TIPS, remain one of the safest options. These adjust payments based on actual inflation rates to maintain real returns. The Crypto Opportunity: A Path to Riches While traditional hedges help in lost value, crypto expands your opportunity for upside. Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” and it’s the benchmark. Meanwhile, Ethereum powers the smart contracts and DeFi applications. There are thousands of altcoins, many of which have their own risks and opportunities. Strategies in crypto vary. HODLers can look forward to any major cycle rallies, while the staking and yield farming opportunities offer passive income. More active investors explore day trading and arbitrage. It has become easier for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the asset thanks to Bitcoin ETFs. The Rising Crypto Star of 2025 Out of the various options available, analysts and investors believe MAGACOIN FINANCE will grab most opportunities to grow. With predictions of 12,000% or more gains, it’s quickly becoming one of the leading crypto presales of 2025. Presale rounds are moving quickly due to the project fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s verified audits, secure smart contracts, capped supply, and whale-backed inflows are certainly differentiating factors. The speculation regarding Tier-1 exchange listings seems to be a result of fundamentals. This has resulted in a rush to invest. Those who position themselves now could be among the first beneficiaries before mass adoption drives broad-based demand. Navigating the Risks Risk management is important for all investment portfolios. Enhancing traditional hedges with cryptocurrency plays of high potential value. Investors typically allocate 1-5% of their capital to cryptocurrency in order to gain exposure. Patience is equally important. Chasing the spikes or selling in panic in declines usually costs losses. Building positions in a systematic manner and sticking to the fundamentals in the longer term suggests more wisdom. Conclusion The financial landscape of 2025 requires adaptability. Real estate, commodities, and inflation-linked bonds provide a robust defensive cushion and with cryptocurrencies unlike other asset classes, the greatest possible upside. In this situation, early adopters are looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE as a once-in-a-cycle opportunity, which seems likely to provide the returns for the next bull run. Combining hedging strategies with exposure to new digital assets can help investors construct portfolios that thrive amid inflationary pressure and market growth.

Both ecosystems occupy central roles in the crypto landscape. Ethereum stands as the pioneer of smart contracts and decentralized finance. Solana positions itself as the challenger with superior speed, scalability, and minimal transaction costs. Every network has its own strengths and disadvantages that stand out. Both platforms have their own groups of developers and investors. Ethereum benefits from its history, clearer rules, and more institutions using it. Solana has a lot of momentum, is very flexible with technology, and is quickly adding new integrations in the gaming, DeFi, and NFT industries. For investors who are trying to choose which platform to back, the choice is still not easy. At the same time, as money changes hands and altseason stories grow, new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are joining the discourse in unforeseen ways. Ethereum’s Case: Security and Institutional Depth Ethereum remains the most recognized smart contract platform globally. Its massive developer base provides continuous innovation and maintenance. Deep liquidity pools ensure stable trading environments for large transactions. The network’s unmatched DeFi footprint makes it the default choice for institutions and startups alike. Layer-2 solutions effectively reduce transaction costs and network congestion. Upcoming upgrades aim to make staking more efficient and wallets more user-friendly. For investors, Ethereum represents security and credibility through its proven track record. The network has weathered multiple market cycles and adapted through consistent innovation. Each adaptation has strengthened its position in the global marketplace. The ecosystem prioritizes resilience over raw speed. These qualities matter significantly to institutional players building products intended to last for decades. Solana’s Case: Speed, Costs, and Growing Adoption To fix Ethereum’s biggest problems with transaction speed and cost, Solana was built from the ground up. The network can handle traffic that is lightning fast. Its transaction fees stay very low, at just a few cents. Because of these things, it is the best chain for uses where size is important. Major NFT platforms have moved to take advantage of its features. It works very well, which helps on-chain game projects. On its network, high-frequency DeFi techniques work better. The chain has come back from technical problems and market downturns in a big way. This comeback has earned the trust of developers and sparked new energy in the community. Partnerships with both standard banks and tech companies have made it even more credible as an alternative. For many people, Solana is more than just faster internet. It looks like this is the chain that could make blockchain more widely used by making it easy for regular people to use. Developers and Security: Two Philosophies It’s hard to understand Ethereum, which is both good and bad. Because it has a very large smart contract infrastructure, it can make things that are quite sophisticated. This level of complexity also makes projects that use shared code or centralized deployers fragile. People think the network is powerful since it has been assaulted a lot in the past. Speed and ease are the most important things to Solana’s design philosophy. The software tools it makes are getting better and easier to use. With these technologies, producers may create swiftly without having to worry about Ethereum’s problems with scale. Like any other blockchain, there are good reasons to worry about security. The network has proved that it can change by adding frameworks that make it harder to hack. In the end, Ethereum is more stable than Solana, which is more adaptable. These are two quite distinct ways of thinking that investors and producers should think about. The New Challenger: MAGACOIN FINANCE While the spotlight remains on Ethereum and Solana, the market’s most interesting opportunities often come from outside the top ten. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the scene with notable momentum. Some analysts compare its early movement to the early days of SHIBA INU and Dogecoin. Unlike the established giants with large valuations, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains at the presale stage. This early stage magnifies its potential growth significantly. Market models currently project possible rallies of up to 12,000% during intensified altseason rotations. Scarcity mechanisms form the heart of this optimistic outlook. Token allocations remain intentionally limited across all distribution rounds. These limited rounds have been selling out rapidly since launch. Early whale accumulation has added credibility to the project’s narrative. This activity signals that sophisticated players are positioning themselves ahead of exchange listings. The project’s unique branding makes it particularly compelling. Its connection to political and cultural currents captures attention beyond crypto’s usual circles. This combination of scarcity, branding, and early adoption mirrors historical traits that fuel breakout altcoin stories . Investors watching for the next cycle’s cultural driver see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a unique opportunity. The established networks cannot replicate this opportunity due to their maturity. Timing the Rotation Altcoin seasons follow a familiar and predictable rhythm across market cycles. Bitcoin rallies typically occur first and strongest. Ethereum then consolidates gains and establishes support levels. Liquidity eventually flows into smaller tokens after these initial movements. During these capital transfers, both Solana and Ethereum will gain. When people are most excited about shopping, newer projects often see the most rapid growth. Outperforming assets have clear trends that can be seen in past cycles. Tokens with new designs and features for scarcity did much better than well-known brands. This trend from history fits nicely with MAGACOIN FINANCE. Since Bitcoin’s popularity is staying the same and capital is getting ready to move, now seems like a good time for MAGACOIN FINANCE to gain huge traction. Which Ecosystem Should Investors Choose? How much risk an investor is willing to take will have a big impact on whether they choose Solana versus Ethereum. Ethereum’s established system and well-aligned rules make it stable. These qualities make it more probable that institutions will do well over time. Solana is quick and works well for apps that need to handle a lot of traffic. This makes it attractive to both developers and customers who demand good performance. If investors are willing to go beyond the main networks, they might uncover other options. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not like any other sites that are already out there. It’s an early-stage chance centered on a story and the premise that things are hard to find. Even if Ethereum and Solana will still get most of the attention, purchasers often find the inconsistent returns they’re searching for during altcoin season in new coins. Conclusion: Giants and Newcomers Together Shape the Future There won’t be a clear winner in the fight between Solana and Ethereum. It’s conceivable that both ecosystems will do well by using different methods and areas of expertise. Ethereum will keep expanding as it becomes more mature and trustworthy. Solana will grow by becoming faster and cheaper. The market might not remember 2025 only for this competition, though. This year could be known for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that made history. Market models that predict big rises make for interesting stories. Limited amounts make potential investors feel like they need to act quickly. Branding that appeals to people outside of the crypto community gives it cultural importance. This mix shows a different type of business idea based on timing and cultural momentum. This mix could really change things for early participants in a year when altseason rotations are supposed to get stronger.

The nation recently made headlines by adding another eight Bitcoin (BTC) to its reserves over the past week. This consistent accumulation underscores El Salvador’s unwavering commitment to its innovative El Salvador Bitcoin strategy, a move that has captured the attention of financial markets worldwide. El Salvador Bitcoin: A Pioneering Path to Digital Wealth The latest acquisition brings El Salvador’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 6,227.18 BTC. This significant digital asset portfolio is currently valued at approximately $727 million, according to data from the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC). This consistent growth is not by chance; it is a result of a deliberate and long-term investment strategy. Since November 18, 2022, El Salvador has maintained a unique approach: purchasing one Bitcoin every single day. This dollar-cost averaging strategy helps mitigate the impact of market volatility, allowing the nation to build its reserves steadily over time. Moreover, this disciplined accumulation reflects a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its potential to reshape national economies. What Drives El Salvador’s Bitcoin Accumulation? El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. This bold decision was not merely about embracing a new technology; it was a strategic move aimed at fostering economic independence and financial inclusion for its citizens. The ongoing accumulation of El Salvador Bitcoin is a direct extension of this vision. The government believes that Bitcoin can offer a pathway to: Greater Financial Inclusion: Providing access to banking services for the unbanked population. Reduced Remittance Fees: Lowering costs for Salvadorans living abroad to send money home. Economic Sovereignty: Diversifying national reserves away from traditional fiat currencies. Attracting Foreign Investment: Positioning El Salvador as a hub for crypto innovation. Therefore, each daily purchase contributes to strengthening these core objectives. Benefits and Global Impact of El Salvador Bitcoin Strategy The world watches closely as El Salvador navigates its pioneering path. The benefits of its Bitcoin strategy extend beyond just accumulating digital assets. For instance, the country has seen a boost in tourism, with many crypto enthusiasts eager to experience a nation where Bitcoin is everyday currency. Furthermore, the increased liquidity and acceptance of Bitcoin within the country facilitate smoother cross-border transactions and stimulate local businesses. The National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) plays a crucial role in managing these holdings and promoting the broader adoption of Bitcoin within the nation. They ensure transparency and provide updates on the country’s Bitcoin reserves, building trust and showcasing the potential of digital assets on a national scale. This proactive stance solidifies El Salvador’s reputation as a trailblazer in the digital economy, influencing discussions about crypto adoption globally. What Challenges Lie Ahead for El Salvador Bitcoin? While the journey has been largely positive, challenges remain. Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility can impact the value of the national holdings. Critics often point to these fluctuations as a risk factor. However, El Salvador’s long-term approach, exemplified by its consistent daily purchases, aims to weather these market swings. International bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have also expressed concerns regarding financial stability and regulatory frameworks, urging caution. Despite these challenges, El Salvador continues to push forward with ambitious plans. Projects like Bitcoin City, powered by geothermal energy, and the issuance of “Volcano Bonds” demonstrate a vision for a future deeply integrated with decentralized finance. The consistent growth in El Salvador Bitcoin reserves is a testament to this enduring commitment and strategic foresight. In conclusion, El Salvador’s steady accumulation of Bitcoin, including the recent addition of eight BTC, highlights its unwavering dedication to its groundbreaking economic model. By consistently investing in Bitcoin, the nation not only strengthens its digital reserves but also reinforces its position as a global pioneer in the cryptocurrency space. This ongoing journey provides valuable insights into the potential for national-level crypto adoption and economic transformation.

XRP, Stellar, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are consistently ranked among the top seven assets expected to post strong ROI, joined by Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, and Dogecoin. Each plays a distinct role in the broader market picture — from payments infrastructure to retail-driven speculation. While XRP and Stellar bring proven adoption and Solana anchors institutional growth, it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that has quickly become the wildcard. Rising from a presale narrative into the mainstream, its projected upside is what ties the list together, giving the “top seven” both stability and breakout potential heading into 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGACOIN) — Breakout Presale Momentum Analysts now place MAGACOIN FINANCE in the same top-seven rankings that feature long-standing players like XRP and Stellar, citing its ability to draw both institutional attention and retail enthusiasm. The crypto presale project has rapidly shifted from a niche meme-fueled presale to a candidate for wider adoption, with momentum building ahead of anticipated listings. Investor sentiment is strong because MAGACOIN FINANCE straddles two narratives at once — the viral energy of meme coins and the structured rollout of more established tokens. That mix has allowed it to capture early inflows from whales while maintaining grassroots appeal. Comparisons to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are common, but analysts argue MAGACOIN’s trajectory looks more deliberate. Its placement alongside established payment networks shows how far it has climbed in market perception, moving from outsider status to one of the most closely watched crypto presales of 2025. For risk-tolerant investors, the token’s rise signals not just speculative hype but a strategic chance to secure exposure to what could become one of the cycle’s breakout performers. XRP — Post-Clarity Resurgence XRP enters 2025 with a tailwind after finally clearing regulatory hurdles with the SEC. That clarity has reignited institutional interest, making XRP one of the few established assets analysts see as capable of a major re-rating. The network’s fast, low-cost transactions and deep global partnerships remain its backbone, but what excites markets now is the potential for ETFs and broader adoption in cross-border finance. XRP is no longer treated as a “maybe” asset; it has moved back into the core discussion of blockchain-based finance, with analysts framing it as a mature play with room for sharp upside. Stellar (XLM) — Parallel Payments Growth Stellar doesn’t command the headlines XRP does, but it often moves in tandem with the Ripple-linked digital asset. Analysts routinely place it in the “next seven” for ROI growth because of its role in remittances and NGO-driven adoption. Its steady partnerships with financial institutions give it a more understated but resilient profile. For investors, Stellar is seen as a hedge within the payments narrative: less speculative than MAGACOIN FINANCE, less institutionally dominant than XRP, but positioned to rise if adoption accelerates across the sector. The Wider Top Seven The 2025 analyst shortlists don’t stop at MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Stellar. Four other altcoins — Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, and Dogecoin — are consistently highlighted as part of the group expected to drive ROI growth next year. Together, they provide balance to the list, covering infrastructure, cross-chain connectivity, and retail-driven demand. Solana continues to dominate discussions of scalability. The network’s low fees and institutional traction — amplified by the approval of a Solana ETF — make it the growth pick for investors looking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum . Cardano , while slower to develop in past cycles, is regaining attention thanks to ecosystem upgrades and its expanding footprint in DeFi. Chainlink is being recognized as a utility cornerstone. With its oracle services underpinning cross-chain liquidity and DeFi protocols, analysts see it as indispensable infrastructure that should benefit directly from broader blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin retains a place on the list as the retail favorite. Despite lacking the technical depth of the others, its cultural staying power and recurring waves of speculation continue to make it a candidate for outsized returns in bullish markets. Final takeaway By combining these four with the breakout narrative of MAGACOIN FINANCE and the payment-focused growth of XRP and Stellar, analysts argue the “top seven” represents the full spectrum of ROI opportunities — from speculative bets to institutional-grade platforms. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale once dismissed as speculative, presence among these established names in top-seven lists of ROI growth candidates, showing how investor attention is shifting toward projects that blend viral momentum with breakout potential.

On August 22, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively experienced a net outflow of $23.2 million. This marks the sixth consecutive trading day where these investment vehicles have seen more money leaving than entering. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone tracking the digital asset landscape. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Outflows Data from Farside Investors reveals that the combined net outflow for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $23.2 million on August 22. This trend of negative flows has persisted for nearly a week, prompting discussions among market observers. However, a closer look at individual fund performances offers a more nuanced picture of these Bitcoin ETF outflows . Delving into the specifics, individual ETF performances varied: BlackRock’s IBIT recorded the largest outflow, seeing $198.8 million depart. Conversely, ARK Invest’s ARKB attracted the highest net inflow at $65.7 million. Fidelity’s FBTC also saw positive movement, bringing in $50.9 million. Valkyrie’s HODL added $26.4 million. Franklin’s EZBC received $13.5 million. Bitwise’s BITB gained $12.7 million. Other ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day. These figures highlight a dynamic environment where investor sentiment can shift quickly, influencing the flow of capital in and out of these popular Bitcoin investment products. What Do These Bitcoin ETF Outflows Signify? While a $23.2 million net outflow might seem significant, it is important to place these Bitcoin ETF outflows in a broader context. Such movements are a normal part of market cycles, especially in a volatile asset class like cryptocurrency. Investors often engage in profit-taking after periods of growth or rebalance their portfolios based on wider economic indicators. For instance, the substantial outflow from BlackRock’s IBIT could be attributed to various factors, including large institutional investors adjusting their positions. However, the simultaneous inflows into other major ETFs like ARKB and FBTC suggest that capital is not necessarily leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem entirely, but rather reallocating among different providers or strategies. This indicates a nuanced market rather than a wholesale rejection of Bitcoin as an asset. Navigating Bitcoin ETF Outflows: An Investor’s Perspective For investors, understanding these daily fluctuations is key, but maintaining a long-term perspective is even more critical. Short-term Bitcoin ETF outflows can create temporary price pressures, yet the fundamental adoption and technological advancements of Bitcoin continue to evolve. Therefore, hasty reactions based on daily figures might overlook the bigger picture. Here are some actionable insights for navigating the current market: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on broader market trends, macroeconomic data, and regulatory news that could influence ETF flows. Diversify: Consider a diversified portfolio that isn’t solely reliant on a single asset or investment vehicle. Long-Term Vision: Focus on Bitcoin’s long-term potential and use short-term dips as potential entry points, rather than reacting impulsively to daily figures. Consult Experts: Before making significant investment decisions, consider seeking advice from financial professionals. Ultimately, these daily net flows are snapshots of a constantly moving market. They provide valuable data points but should be interpreted as part of a larger, ongoing narrative of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. In conclusion, the recent $23.2 million in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 22 represents a temporary dip in investor capital for some funds, while others saw robust inflows. This dynamic reflects the natural ebb and flow of market sentiment and portfolio adjustments. Rather than signaling a fundamental shift, these movements underscore the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investments and the importance of a balanced, informed approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency itself. They trade on traditional stock exchanges. 2. What caused the $23.2 million in Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 22? The outflows on August 22 were a net figure, meaning total withdrawals exceeded total deposits across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. While specific reasons vary, common factors include profit-taking by investors, portfolio rebalancing, or broader market sentiment shifts. 3. Is this a negative sign for Bitcoin’s future? Not necessarily. Daily or short-term outflows are a normal part of market dynamics, especially in volatile assets like Bitcoin. The overall trend and long-term adoption are more critical indicators than single-day figures. Inflows into other ETFs on the same day suggest reallocation rather than a complete exit. 4. How do individual ETF performances affect the overall market? Individual ETF performances contribute to the overall net flow. Large outflows from one fund, like BlackRock’s IBIT in this case, can significantly impact the aggregate figure. Conversely, strong inflows into other funds, such as ARK Invest’s ARKB and Fidelity’s FBTC, can offset some of these negative movements, indicating varied investor strategies. 5. What should investors do during periods of Bitcoin ETF outflows? Investors should prioritize staying informed, maintaining a diversified portfolio, and focusing on a long-term investment strategy. Avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations is crucial. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide valuable guidance.

Searching for Next Big Winner While Cardano & XRP Slips Lower,https://nulltx.com/ethereum-whales-next-bets-searching-for-next-big-winner-while-cardano-xrp-slips-lower/,"Large holders of Ethereum are moving their funds as popular coins like Cardano and XRP trend downward. The search for a promising new project is underway, sparking speculation across the market. Attention is turning to where these influential players might invest next, as recent shifts hint at a possible shake-up among top digital assets. Cardano (ADA) Source: TradingView ADA sits between $0.81 and $1.07 after a choppy week. The coin slid 7.55% in 7 days and 5.20% in a month but is still up 10.72% over 6 months. Buyers point to that long-term climb, while sellers highlight the fresh dip. The 10-day average at $0.86 hugs the 100-day at $0.88, showing a flat trend. RSI at 46.13 and Stochastic at 38.29 lean slightly oversold. MACD is a touch below zero, hinting that downward drive is weak and could flip fast. A break over $1.17 would mark a 15% pop and could push ADA toward $1.42, roughly 35% higher. Staying above $0.86 keeps that path open. Dropping under $0.81 risks a slide to $0.66, about 20% down, and in a hard sell-off $0.41, nearly 50% lower. For now the mixed signals suggest sideways action, yet the 6-month rise gives bulls a slight edge for an upward move in the next few weeks. XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP trades between $2.95 and $3.29 after a rough stretch. The token slid 6.96% in 1 week and 19.35% in 1 month, erasing most spring gains. Even so, it still shows an 11.27% rise over 6 months, proving buyers did not flee for good. Momentum hints at a pause. Price sits a shade above the 10-day average of $2.86 and almost level with the 100-day line at $2.94. RSI at 44.3 is neutral, while a 27.99 stochastic leans oversold. The MACD is a hair below zero, echoing the recent dip but not flashing panic. Traders now watch $3.49. A clean break could lift XRP by roughly 8% toward $3.84, the next ceiling, and that would leave the monthly chart looking steadier. Failure to clear $3.49 opens room for a drop to $2.80, about 5% lower, and a deeper slide to $2.46 would shave nearly 16% off today’s level. Until either line cracks, expect tight, choppy moves.

This significant event marks the second consecutive day of positive flows, signaling robust investor interest in Ethereum-backed exchange-traded funds. According to data from Farside Investors, this impressive performance underscores a growing trend in institutional adoption of digital assets. Which Spot Ethereum ETFs Led the Charge? On August 22, several key players in the ETF space saw substantial capital inflows, demonstrating strong market confidence. These figures highlight the immediate impact of these new investment vehicles, making it easier for investors to access Ethereum. Fidelity’s FETH: Led the pack with a substantial $117.9 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA: Followed closely, attracting an impressive $109.4 million . Grayscale’s ETHE: Saw significant interest with $45.9 million in inflows. Bitwise’s ETHW: Recorded strong participation, bringing in $36.3 million . Grayscale’s ETH: Added another $22.7 million to the total. Franklin Templeton’s EZET: Contributed $5.5 million , rounding out the top performers. The remaining spot Ethereum ETFs reported no change in their holdings. This concentration suggests investors are actively choosing established providers for their Ethereum exposure, highlighting trust in these specific funds. What Drives the Momentum Behind Spot Ethereum ETFs? The consistent positive inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs are not random; they reflect several underlying factors shaping the cryptocurrency market. Investors are increasingly seeking regulated and accessible ways to gain exposure to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Moreover, the approval of these ETFs provides a new layer of legitimacy and accessibility. These vehicles simplify the investment process, removing complexities like setting up wallets. Therefore, the convenience and regulatory oversight offered by these ETFs are powerful attractants for a broader investor base. The Broader Impact of Growing Spot Ethereum ETF Adoption The rising popularity of spot Ethereum ETFs carries significant implications for both the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader financial landscape. Increased inflows translate into greater liquidity for the underlying asset, potentially stabilizing its price and reducing volatility in the long term. Furthermore, the success of these ETFs can pave the way for more innovative crypto-backed financial products. This trend signifies a maturation of the digital asset market, moving from speculative trading to more structured investment opportunities. However, market volatility remains a factor, and investors should always conduct thorough due diligence. What’s Next for Spot Ethereum ETFs and the Crypto Market? The impressive inflows on August 22 suggest a strong appetite for regulated Ethereum investment products. This positive momentum could lead to further capital allocation into these funds, potentially driving up demand for Ethereum itself. Market observers will closely watch for continued trends and regulatory developments. As institutional interest deepens, we might see even greater integration of digital assets into traditional financial portfolios. The success of spot Ethereum ETFs serves as a powerful indicator of this evolving financial landscape, highlighting Ethereum’s growing importance as a mainstream asset class. Concluding Thoughts: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The substantial $337.7 million net inflow into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 22 marks a pivotal moment. It showcases strong investor confidence and the increasing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as a viable investment. This positive trend not only benefits the ETF providers but also solidifies Ethereum’s position in the global financial ecosystem. These products offer a simplified and secure gateway for investors to participate in the exciting world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs?

Cardano, Avalanche, and presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing growing attention, with analysts pointing to major upside potential in the months ahead. Cardano Shows Signs of Long-Term Recovery Cardano (ADA) has been strongly rebounding this year after spending most of 2024 consolidating under $0.70. Cardano is trading around $0.88, an upward trend driven by rising developer activity and institutional inflows. The blockchain is now among the largest Layer 1 networks by active wallets and is gaining new partners across DeFi, identity management and enterprise solutions. According to analysts, Cardano (ADA) price may rally towards $1.50 by late 2025 on the back of surging institution demand. Resistance levels sit at $0.97 and $1.03. According to experts, breaking above those zones could see ADA price heading towards $1.50 by late 2025. With the forthcoming ETF cycle likely to spur institutional demand for proof-of-stake assets, Cardano is firmly situated amongst the best cryptos to accumulate before the next rally. Avalanche Benefits From Growing Institutional Adoption Investors are looking for ETF-associated catalysts for Avalanche(AVAX). Currently priced at $23, AVAX offers technical support and is gaining acceptance in real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation, making it mainstream. On Avalanche, the tokenized hedge funds’ institutional product has surpassed $300 million. Moreover, RWAs are $188 million. Google Trends data shows that retail searches for AVAX have surged, indicating that instituational and retail demand could be converging for a breakout. The level of resistance is at $27, with bullish setups starting to point to a move towards $32 or even $37. ETF narratives could also help bitcoin rally, with the expectation of crypto-friendly candidates. According to a report, analysts consider Avalanche one of the most strategic assets to hold due to its speed, scalability, and widespread adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned as the Breakout Play While Cardano and Avalanche are clear beneficiaries of the ETF buzz, analysts say the real early adopter opportunity lies with MAGACOIN FINANCE. Backed by whale inflows and forecasts of 40x upside, it’s being ranked as one of the 5 best cryptos to buy now . Early buyers using PATRIOT50X unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are disappearing quickly. The project has been gaining momentum not just for its capped tokenomics and verified audits but also for its unique positioning as a politically charged, community-owned ecosystem. Whale-backed demand has already created scarcity in the presale, with analysts suggesting this could mirror the early growth phases of meme coins that later achieved multi-billion-dollar valuations. With attention shifting toward 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a strategic presale bet with asymmetric upside. Conclusion: Accumulation Before the Next Wave Cardano and Avalanche are both decent Layer 1 options. They boast growing adoption and institutional interest. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE can provide a much bigger opportunity. Analysts are predicting a 40x return as whales are also coming in for it. For this reason, many experts are recommending it as one of the best cryptos to buy before the bull run of 2025.

Ethereum (ETH) has once again captured the crypto world’s attention. For the first time ever, the total ETH futures open interest across major global crypto exchanges soared past an astonishing $70 billion on August 23rd, according to CoinGlass data. This monumental achievement signals a significant milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency, reflecting growing confidence and market participation. What’s Driving This Unprecedented ETH Futures Open Interest? The surge in ETH futures open interest isn’t just a random event; it’s a clear indicator of heightened market activity and strategic positioning by major players. Binance, a leading global exchange, accounted for a substantial $14.15 billion of this total, demonstrating its dominant role in the derivatives market. Close behind was CME, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, contributing an impressive $10.27 billion. This leadership from both a crypto-native giant and a traditional financial powerhouse underscores a broad-based interest. Moreover, this record-breaking futures activity coincided perfectly with ETH reaching an all-time high earlier on the same day. It also followed continued institutional inflows into U.S. spot ETH ETFs on August 22nd. These factors collectively fueled the surge, painting a picture of a robust and maturing market. The Significance of $70 Billion: Why Does It Matter for Ethereum? Reaching $70 billion in ETH futures open interest is more than just a large number; it signifies several critical aspects for Ethereum. Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts that have not yet been settled. A high open interest often indicates: Strong Market Confidence: Traders and institutions are actively taking positions, suggesting conviction in Ethereum’s future price trajectory. Increased Liquidity: More contracts mean a more liquid market, making it easier for large players to enter and exit positions without significant price impact. Growing Institutional Adoption: The substantial contribution from CME, a regulated traditional finance exchange, highlights increasing institutional engagement with Ethereum. This level of activity suggests that sophisticated investors are increasingly viewing Ethereum as a serious asset class, worthy of significant capital allocation. Institutional Powerhouses: Binance, CME, and Spot ETH ETFs The roles of Binance and CME cannot be overstated in this narrative. Binance’s significant share reflects the vast retail and crypto-native institutional participation. Meanwhile, CME’s strong showing underscores the expanding bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. The timing of this surge, immediately after continued inflows into U.S. spot ETH ETFs, is particularly telling. Spot ETFs provide a regulated and accessible avenue for institutional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset. As more institutions commit capital to these ETFs, it often creates a ripple effect, increasing demand and activity in related derivatives markets like futures. This symbiotic relationship between spot and futures markets is a key driver for Ethereum’s current momentum. Navigating the Future: What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Price? At the time of publication, ETH was trading at $4,752.82, showing a remarkable 10.81% increase in the past day. This price action, alongside the soaring ETH futures open interest , points towards strong bullish sentiment. Potential for Continued Growth: High open interest can precede significant price movements. If sentiment remains positive, further upward pressure on ETH’s price is possible. Increased Volatility: While bullish, a highly active futures market can also lead to increased volatility. Traders should remain cautious. Long-Term Validation: The sustained interest from institutional players, as evidenced by both futures and ETF inflows, provides long-term validation for Ethereum’s ecosystem and its role in the decentralized economy. Investors and enthusiasts are closely watching to see how this unprecedented level of interest translates into Ethereum’s broader market performance. The historic climb of ETH futures open interest past the $70 billion mark is a powerful testament to Ethereum’s growing prominence and the increasing maturity of the crypto derivatives market. Driven by key exchanges like Binance and CME, alongside robust institutional engagement through spot ETFs, Ethereum is clearly charting a course towards new heights. This milestone not only reflects current market enthusiasm but also sets a compelling precedent for future institutional adoption and sustained growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ETH futures open interest? A: ETH futures open interest refers to the total number of outstanding Ethereum futures contracts that have not yet been settled or closed. It’s a key indicator of market sentiment and liquidity. Q2: Why is $70 billion a significant milestone for Ethereum? A: Reaching $70 billion signifies unprecedented market confidence, increased liquidity, and growing institutional adoption for Ethereum, indicating its maturing status as a serious asset class. Q3: Which exchanges are leading the surge in ETH futures open interest? A: Binance and CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) are the primary exchanges leading this surge, accounting for the largest portions of the $70 billion total. Q4: How do institutional inflows into spot ETH ETFs relate to futures open interest? A: Institutional inflows into spot ETH ETFs provide regulated exposure to Ethereum, often creating a ripple effect that increases demand and activity in related derivatives markets like futures, as institutions seek to hedge or amplify positions. Q5: What could this mean for Ethereum’s price in the short term? A: High open interest, especially when coupled with strong price performance, often indicates bullish sentiment and potential for continued growth. However, it can also lead to increased market volatility. Did you find this analysis of the surging ETH futures open interest insightful?

This surprising departure, closely following other senior officials, raises important questions about the future of crypto tax enforcement and regulation in the United States. Why is the IRS Crypto Chief’s Departure So Crucial? Trish Turner’s swift exit from her role as the head of the IRS cryptocurrency division is more than just a personnel change; it signals potential shifts in how the agency approaches digital asset taxation. Her resignation, reported by CoinDesk, comes amidst a period of increasing scrutiny on cryptocurrency holdings and transactions. This development is particularly notable because it follows the departure of two other senior officials from the same division, creating a leadership void at a critical time for crypto tax policy. These exits are reportedly linked to budget cuts under the previous U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Such financial constraints can severely impact an agency’s ability to effectively staff and execute its mandate. Especially in complex and rapidly evolving areas like cryptocurrency, the challenges faced by the IRS in retaining top talent could have ripple effects on its capacity to manage the growing volume of crypto-related inquiries and filings. Understanding the Impact on Crypto Tax Compliance The IRS anticipates a significant rise in cryptocurrency-related inquiries and filings. This trend underscores the increasing mainstream adoption of digital assets and the corresponding need for clear guidance on crypto tax obligations. When key personnel, especially those leading specialized divisions, depart, it can create uncertainty. For taxpayers, this might mean a slower response to questions or less consistent enforcement as the agency navigates these internal changes. Moreover, the experience and expertise of officials like Turner are invaluable in developing robust tax frameworks for a nascent industry. Her departure could potentially delay the implementation of new policies or the clarification of existing ones. This leaves both individuals and businesses in a state of ambiguity regarding their compliance requirements. It highlights the ongoing struggle for traditional regulatory bodies to keep pace with technological innovation. Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto Tax Regulation The challenges facing the IRS in regulating cryptocurrency are multifaceted. On one hand, the decentralized nature of digital assets and the global reach of the crypto market make traditional enforcement difficult. On the other hand, the sheer volume of transactions and the variety of crypto assets demand a sophisticated and well-resourced approach. The recent departures, particularly that of the IRS crypto chief , underscore these internal pressures. However, every challenge presents an opportunity. The evolving landscape might encourage the IRS to explore new technologies or partnerships to enhance its enforcement capabilities. Furthermore, the increased public awareness surrounding crypto taxation could lead to greater calls for clearer, more streamlined regulations. This could ultimately benefit taxpayers by reducing complexity and improving compliance rates. What This Means for Your Crypto Tax Obligations For individual crypto holders and businesses, the underlying obligation to report cryptocurrency gains and losses remains unchanged. Regardless of leadership changes at the IRS, the agency continues to view virtual currency as property for tax purposes. Therefore, it is absolutely essential to maintain meticulous records of all your crypto transactions, including purchases, sales, trades, and any income received from staking or mining. Trish Turner’s next steps offer an interesting insight into the private sector’s role in this space. She is expected to join private crypto tax firms, specifically serving as tax director at CryptoTaxGirl and working with U.K.-based Asset Reality. This move suggests a growing demand for specialized crypto tax expertise outside of government, providing new resources for individuals and companies seeking professional guidance. It also shows the fluidity of talent between public service and the private sector in this niche area. The resignation of the IRS crypto chief, Trish Turner, marks a significant moment for cryptocurrency taxation. While it highlights internal challenges and budget constraints within the IRS, it also underscores the growing importance of the private sector in providing expert crypto tax guidance. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, staying informed and compliant with your tax obligations remains paramount. The need for clear, actionable advice on digital asset taxation is more critical than ever. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Tax Who is Trish Turner and why did she resign from the IRS?

The departure of key personnel like Trish Turner could create uncertainty and potentially slow down the IRS’s ability to develop and enforce clear crypto tax policies.

A bold Ethereum price prediction from Monarq Asset Management’s CIO, Sam Gaer, suggests that ETH is on the verge of an incredible breakthrough. He anticipates Ethereum could soon soar past the $5,000 mark. This optimistic outlook comes as a direct response to recent economic shifts and growing market confidence. Ethereum Price Prediction: The $5K Target in Sight Monarq CIO Sam Gaer’s analysis points to a significant rally for Ethereum (ETH). His confidence stems from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium. Powell’s comments have significantly bolstered expectations for a September interest rate cut. A rate cut typically makes traditional investments less attractive, prompting investors to seek higher returns in assets like cryptocurrencies. This shift in monetary policy acts as a powerful tailwind for the crypto market. It suggests a more accommodating economic environment. Consequently, investors are now more willing to allocate capital into riskier, yet potentially more rewarding, assets. Gaer believes this environment is perfect for a substantial Ethereum price prediction to materialize. What’s Fueling This Ethereum Price Prediction Surge? Beyond the macroeconomic factors, several elements are contributing to ETH’s strong position. Sam Gaer highlights that both Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH are poised for new highs. Crucially, he sees no immediate signs of overheating in the market. This indicates sustainable growth rather than a speculative bubble. Here are the key drivers: Strong Institutional Inflows: Large financial institutions are increasingly investing in Ethereum. This signifies growing mainstream acceptance and provides significant capital backing. Options Market Signals: Data from the options market reveals a bullish sentiment specifically favoring ETH. Traders are betting on higher prices, indicating strong confidence in its future performance. Bitcoin’s Stability: Bitcoin’s robust performance often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. Its current strength provides a stable foundation for altcoins like Ethereum to thrive. These combined factors create a compelling case for Gaer’s ambitious Ethereum price prediction . Navigating the Crypto Rally: Insights and Opportunities As the crypto market gears up for what could be a historic rally, understanding the landscape is crucial. Investors and enthusiasts alike are looking for actionable insights. The potential for ETH to break $5,000 presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges typical of volatile markets. Consider these points as you navigate the current market: Potential for Significant Gains: If the Ethereum price prediction holds true, early investors could see substantial returns. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem and ongoing developments continue to attract innovation. Market Volatility: Despite bullish signals, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. Prices can fluctuate rapidly based on news, sentiment, and unexpected events. Risk Management: It is always wise to invest only what you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio and setting clear investment goals are essential strategies. Staying informed about economic indicators and crypto-specific news will empower you to make more informed decisions. The Road Ahead for Ethereum: A Compelling Outlook The outlook for Ethereum appears incredibly promising, with Monarq CIO Sam Gaer leading the charge with a bold Ethereum price prediction . The convergence of a dovish Federal Reserve, robust institutional interest, and positive options market signals paints a clear picture of potential upward momentum. While the path to $5,000 may encounter its usual market fluctuations, the underlying fundamentals and external catalysts suggest a strong trajectory. This potential breakthrough is not just about a price target; it reflects Ethereum’s growing importance in the digital economy. As its utility expands across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions, its value proposition strengthens. The coming months could indeed mark a pivotal period for ETH, solidifying its position as a leading digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “dovish shift” and how does it affect crypto? A dovish shift refers to a central bank’s policy stance favoring lower interest rates and economic stimulus. This typically makes traditional investments less appealing, encouraging investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, thus potentially boosting their prices. Q2: Who is Sam Gaer and what is his prediction for ETH? Sam Gaer is the CIO (Chief Investment Officer) of Monarq Asset Management. He predicts that Ethereum (ETH) is poised to surpass the $5,000 mark, driven by macroeconomic factors and strong market signals. Q3: What are the main factors supporting ETH’s potential rally to $5K? Key factors include U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks hinting at a September rate cut, strong institutional inflows into crypto, and bullish signals from the options market favoring Ethereum. Q4: Is it safe to invest in Ethereum now given this prediction? While the Ethereum price prediction is optimistic, all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks due to market volatility. It’s crucial to conduct your own research, invest only what you can afford to lose, and consider diversifying your portfolio. Q5: What is the significance of the $5,000 price target for ETH? Breaking the $5,000 mark would represent a significant psychological and technical milestone for Ethereum, potentially signaling strong bullish momentum and renewed investor confidence, possibly leading to further price discovery.

50529341,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79785,1755931396,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says XRP Price Breakout Incoming. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-price-breakout-incoming-heres-why/,"A recent chart shared by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) highlighted XRP’s price compressing into a well-defined structure on the daily timeframe. The post suggested that a massive breakout is coming, with XRP trading within a symmetrical triangle, and following a five-wave Elliott Wave pattern that could increase its momentum once it breaks out of the triangle. The Setup on the Chart The symmetrical triangle began forming in July after XRP reached a new all-time high . Within this symmetrical triangle, it followed a well-defined five-wave structure, with successive highs stepping lower while lows higher, which compresses the range as candles respect both boundaries. The starting point of wave E sits close to the apex in early September. This shows that the sequence has matured and that volatility may expand as the symmetrical triangle approaches resolution. #XRP BREAKOUT INCOMING !!! pic.twitter.com/NwcXoDfmHk — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 21, 2025 What the Projection Suggests From the area around E, a green arrow projects an upward resolution. The arrow rises from the triangle’s tip toward the upper portion of the price scale, settling around the $4.5 target. This visual conveys the analyst’s expectation for a decisive move after consolidation. The chart does not provide an explicit target or date beyond the scale, but the direction and placement of the arrow suggest a climb to a new all-time high for the digital asset. Why the Pattern Matters Triangles on the daily timeframe can help identify control areas between buyers and sellers. In this case, the combination of lower highs and higher lows defines a structured contraction that progressed over several weeks. The strong advance that led into the pattern supports the case for continuation, yet confirmation remains necessary. A firm break and daily close above the upper dotted boundary would validate the scenario shown in the post. While a decisive loss of the lower support boundary would negate the setup and reset expectations, it would extend the consolidation phase and potentially send the asset’s price down. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? Two practical points follow from the chart. First, the structure looks mature, as XRP is entering the final wave in the Elliott Wave sequence. Second, the post implies action on a breakout rather than within the range. XRP is currently trading at $2.83, showing similar bearish momentum to the broader market. However, this decline should be short-lived if the asset can follow the path outlined by Steph.

The wipeout was part of $769 million liquidated marketwide, with over 183,000 traders forced out of positions. The single biggest hit was a $10 million ETH swap order on OKX, an unusually high figure for the token, which is often second to bitcoin-based positions. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. The move came as ether surged almost 15% to a record $4,885 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested rate cuts could arrive in September. Bitcoin lagged with a 4% gain to $113,000, while the CoinDesk 20 Index climbed 9%. Analysts say the rally isn’t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street’s preferred blockchain. “Ether’s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,” said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk. “I would expect ETH to surpass $10k once we start to see stablecoin solutions being implemented for payments within the U.S.” That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts.

Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is on the verge of proposing a monumental Japan crypto tax overhaul. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine how cryptocurrency gains are treated, bringing significant relief and clarity to investors and fostering a new era for digital assets. What’s Sparking This Revolutionary Japan Crypto Tax Reform? The FSA is actively working to include comprehensive cryptocurrency tax reform in its 2026 tax revision proposal. This initiative, initially reported by BeInCrypto and local outlet Nikkei, aims to streamline the taxation process while introducing stricter regulations. The ultimate goal is to foster a more robust and secure environment for digital assets, potentially even paving the way for crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Currently, crypto gains in Japan face a steep hurdle. They are categorized as “miscellaneous income,” subjecting them to progressive tax rates that can soar above 50% once local taxes are factored in. Imagine earning substantial profits only to see more than half disappear into taxes! This punitive structure has often been cited as a significant disincentive for both individual and institutional investors, hindering the growth of the local crypto market. How Will the New Japan Crypto Tax Structure Work? The FSA’s proposal seeks to fundamentally shift this paradigm. They intend to recommend moving cryptocurrency from this “miscellaneous income” category to the same tax treatment as equities. This means a separate, flat tax rate of 20% would apply. This change offers a dramatic reduction in potential tax liabilities for many investors, making crypto investments significantly more attractive and predictable. This isn’t merely about tax rates; it’s about a fundamental reclassification. The agency also plans to reclassify crypto as a financial product. This seemingly technical change has profound implications: Enhanced Investor Protections: Treating crypto as a financial product brings it under the umbrella of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. This means stronger safeguards for investors, similar to those enjoyed by stock market participants, offering a much-needed layer of security. Clear Disclosure Requirements: Companies and platforms dealing with crypto would be subject to more stringent disclosure rules, increasing transparency and accountability across the industry. Level Playing Field: It aligns crypto with traditional financial assets, potentially reducing regulatory ambiguity and fostering greater trust among both seasoned and new investors. Unlocking Potential: Benefits of the Japan Crypto Tax Overhaul The proposed Japan crypto tax changes could unlock a wave of positive developments for the nation’s digital asset ecosystem. Lower and predictable tax rates are a powerful incentive for both retail and institutional capital. When investors know their potential returns won’t be eroded by exorbitant taxes, they are more likely to engage with the market, leading to increased liquidity and innovation. Moreover, the reclassification of crypto as a financial product could accelerate the approval of crypto ETFs. These investment vehicles allow traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding them, potentially bringing billions of dollars into the market. This institutional adoption could further legitimize the asset class and drive mainstream acceptance. The clarity provided by a flat tax rate also simplifies compliance for businesses operating in the crypto space, encouraging more innovation and entrepreneurship. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Japan Crypto Tax Reform? While the FSA’s intentions are clear and largely positive, this proposal is still in its early stages. It needs to navigate the complex legislative process, including gaining approval from the ruling party and passing through parliament. The target for implementation is the 2026 tax revision, meaning there’s still a journey ahead before these changes become law. Stakeholder consultations and potential amendments are also part of the process. However, the clear direction from a key financial regulator is a strong signal of Japan’s commitment to embracing the future of finance responsibly. This proactive approach by Japan could position it as a leader in creating a balanced and supportive environment for digital assets. For crypto enthusiasts and investors worldwide, Japan’s move is a beacon of hope, demonstrating how sensible regulation can foster innovation rather than stifle it. This bold step reflects a growing understanding among global regulators that a clear, fair, and predictable tax framework is essential for the healthy development of the cryptocurrency market. Japan’s leadership in this area could set a precedent for other nations grappling with similar challenges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Japan Crypto Tax What is the current crypto tax rate in Japan? Currently, crypto gains are taxed as “miscellaneous income,” subject to progressive rates that can exceed 50% when local taxes are included. What is the proposed new Japan crypto tax rate? The FSA proposes a flat 20% tax rate, aligning it with how equities are taxed. When is this crypto tax reform expected to take effect? The reform is part of the FSA’s 2026 tax revision proposal, meaning it could be implemented in 2026 if approved. How will reclassifying crypto as a financial product benefit investors? This reclassification will bring crypto under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, offering enhanced investor protections and clearer disclosure requirements, similar to traditional financial assets. Could this reform lead to crypto ETFs in Japan? Yes, reclassifying crypto as a financial product and establishing a clear tax framework could pave the way for the approval and launch of crypto-linked Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in Japan.

Speculation is rising about its potential to outshine its rivals and deliver extraordinary returns during this cycle. Early interest and market whispers hint that this could be the breakout project everyone is searching for. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView SHIB has slipped for three straight periods, down 3.72% over the past week, almost 20% in a month, and just over 20% in six months. Even with that grind lower, the token now trades between $0.00001229 and $0.00001398, almost level with both its 10-day and 100-day averages. This tight band shows traders are pausing after the sell-off. Momentum is mixed. The strength index sits near 49, a middle zone that signals neither clear buying nor selling force. A similar mid-40 reading on the stochastic line echoes that stalemate, while the main trend signal stays a shade negative. Put simply, SHIB lacks a spark, but it is also not collapsing. All eyes turn to $0.00001493, the closest ceiling, and $0.00001155, the floor that has cushioned recent dips. If bulls manage to punch through the first barrier, price could add roughly 15% and test the next ceiling near $0.00001662, taking the six-month slide back into single-digit territory. Failure to defend $0.00001155 would likely drag SHIB about 10% lower, with a deeper slip toward $0.00000986 adding up to a 25% retreat from current levels. Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView Pepe sits near 0.000011 inside a band from $0.0000102173 to $0.0000123633. The coin fell 5.82% in 7 days and 26.60% over a month, trimming the meme buzz. Yet it is still up 8.21% in 6 months, keeping hopes alive for patient holders. The 10-day and 100-day averages meet at about $0.00001045, almost level with the market. This flat line shows a standoff. A momentum reading close to 50 signals neither strong buying nor heavy selling. Shrinking volume hints that traders wait for a clear push. A close above $0.0000135936 could trigger fresh bids, opening the way to $0.0000157396, roughly 20% and 40% above today’s midpoint. Failure to clear that cap risks a slide to $0.0000093016, about 18% lower, with a deeper floor at $0.0000071556, nearly 37% down. Until a breakout, Pepe likely drifts sideways while bulls search for a spark. Current memecoins price prediction models reflect this cautious outlook amid broader market uncertainty. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Conclusion SHIB and PEPE remain solid memes. Yet XYZVerse (XYZ) merges sports passion with meme power, eyeing 20,000% gains as early entrants shape a community-driven GOAT for the 2025 surge.

News Background • The Federal Reserve signaled a softer stance on crypto banking rules, while Wyoming launched the first state-backed stablecoin. Both developments lifted sentiment around digital assets. • Trump-linked entity Thumzup completed a $50 million acquisition of Dogecoin mining firm Dogehash, forming what executives claim is the largest DOGE mining operation. • SoFi became the first U.S. banking institution to integrate Bitcoin’s Lightning Network for remittances, reinforcing broader institutional adoption of crypto infrastructure. • Whale wallets accumulated 680 million DOGE tokens through August, cementing rising institutional flows despite retail-driven volatility. Price Action Summary • DOGE rallied 8% in the Aug. 22–23 session, climbing from $0.22 to $0.24 in a $0.02 range. • The sharpest move came at 14:00 GMT on Aug. 22, when DOGE spiked from $0.21 to $0.23 on 4.27B volume, nearly quadruple the hourly average. • Support now holds at $0.21 after a successful retest, while resistance capped gains at the $0.24 psychological level. • A late-session surge added 1% from $0.23 to $0.24, with a volume peak of 28.1M at 04:52 GMT confirming accumulation. • Price action shows consecutive higher lows, suggesting sustained buying pressure and potential trend continuation. Market Analysis DOGE’s breakout aligns with a broader crypto rebound as risk appetite improved across equities and digital assets. The combination of Fed policy recalibration, state-level stablecoin adoption, and a high-profile mining acquisition amplified institutional participation in a token often viewed as purely retail-driven. The $0.24 level remains a critical inflection point. A sustained breakout could open momentum targets toward $0.26, while failure risks renewed retests of $0.21 support. Technical Indicators • 24-hour gain of 8% from $0.22 to $0.24 with $0.02 trading range. • Volume spiked 97% above 30-day average with 4.27B tokens traded. • Support confirmed at $0.21 following intraday retest. • Resistance hardened at $0.24 psychological threshold. • Consecutive higher lows point to bullish structure. • Volume surge of 28.1M at 04:52 GMT validates institutional flows. What Traders Are Watching • Whether DOGE can establish $0.24 as support for a clean breakout toward $0.26. • Ongoing whale accumulation trends versus potential retail profit-taking at resistance. • Impact of Wyoming’s state-backed stablecoin launch on memecoin liquidity flows. • Futures open interest reaction after heavy spot-driven rally.",Markets|Dogecoin|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-23 07:05:04

Recently, a story emerged that has captivated the crypto community, highlighting both the volatile nature of digital assets and the cunning of those who exploit vulnerabilities. We’re talking about the Radiant Capital hacker , whose audacious move not only siphoned millions but then reportedly doubled their illicit gains through strategic Ethereum (ETH) swing trading. Who is the Radiant Capital Hacker and What Did They Do? In October 2024, the DeFi protocol Radiant Capital (RDNT) suffered a significant blow. An unknown perpetrator executed an exploit, managing to steal a staggering $53 million. This incident sent ripples through the DeFi space, raising concerns about security and the integrity of smart contracts. However, the story didn’t end there. Following the initial breach, the Radiant Capital hacker converted the stolen assets into a substantial amount of Ethereum. On-chain analysis by experts like @EmberCN on X revealed that the hacker acquired approximately 21,900 ETH. They purchased these ETH tokens at an average price of $2,420, essentially parking their ill-gotten gains in one of the market’s most prominent cryptocurrencies. This initial acquisition phase was crucial. It demonstrated a calculated move to consolidate the stolen funds into a liquid and widely accepted asset. Many assumed the funds would simply sit, perhaps awaiting a complex laundering process. However, the hacker had other plans, showcasing a surprising level of market acumen. How Did the Radiant Capital Hacker Double Their Fortune? The plot thickened as the Radiant Capital hacker began to actively manage their stolen ETH holdings. Instead of remaining dormant, the hacker engaged in what appears to be sophisticated ETH swing trading. This strategy involves buying and selling an asset over short to medium timeframes, aiming to profit from price fluctuations. Here’s a breakdown of their reported trading activity, turning $53 million into over $100 million: Initial Acquisition: 21,900 ETH purchased at an average price of $2,420 after the exploit. Liquidation Begins: On August 14, the hacker started liquidating some of their ETH holdings, indicating active market participation. Strategic Buys: Recently, 4,914 ETH were acquired at a higher average price of $4,167, suggesting confidence in an upward trend. Profitable Sales: Just three days later, on August 23, 3,931 ETH were sold at an average price of $4,726. This move converted a significant portion into DAI stablecoins. These calculated moves allowed the Radiant Capital hacker to significantly increase the value of their portfolio. Their current holdings are estimated to be approximately $104 million. This includes a mix of 13,300 ETH and a substantial 42.03 million DAI. This diversification into stablecoins indicates a move to lock in profits and reduce exposure to further ETH price volatility. What Does This Mean for DeFi Security and On-Chain Analysis? This extraordinary case raises critical questions for the decentralized finance ecosystem. It highlights that while exploits are a significant concern, the subsequent actions of attackers can be equally, if not more, impactful. The ability of the Radiant Capital hacker to effectively trade and multiply their illicit gains showcases a new dimension of cybercrime in crypto. On-chain analysts, like @EmberCN, play a crucial role in tracking these movements. Their ability to follow the flow of funds provides invaluable insights into hacker behavior and market dynamics. However, the fact that a hacker can not only steal but also successfully trade stolen assets presents a complex challenge for law enforcement and recovery efforts. It emphasizes the need for continuous innovation in security protocols and forensic tools within the DeFi space. The story of the Radiant Capital hacker is an astonishing reminder of the wild west nature of the crypto world. It’s a tale of a massive exploit followed by an impressive display of trading prowess, turning a $53 million theft into a $104 million fortune. While such incidents are disheartening, they also push the industry to evolve, strengthen its defenses, and enhance its ability to track and potentially recover stolen assets. This event underscores the ongoing battle between security innovation and the relentless pursuit of illicit gains in the ever-expanding DeFi landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What happened to Radiant Capital in October 2024? Radiant Capital, a DeFi protocol, suffered an exploit in October 2024, resulting in the theft of $53 million in assets by a hacker. 2. How did the Radiant Capital hacker manage to double their stolen funds? After the initial theft, the Radiant Capital hacker engaged in strategic Ethereum (ETH) swing trading, buying and selling ETH at opportune times to profit from price fluctuations, effectively doubling their initial illicit gains. 3. What is ETH swing trading? ETH swing trading is a strategy where traders buy and sell Ethereum over short to medium timeframes, aiming to capture profits from price swings rather than long-term holding. 4. What are the current holdings of the Radiant Capital hacker? As of recent reports, the Radiant Capital hacker ‘s holdings are estimated to be approximately $104 million, comprising 13,300 ETH and 42.03 million DAI. 5. What does this incident mean for DeFi security? This incident highlights the dual challenge in DeFi: preventing initial exploits and then tracking/recovering funds from sophisticated attackers who can also trade. It emphasizes the need for stronger security protocols and advanced on-chain forensic tools. The unfolding saga of the Radiant Capital hacker is a compelling narrative that impacts the entire crypto community.

One such forecast comes from Tom Lee, a highly respected figure in finance. He sees a very high probability of ETH surpassing BTC in terms of market capitalization. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a profound insight from a seasoned expert with significant credibility in market analysis. Why Tom Lee Believes in ETH Surpassing BTC Tom Lee, founder of the U.S. research firm Fundstrat and chairman of Nasdaq-listed BitMiner (BMNR), recently shared his compelling perspective during an interview with The Compound, as reported by Benzinga. His vision for Ethereum’s potential dominance is rooted in historical parallels and current market dynamics. Historical Analogy: Lee drew a fascinating comparison to 1971, when the U.S. abandoned the gold standard. While many focused on gold, Wall Street ultimately emerged as the real winner by adapting to the new financial landscape. He suggests a similar shift could happen in crypto. Market Evolution: This analogy implies that while Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the ‘digital gold,’ the market’s focus could shift to assets offering more utility and growth potential, much like traditional finance pivoted from gold to more dynamic investment vehicles. This perspective provides a fresh lens through which to view the ongoing competition between the two largest cryptocurrencies. The Power of Institutional Inflows: Fueling Ethereum’s Rise A key driver behind Lee’s prediction for ETH surpassing BTC is the anticipated influx of institutional capital. He believes that significant investment from Wall Street could dramatically accelerate Ethereum’s growth. 100x Potential: Lee suggests that these institutional inflows could drive ETH to rise by up to 100 times its current value. Such a surge would undeniably position it to flip Bitcoin in market cap. BitMiner’s Strategy: As a testament to this institutional confidence, Lee’s own company, BitMiner, has formalized an ETH accumulation strategy. The firm reportedly holds approximately 1.52 million ETH, making it the largest Ethereum treasury globally. This demonstrates a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term value and its potential for substantial appreciation. The institutional embrace of Ethereum highlights its growing legitimacy and appeal beyond retail investors. This trend is pivotal for its future trajectory. Market Dynamics and Macroeconomic Influences on ETH Recent market events further underscore Ethereum’s momentum, aligning with Tom Lee’s optimistic outlook. The broader economic environment often plays a significant role in cryptocurrency performance. Recent Surge: Ethereum recently surged near all-time highs. This impressive rally followed dovish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell regarding potential September rate cuts. Investor Confidence: Such macroeconomic signals can boost investor confidence in risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Lower interest rates typically make growth-oriented assets more attractive, directly benefiting ETH. Understanding these interconnected factors is crucial for grasping the full scope of why ETH surpassing BTC is seen as a high probability by experts like Tom Lee. What Does an ETH Market Cap Flip Mean for the Crypto Landscape? If Ethereum were to truly surpass Bitcoin’s market capitalization, it would mark a transformative moment for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This scenario has profound implications for investors and the future of digital assets. Evolving Narratives: It would shift the narrative from Bitcoin as the sole ‘digital gold’ to Ethereum as a foundational layer for decentralized applications, NFTs, and a new internet economy. Investment Strategies: Investors might increasingly diversify their portfolios, recognizing Ethereum’s utility and growth potential alongside Bitcoin’s store-of-value proposition. Innovation Focus: A flip could also accelerate innovation on the Ethereum network, attracting even more developers and projects to its robust ecosystem. This potential shift underscores the dynamic and competitive nature of the crypto market, where utility and innovation are increasingly valued. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Ethereum While the prospect of ETH surpassing BTC is exciting, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The path to market dominance is rarely straightforward. Scalability: Ethereum continues to work on scalability solutions, though significant progress has been made with upgrades like the Merge. Further enhancements are vital for mass adoption. Regulatory Clarity: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally will also play a crucial role in Ethereum’s growth and institutional acceptance. Competition: Other smart contract platforms are constantly innovating, presenting competitive pressures that Ethereum must navigate. Despite these hurdles, the opportunities for Ethereum remain immense, especially with its strong community, established ecosystem, and ongoing development. Tom Lee’s prediction that ETH surpassing BTC is a very high probability event offers a compelling glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency. His insights, backed by historical analogies and an understanding of institutional finance, suggest a potential paradigm shift. As Wall Street increasingly embraces digital assets, Ethereum’s utility and robust ecosystem position it uniquely for significant growth. This isn’t just about market cap; it’s about the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape, potentially ushering in a new era where innovation and utility take center stage. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Tom Lee and why is his prediction significant? A1: Tom Lee is the founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a prominent Wall Street research firm, and chairman of BitMiner. His significance comes from his deep expertise in traditional finance and his early, often accurate, insights into the crypto market, lending credibility to his predictions. Q2: What does ‘ETH surpassing BTC’ mean? A2: It means Ethereum’s total market capitalization (price per coin multiplied by circulating supply) would exceed that of Bitcoin. This would signify a major shift in perceived value and dominance within the cryptocurrency market. Q3: How could institutional inflows drive Ethereum’s market cap? A3: Institutional investors manage vast amounts of capital. When they allocate even a small percentage to an asset like Ethereum, it can lead to massive demand, driving up its price and subsequently its market capitalization significantly. Q4: What is the significance of the 1971 gold standard analogy? A4: Lee uses this analogy to suggest a historical precedent where a dominant asset (gold) was eventually overshadowed by more dynamic financial instruments (Wall Street investments). He implies a similar shift could occur from Bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ status to Ethereum’s utility-driven ecosystem. Q5: What factors, besides institutional money, could contribute to ETH’s rise? A5: Beyond institutional inflows, factors include Ethereum’s continuous technological upgrades (like the Merge), its vibrant ecosystem of dApps and NFTs, increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), and favorable macroeconomic conditions such as potential interest rate cuts. Q6: Is BitMiner’s ETH accumulation strategy unique? A6: While other entities hold ETH, BitMiner’s reported 1.52 million ETH makes it the largest corporate Ethereum treasury globally. This significant holding demonstrates a strong, formalized institutional belief in Ethereum’s long-term value and potential for market leadership. Did you find this analysis insightful?

A Crypto Market Outlook for the Rest of 2025,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/are-we-in-a-bear-market-a-crypto-market-outlook-for-the-rest-of-2025/,"The crypto market is standing at the foot of a crossroads, as the lingering question is whether this market is still in the bear market or whether the current turmoil is just the beginning of a new bull market. Earlier in the year, Bitcoin and most other major indexes suffered a sharp decline. Yet that they rallied to new all-time highs shows the resiliency of the asset class. In this regard, one of the surveys carried out by the Investopedia indicates that nearly two-thirds of the retail investors can be deemed as optimistic . The said degree of confidence is anchored firmly on strong corporate portfolios and the capacity of the economy. Almost on par with consumer support is institutional backing of Bitcoin. The SEC move to legalize the spot bitcoin ETFs has catalyzed the rise in prices and liquidity in the international market. This does not only help Bitcoin but the crypto market at large. Given that crypto is now thoroughly integrated into mainstream finance—a fact demonstrated by a series of high-profile IPOs and the growing trend of companies establishing digital asset reserves—the overarching narrative continues to lean much more bullish than bearish. Market Signals & Interpretation Despite those shorter-lived downward infusions that, technically, qualified as being in bear territory, i.e., down sharply more than 20%, the overall situation has been quite murky. The strong economy and much cash to move into the ETFs have played a huge role in giving rise to Bitcoin. Money is pouring into the market, small cash is bullish, and the future is bright with the new guidelines of cryptos in the U.S. A lot of news about money talks about how popular initial coin offerings (ICOs) are and how many companies hold crypto. Plus, over 135 public companies now name Bitcoin as a backup asset on their balance sheets. This shows that Bitcoin is becoming more prominent. Also, good news like the proposed Genius Act and state rules that back it up is making people trust organizations even more. This makes people even more sure that crypto is a safe way to handle money. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an excellent opportunity that is becoming extremely relevant in this complex and dynamic world. Customers can already find Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP very expensive, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its infancy and this aspect aligns with the way organizations are evolving. The clever money is investing more of its money in MAGACOIN FINANCE now as money is on the move. The phases of this presale of the project were sold quickly since they were restricted in number. That indicates that demand was excessive long before any typical cyclical surges enjoyed their start. It is the politically charged branding and community that makes MAGACOIN stand out the most, as its history follows a similar pattern of powerful cultural trends of power. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an isolated case in the industry where the attitude towards promotion is rational, with the frequency of its usage sufficiently high to end up with development. Broader Market Context From a macro standpoint, even traditional markets are holding onto a fragile sort of optimism. Sure, U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies are climbing, but you can’t ignore the nagging worries about core producer prices and this stubborn inflation that just won’t quit—it’s all still very much on everyone’s radar. Taking a macro view, even ordinary markets are showing some sort of insecure faith. Despite the rising stocks and cryptocurrency, people remain worried about the core producer prices and inflation that is not declining. Simultaneously, an increasingly symbiotic relationship between crypto and traditional banking, such as with the emergence of new crypto-linked loans at JPMorgan or concurring changes regarding the government digital asset strategy, inevitably begs the question as to what may be systemic failure points, despite what may seem to be a robust performance in the market at this present time. Nonetheless, the majority of analysts are still saying that the bear market has not really started. An example for illustration is that PlanB and other popular predictive applications maintain to prophesy consistent tracking of Bitcoin strengthening through long-term period windows. Even business leaders are saying that the market is experiencing temporary and macro-caused corrections rather than long-term business-cycle decline. Conclusion: A Transitional Phase In a nutshell, although 2025 has already had periods of significant technical drawdown, all the prevailing indicators—healthy fund tracking products and fees, rapidly advancing institutional scaling, proactive regulation, and intense initial public offering activity are working in favor of this not being a traditional bear market. The current market situation can be characterized as one of transition, and there are indications that the market could harbor the entrance of so many people in the market and could also expand over the long term. The market stands at a crossroads, and it is a good time to make a purchase by buyers who love planning in advance. These developments are providing space to new ideas to emerge. Its concept of core scarcity, the entire politically motivated brand built around it, and the accumulation of major players before the era of mass usage of the given concept even commences is a definite strength of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Once the market turns again in the other direction, such pre-sale tokens with their appealing narrative and sound fundamentals may have a strong head start ahead of the older and already tired projects.

According to the filing filed today, the proposed VanEck JitoSOL ETF aims to track the price of the liquid staking token (LST) JitoSOL. JitoSOL is a tokenized version of staked SOL, allowing users to maintain the value of their staked assets while still earning on-chain rewards. This allows investors to generate returns and use their assets in DeFi applications without locking them up. The Jito Foundation announced in a statement that the fund will be “the first spot Solana ETF backed by 100% liquid staking tokens.” Unlike traditional staking, liquid staking provides a tradable token in exchange for the staked asset, offering investors both liquidity and returns. Related News: Ethereum Soars to New Heights: Historic Moments Unfold - ATH on the Horizon - Here's Why and the Current Situation Alongside the filing, the Jito Foundation announced that it has been in intensive discussions with the SEC and other authorities in recent months. Jito Labs CEO Lucas Bruder and Legal Director Rebecca Rettig previously met with the SEC's Crypto Task Force to discuss how staking and re-staking mechanisms could be implemented in ETFs. The SEC previously clarified that proof-of-stake-based staking activities would not be considered securities transactions and that certain liquid staking activities would not qualify as securities. The Jito Foundation stated that following this guidance, the “compliance process for LST-based ETFs and ETPs has become clear and applicable.” Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett commented on the development: “Look at how far we’ve come in just one year; Wall Street giants like VanEck and regulators like the SEC are now considering liquid staking token-backed ETFs.” *This is not investment advice.

One powerful metric that offers a direct glimpse into trader sentiment is the Bitcoin long-short ratio . This vital indicator helps us see whether more traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price going up or down. Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour data to decode what the market is truly thinking and how these ratios can empower your trading decisions. What Are Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios, Anyway? Before we dissect the numbers, let’s clarify what Bitcoin long-short ratios represent. Essentially, this ratio compares the number of ‘long’ positions (bets that the price will increase) to ‘short’ positions (bets that the price will decrease) on perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading. When the long percentage is higher, it suggests a more bullish sentiment among traders. Conversely, a higher short percentage points towards a bearish outlook. Monitoring these ratios across various exchanges provides a comprehensive view of overall market positioning and potential directional biases, offering a window into collective trader psychology. Unpacking the Latest 24-Hour Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios Over the past 24 hours, the collective sentiment across major cryptocurrency exchanges shows a finely balanced, almost neutral, positioning. Here’s a breakdown of the Bitcoin long-short ratios : Total Market Overview: Long 49.82%, Short 50.18% This overall figure indicates a slight lean towards short positions, suggesting a cautious or slightly bearish sentiment in the broader market. However, a closer look at individual exchanges reveals some interesting variations: Binance: Long 49.53%, Short 50.47% – Binance traders show a clear lean towards short positions, slightly more bearish than the overall market. Bybit: Long 50.19%, Short 49.81% – In contrast, Bybit users exhibit a slightly bullish bias, with long positions marginally outnumbering shorts. Gate.io: Long 49.68%, Short 50.32% – Similar to Binance, Gate.io traders are leaning bearish, though less pronounced than Binance. These disparities highlight how sentiment can vary even among leading platforms. Therefore, a holistic view of Bitcoin long-short ratios is essential for a complete picture of market dynamics. What Do These Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios Mean for Traders? Analyzing these ratios offers actionable insights for savvy traders. Understanding the prevailing sentiment can help you anticipate potential market movements. When the market is heavily skewed in one direction, it often sets the stage for a ‘squeeze’ – a rapid price movement in the opposite direction as traders are forced to cover their positions. Identifying Overextension: A significantly high long ratio might suggest an overextended bullish sentiment, potentially leading to a long squeeze if prices drop. Conversely, an extreme short ratio could precede a short squeeze. Confirming Trends: If the Bitcoin long-short ratio aligns with a current price trend, it can confirm the strength of that trend. For instance, an increasing long ratio during an uptrend suggests strong conviction among buyers. Spotting Divergences: Sometimes, the ratio might diverge from price action. If the price is rising but the long ratio is decreasing, it could signal weakening conviction among buyers, potentially indicating a trend reversal. It is important to remember that these ratios are just one piece of the puzzle. They work best when combined with other technical and fundamental analysis tools to form a comprehensive trading strategy. Navigating the Nuances of Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios While invaluable, Bitcoin long-short ratios are not without their complexities. Traders must consider several factors to interpret them effectively. For example, a slight majority of short positions, as seen in the total market, doesn’t automatically guarantee a price drop. It merely indicates the current positioning of leveraged traders. Moreover, the composition of traders on each exchange can influence its specific ratio. Different platforms attract different types of traders, which can lead to varying sentiment distributions. For instance, some exchanges might have a higher proportion of retail traders, while others might cater more to institutional players, whose strategies could differ significantly. Always consider the broader context and avoid making decisions based on a single indicator, ensuring a robust approach to market analysis. Conclusion: Staying Ahead with Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios The 24-hour Bitcoin long-short ratios provide a fascinating snapshot of market sentiment, revealing a slight bearish lean overall, with interesting variations across top exchanges. By understanding these dynamics, traders can gain a deeper appreciation of market positioning and potential future movements. While not a crystal ball, these ratios are a powerful tool for enhancing your trading strategy. Stay informed, stay analytical, and always trade with a comprehensive understanding of market indicators to navigate the volatile crypto landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are BTC perpetual futures? A1: BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they do not settle physically and are popular for continuous trading, offering leverage and enabling both long and short positions. Q2: How do Bitcoin long-short ratios indicate market sentiment? A2: These ratios compare the number of long (buy) positions to short (sell) positions on perpetual futures. A higher percentage of long positions suggests bullish sentiment, while a higher percentage of short positions indicates bearish sentiment among traders. Q3: Why do long-short ratios differ across exchanges? A3: Ratios can vary due to differences in trader demographics, liquidity, trading volumes, and specific market events on each platform. Different exchanges may attract distinct trader profiles, leading to varied collective sentiment. Q4: Can I use Bitcoin long-short ratios to predict price movements? A4: While powerful, Bitcoin long-short ratios are not a standalone predictive tool. They offer insights into market positioning and sentiment, which can precede price movements, but they should always be used in conjunction with other technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and risk management strategies. Q5: What is the difference between a ‘long’ and a ‘short’ position in futures trading? A5: A ‘long’ position is a bet that the asset’s price will increase, aiming to profit from a rise. A ‘short’ position is a bet that the asset’s price will decrease, aiming to profit from a fall. Both are common strategies in futures markets.

CryptoSensei shared a clip of Barron where he criticized these forecasts, as both suggested gradual and sustainable growth. Avoiding Unreasonable Predictions Barron stated that forecasts of XRP reaching $500 to $1,000 are implausible in the near term, calling such figures unrealistic. CryptoSensei amplified the concern, arguing that high-profile figures who project extreme outcomes carry responsibility because many followers act on public commentary. HONEST RIPPLE XRP PREDICTION!!! pic.twitter.com/CZuA8A6LUU — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) August 21, 2025 The core of CryptoSensei’s argument is that public figures shape expectations. He emphasized that when creators with substantial followings endorse speculative price targets, they risk exposing followers to financial harm if those projections fail. CryptoSensei noted that credibility and access within the industry do not justify presenting speculative scenarios as likely outcomes. He suggested that clearer communication about uncertainty is necessary to protect retail participants and to maintain trust in public discourse. Other experts have consistently warned against these unrealistic targets , and CryptoSensei warned that influencers with large audiences should prioritize accuracy and restraint when discussing potential returns. Assessing the Claims Evaluating multi-hundred-dollar price projections requires balancing theoretical scenarios against observable market fundamentals. CryptoSensei did not deny that dramatic outcomes are imaginable under extreme systemic changes. However, he questioned the assigned likelihood of those events occurring soon, mirroring beliefs shared by other analysts about the infeasibility of these targets . He highlights the need to separate long-term hypothetical narratives from near-term probability statements and avoid framing improbable outcomes as expectations. He urged commentators to support probabilistic claims with transparent evidence and to identify the key assumptions that drive any headline number.

All sources on predictions should be trustworthy, and everyone should treat bold price targets with skepticism. While he acknowledged that XRP has the potential to experience massive price surges , investors must consider the range of plausible outcomes and the specific assumptions behind any forecast. CryptoSensei’s comments also serve as a reminder to content creators and commentators. He argued for transparency about uncertainties and for explicitly distinguishing personal views from empirical analysis. He suggested that influential voices adopt a consistent standard for qualifying optimistic scenarios and avoid implying certainty to the community where none exists.

Hype has been driven by the much-awaited Remittix wallet launch and promised CEX listing, making RTX one of the most promising crypto presale projects for 2025. Priced at just $0.0969 per token, investors are taking note of its gaining traction and growing utility in the DeFi space. Solana Market Performance and Changing Focus Solana has nonetheless continued to trade aggressively, and its price is currently at $180.87, a 2.1% decrease. Its market capitalization is $97.71 billion, but trading volume has taken a dive down to $4.59 billion, a decrease of 30.96%. Although Solana remains one of the top performers in the blockchain ecosystem, some large holders are diversifying their bets into upcoming crypto ventures like Remittix. This shift reflects that investors are now focused on low gas fee crypto projects with good use cases, namely payments and real-world adoption. To many, early crypto investment in RTX offers exposure to a new altcoin with utility rather than speculation. Remittix Wallet Unveiling and Presale Momentum The spotlight is on Remittix now that it has announced its wallet unveiling, which will launch live with the beta version planned in Q3 2025. The mobile-first wallet will enable real-time FX conversion and cross-border transfers into traditional bank accounts in 30+ nations. The wallet provides utility adoption value, positioning RTX to be more than just another DeFi project. On the presale front, Remittix has already raised over $20.7 million with over 614 million tokens sold at the price of $0.0969 per token. The success was capped with the project’s maiden centralized exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart, which widened global access and liquidity. The momentum will continue as the team works towards its next fundraising goal of $22 million, with the announcement of a second CEX listing in the offing. Key Forces Accelerating Remittix’s Growth Cross-border capability: Crypto-to-bank transfers directly in 30+ countries Transparent FX conversion: Real-time rates via its wallet launch in Q3 Successful presale: Over $20.7Million raised, 613Million+ tokens sold Exchange listing: First CEX listing confirmed on BitMart Community rewards: $250,000 Remittix Giveaway ongoing The RTX buying up by large holders, combined with the strong but unpredictable Solana performance, underscores a trend towards crypto that has real utility. With the presale going strong and a wallet launch planned later in 2025, Remittix is still set to be one of the leading DeFi projects this year. For the investors looking to the next big altcoin, Remittix is the best bet to address real-world issues in the $19 trillion payments industry. That it enjoys presale momentum, upcoming CEX listings, and new wallet functionality makes it a project worth watching in the months ahead.

Suddenly, crypto market sentiment has swung dramatically, moving from a neutral or cautious stance straight into “Greed.” This rapid change wasn’t random; it followed pivotal comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, signaling a potentially softer approach to monetary policy. For many, this moment has reignited optimism, fueling discussions about what lies ahead for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. What Ignited the Shift in Crypto Market Sentiment? The catalyst for this sudden surge in positive crypto market sentiment was clear: Jerome Powell’s speech at the recent Jackson Hole symposium. Prior to his address, market participants were cautiously optimistic, with the probability of a September rate cut hovering around 75%. However, Powell’s carefully chosen words hinted at a more accommodative stance, suggesting the Fed might be less aggressive in its fight against inflation than previously anticipated. This dovish turn was a game-changer. Almost immediately, the market reacted. The likelihood of a September rate cut soared above 90%, reflecting a strong belief among investors that borrowing costs would soon decrease. Lower interest rates typically make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, more attractive. Therefore, this policy pivot directly contributed to the renewed investor confidence we are now witnessing. Understanding the Fed’s Dovish Turn and Its Impact A “dovish turn” essentially means the Federal Reserve is leaning towards policies that favor economic growth over strictly controlling inflation, often by keeping interest rates low or cutting them. This contrasts with a “hawkish” stance, which prioritizes inflation control, usually through higher rates. For the crypto market, a dovish Fed is generally bullish. Why? Because when traditional investments offer lower returns due to low interest rates, investors often seek higher-growth opportunities elsewhere. The implications of this shift are significant: Increased Liquidity: Lower rates can lead to more money flowing into the financial system. Reduced Opportunity Cost: Holding cryptocurrencies becomes more appealing compared to low-yield savings or bonds. Risk-On Appetite: Investors become more willing to take on risk in pursuit of higher returns. This environment naturally fosters a positive crypto market sentiment , pushing the Fear & Greed Index firmly into “Greed” territory. How Did the Crypto Market Respond to This Sentiment Shift? The response from the broader markets was immediate and enthusiastic. Cointelegraph reported that the cryptocurrency sector, in particular, saw a significant boost. Bitcoin, the flagship digital asset, quickly climbed by 5%. Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surged even more impressively, climbing 11% to reach new all-time highs. These gains were not just numerical; they reflected a palpable change in investor psychology. The “Greed” indicator, which measures market sentiment, jumped in a single day. This indicates that investors are now feeling more confident, perhaps even eager, to buy into the market, anticipating further price appreciation. Such rapid price movements often signal a strong underlying belief in the market’s upward trajectory, especially when driven by macroeconomic factors like central bank policy. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Phase: What’s Next for Crypto Investors? While a “Greed” phase can be exciting, it also requires a measured approach. It suggests that many investors are optimistic, but sometimes, excessive greed can lead to irrational exuberance and potential market corrections. Therefore, understanding the current crypto market sentiment is crucial for making informed decisions. For investors, this period offers both opportunities and challenges: Opportunities: Potential for continued gains in leading assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Emerging altcoins might also see significant upside. Challenges: Increased volatility and the risk of “FOMO” (Fear Of Missing Out) leading to impulsive decisions. Market corrections can occur swiftly. Actionable Insight: Always conduct thorough research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research) before investing. Consider diversifying your portfolio and never invest more than you can afford to lose. While the current outlook is positive, market dynamics can change rapidly. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s dovish pivot has undoubtedly injected a fresh wave of optimism into the cryptocurrency space. With the probability of a September rate cut now significantly higher, crypto market sentiment has decisively shifted to “Greed.” This shift has fueled impressive rallies in Bitcoin and Ethereum, pushing them to new all-time highs. While the excitement is palpable, prudent investors will continue to monitor global economic indicators and maintain a balanced perspective. The digital asset journey is always evolving, and staying informed is key to navigating its highs and lows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent shift in crypto market sentiment? A1: The primary cause was U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish comments at the Jackson Hole symposium, which significantly increased the probability of a September interest rate cut. Q2: What does a “dovish turn” by the U.S. Federal Reserve mean for cryptocurrencies? A2: A dovish turn indicates the Fed is leaning towards policies that favor economic growth, often through lower interest rates. This generally makes riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive as traditional investments offer lower returns. Q3: How did Bitcoin and Ethereum react to the Fed’s comments? A3: Bitcoin rose by 5%, and Ethereum surged by 11%, reaching new all-time highs, as reported by Cointelegraph. Q4: What is the “Greed” indicator in the crypto market? A4: The “Greed” indicator is part of the Fear & Greed Index, a tool that measures overall market sentiment. A shift to “Greed” suggests investors are feeling confident and eager to buy, anticipating further price increases. Q5: What should investors consider during a “Greed” phase in the crypto market? A5: While a greed phase offers opportunities for gains, investors should exercise caution. Increased volatility and the risk of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) are common. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research, diversify portfolios, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Did you find this analysis helpful?

50532156,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=790498,1755935832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50532156.jpeg,Germany pledges reforms as economy shrinks 0.3%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/germany-defends-economic-policy/,"Germany’s Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil told Funke Media Group this week that the coalition government will push through new reforms by the end of 2025. The pledge comes as Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s administration faces rising pressure to fix an economy that’s clearly out of breath. Klingbeil said the coalition still has what it takes to deliver actual change, promising “important decisions” in the coming months on key areas like health care and pensions. Those promises land just as fresh economic figures hit the public. Germany’s economy shrank by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, way worse than the early estimate of -0.1%, and far from what the government had hoped for. The Federal Statistical Office said the drop was mostly caused by weak manufacturing, which had boomed earlier in the year as companies rushed orders to the United States to avoid President Donald Trump’s tariffs. That artificial growth is gone now, and the bottom’s showing. GDP weakens as tariffs hit exports Germany’s fragile growth got knocked further by multiple hits: lower household spending, falling investment, and a declining construction sector. New data from the Statistical Office revised household consumption down to just 0.1%, citing poor performance in food, hotels, and accommodation. Meanwhile, government spending rose slightly by 0.8%, but it wasn’t nearly enough to stop the bleeding. Net exports also dropped, dragged down by weaker global demand and tariff pressure from across the Atlantic. Klingbeil said Germany needs to clean out its bureaucracy to get things moving again. “We must free life in this country from bureaucracy so that it is fun again to start a business, run an association or build a house,” he told Funke. But that message competes with the cold reality that Bundesbank already warned the country might not see any growth in the third quarter either. If that happens, it’ll be two quarters in a row of negative or zero growth, a textbook recession. A brief spark at the start of 2025 had raised hopes, mostly because German firms were front-loading trade with the U.S. to dodge Trump’s new import taxes. That rush pushed up GDP early in the year but left a vacuum behind it. Now, there’s no more buffer. The PMI data released Thursday by S&P Global gave a small sign of life, showing business activity grew in August for the third straight month, and at the fastest pace since March. But even S&P warned the improvement was modest. It’s not enough to offset what’s happening in the real economy. Tariffs, debt limits, and global drag intensify pressure Klingbeil and Merz’s government is trying to act. Earlier this year, it pushed through a constitutional change to the debt brake rule, allowing defense spending above 1% of GDP to escape borrowing restrictions. It also approved a €500 billion extra-budgetary fund to invest in infrastructure. Still, those moves haven’t stopped the decline. The impact of Trump’s 15% tariffs on most European products is already being felt. And the auto industry’s hanging in limbo, waiting to see if the U.S. will bring car tariffs back down from 27.5% to 15%. Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, said the tariffs and ongoing economic changes are already showing up in corporate reports. “Recent corporate results were already a painful reminder that US tariffs, but also structural transitions, were in full swing in the second quarter, weighing on company results,” Brzeski said. He added, “This is a trend that won’t change too much in the third quarter, with US tariffs of 15% on most European goods and uncertainty over whether (and when) the 27.5% tariffs on automotives will be brought back to 15%.” Germany sends about 10% of its exports to the United States. That’s a huge piece of the puzzle, and if that window keeps tightening, companies will feel it quarter after quarter. This all traces back to 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine helped derail global supply chains and shook energy markets across Europe. That shock hit Germany hard, and the effects are still here. Add that to an aging population, weak global growth, and too much red tape, and the picture gets darker. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Choosing the right token could make the wait worthwhile. One lesser-known altcoin stands out as a smart pick for times like these. Discover which coin is gaining attention for its potential to shine when the market turns around. Ethena (ENA) Source: TradingView ENA slipped nearly 10% this week, trading between $0.64 and $0.82. Even so, the token still sits just over its 10-day and 100-day averages, hinting at a steady base. A strength reading near 56 is neutral, while a fast oscillator at 81 leans hot, suggesting short-term selling fueled the dip. Zoom out and the mood brightens. ENA is up 27% in the past month and 44% over six months. Buyers have stepped in on every pullback, keeping the price well above the firm $0.57 floor. Momentum has cooled since last week, yet the slight positive trend gauge shows bulls still hold an edge. If demand revives, the first barrier rests at $0.92. A jump from the mid-range price of $0.73 to that mark would mean about 26% upside. Clearing it opens a path to $1.10, roughly 51% higher. Failure to defend $0.57 would expose $0.39, a slide of 47% from current levels. Given the longer-term climb and neutral momentum, odds favor a grind higher toward $0.92, but a quick drop to test $0.57 remains a real risk if sellers press again. Bonk (BONK) Source: TradingView Bonk lost 10.01% this week and 42.13% over the past month, yet it still clings to a 32.88% gain in six months. The price now drifts near $0.000022 after swinging between $0.00002151 and $0.00002736. The coin is glued to both its 10-day and 100-day averages, pointing to a stalemate. RSI at 45 and a Stochastic reading of 41 show mild selling, not panic. A small negative MACD level backs the idea of flat-to-soft momentum rather than a deep slide. A clear close above $0.00002736 could send BONK toward the first resistance at $0.00003089, about 30% higher. Breaking that opens room for $0.00003674, roughly 50% above current trade. On the flip side, slipping under $0.00002150 would expose the $0.00001920 support, near 20% lower, with $0.00001336 another 40% beneath. Traders are waiting for a breakout to decide whether the next leg is up or down. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto.

With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.005 Next Stage : $0.01 Final Presale Price : $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Raydium (RAY) Source: TradingView RAY slipped 14.29% this week, 5.32% over the month, and 24.54% in 6 months. The token now hovers between $2.99 and $4.12, just below both the 10-day SMA at $3.23 and the 100-day SMA at $3.28. Momentum signals look neutral: RSI sits at 49.56, Stochastic at 56.69, while MACD is slightly red at -0.0117. This mix hints at a pause rather than panic. Bulls must clear $4.68 to regain control. A close above that ceiling could open a sprint to $5.80, adding roughly 40-60% from today’s mid-range. Volume near the upper band would likely pull the 10-day SMA back above the 100-day line and flip MACD green, giving buyers a clear path. Failure to shake off the drag keeps eyes on $2.43 support. A dip under that floor risks a slide to $1.31, nearly another 45-55% down. The flat averages and mid-range RSI suggest more range trading first, but the longer downtrend still shadows the chart. Traders will watch $4.68 and $2.43 as the breakpoints that decide the next big move. Sei (SEI) Source: TradingView Sei trades between $0.31 and $0.37 after a sharp pullback. The coin is down 10.39% in 1 week and 17.03% in 1 month, yet it keeps a 4.49% gain over 6 months. Short-term sellers rule, long-term holders still see green. Price floats just above the 100-day average of $0.31. A momentum score of 41.69 hints at weak demand, but a fast oscillator reading of 15.99 shows the market is oversold. With trend power near zero, any fresh bid could lift the pair to the next ceiling at $0.40. Beating $0.40 could spark a sprint to $0.46, adding about 15% then 35% from today’s midpoint. Slip below $0.31 and eyes move to $0.27, roughly 13% lower, and then $0.20, almost 37% down. Given the oversold state and the modest 6-month rise, the chart leans toward a 10%-20% bounce, yet the key lies in defending $0.31.

50532038,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=809198,1755936048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50532038.jpeg,Ethereum Chain Dominates With $516M Net Inflows In 7 Days,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-chain-dominates-with-516m-net-inflows-in-7-days/,"Ethereum (ETH) just delivered one of its strongest moves in years, breaking its all-time high of around $4,860 after a bullish surge on Friday. The cryptocurrency soared by more than 13% in a single day, marking a pivotal moment for the market and confirming the strength of Ethereum’s ongoing rally. Related Reading: TRON Spot Market Signals Relief – Seller Dominance Weakens After Cycle High Momentum is firmly on the side of the bulls, as Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin. While BTC consolidates around the same price range it held a month ago, ETH has taken the lead, strengthening the case for an extended altcoin rally. The market is entering a phase where altcoins are beginning to show strength across the board, with Ethereum spearheading this trend. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ted Pillows shared fresh insights pointing to Ethereum’s continued dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi). He emphasized that Ethereum remains the number 1 chain in DeFi, reinforcing its position as the backbone of the sector. With institutional adoption rising, exchange supply shrinking, and derivatives activity heating up, many see Ethereum as primed for a sustained rally. Ethereum Netflows Surge Amid Fed Speculation Ethereum’s dominance in the crypto market has once again been reinforced by its recent on-chain activity. Over the last seven days, Ethereum recorded a netflow of +$516.4 million, significantly outpacing all other networks. To put this into perspective, the second-largest, Polygon, registered just $102.9 million over the same period. This vast difference highlights Ethereum’s position as the clear leader in attracting and holding liquidity. The timing of this surge is tied closely to macroeconomic developments. Markets began to heat up after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole, where he noted that “with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” This statement has fueled widespread speculation that the Fed could cut interest rates in September, sparking renewed optimism across both traditional and crypto markets. Ethereum’s strong netflows reflect both institutional and retail conviction. Investors are positioning for further upside in anticipation of improved liquidity conditions. The inflow surge signals not only buying pressure but also a growing shift toward Ethereum as the primary vehicle for DeFi, staking, and treasury strategies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Score Index Signals Fading Momentum: Room For Downside? Weekly Price Analysis: Reaching New ATH Ethereum (ETH) has officially broken into uncharted territory, setting fresh all-time highs on the weekly chart as shown. The breakout above the 2021 peak near $4,860 confirms a major bullish structure after months of consolidation and a sharp rally in recent weeks. ETH closed this candle strongly, near $4,876, representing an almost 9% surge within the week. The structure highlights sustained bullish momentum. With ETH trading well above its 50-week ($2,823), 100-week ($2,794), and 200-week ($2,446) moving averages. This alignment — with shorter-term moving averages trending above the longer-term ones — reinforces the bullish trend. Momentum indicators also suggest that buyers remain in control, supported by institutional flows and derivatives positioning.

In such phases, rallies often extend rapidly, especially when combined with rising open interest and strong on-chain accumulation trends. On the downside, immediate support rests around the $4,300–$4,200 zone, which coincides with the breakout region. Losing this area could invite deeper corrections, but bulls are currently defending it strongly.

Amid the chaos of its explosive debut and the subsequent controversy, Tate appears to have made a calculated move. A Rare Win? Lookonchain’s latest findings reveal that controversial social media personality Andrew Tate opened a 3x short position on Kanye West’s new meme coin, YZY, at $0.8524 and sat on a $16,000 profit at the time of the post. He should still be in the money, even though YZY rebounded slightly to $0.70 alongside the rest of the market. However, despite this winning move, his overall track record in perpetual trading remains questionable. Data shows that Tate has executed 80 trades on Hyperliquid, but only 29 have been profitable, which reflects a win rate of just 36.25%. In fact, his trading activities have resulted in staggering losses amounting to $699,000, in what appears to be a pattern of poor performance in the perps market. Lookonchain tweeted, “he doesn’t seem to be good at perps trading.” Tate’s History With Shady Meme Coin Projects Bubblemaps and Coffeezilla had previously called out Tate for his involvement with several dubious meme coins. Despite once claiming, “I will never endorse any crypto. Why would I damage my fans?” Tate reversed course on June 7, 2024, by diving headfirst into the Solana meme coin frenzy. Within just 24 hours, he had promoted over 10 different tokens, most of which eventually collapsed. One of the first was GER (Germany Token), which Tate agreed to buy if the creator called him “fuhrer.” A single cluster controlled 30% of the supply, and the token’s value plunged by 99% in just two months. He then promoted “Fuck Madonna,” even revealing his own wallet address. That token spiked to $2 million in volume almost instantly before crashing to zero in a single day. Next came FTRISTAN (Fuck Tristan), which he hyped on Twitter, driving $15 million in trading volume before the inevitable collapse to zero. Tate also heavily promoted TOPG and received 58% of the supply. His repeated tweets brought massive attention, which pushed the coin to over $300 million in trading volume. But despite the hype, it ended with the same result: zero. Other meme coins connected to him – ROOST, RNT, and DADDY – suffered similar fates.

According to the country’s anti-corruption agency, the deported criminals consisted of 102 foreign nationals, including 60 Chinese and 39 Filipinos. According to the announcement by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the deported foreign nationals were part of the criminals convicted by a federal high court in June. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the criminals were apprehended after the anti-graft agency dismantled their operational base in December 2024, capping off a successful investigation that had gone on for months. The agency mentioned that the criminals carried out their operations out of a building located at Oyin Jolayemi Street, Lagos. The EFCC also noted at the time that over 700 suspects tied to the illicit operations were apprehended, noting that they would undergo processing, serve their terms, and be deported to their countries of origin. Nigeria deports foreign nationals convicted in investment scams According to the Nigerian agency, the move to deport the criminals comes as efforts are being stepped up across the country to crack down on online scam operations, which have seen victims lose funds to fake cryptocurrency investments. According to reports, there has been an increase in crypto-related scams in Nigeria, with the scammers preying on the high illiteracy rate to carry out their activities. A typical example is the Crypto Bridge Exchange ( CBEX ) investment scheme, which promised users rewards for their investments. However, all hell broke loose earlier this year after it was discovered that the investment scheme was a scam, leaving users scrambling to save what was left of their funds to no avail. The revelation led to several damages, including financial and psychological, with most victims resorting to suicide after losing their entire savings to the scheme. Speaking to several news agencies, Dele Oyewale, the spokesman of the EFCC, mentioned that they had carried out a first deportation that had gone under the radar prior. He added that the deportation happened on August 15, involving a group of 39 Filipinos, 10 Chinese, and two people from Kazakhstan. Oyewale noted that this isn’t the last of the deportations, as more are expected to happen in the coming days.

The men, clearly Asian, wore surgical masks to protect their identities. EFCC steps up efforts to curb criminal activities Nigeria, which is currently the most populous country in Africa, has witnessed a rapid rise in internet fraud. The menace, known by its local slang as “Yahoo,” was named after yahoo.com, the early mail messaging platform. According to the EFCC, they have stepped up their efforts to ensure these activities are being curbed, busting several hideouts where the young populations are being taught these online scamming skills. According to the EFCC, foreign gangs often recruit young Nigerian accomplices, luring them with promises of big returns in exchange for helping them find their victims online via several phishing methods. The attackers usually try to deceive their victims into moving or transferring funds into accounts controlled by their bosses via several means, which include befriending them, sending them phishing links, or calling to act as their banks. Most of these scams target residents in America, Canada, Mexico, and other European countries, since most of these people are seen as better off than the average African. This doesn’t mean their activities are limited abroad, as they also try their hands on local victims that fall prey to their tactics. According to experts, cybercriminals are now using sophisticated technologies to carry out their acts, making it harder to apprehend them. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The world’s largest asset manager sold a total of $351.3 million worth of Ethereum ( ETH ), equivalent to about 84,000 ETH, across three sessions between August 18 and August 20, according to data from Coinglass . Ethereum ETF net inflow. Source: Coinglass The heaviest selling came on August 20, when BlackRock’s fund posted $257.8 million in redemptions, marking the single-largest daily outflow of the week. Earlier, on August 18, the ETF shed $87.2 million, followed by a smaller sell-off of $6.3 million on August 19. Despite the outsized outflows, momentum shifted later in the week. On August 21, BlackRock attracted $233.6 million in Ethereum inflows, followed by an additional $109.4 million on August 22. Across all issuers, Ethereum spot ETFs recorded net weekly outflows of $233.7 million. BlackRock’s activity dominated, with its $351 million in sales accounting for more than 85% of total redemptions during the sell-off days. Ethereum rallies to new highs Indeed, the renewed institutional interest contributed to Ethereum reaching new highs. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap notched another record, buoyed by optimism around ETF demand. The rally also gained support after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled the possibility of an interest rate cut, sparking a broad crypto market surge. Interestingly, over the past two months, Ethereum’s price has more than doubled, outpacing Bitcoin ( BTC ) as investors pour into exchange-traded funds. By press time, Ethereum was trading at $4,713, up 8.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 6% higher on the week. ETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, Ethereum remains well above both its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $3,674 and 200-day SMA of $2,679. The alignment of short- and long-term averages confirms sustained bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 66.66, edging closer to the overbought threshold of 70. This suggests that while buying pressure is dominant, the asset is nearing levels where a short-term pullback could emerge.

Hunting for Next Big Opportunity While Cardano & XRP Slips Lower,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/ethereum-whales-next-moves-hunting-for-next-big-opportunity-while-cardano-xrp-slips-lower,"Large holders of Ethereum are shifting attention as other leading coins face declines. With Cardano and XRP prices moving downward, the search for the next major gain is underway. Fresh strategies and reactions are taking shape among the biggest players. Which coins or projects will draw their focus next? New moves are coming soon. Cardano (ADA) Source: TradingView Cardano trades between $0.81 and $1.07 after a tough week. The token dropped 8.95% in 7 days and 6.64% in a month, trimming but not wiping out the 9.04% rise logged over 6 months. The cooling pace signals that traders wait for a clear break before placing fresh bets. The 10 day moving average sits at $0.85 while the 100 day line is $0.88, so short term bias tilts lower. Momentum tools echo this; RSI at 38.87 and stochastic at 28.72 show weak demand, and the MACD holds in negative ground. If sellers push, the nearest support at 0.66 may get tested, a slide of roughly 30% from the midpoint of today range. Bulls still have a path. A close above $1.17 would flip mood and put $1.42 in sight. That run would add about 25% then 50% from the $0.94 midpoint. The six month climb hints the network can draw money when the market warms. Watch volume near 1.17; a clean breakout could restart the rally and lift the moving averages. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP trades between $2.95 and $3.29 after a rough stretch. The coin slipped 7.54% in the past week and 19.85% in the past month, wiping out most short-term gains. Even so, the six-month score still shows a 10.57% rise. Price now sits a touch above both its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, hinting that selling may be cooling. If buyers regroup, the first target is the $3.49 ceiling. From the midpoint of the current range, that is about a 12% climb. A clean break could push toward the next barricade at $3.84, roughly 24% higher. On the other side, a slip under the $2.80 floor would invite pressure down to $2.46, close to an 18% drop. Volume remains muted, so any surge could move the chart quickly. The data paints a mixed picture. Short-term losses point to caution, but longer-term growth and steady support suggest upside potential. As long as the coin holds above $2.80, the path of least resistance leans upward. A bounce to $3.49 is within reach; failure to clear that level would likely keep XRP orbiting the $3 mark until a fresh catalyst appears. Conclusion ADA and XRP look sound for the long term. Yet Ethereum whale capital now eyes XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, targeting 20,000% upside in the 2025 bull run.

The forecast , released Friday, says the primary deficit will drop by $3.3 trillion between now and 2035 from duties already imposed, with another $700 billion saved on interest payments tied to a smaller national debt. The total, $4 trillion in deficit reduction, comes as Trump’s fiscal agenda raises concerns about spending. The CBO, led by Phillip Swagel, noted that the projected impact from tariffs is about one-third larger than what they estimated earlier in May, when fewer measures had been rolled out. Since then, Trump has stepped up enforcement and announced new trade actions, pushing the numbers higher. New tariff projections help offset spending bill impact Trump’s controversial spending package, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to add $4.1 trillion to U.S. debt by 2035. But the updated tariff estimates now nearly cancel out that rise. That near balance has become a central issue for investors, especially as the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio sits at around 100%, making U.S. Treasuries less attractive to some money managers. The CBO’s latest analysis doesn’t calculate how these tariffs might affect the economy’s overall size. Most economists think the duties will slow growth, but the report doesn’t try to guess by how much. Swagel warned the figures are built on shaky ground. “The estimates are subject to significant uncertainty,” he said, pointing to unknowns like how long the tariffs will last, whether exceptions will be granted, and how much precedent actually exists. Even with the caveats, the numbers are landing well at the White House. Trump and his administration have long argued that tariff revenue would cover increased federal spending. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week he now expects more money to come in from import taxes than he’d planned for earlier. “We’re going to bring down the deficit to GDP,” Scott told CNBC. “We’ll start paying down the debt, and then at that point that can be used as an offset to the American people.” Over at S&P Global, the credit ratings agency highlighted these incoming funds too. This week, the firm reaffirmed the U.S. government’s debt rating, citing “broad revenue buoyancy, including robust tariff income” as the reason. Their analysts said this extra money would help cushion any fiscal damage from the tax cuts and spending baked into Trump’s agenda. The CBO also reminded people that: “Typically, once tariff rates go into effect, they are not applied to goods already in transit to the United States, which can take as long as two months.” White House opens new furniture tariff probe under national security rule On Friday, Trump revealed a new step in his trade crackdown, saying his administration would launch a fresh tariff investigation focused on furniture imports. He posted on Truth Social that furniture coming into the U.S. would be taxed at a “rate yet to be determined.” He said the process will be completed within 50 days, although other similar investigations have often taken longer. A White House official confirmed the probe will be handled under Section 232, which allows the federal government to apply tariffs in the name of national security. This move also creates a legal backup for other duties Trump imposed earlier this year. In April, he hit a long list of U.S. trading partners with “reciprocal” tariffs, and in February, import taxes were placed on China, Canada, and Mexico. But those actions are currently facing legal challenges. If a federal appeals court throws out those earlier duties, this new Section 232 investigation could give the White House a second path to keep them in place. It’s a legal insurance policy, in case Trump’s first round of tariffs doesn’t survive court scrutiny.

Many let fear push them out too soon or steer them toward the wrong coins. Still, there is one digital asset that stands strong during such dull periods. Discover which choice can set up a strong portfolio when the market seems uncertain and slow. Ethena (ENA) Source: TradingView ENA slipped nearly 10% this week, trading between $0.64 and $0.82. Even so, the token still sits just over its 10-day and 100-day averages, hinting at a steady base. A strength reading near 56 is neutral, while a fast oscillator at 81 leans hot, suggesting short-term selling fueled the dip. Zoom out and the mood brightens. ENA is up 27% in the past month and 44% over six months. Buyers have stepped in on every pullback, keeping the price well above the firm $0.57 floor. Momentum has cooled since last week, yet the slight positive trend gauge shows bulls still hold an edge. If demand revives, the first barrier rests at $0.92. A jump from the mid-range price of $0.73 to that mark would mean about 26% upside. Clearing it opens a path to $1.10, roughly 51% higher. Failure to defend $0.57 would expose $0.39, a slide of 47% from current levels. Given the longer-term climb and neutral momentum, odds favor a grind higher toward $0.92, but a quick drop to test $0.57 remains a real risk if sellers press again. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005. At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bonk (BONK) Source: TradingView Bonk lost 10.01% this week and 42.13% over the past month, yet it still clings to a 32.88% gain in six months. The price now drifts near $0.000022 after swinging between $0.00002151 and $0.00002736. The coin is glued to both its 10-day and 100-day averages, pointing to a stalemate. RSI at 45 and a Stochastic reading of 41 show mild selling, not panic. A small negative MACD level backs the idea of flat-to-soft momentum rather than a deep slide. A clear close above $0.00002736 could send BONK toward the first resistance at $0.00003089, about 30% higher. Breaking that opens room for $0.00003674, roughly 50% above current trade. On the flip side, slipping under $0.00002150 would expose the $0.00001920 support, near 20% lower, with $0.00001336 another 40% beneath. Traders are waiting for a breakout to decide whether the next leg is up or down. Raydium (RAY) Source: TradingView Defi crypto RAY slipped 14.29% this week, 5.32% over the month, and 24.54% in 6 months. The token now hovers between $2.99 and $4.12, just below both the 10-day SMA at $3.23 and the 100-day SMA at $3.28. Momentum signals look neutral: RSI sits at 49.56, Stochastic at 56.69, while MACD is slightly red at -0.0117. This mix hints at a pause rather than panic. Bulls must clear $4.68 to regain control. A close above that ceiling could open a sprint to $5.80, adding roughly 40-60% from today's mid-range. Volume near the upper band would likely pull the 10-day SMA back above the 100-day line and flip MACD green, giving buyers a clear path. Failure to shake off the drag keeps eyes on $2.43 support. A dip under that floor risks a slide to $1.31, nearly another 45-55% down. The flat averages and mid-range RSI suggest more range trading first, but the longer downtrend still shadows the chart. Traders will watch $4.68 and $2.43 as the breakpoints that decide the next big move. Sei (SEI) Source: TradingView Sei trades between $0.31 and $0.37 after a sharp pullback. The coin is down 10.39% in 1 week and 17.03% in 1 month, yet it keeps a 4.49% gain over 6 months. Short-term sellers rule, long-term holders still see green. Price floats just above the 100-day average of $0.31. A momentum score of 41.69 hints at weak demand, but a fast oscillator reading of 15.99 shows the market is oversold. With trend power near zero, any fresh bid could lift the pair to the next ceiling at $0.40. Beating $0.40 could spark a sprint to $0.46, adding about 15% then 35% from today’s midpoint. Slip below $0.31 and eyes move to $0.27, roughly 13% lower, and then $0.20, almost 37% down. Given the oversold state and the modest 6-month rise, the chart leans toward a 10%-20% bounce, yet the key lies in defending $0.31. Conclusion Bull run 2025 is rolling; ENA, BONK, RAY, SEI look solid, yet the first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) targets 20,000% growth through community-driven, meme-sports fusion and clear roadmap.

Attention now shifts to which coins might attract their interest next. These moves could signal big changes in the market. Speculation grows as observers watch for hints about the next popular choice among major investors. Cardano (ADA) Source: TradingView ADA sits between $0.81 and $1.07 after a choppy week. The coin slid 7.55% in 7 days and 5.20% in a month but is still up 10.72% over 6 months. Buyers point to that long-term climb, while sellers highlight the fresh dip. The 10-day average at $0.86 hugs the 100-day at $0.88, showing a flat trend. RSI at 46.13 and Stochastic at 38.29 lean slightly oversold. MACD is a touch below zero, hinting that downward drive is weak and could flip fast. A break over $1.17 would mark a 15% pop and could push ADA toward $1.42, roughly 35% higher. Staying above $0.86 keeps that path open. Dropping under $0.81 risks a slide to $0.66, about 20% down, and in a hard sell-off $0.41, nearly 50% lower. For now the mixed signals suggest sideways action, yet the 6-month rise gives bulls a slight edge for an upward move in the next few weeks. XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP trades between $2.95 and $3.29 after a rough stretch. The token slid 6.96% in 1 week and 19.35% in 1 month, erasing most spring gains. Even so, it still shows an 11.27% rise over 6 months, proving buyers did not flee for good. Momentum hints at a pause. Price sits a shade above the 10-day average of $2.86 and almost level with the 100-day line at $2.94. RSI at 44.3 is neutral, while a 27.99 stochastic leans oversold. The MACD is a hair below zero, echoing the recent dip but not flashing panic. Traders now watch $3.49. A clean break could lift XRP by roughly 8% toward $3.84, the next ceiling, and that would leave the monthly chart looking steadier. Failure to clear $3.49 opens room for a drop to $2.80, about 5% lower, and a deeper slide to $2.46 would shave nearly 16% off today’s level. Until either line cracks, expect tight, choppy moves.

Low-Cap Meme Coins Like $MAXI: Where the Real 1000x Potential Lies When we think of meme coins, names like Dogecoin and Pepe instantly come to mind. But the fact of the matter is, while they once delivered 100x or even 1000x returns, those days are long gone. Their popularity has pushed market caps so high that it’s virtually impossible for them to deliver moonshot gains today. So what do you do. Lose out on those life-changing returns? Absolutely not. The key is to look at new, under-the-radar meme coins. Like $MAXI . Thanks to their unique designs and low market caps, these projects are not only positioned to ride the broader crypto wave, but also offer far superior upside compared to the mainstream names. Who Is Maxi Doge? If you’ve looked at Maxi’s face and noticed an uncanny resemblance to Dogecoin, you’re not alone – and you’re not wrong either. Maxi and Doge are, in fact, cousins. But here’s the twist: they couldn’t be more different. Growing up, Doge, because of how ‘cute’ and wholesome it looked, and of course because it became the greatest meme coin on the planet, soaked up all the spotlight at every family gathering. Maxi, on the other hand, was left in the shadows, ignored, and overlooked, even by his own mom. That’s when Maxi made a decision to become the anti-Doge. Unlike Doge, he hit the gym, bulked up his muscles, downed protein shakes and caffeine, and set off on a mission to dethrone Doge as the best meme coin on the planet. He studied candlesticks all day long, to the point that he took one of those fat green candles and turned it into a lightsaber to fight off Doge lovers and mediocre gains. Maxi is a fierce Shiba who lives by the philosophy: never skip leg day, never skip the pump. And that’s exactly the kind of raw degen energy meme coin investors crave. Because let’s face it: ‘cute’ might win attention, but it doesn’t win battles. Maxi Doge: More Than Just a Meme At first glance, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might look like just another glamorous meme coin, one that prides itself on having no utility, no underlying value, and simply chasing big pumps out of thin air. But in reality, the project’s developers have put forward a surprisingly strong roadmap. For instance, 40% of the total token supply has been reserved for marketing, covering PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and relentless social media blitzes, all designed to make Maxi one of the top trending cryptos in the space. The gym-bro humor and viral meme culture behind it give $MAXI the potential to break beyond crypto circles and reach everyday audiences, driving mainstream appeal and popularity. For holders, the benefits don’t stop at potential price action. Owning Maxi unlocks access to weekly trading competitions, leaderboard prizes, and a thriving community of traders eager to share strategies. The goal? To help everyone chase those outsized 1000x returns that are usually only reserved for institutional players with eight-figure capital. Maxi’s mission is simple: bring those moonshot gains to the average Joe. And speaking of massive returns, the project isn’t stopping at CEX and DEX listings. $MAXI is also eyeing futures listings, which could allow holders to take 1000x leverage bets, opening the door to life-changing profits for those willing to play the high-risk, high-reward game. Best Time to Buy $MAXI? NOW! As mentioned earlier, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is currently in presale – just a few weeks in, in fact – meaning you can grab it at some of its lowest-ever prices. Right now, 1 $MAXI is available at just $0.0002535, with the project having already pulled in over $1.45M from early investors.

The reaction came on the heels of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signalling the possibility of a rate cut in September. Sentiment indicators reacted accordingly. The crypto fear and greed index, which had slipped to a weekly low of 46—well within neutral territory—now looks poised to edge back into the greed zone as optimism returns to the broader market. Meanwhile, the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation bounced back above the $4 trillion mark, reflecting renewed investor confidence sparked by Powell’s remarks. In line with this, altcoins also saw a late-week boost, with several top-100 tokens extending their weekly gains on renewed bullish sentiment. Why is the Bitcoin price going up? Bitcoin’s late-week rally came after days of sluggish movement, marked by narrow trading ranges and muted investor interest. The week began with price action hovering sideways, weighed down by uncertainty over what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would signal at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. That anticipation, paired with a notable drop in institutional activity, kept market momentum at bay. The spot Bitcoin ETF market reflected this hesitation. Funds shed assets for five straight days leading into Friday, offloading $194 million on Thursday alone. Total outflows for the week topped $1 billion, underscoring how institutional players had been pulling back amid macroeconomic ambiguity. Ethereum wasn’t spared either—its spot ETFs lost over $700 million during the same stretch, a stark reversal from the inflows seen in previous weeks. However, as Powell took the stage in Jackson Hole and delivered his speech, the momentum shifted. Bitcoin surged to $116,000 after Powell’s speech hinted that the central bank may soon pivot to a more accommodative stance. While Powell was careful with his language, he noted that the current trajectory of inflation and labour market conditions “may warrant adjusting” the Fed’s policy, a statement widely interpreted as dovish by traders. Markets wasted no time responding. Risk assets, including crypto, jumped on the news while the US dollar retreated. Bitcoin gained over 3.5% on the day, bouncing off local lows of $111,658—its weakest level since July 10. The move not only wiped out the week’s losses but also injected fresh volatility into the market. Expectations for a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed’s September meeting have now gained traction. The Kobeissi Letter noted that Powell’s messaging was clear enough to set the stage for such a move. CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed a similar leaning in market pricing. Several prominent analysts noted key technical setups aligning with the news. The Wolf Of All Streets @scottmelker · Follow $BTC 4-HOURBitcoin is showing bullish divergence (again) with oversold RSI on the 4-hour… and 6-hour. Maybe the 12-hour. Maybe the daily.

The bounce also appeared to tap into resting liquidity below the range, according to TheKingfisher, while fellow analyst Daan Crypto Trades noted the recovery followed a “range low sweep” spurred by Powell’s dovish tone. Bitcoin Liquidation map. Source: TheKingfisher on X. What’s next for Bitcoin? One look at Bitcoin’s 24-hour liquidation heatmap shows the spark behind Friday’s surge: a cascade of short liquidations ignited just above $113,000, accelerating BTC’s climb toward $117,000. The steep vertical rally carved through dense layers of bid-side liquidity where bears were heavily positioned just above the recent range. As prices pierced those pockets, liquidations snowballed, forcing traders to cover shorts and contributing to the sudden price spike. Zooming out to the 1-week liquidation map, a broader picture of the battlefield emerges. Bitcoin’s recent bounce from $111,658 came after it absorbed significant bid-side liquidity near the $111K–$112K zone, a region housing concentrated leveraged longs that had built up during the drop. Bitcoin 1-week liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. The recovery flipped that zone into a short-term support base, as the price moved away from the liquidation cluster. Just above, around $117,000 to $119,000, a fresh wall of liquidation leverage looms. This area is densely packed with short interest and could act as both a magnet and a hurdle. If bullish momentum persists, Bitcoin may attempt to sweep through that region next, likely triggering another round of forced buying. However, failure to break above it cleanly could invite rejection and a retest of the $114,000 level, now a key intraday support that coincides with the midpoint of the liquidation sweep. Below the current price, the $111K zone continues to stand out as a structural support. Not only did it mark the week’s lowest low, but it also represents an area where strong bid liquidity absorbed selling pressure. Should the market retrace, that level may serve as a critical line in the sand for bulls. On X, most analysts were already expecting a major run fuelled by Powell’s recent remarks, with some volatility expected over the weekend. For market commentator Mario Nawfal, $130,000 was a possible target for the bulls next week. Others argued that the real upside could come later, with markets likely to rally further once the Federal Reserve formally enacts the anticipated rate cut in December. ₿IGRYAN 🟠 @BigRyanPark · Follow TODAY: #Bitcoin Pumps +2% in 15 Minutes As Fed Chair Jerome Powell Hints at a Rate Cut in SeptemberIf this is how markets respond at the **hint of a rate cut, imagine what happens when an actual rate cut occurs. $btc HIGHER. 🚀🪐 Watch on Twitter View replies 7:53 pm · 22 Aug 2025 23 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies Meanwhile, veteran trader Michael van de Poppe wrote “Uptrend is back” as Bitcoin was crossing the $116,000 mark.

Source: Merlin The Trader. If this retest holds, based on the structure a potential upside move toward the $130,000 region in the coming weeks is a possibility. At press time, Bitcoin was hovering over $116,500 with losses of less than 1% on the weekly timeframe. Altcoin market recap The total market capitalization of all altcoins initially rose 2.4% over the past week before ending the period 2.5% lower, standing at $1.63 trillion as of Friday, Aug. 22. As of press time, the altcoin market was showing renewed momentum following Powell’s speech. Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market cap, settled at $4,650 over the week with gains of 2.2% while other large-cap coins like BNB (BNB), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) posted gains between 1-5%. OKB led the highest gains among the top 99 altcoins, up nearly 125% while Morpho (MORPHO) and Chainlink (LINK) followed with gains of 40% and 21% over the week. Source: CoinMarketCap OKB : The major catalyst fueling OKB’s rally this week was its token burn event, which removed 65 million OKB tokens and slashed its circulating supply from about 300 million to a hard cap of 21 million. Another factor that played a part in OKB’s rally this week was the launch of its zkEVM-based X Layer blockchain, which delivers significantly higher throughput, near-zero fees, and full integration with OKX’s wallet, exchange, and payment systems. Additionally, OKX also phased out its older Cosmos-based OKTChain, migrating 1.3 million OKT tokens into OKB. Morpho : Morpho rallied this week primarily due to the successful launch of its lending protocol on Ethereum, which drove renewed investor interest in the token. The project’s debut was further boosted by a surge in liquidity inflows, as users moved capital into the protocol to take advantage of its competitive yields and efficient design. Chainlink : Chainlink rallied this week primarily due to sustained whale accumulation, with large investors ramping up their LINK holdings. The token also benefited from rising institutional adoption, with more projects integrating Chainlink’s oracle solutions to enhance their smart contract reliability. Adding to that, Chainlink Reserve, which uses revenue from ecosystem integrations to purchase LINK tokens, has also supported its gains via multiple buybacks this week.

The premier cryptocurrency now trades above $116,000, nullifying earlier losses seen in the past week. Interestingly, prominent market analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino has outlined the implications of this price rebound regarding the BTC price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Below $120K as Buyers Retreat, Is the Rally Already Over? Bitcoin’s Latest Bounce Revives Bullish Momentum – Price Targets To Watch In an X post on August 22, Severino explains that Bitcoin showed resilience in its price recovery on Friday by bouncing off the lower boundary of a long-standing ascending channel, tagged as the “Wall of Worry.” Notably, this lower boundary has acted as a key support zone for the leading cryptocurrency, stretching as far back as November 2023. Following each bounce off this support, Bitcoin has popularly reached the upper boundary, raising many expectations of a price surge at this moment. According to the channel analysis, Severino shows that the immediate technical target lies at the median line around $144,000, representing a roughly 24% advance from current levels. Interestingly, should bullish momentum persist, the next major resistance zone would align near the upper boundary of the channel at $183,000. However, a decisive break below the ascending channel would invalidate the bullish structure, potentially triggering a broader retracement toward the $95,000–$100,000 region. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Bottom Out? This Could Be The Signal To Watch Bitcoin Market Outlook At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $115,641, reflecting a 3.21% gain in the last 24 hours. This positive performance is accompanied by a 38.78% gain in daily trading volume, currently valued at $80.33 billion. However, losses of 1.76% and 1.94% on the weekly and monthly charts indicate that new market entrants are yet to break even. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Jordan Pivato is predicting the current market cycle to peak on October 21, 2025. This projection is based on historical data showing that Bitcoin cycles tend to extend slightly longer with each iteration. While the previous cycle lasted 548 days, Pivato estimates the ongoing one will span 550 days, placing the top in late October. He further points to Bitcoin’s strong seasonal performance in October as additional support for his call. Historically, October has been Bitcoin’s most bullish month, logging gains in six of the past twelve years and recording just two losing Octobers in that period. On average, Bitcoin has delivered a 46.72% monthly gain in October, with a median increase of 10.82%, making it the most favorable month in the calendar year for BTC performance.

A soaring SHIB burn rate is making headlines. Millions of tokens are being permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary tactic aims to create scarcity and support price appreciation. Yet many traders are looking beyond this mechanism for real yield. They are turning their attention to Layer Brett . Its 3,000% staking rewards offer a more direct path to growth. While SHIB relies on reducing supply, LBRETT focuses on increasing demand through utility. This fundamental difference is driving a noticeable shift in investor behavior. The limits of token burning Understanding the burn mechanism The SHIB burn strategy is simple in theory. By reducing the total supply, each remaining token should become more valuable. The community rallies around these burn events. They see it as a collective effort to increase scarcity. Why burning isn’t enough But burning alone has its limitations. It does not create any new utility for the token. It does not generate income for holders. The price effect is often slow and uncertain. For traders seeking immediate returns, waiting for burns to work is not a viable strategy. This is where Shiba Inu struggles to meet modern investor expectations. How Layer Brett delivers immediate value Layer Brett takes a completely different approach. Instead of hoping scarcity drives value, it builds value directly into the token. Its massive staking rewards provide instant utility and income generation. This creates a powerful incentive for both buying and holding. The project’s core advantages are clear: Immediate high yield: Earn over 3,000% APY from day one through simple staking. Real utility: Functioning Ethereum Layer 2 technology enables fast, low-cost transactions. Community growth: Active development and engagement beyond tokenomics. Presale accessibility: Fixed pricing structure allows for planned entry without volatility. This combination of features addresses the gaps that token burning cannot fill. The trader’s perspective: yield versus hope From an investment standpoint, the choice is becoming clear. Shiba Inu offers hope that burning will eventually increase value. Layer Brett offers certainty of rewards through its staking mechanism. One is speculative while the other is actionable. Traders are increasingly choosing actionable opportunities. The 3,000% APY provides a concrete return regardless of market conditions. This reliability is particularly attractive during periods of market uncertainty. It represents a modern approach to crypto investing that prioritizes utility over hype. Making the strategic shift The move from SHIB to $LBRETT doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Many investors maintain a position in Shiba Inu while diversifying into newer opportunities. This balanced approach captures potential upside from both established communities and innovative newcomers. Participating in Layer Brett is straightforward. Visit the official website using a connected wallet. Purchase $LBRETT tokens at the current presale price ($0.0047 as of writing). Then immediately stake them to begin earning rewards. The entire process takes minutes but positions investors for both short-term yield and long-term growth. Final thoughts: The new standard for token value Shiba Inu pioneered community-driven tokenomics. Its burn efforts show dedicated supporter engagement. However, the market is evolving toward projects that offer both community energy and tangible utility. Layer Brett represents this evolution. As more traders discover the advantages of utility-based tokens, demand will increase. Visit layerbrett.com today to explore this opportunity. Don’t just watch burns happen.

Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention with projections of a 30x ROI, while other leading altcoins continue to shape market narratives. Here are the 7 best cryptos to buy now. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned for 30x ROI in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about altcoins this year. Built on a zero-tax, security-first infrastructure, it combines meme coin appeal with real DeFi utility. Analysts point to its fair tokenomics and decentralized design as major strengths, making it a standout in a crowded field. With forecasts suggesting a 30x ROI in 2025, many traders see MAGACOIN FINANCE as an early-entry opportunity before upcoming exchange listings. Bitcoin Cooling Before Next Big Move Bitcoin remains at the center of market discussions, currently trading around $115,300 after peaking at $124,450 last week. According to technical analyst CasiTrades, Bitcoin’s recent pullback could pave the way for a bounce toward $119,900–$121,900 before its next decisive move. While some anticipate further downside, others are eyeing the bigger picture, with comparisons being drawn to gold’s historic breakout in the early 2000s. If that pattern repeats, Bitcoin could climb toward $600,000 by 2026. For now, Bitcoin’s consolidation keeps traders alert to the next breakout signal. Ethereum Leads Stablecoin Activity Ethereum continues to dominate the stablecoin market, with an average of $521,000 transferred per holder over 30 days. Hosting 51% of the global stablecoin supply, Ethereum plays a vital role in both institutional and retail transactions. As stablecoin adoption grows, Ethereum benefits through higher fee revenues and broader usage, strengthening its position as the backbone of on-chain finance. Its dominance makes it one of the best cryptos to buy now for those focused on utility-driven networks. Stellar Gears Up for Upgrade Stellar (XLM) is trading around $0.403, with attention shifting to its Protocol 23 upgrade aimed at boosting scalability. Alongside strategic moves like SDF’s investment in UK-based Archax, Stellar is carving a path in real-world asset tokenization. Historically, upgrades have triggered rallies in XLM, and traders are watching closely to see if this trend continues. NEAR Protocol Attracts New Users NEAR Protocol is trading at $2.52 and has outperformed many peers in user growth. Weekly active accounts surged 18.4% to 16 million, surpassing Solana for the first time. With institutional inflows, new AI initiatives, and a major upgrade scheduled, NEAR is gaining traction as one of the best cryptos to buy now. A proposal to cut inflation further adds to its appeal for long-term holders. Solana Maintains Speed Leadership Solana remains a leader in performance, recently recording 107,664 transactions per second. Trading just below $205, Solana has the potential to move toward $250 despite regulatory delays around Solana-based ETFs. Its unmatched speed and scalability continue to attract developers and institutions, making it a strong contender for those seeking high-performance blockchain exposure. Chainlink Benefits from Integration Growth Chainlink (LINK) has climbed above $24, gaining over 30% in the past month. Its growth is fueled by rising institutional adoption and increased wallet activity. As the key provider of off-chain data to blockchains, Chainlink’s utility ensures its relevance. Analysts suggest LINK could advance toward $50–$55 by the end of 2025, reinforcing its position as one of the best cryptos to buy now. What Should Traders Do? With MAGACOIN FINANCE poised for a possible 30x ROI in 2025 and leading tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana shaping the market, traders have a diverse set of opportunities. Those seeking early exposure may consider visiting the official MAGACOIN FINANCE channels to act before broader listings arrive.

It predicted that more gains are coming. The chart identifies an initial accumulation range, a later re-accumulation band, and a separate region labeled as a blow-off top. It displays a sharp upward impulse between the highlighted areas, followed by an extended interval of range-bound trading inside the higher band. The digital asset’s recent price action was near the upper boundary of the re-accumulation area and approaches the breakout zone highlighted by the analyst, suggesting a massive price surge is imminent. More #XRP gains are coming. Send it to new all-time highs with haste! pic.twitter.com/VoqMo6Urk5 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 22, 2025 XRP Technical Interpretation The initial accumulation period shown on the chart lasted from July to September 2024. Shortly after Donald Trump’s election victory and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement , XRP experienced a notable breakout, reaching heights it had not seen since 2018, and closing January 2025 with the highest monthly close in its history . This surge brought the digital asset into the re-accumulation phase. During the reaccumulation phase, the price oscillated between the tested support and resistance levels. It displayed reduced volatility relative to the prior impulse. The asset struggled during this phase, almost testing the bottom of this range in April, before a quick recovery. It built on this momentum, and its recent price movements suggest that the consolidation might be near its end. XRP recently probed the top of the re-accumulation zone, briefly climbing above the upper boundary when it reached a new all-time high of $3.65 in July . A decisive sustained close above that resistance, supported by rising volume and improving momentum indicators, would strengthen the technical case for continued appreciation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Implications and Risk If a confirmed breakout unfolds and price extends toward the region labeled as a blow-off top on the chart, the market conditions could shift substantially. This zone on the chart ranges from $4 to $16, suggesting a potential double-digit target for the digital asset. A sustained move into that area would also attract renewed speculative interest from retail and institutional investors, which could accelerate trend extension. External factors such as macroeconomic shifts, regulatory developments, and significant token flows can also influence the strength and duration of any climb. As a result, market participants must remain watchful, as XRP often moves fast . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Two years after obtaining the license, the company is leveraging this position to launch the distribution of Ripple USD (RLUSD) and other stablecoins in Japan. Ripple and its subsidiary, SBI VC Trade, have signed a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the distribution of RLUSD in Japan, according to a blog post by Ripple. SBI VC Trade has begun offering stablecoin services, becoming the first entity in the country to receive an Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange Service Provider License. The stablecoin market, currently around $300 billion, is expected to reach a trillion dollars in the coming years. The key drivers of this growth will be usage and institutional demand. According to the blog post, RLUSD stands out as a stablecoin developed with institutional-grade principles of reliability, compliance, and transparency. RLUSD is backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US government bonds, and cash-like assets. Transparency is also ensured through monthly verifications by an independent auditing firm. Tomohiko Kondo, CEO of SBI VC Trade, said: “Our company is pioneering the stablecoin space as the first organization to receive an Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange License in Japan. The launch of RLUSD will not only increase stablecoin options in Japan but also represent a major step forward in terms of reliability and ease of use. We will continue to build a secure and transparent financial infrastructure together with Ripple.” Related News: Ethereum Soars to New Heights: Historic Moments Unfold - ATH on the Horizon - Here's Why and the Current Situation Jack McDonald, Senior Vice President of Ripple Stablecoin, added: “Our partnership with SBI has always been about more than just technology; it has aimed to build a reliable and harmonious financial future. The rollout of RLUSD in Japan is a result of this work. RLUSD is designed to create a reliable bridge between traditional and decentralized finance. This collaboration will not only increase stablecoin adoption in Japan, but also set a new standard for the entire market.” *This is not investment advice.

The bounce came as BTC broke out of a descending channel on the 4-hour chart, but upside remains capped by resistance around $116,000. Traders are trying to figure out if this bounce is the start of a bigger reversal or just a short-term rally. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin moved down from $123,700 to $111,700 on the 4-hour chart, then broke out upward. The price action shows that the resistance at $116,200 is being tested again, which is the same level as the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $116,289. After that, there was a rejection, and BTC stayed just above the $114,500–$115,000 range. The Money Flow Index (MFI) is close to 57, which means that liquidity is balanced. The RSI on shorter timeframes is between 42 and 45, which means that the market is neutral to slightly bearish. This means that momentum is starting to stabilize after last week’s drop.

US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s rate cut hint has brought optimism, the Philippines is proposing a $1.1 billion Bitcoin reserve and Taiwan’s $72 million crypto crackdown has boosted regulatory trust. Together, these developments highlight the maturing role of Bitcoin in global finance—both as a hedge and a growth asset. With technical charts also pointing to a potential breakout, traders now eye the path toward $130,000 with renewed confidence. Taiwan’s $72M Crypto Laundering Case Boosts Market Trust Taiwanese prosecutors have charged 14 individuals in what they call the country’s largest crypto money laundering case, worth around $72 million. Led by Shi Qiren, the group used unregistered exchanges “CoinW” and “CoinThink Technology” to scam over 1,500 people. They deposited funds into machines, converted to foreign currency, bought USDT and then moved the money out. Taiwan prosecutors are investigating the largest-ever money laundering case involving a brick-and-mortar virtual currency exchange. Fourteen individuals, using the CoinW exchange, assisted a fraud ring in converting cash into virtual currency.

Prosecutors are pushing for a $39 million asset seizure, while CoinW denied involvement. While the case exposed risks in loosely regulated markets, investors view the crackdown as a step toward stronger regulatory trust—likely supportive for Bitcoin in the long run. Powell’s Jackson Hole Signal Fuels Crypto Rally Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reignited optimism during his Jackson Hole speech, hinting at an upcoming rate cut. He noted that shifting conditions may “call for adjusting policy,” leading markets to assign a 90% probability of a September reduction. A dovish speech by Powell, signaling interest rate cuts, has energized the crypto market. $BTC and $ETH saw an increase, with #Ethereum 's stronger performance relative to #Bitcoin drawing particular attention. pic.twitter.com/SJlN4LkgNm — Crypto Data Space (@cryptodataspace) August 22, 2025 Bitcoin surged from $112,000 to above $114,700 within minutes, with Ethereum jumping 7% to $4,600. Altcoins including Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP all posted 6%+ gains. Investors had sold heavily earlier in the week but Powell’s dovish comments turned sentiment around. Rate cuts have historically driven liquidity driven rallies across crypto and traders expect this to be no different. Philippines Eyes 10,000 BTC National Reserve Another major development came from Manila. Lawmakers in the Philippines have introduced a bill to create a 10,000 BTC strategic reserve worth $1.1 billion at current prices. The plan would see the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas purchase 2,000 BTC annually for five years, holding the coins in trust for 20 years.

If approved, the Philippines’ holdings would rival Bhutan’s 10,565 BTC and exceed El Salvador’s 6,276 BTC, a move seen as a strong bullish signal by traders betting on institutional adoption. Bitcoin Price Prediction – Technical Outlook The short-term Bitcoin price prediction seems neutral as BTC’s chart below is shaping into a battleground between buyers and sellers. After sliding into a descending channel in mid-August, BTC has bounced sharply from $112,000 support, reclaiming the 50-period EMA at $115,578. Price briefly tested $117,000, marking an attempt to break the channel’s upper boundary. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A completed harmonic pattern between $124,450 and $105,150 underscores the recent swings. Candlestick action near support produced a bullish hammer, followed by green candles that could evolve into a three white soldiers formation if momentum sustains. RSI has recovered to 55, while MACD shows a bullish crossover with a widening histogram—both reinforcing a constructive outlook. If Bitcoin clears $117,000 and sustains above $119,000, upside targets emerge at $121,800 and $124,400. A breakout would likely push to $127,500 and possibly $130,000 in the coming months. On the downside $113,500 and $112,000 are key supports. BTC Potential Trade Setup A cautious entry above $116,200 with a stop under $112,000 aligns risk and reward. If confirmed BTC could rally to $124,400 and then $130,000 as bullish momentum builds into 2025.

Bubblemaps data showed that the very first purchase came from a well-known trader with the name “Naseem.” Blockchain data shows that the trader spent $250k worth of USDC to grab $1.2 million worth of YZY. Solscan data shows YZY token’s first buy. According to Bubblemaps, this is the same trader who once turned a million dollars investment in Donald Trump’s TRUMP token into $100 million in profit. The firm described him as a crypto trader who specializes in sniping. The trader managed to snipe the coin despite the fact that the YZY project claimed to have protections in place to prevent such moves. The YZY website explained that the token launch was designed with an “anti-sniping system.” It said 25 different contract addresses had been created, and one was randomly chosen as the official YZY token to make it harder for automated traders to grab early buys. Blockchain data showed that as many as 50 look-alike wallets were also set up by the team, some of which saw minor attempts from traders trying to guess the real one. Despite these efforts, experienced buyers still managed to work around the defenses. In one case, a user who appeared to have inside information mistakenly purchased the wrong contract, losing $710,000 in the process. They later recovered by buying the correct token. Another trader spent $24,000 in fees to push through a priority transaction and walked away with $3.4 million in profit. On-chain Lens, another blockchain tracking service, said an early investor briefly showed a $6 million gain at the token’s peak. Ye’s stance on memecoins shifted dramatically The launch was a surprise to some fans, since Ye had previously spoken against celebrity-backed coins. Back in February, he criticized such projects for preying on followers. But on Wednesday, he promoted the token with a video on X. By Thursday, he shared the official contract address and linked “Yeezy Money,” website describing it as “a new economy, built on chain.” The website stated that YZY would function as a currency inside a broader financial platform called YZY Money. Later, West himself appeared in a video confirming that the YZY token just dropped. Big traders have a lot of confidence in YZY YZY’s market value soared to $3 billion before tumbling back down to about $1 billion within 40 minutes of launching. Despite the volatility, several prominent figures in the crypto community jumped in. James Wynn , a prominent leverage trader said that he believed the coin’s liquidity and trading volume would attract large investors. He called his own entry into YZY a short term move, hoping to double or even quadruple his investment. He compared it to Trump’s token, which surged from $4 billion to $15 billion in just over a day. “Aped $YZY on a 60% pullback,” Wynn posted, noting the rapid gains he expected. Co-founder of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes also appeared to confirm that he had bought into the coin, sharing a post on X. Pls don’t rug me @kanyewest !!! $YZY for the win … cause bull market.

Because of this, the asset may play a much bigger role in global digital money in the years ahead. Institutional Catalysts For XRP: Gemini’s Card & JPM’s Outlook This week, Gemini released a big teaser in New York City. The company put up a huge wraparound billboard showing an XRP-branded Mastercard. On the card was the date August 25, 2025, and the words “Issued by WebBank.” Gemini also posted the picture on X with the caption “Prepare your bags.” The sign and the post suggest that a major launch is coming. Many people believe this date could be significant for XRP, because it may mark the start of a new product that connects the asset directly with the global Mastercard network. Crypto commentator John Squire quickly reacted to the news . He said mass adoption “is coming fast” and added that the date “could change everything.” The idea of an XRP card is exciting because it could let people make payments using XRP or convert their assets into regular money during a purchase. Another development came from JP Morgan as the bank released a report called “Sizing up the XRP ETP Opportunity.” According to a post shared on X by SMQKE, JP Morgan’s report suggests that XRP could generate $4.3 to $8.4 billion in its first year following the launch of an exchange-traded product . The bank also pointed out that the digital asset is very cheap to use, with each transaction costing only about $0.0004, which is far less than Ethereum or Bitcoin. Global Payments Expansion: Europe & Japan Ripple’s progress in Europe and the U.K. is also getting attention as the company’s system now fits with upgrades in the region’s payment networks. The SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme completes euro payments in under ten seconds, and its adoption is growing. In the U.K., the Faster Payments Service (FPS) is already moving trillions of pounds each year, and the Bank of England is modernizing its Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system to connect with new global standards. The fintech company is collaborating with partners like OpenPayd to integrate these systems with Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution , which means XRP could be utilized as a bridge to facilitate swift cross-border transactions. In Asia, Ripple is preparing to launch its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin in Japan during the first quarter of 2026. The rollout will happen through SBI VC Trade, which is part of SBI Holdings, a well-known Japanese financial company. RLUSD is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, Treasury securities, and other cash assets, with monthly audits to show transparency. As of August, RLUSD already had a market cap of $666 million, making it the eighth-largest stablecoin in the world . Ripple’s entry into Japan comes as the country gets ready to approve its first official stablecoins, making this move very timely. The launch follows the company’s approval in Dubai earlier this year and adds another region where RLUSD can operate.",XRP|ripple|Ripple adoption|ripple news|XRP news|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|ASIA|FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 09:30:52

Cardano price predictions from different analysts point to ADA price peaking at $150. However, some analysts believe ADA may have passed its peak, and prefer investing in Remittix (RTX), which is termed the 100x altcoin of 2025. Which is the better investment option? Cardano price prediction offering modest gains or Remittix predictions of a 100x? Cardano Price Prediction: Is $150 Feasible? While many analysts are optimistic about the $150 Cardano price prediction, some feel otherwise. Technically, ADA price has broken through the ceiling of a falling trend channel in the medium term. This indicates a slower falling rate initially, or the start of a more horizontal development. ADA has given a positive signal from the double bottom formation by breaking through the resistance at $0.84. A further rise to $1.13 or more is signaled. The currency is testing support at $0.84. This could give a positive reaction, but a downward breakthrough at $0.84 means a negative signal. The RSI curve shows a rising trend, which could also be an early signal of the start of a rising trend for the price. Cardano’s roadmap progress and scheduled upgrade are gaining traction. ADA’s price action has shown building momentum and gradual accumulation by whales. A few hours ago, Whales_alert reported that 59 million ADA tokens worth over 50 million were transferred from Bitstamp to an unknown wallet. That massive transfer indicates a likely whale or institutional accumulation. Source: Whale_alert via X. ADA is bullish for supply dynamics, as immediate sell pressure drops when funds move off-exchange. Remember, ADA is an established token with a market cap of $26 billion, which makes it less likely to deliver massive gains. Investors looking for a higher upside are exploring smaller-cap altcoins like Remittix with real-world utility.

Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert reported a substantial movement of 2,074 Bitcoin from the leading exchange Binance to an unidentified wallet. This single transaction, valued at approximately $240 million, has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation among investors and market watchers. Such large movements often signal important shifts or strategies within the cryptocurrency landscape, prompting us to delve deeper into its potential implications. What Just Happened: The Massive Binance BTC Transfer? On [Insert Date, if known, or simply state ‘recently’], the crypto community observed a colossal Binance BTC transfer . Whale Alert, a prominent service known for monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions, flagged the movement of 2,074 BTC. This significant sum originated from Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and was directed to a wallet address that remains unknown to the public. The sheer scale of this transaction, translating to roughly $240 million, immediately raises questions about its purpose and the identity of the recipient. Transaction Volume: 2,074 BTC Origin: Binance Exchange Destination: Unknown Wallet Estimated Value: Approximately $240 Million USD These large-scale transfers are often referred to as ‘whale movements’ because they involve individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market dynamics. Why Does a Whale Alert Binance BTC Transfer Matter? Understanding why a Binance BTC transfer of this magnitude garners so much attention is crucial. Whale movements are significant indicators in the cryptocurrency market for several reasons: Market Sentiment: Large transfers can create ripples, influencing investor confidence and market sentiment. A transfer to an unknown wallet might suggest a long-term hold or preparation for a large trade. Potential Volatility: While this specific transfer went to an unknown wallet, large movements can sometimes precede significant sell-offs or buy-ins, leading to price volatility. Strategic Insight: These transactions offer a glimpse into the strategies of major holders. Are they accumulating, rebalancing portfolios, or preparing for new ventures? The opaque nature of an ‘unknown wallet’ adds an extra layer of intrigue, prompting analysts to speculate on the underlying intentions behind such a substantial move. Unveiling the Unknown: Implications of This Binance BTC Transfer When a substantial Binance BTC transfer lands in an ‘unknown wallet,’ it leaves a trail of possibilities rather than definitive answers. However, we can explore several plausible scenarios for such a destination: Cold Storage: A common practice for large holders is to move assets from an exchange to a secure offline wallet (cold storage) for enhanced security, indicating a long-term holding strategy rather than immediate trading. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desk: The BTC might be destined for an OTC desk, where large trades are executed privately to avoid impacting exchange order books. This often involves institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. Institutional Investor: A new institutional player might be entering the market, acquiring a significant Bitcoin position for their portfolio. Exchange Rebalancing: Sometimes, exchanges themselves move funds between their own hot and cold wallets for security or operational purposes, though this is less common for ‘unknown’ public addresses. Without direct confirmation, pinpointing the exact reason remains challenging, but these are the most common interpretations within the crypto community. What Are the Potential Market Impacts of This Massive Binance BTC Transfer? While a single Binance BTC transfer doesn’t dictate the entire market, its size warrants consideration for potential impacts. Investors often react to such whale movements, leading to: Increased Scrutiny: The market will likely watch Bitcoin’s price action more closely for any follow-up moves from this address or related entities. Shifting Sentiment: If the market perceives this as a long-term hold, it could be seen as a bullish signal, indicating confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Conversely, if it’s feared to be preparation for a large sale, it might induce caution. Liquidity Considerations: While the funds are off the exchange, they are temporarily out of the active trading supply, which could theoretically affect liquidity, although Bitcoin’s overall market depth is vast. For individuals, staying informed about such transfers and understanding their potential implications can help in making more informed decisions. This substantial Binance BTC transfer underscores the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price might not be drastic, the move highlights the ongoing activity of large holders and the importance of monitoring blockchain data. It serves as a reminder that behind the charts and price fluctuations, significant players are continually making strategic decisions that shape the future of digital assets. Keep an eye on further developments, as the story of this $240 million transfer continues to unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Whale Alert? A1: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various networks, providing transparency into significant movements by ‘whales.’ Q2: Why is a Binance BTC transfer to an unknown wallet significant? A2: A large Binance BTC transfer to an unknown wallet is significant because it suggests a major strategic move by a large holder, potentially signaling a shift in investment strategy, cold storage, or an OTC deal, which can influence market sentiment. Q3: Does this transfer mean Bitcoin’s price will go up or down? A3: Not necessarily. While large transfers can influence sentiment, a single Binance BTC transfer doesn’t guarantee a specific price movement. It depends on the market’s interpretation of the whale’s intentions and subsequent actions. Q4: How can I track such large transactions myself? A4: You can follow services like Whale Alert on social media or use blockchain explorers for Bitcoin (like Blockchain.com or Blockchair) to track transactions by known addresses, though identifying the owner of an ‘unknown wallet’ is generally impossible. Q5: Is it safe to keep my BTC on an exchange like Binance? A5: While exchanges like Binance implement robust security measures, transferring large amounts of BTC to a personal cold storage wallet is generally considered safer for long-term holding to mitigate exchange-specific risks.

Remember “DeFi Summer” in 2020, when farmers turned yield into fortunes? Or “Solana Summer” in 2021, when the chain’s speed and low fees had everyone buzzing like it was the hottest beach party in town? Fast forward to now, and that heat seems to be cooling. Solana still shines, but the hype wave isn’t as wild as before. Instead, a new name is making the rounds on Crypto Twitter and Discords everywhere, “ Layer Brett Summer.” The meme-fueled Ethereum Layer 2 project is turning heads, wallets, and timelines, becoming the season’s unexpected star. Why Solana's summer tan is starting to fade For a while, Solana looked unstoppable, climbing the charts like it was heading for another beach party high. But the data now shows otherwise. Holder activity is slipping fast: mid-term holders dropped from 14.84% to 12.96%, and short-term holders fell by almost half. That’s a lot of wallets choosing to pack up and leave the party early. The charts aren’t helping either. Solana’s price action has carved out a double top around $206–$209, textbook bearish vibes. If $183 cracks, the next stops could be $175 or even $161. Add in SOPR showing weaker profit conviction, and suddenly Solana’s once-flashy rally looks more like a mirage than momentum. All this doesn’t mean Solana’s done, but the cool-down is real. And in crypto, when one summer ends, another begins. That’s why investors are already calling it “Layer Brett Summer” instead, chasing fresh heat in the Ethereum Layer 2 scene. Why Layer Brett summer is heating up fast In crypto, every season has its star. Remember when Polygon suddenly went from “that sidechain thing” to a must-have scaling solution? Or when Shiba Inu surprised everyone with staking utilities that kept holders hooked? That’s the kind of buzz now forming around Layer Brett ($LBRETT), except this time, it’s not just a meme, it’s a full-blown Layer 2 evolution. Ethereum’s Layer 2s are already on track to handle over $10 trillion a year by 2027, and the reason is simple: lower gas fees, faster speeds, and room to scale. Layer Brett rides this exact wave, offering near-instant transactions and dramatically cheaper costs while staying anchored to Ethereum’s security. Think of it as ETH’s fun, faster cousin who actually pays for the drinks. And the sweet part? $LBRETT isn’t just tradable, it’s stakable. With a few clicks on MetaMask or Trust Wallet, holders can lock in high-yield rewards. That’s why the crowd is calling it Layer Brett Summer. Staking just leveled up One reason Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is buzzing is its gamified staking. Instead of boring lock-ups, rewards feel interactive, like how StepN made walking a sport or how Blur turned NFT trading into a farming race. Add NFT integrations here, and suddenly staking isn’t just numbers on a screen, it’s like holding a BAYC that unlocks perks while also paying you. Tokenomics? Straightforward. With a hard cap of 10 billion tokens, no mystery minting, no hidden inflation, $LBRETT stays fully transparent and community-driven. That kind of simplicity reminds people of why SHIB’s community thrived, because everyone knew the rules of the game. And the cherry on top: no KYC hurdles, no middlemen. Pure self-custody. Think the freedom of MetaMask or Uniswap, but with NFTs, staking boosts, and rewards that make hodling fun again. The bottom line Crypto summers always have a headliner, and this year, it looks like Solana’s tan is fading while Layer Brett ($LBRETT) grabs the spotlight. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it blends meme energy with real scaling power, fast, cheap, and secure. Add gamified staking, NFT perks, and transparent tokenomics, and you’ve got a recipe that feels fresh yet familiar, like when SHIB or Polygon had their breakout moments. Whether it’s the staking rewards or the no-KYC, self-custodial freedom, investors are already dubbing it “Layer Brett Summer”, and the buzz suggests this beach party is just getting started.

The crypto community often remembers the summer seasons by their defining trends, such as ""DeFi Summer"" and the more recent ""Solana Summer."" Now, a novel term is gaining traction: ""Layer Brett Summer,"" a movement centered around the Ethereum Layer 2 solution known for its innovative approach and community-driven ethos. Despite Solana's previous allure, its luminescence is waning. Investment metrics and market data indicate a decline in both mid-term and short-term holder activity, suggesting that many are moving away from Solana to explore other promising ventures. This shifting focus is captured in the emergent excitement for Layer Brett, which offers new staking mechanisms and enticing transaction speeds. Shifting Sands: From Solana to Layer Brett While Solana once held the crypto community's attention with its rapid transactions and low fees, it's the innovative features of Layer Brett that are now drawing crowds. The platform not only promises enhanced speed and efficiency but also introduces a gamified staking experience, making it a standout in the Layer 2 landscape. Why ""Layer Brett Summer"" is the New Buzzword Layer Brett isn't just another crypto project. It’s a cultural shift within the Ethereum ecosystem, emphasizing scalability and cost-efficiency but with a twist of fun. Staking on Layer Brett isn't merely an investment; it's an engaging activity that rewards participants in innovative ways, akin to playing a game. Furthermore, the hype around Layer Brett is backed by solid technological advancements that promise to handle significant volumes of transactions, echoing the broad ambitions of Ethereum’s scaling solutions. This potential has not only caught the eye of seasoned investors but also of new participants eager to join the Layer 2 revolution. Investing in Layer Brett: A Smart Move? As interest pivots from Solana to Layer Brett, investors and crypto enthusiasts are keenly observing the benefits of engaging with the platform. The allure of reduced transaction fees, coupled with high-speed operations and robust security measures inherited from Ethereum, makes Layer Brett an attractive option for anyone looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Moreover, the tokenomics of Layer Brett are designed to ensure transparency and fairness, enhancing its appeal among a community that values clarity and equitable opportunity. With the crypto landscape constantly evolving, keeping an eye on emerging trends like Layer Brett could provide insightful leads into where the market is headed next.

Powell used his final Jackson Hole address to hint at looming interest rate cuts. This ignited a sharp rally for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other major altcoins. Data shows that nearly $770 million worth of long and short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Bears got hammered the most during the fresh rally. Bitcoin had been teetering near $112,000 last mid-week, but it roared back to breakthrough the $117 mark again. The cumulative digital assets market cap surged by more than 4% to regain $4 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 79% to stand at $261 billion. The Fear and Greed Index remained “Neutral” while inching towards “Greed” territory. $476M shorts wiped as bulls pushes ETH According to the data shared by CoinGlass, more than $476 million of short bets were liquidated over the last 24 hours. The largest single liquidation order of ETH-USDT-SWAP, worth $10 million, happened on OKX. Ethereum stole the spotlight as it skyrocketed nearly 15% to hit a fresh all-time high just shy of $4,900. The bull frenzy managed to demolish the record made back in 2021. ETH price is now running up by 42% on a YTD basis. It has outperformed Bitcoin gains of 24% in the same period. Ripple’s XRP is the only crypto among the top 10 that outdid Ethereum in the parallel spell. Ethereum is trading at an average price of $4,714 at the press time. Its 24-hour trading volume has spiked by 129% to hit $80.25 billion. Ethereum long and short liquidation, Source: CoinGlass. Data shows that the market saw $384 million worth of long and short bets set on ETH price being liquidated over the last 24 hours. However, $272 million (71%) of the liquidated positions turn out to be short bets. This suggests that traders were hoping that Ethereum price would continue to struggle, but that was not the case. ETH ETFs see $337M inflows while Bitcoin funds bleed Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked US exchange-traded funds reported decoupling again. BTC ETFs saw $23.15 million flowing out of the funds on Friday. BlackRock’s IBIT was the only ETF that leaked funds. It posted almost $200 million in withdrawals. Meanwhile, Ark and 21shares bagged more than $65 million in inflows. BTC ETFs are on a streak of 6 days printing red indices. On the other side, Ethereum ETFs recorded a huge inflow of $337.63 million on Friday. This suggests that investors have now shifted on ETH accumulation. Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, mentioned that ETH has now gained over 250% from April lows, outpacing Bitcoin. He added that the transactions on the Ethereum network jumped 63% in the past 30 days, while active addresses rose 26%. However, wallets holding over 10,000 ETH have risen by 200 since July. Behind the noticeable surge sits Powell’s message from Jackson Hole. Instead of doubling down on inflation worries, the Fed chair noticed that the downside risks to employment are rising. He even cautioned that labor market stress can “materialize quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs.” These remarks fueled speculation that rate cuts could arrive as early as September. As of now, markets are now pricing in a chance of policy easing from the current 4.25%–4.5% range. For crypto traders, the implications are pretty simple.

That’s a 9% daily gain, which exhibits just how quickly momentum can shift when investors are taking control of the market. In just two sessions, ETH added more than $800, a rally fueled by cleaner technical signals and stronger interest from bigger players in the market. Looking at the 4-hour chart, ETH has carved out a classic ABCD harmonic pattern, a sign that the move isn’t random but follows a structured path. The breakout above the 50-period SMA at $4,388 also came with a bullish engulfing candle—an early indication that sellers lost their grip and buyers were willing to commit. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Key Levels to Watch Now Bitcoin price prediction is slightly bullish as the ETH/USD pair is showing strength without looking stretched. The relative strength index (RSI) is holding around 65, high but not yet overbought. Whereas, the (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) MACD is widening on the bullish side, suggesting momentum still has room. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Right now, price action is consolidating around $4,700 in what looks like a flag formation. That’s often the pause before the next leg up. Ethereum is trading near $4,720 after a sharp breakout. Support sits at $4,600 & $4,400, while resistance at $4,900 could open the path to $5,300. #ETH #Crypto pic.twitter.com/e82KAWw9mG — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 23, 2025 Here’s how the chart stacks up: support is sitting around $4,600, with a stronger base near $4,400. Resistance is at $4,900—if ETH clears that, it opens a path to $5,300, and eventually $5,700. These levels line up closely with the extension targets highlighted on TradingView’s path tool. Looking Ahead: Can ETH Push Toward $6,000? For traders, ETH technical analysis is simple. A close above $4,900 and you’re in, stops below $4,600. First target $5,300, then $5,700. If momentum continues, ETH could be laying the foundation for a move to $6,000 in the coming months. Momentum is bullish: RSI near 65, MACD widening. A close above $4,900 sets sights on $5,700–$6,000. ETH’s $569B market cap signals this run may just be beginning. #Ethereum — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 23, 2025 Ethereum’s $569 billion market cap isn’t just a number – it’s the weight it’s carrying across DeFi, NFTs and blockchain infrastructure. That’s why this feels different from just another spike. It could be the start of a bigger move where ETH retests the highs and starts to become the backbone of the digital economy.

The ETF uses a covered call strategy, trading Bitcoin ETPs and selling call options to generate high yields, though this caps upside during strong rallies. BTCI is ideal for income-focused Bitcoin investors willing to trade some growth for steady cash flow, but it carries risks tied to Bitcoin's price and volatility. With strong early performance, robust distributions, and a compelling value proposition, I rate BTCI a buy for those seeking yield plus Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been one of the most exciting assets in the markets this past decade. Critics argue that its volatility makes it unsuitable as a store of value, while supporters compare it to digital ""Manhattan real estate"" or more commonly digital gold. Over the last year alone, Bitcoin has rallied more than 85%, cementing its reputation as a high-beta asset tied to broader risk sentiment. While bitcoin’s growth has been mind-blowing, and bitcoin believers have made tons of money, there is no way to live off these gains without selling your coins and losing Bitcoin exposure. That is where the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) comes in. This actively managed ETF was launched in late 2024, helping investors like me combine direct exposure to bitcoin with an options strategy that monetizes the asset’s volatility. In other words, BTCI turns bitcoin’s volatility into a source of monthly income. Since its inception, BTCI has quickly gained a ton of traction and has established itself as a top monthly payer. The fund has more than $500 million in assets under management, and it pays one of the most rewarding distribution yields available today. BTCI is paying more than 25% on an annualized basis. I have started contributing half of my bitcoin allocation into BTCI, and I believe many bitcoin investors will do the same. If you are long bitcoin and are willing to sacrifice some upside potential for monthly income and reduced volatility, BTCI is a buy. Breaking down BTCI Inception: October 17, 2024 Assets Under Management: $556 million Expense Ratio: 0.98% Underlying Exposure: Actively managed fund investing in Bitcoin ETPs and futures, with a call option overlay strategy Distribution: Monthly, currently 27.92% annual yield, most distributions are classified as return of capital (ROC) (estimated 96%) Performance: Since inception, BTCI has delivered a total return of 58%. For reference, current date: 8/19/2025. BTCI's Options Strategy BTCI is an actively managed ETF, as you could probably tell by the expense ratio close to 1%. Its strategy is synthetic covered calls on Bitcoin. The fund establishes exposure to Bitcoin through spot Bitcoin ETPs, while selling call options on Bitcoin futures ETFs. These calls are sold about one month away and are held until expiration. Investors benefit from income that is directly tied to bitcoin’s volatility. When volatility is high, option premiums increase, allowing BTCI to deliver double-digit annualized yields. Selling calls means the fund gives up some upside in big Bitcoin rallies. If Bitcoin shoots up 20% in a month, BTCI investors will capture only a portion of that move since the calls sold against the underlying cap the upside. This strategy can produce alpha against Bitcoin in flat or slightly up or down markets. BTCI thrives, as premiums collected provide steady returns even if Bitcoin’s spot price does not move much. Risks While BTCI’s 25%+ yield is extremely attractive, there are several risks we should understand while holding BTCI. Bitcoin’s uncertainty remains high, and BTCI is not a hedge against crypto downturns. If Bitcoin enters a bear market, BTCI’s net asset value will decline. The options strategy provides income but does not offer much downside protection. So it has similar risk profiles to holding bitcoin. Its ability to generate large monthly payments depends on implied volatility in bitcoin options and futures. If volatility compresses and bitcoin trades in a tight range for a while, option premiums will shrink, lowering payouts. Distributions will vary a bit from month to month, depending on market conditions. These distributions won't be as reliable and safe as blue-chip dividend stock; they have a lot more factors associated with them. The range so far has been about $1.12 - $1.5 per share, with most dividends being $1.4 per share. So there is a bit of a gap between the biggest and the smallest payouts, but it's nothing dramatic. The upside is capped. BTCI will underperform pure Bitcoin during sharp rallies because call options limit gains. Investors who do not value income so much and want the full upside potential of bitcoin will do better off just holding bitcoin directly. BTCI is great for income, but it will limit some bitcoin rally upside. Seeking Alpha BTCI just launched in October 2024; it is brand new. With such a short amount of time since its inception, we don't have much data on how it will actually perform in the long term. We have not yet seen how it will perform in a true crypto winter or in a bitcoin halving. We can make estimates and try to back-test the trades, but we will never truly know until it happens and we get to see it for ourselves. Since there is only about 6 months of data for BTCI, I used the last 6 months to compare it to Bitcoin's performance in a pretty bullish cycle for Bitcoin. It has been on par with Bitcoin, which is what we want. Past performance does not guarantee future returns. We will just have to wait a couple of years to see. Distributions Since its inception, BTCI has done a great job at returning income to shareholders. It has paid about $1.40 per share per month. This is roughly a 2% monthly yield; these types of returns can seriously compound money fast. Seeking Alpha BTCI has also done a great job controlling its share price and net asset value [NAV]. BTCI's shares have actually gone up about 20% since its inception, on top of returning huge income to investors. With the continued rise of Bitcoin, this should continue and will allow BTCI to keep paying a high monthly income. I do not see NAV erosion or huge share price decays outside of bitcoin's share movement to be a problem for BTCI. BTCI's future success will come from two things: continued volatility in bitcoin and continued bitcoin appreciation. If the volatility remains high, we will continue to receive 20+% yields yearly, and if bitcoin's price keeps grinding up, we will receive share appreciation. Bitcoin's price appreciation also protects the NAV from decreasing and could eventually offset reduced volatility if Bitcoin becomes a more stable asset. Scenario Analysis: Here are some scenarios on how Bitcoin's price action will affect BTCI. If Bitcoin rallies 50% in a year, BTCI will capture some of the upside. Of course, not all of it, but possibly 15–25% capital appreciation on top of big distributions. Still producing a strong total return even if it lags BTC directly. If Bitcoin trades sideways, BTCI thrives. Monthly option income will keep hitting the account monthly, and we will enjoy double-digit yields. Maybe since volatility is lower, we won't see a 25% yield, but we could see 18%-20%. BTCI in this scenario would outperform Bitcoin and produce really strong results. If Bitcoin declines sharply, BTCI will follow, also declining. While income will continue, total returns could turn negative, just as they would for direct bitcoin holders. BTCI would outperform Bitcoin in this scenario, as calls will keep producing income since volatility will still be there. The calls will also provide a little cushion as the share price falls, since they make it so BTCI has a lower overall beta compared to Bitcoin. BTCI will lag Bitcoin’s return when the price is shooting up, but it could create alpha compared to Bitcoin in slow-moving or bear markets. Why I Am Bullish What makes BTCI compelling is that it solves a problem for people like me who are bullish on bitcoin and want to hold bitcoin for a long time, but also want income. Something bitcoin does not provide. Seeking Alpha BTCI has heavily outperformed the S&P 500 these past 6 months, although we do not have many years of data. If you are bullish on Bitcoin, you do not see this trend slowing down. Even just a small exposure to this ETF can set your portfolio apart and create market-beating returns. Seeking Alpha BTCI has also heavily outperformed other NEOS high-yielding ETFs. Bitcoin's underlying volatility makes it hard for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to compete. Although past returns do not guarantee future returns. I see BTCI as a true winner, it is everything a high-yield ETF should be. I am very bullish on BTCI, and I believe it will keep returning market-beating results for many years to come. Assuming bitcoin's price keeps appreciating over time as more buyers see bitcoin's potential. And, assuming government policy towards crypto does not do a complete 180 from friendly to ban all crypto, BTCI is going to do great. The current macro conditions make BTCI even more favorable, as the Federal Reserve’s expected rate cuts could increase the attractiveness of BTCI’s distributions as people move from treasuries and bonds to other high-yielding assets. This can cause BTCI’s AUM to grow even quicker. Another thing to note that could impact BTCI's AUM is that when the Fed cuts rates, investors will have access to cheaper capital. If you are an investor with a high-risk appetite, you may buy BTCI on margin and be able to pocket the yield difference. Let's say BTCI remains flat in price, but returns a 20% yield. If you are paying 5% in interest, you just made a 15% return on your money. I'm not saying this has to happen, but sentiment online is that more and more people are starting to look at these yield arbitrage plays with covered call ETFs. This definitely could have an impact on BTCI's AUM, and that is why I mention it. This strategy is risky and not meant for every investor. I am currently not using this strategy myself. Conclusion BTCI is one of the most interesting ETFs to launch in recent years. By applying a high-income covered call strategy to Bitcoin, it takes volatility and turns it into a monthly cash flow while still offering some upside participation. Risks remain correlated to Bitcoin’s price and underperformance in upside during big rallies, but the value proposition is clear. For income investors who want bitcoin exposure, BTCI is paradise. With annualized yields currently more than 25%, consistent monthly payouts, and a best-in-class fund backing it in NEOS, the fund provides a nice mix of yield and growth. I rate BTCI a buy, as it represents one of the best ways for investors who are bullish on Bitcoin to generate monthly income while still being exposed to Bitcoin’s long-term price movements.",BTC-USD|BTCI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-23 09:55:00

Altcoins have historically mirrored the performance of Bitcoin with exaggerated rallies, and early indications show that this will not change. Investors have now started paying attention to projects that will perform better as soon as Bitcoin dominance. Among the new names generating buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already been picked by crypto experts as one of the best altcoin choices for the 2025 bull market, highlighting the growing appetite for high-upside opportunities. Among the tokens that most analysts believe could spearhead this next phase of the rally are XRP, ADA, and SOL. Each token presents its value proposition and can take advantage of changing market sentiment as money flows out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. XRP: The Institutional Darling XRP has always been the asset of choice in cross-border payments. The end of regulatory uncertainty has now opened the way to renewed institutional demand and even the possibility of ETFs in the future. Its applicability in the real world is on a steady rise, particularly as RippleNet adopts its usage, thus providing the coin with potential and a growth thesis that sees the world of finance integrate blockchain technology. ADA: The Research-First Innovator The emphasis placed by Cardano on peer review and research-based development has earned a following and provided a solid structure for further development. The governance improvements and rapidly growing dApp ecosystem point to actual usage growth. In combination with its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism and scaling solutions, such as Hydra, ADA is considered one of the top contenders to rally in the current bull market. SOL: The High-Speed Powerhouse Solana is a performance-oriented blockchain used in DeFi, games, and NFTs. It has a Proof-of-History consensus mechanism that makes the system very fast and with low transaction costs, which is attractive to developers and users. The rumour of a possible future spot ETF is only adding anticipation to an already hyped-up market, and the meme coin and dApp phenomenon continues to keep investors deeply invested. A Breakout Opportunity About to Shake the Crypto Market Amid these established altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a breakout contender in 2025. Analysts note that it has significant potential, with some early participants already projecting returns that could increase historical meme coin giants. With demand rising and presale rounds selling out quickly, experts note that a small early allocation – say $1,000 – could realistically turn into $20,000 or more if adoption continues at this pace. This scarcity-driven momentum has cemented MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most talked-about new projects this cycle. Conclusion The timing of “altcoin season” is unpredictable, but history shows that when it begins, opportunities can multiply quickly. As Bitcoin stabilizes, investors will tend to rotate into riskier, high-reward investments. With XRP, ADA, and SOL all carrying strong catalysts, and MAGACOIN FINANCE offering great opportunities for early investors, the stage is set for a potentially explosive second leg of this bull market .

While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the bedrock of the market, the biggest opportunities often come from new tokens entering at attractive price points with strong fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly moving up the ranks, having already surged 300% during its presale. Traders are now questioning whether it could be the next token to deliver a 1,000% rally in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) began its presale at $0.015 and has steadily progressed through multiple phases, now priced at $0.035. To date, the project has raised $14.75 million and onboarded more than 15,550 holders. With a confirmed listing price of $0.06, early participants are already positioned for gains once trading goes live. This momentum stands out, as presales rarely deliver both low-cost access and utility. By offering a sub-$0.05 entry backed by a functioning model, MUTM has drawn interest from everyday traders as well as whales positioning for the next major DeFi success story. Stablecoin Integration: A Utility Advantage One of the standout features of Mutuum Finance is its development of an overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this asset will be fully backed by on-chain reserves and minted from collateral deposited into Mutuum’s lending markets. This stablecoin is a fundamental part of the ecosystem. It strengthens liquidity, provides a reliable medium for transactions, and ensures Mutuum Finance has long-term relevance beyond short-term trading. By embedding this functionality, the protocol sets itself apart from many presale projects that often launch without immediate real-world use cases. Security and Investor Confidence Security has been a critical focus for Mutuum Finance. The project recently completed a CertiK audit, scoring 95/100, a result that ranks it among the most trusted DeFi protocols in development. In addition to the audit, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $50,000 bug bounty program, structured with four reward tiers based on severity: Critical – Up to $2,000 Major – Up to $1,000 Medium – Up to $500 Low – Up to $200 For investors, these measures are a strong signal. They demonstrate that the project isn’t just about growth potential but also about building a safe, transparent, and sustainable ecosystem. This attention to detail is one of the reasons why whales have already begun securing sizable allocations in the presale. Example of Investment Potential The numbers behind MUTM’s growth tell the story best. At today’s presale price of $0.035, a $1,500 investment secures around 42,800 MUTM tokens. By the time the token launches at $0.06, that allocation would already be valued near $2,570. Looking at the broader horizon, analysts are predicting MUTM to reach around $0.85 within its first major cycle. Once that plays out, the same $1,500 investment would be worth over $36,000—a 24x return. Some even suggest that MUTM’s tokenomics and stablecoin integration could drive further upside, placing it in contention for the 1,000% club in 2025. Why Analysts See More Upside Ahead What gives analysts confidence is the combination of mechanics built into the protocol. Mutuum Finance redistributes a portion of protocol fees by buying MUTM on the open market and sending it to mtToken stakers, creating consistent buy pressure. Additionally, the project is launching its beta platform simultaneously with the token listing, giving investors immediate access to lending and borrowing utilities from day one. This removes the uncertainty of waiting months for functionality. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already surged 300% during its presale, and with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, the growth trajectory is firmly in motion. The integration of an overcollateralized stablecoin, strong security audits, and immediate platform functionality only add weight to analysts’ calls that this could be one of the next major gainers of 2025.

Key Takeaways: Grayscale, Bitwise, and others filed updated spot XRP ETF proposals, likely in response to SEC feedback. The filings adjust structures to include XRP or cash creations and both cash and in-kind redemptions. While XRP rallied 7% on the news, BlackRock has stayed out of the XRP ETF race for now. Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin, 21Shares, and WisdomTree all submitted amendments for their proposed spot XRP ETFs. While the SEC has yet to approve any spot XRP ETF, the filings suggest that firms are responding to ongoing regulatory feedback. XRP ETF Filings Likely Sparked by SEC Feedback Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart described the cluster of filings as “almost certainly due to feedback from SEC,” adding on X that while the move is “a good sign,” it was largely expected. The updated proposals appear to adjust fund structures to allow for XRP or cash creations, along with both cash and in-kind redemptions, rather than strictly cash-based mechanisms. Bunch of XRP ETF filings being updated by issuers today. Almost certainly due to feedback from SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected pic.twitter.com/GiSL1kc6lt — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 22, 2025 Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called the simultaneous filings “highly notable,” saying it was “a very good sign” for the prospects of eventual approval. Despite the momentum, the world’s largest ETF issuer, BlackRock, has not joined the XRP race. While BlackRock launched the first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the firm confirmed earlier this month that it has no current plans to pursue an XRP product. The filings arrive amid a broader crypto market rally, with XRP climbing 7% on Friday to trade at $3.08. Meanwhile, VanEck has submitted an application for a JitoSOL ETF, the first proposed Solana fund backed entirely by a liquid staking token (LST). The ETF would track JitoSOL, a token representing SOL staked on the Solana network. The Jito Foundation, which backs the proposal, said the fund marks a milestone now that the SEC has provided clarity that both protocol and liquid staking do not constitute securities transactions. “That clarity opens a compliant path for ETF sponsors to use LSTs,” the foundation said in a Friday blog post. The SEC recently approved in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs, further widening the compliance runway for novel products. Just weeks ago, REX-Osprey became the first ETF issuer to integrate staking rewards into a Solana fund via a JitoSOL partnership. Solana (SOL) was trading at $199 at press time, up nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. Grayscale Moves Forward With Dogecoin ETF Plan As reported, Grayscale is pushing ahead with its bid to launch a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund , revealing the ticker “GDOG” in its latest US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company said Friday it plans to rename its existing Grayscale Dogecoin Trust to the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF.

This community has identified Avalon X (AVLX) as the next best crypto to buy in 2025. As XRP has successfully disrupted the traditional financial sector, Avalon X is about to disrupt the real estate sector. Avalon X is doing with real estate what XRP did for payments. For decades, luxury real estate has been locked away from everyday investors. Avalon X is simplifying and giving access to the ordinary masses without the need for deep pockets or paperwork. Its token, AVLX, is more than just a trade coin. It is a digital key tied to Grupo Avalon’s nearly $1 billion project pipeline. For anyone who believes assets should have a purpose, Avalon X is worth a closer look. Unlike XRP, which tackled the financial sector with no backing, investors are recognizing AVLX has a stronger start due to its billion-dollar backing. Avalon X Crypto: RWA Project Dominates Crypto Market Crypto’s market cap sits in the trillions; its growth in the last decade has been very impressive. But real estate? That market towers at more than $379 trillion worldwide. Most of it is inaccessible to average people. Avalon X is setting up the bridge between the two. By tapping into this market, this will expand into a much bigger, untapped space, creating the next wave of crypto millionaires. Unlike XRP, which has an unlimited supply, Avalon X has further employed great tokenomics with a capped supply of AVLX coins. Allocation of these tokens rewards early adopters and ensures long-term sustainability. In the long term, the plan is global expansion and broader asset classes. To kick things off, they’re giving away $1 million worth of AVLX tokens . Even bigger, one participant will walk away with a luxury townhouse in the Dominican Republic. That’s not “enter to win a t-shirt” marketing. That’s a real property tied directly to the project’s DNA. Timing Is Everything As XRP has proven, timing is everything: buying when it’s still building and selling high. Ethereum early adopters know this as well. Catching a project before the crowd piles in is what separates small wins from transformative gains. Avalon X presale is still early. The presale price is low, the Avalon X giveaways are live, and the roadmap is just beginning to unfold. A moment in time where a token gives you not just access to a new market, but a tangible claim to a piece of tomorrow. The early stages of this journey are fleeting, and the window of opportunity is closing. For the discerning investor who sees the future in the marriage of technology and real assets, the time for hesitation is over. The market is whispering, the foundation is set, and the future is waiting. Secure your position and own a piece of the new frontier.

But what if there is a coin that could give you 100 times more? We’ll talk about a recent XRP price prediction and why some investors are still optimistic even though the XRP price has dropped in the short term. Then we’ll talk about a new meme coin called Layer Brett that combines fun with real blockchain use. Is it the best crypto to buy right now? Let’s find out. XRP Builds Momentum Despite Whale Moves Some investors may have been frightened about the recent $470M whale unwinding, but analysts say there is no need to panic. Retail buyers are becoming involved, which is a symptom of redistribution. The XRP price has decreased more than 7% over the past week, but it is still holding strong in the $2.7 to $2.8 region. The XRP price has been trading between $3.6 and $2.7 over the past month, which signals that it is getting ready for its next move. The XRPArmy remains strongly bullish. CoinCodex’s recent XRP price prediction says that short-term drops may keep happening. Nonetheless, the long-term trend looks good despite the bearish short-term XRP price prediction . XRP has had 12 days of growth over the previous 30 days, with a mild volatility of 4.46%. Long-term holders are excited since the XRP price is only approximately 200% away from its $10 target. The technical sentiment is neutral, but if prices keep going up at this level, it might mean a breakout is coming shortly. According to the XRP price prediction , now would be a good opportunity to buy before the market picks up again. Layer Brett: The 100x Meme Coin With Real Utility Layer Brett is more than just talk. It utilises Layer 2 scaling to facilitate transactions almost instantly and maintain very low gas fees, all while remaining connected to Ethereum for security. You can buy and stake $LBRETT in seconds with ETH, USDT, or BNB through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. The ecosystem stays active and rewarding via gamified staking, NFT integrations, and rewards. It stands out due to its clear tokenomics and community focus. Layer Brett is already looking like the best crypto to invest in for both quick gains and long-term growth for a lot of people. Timing is quite crucial since people who buy early get greater staking rates and higher yields. The presale price is merely $0.0047, and in just a few weeks, approximately $900,000 has already been raised. This shows that there is a lot of interest. You may connect different chains with this project. This makes it better than other Layer 2s, such as Optimism and Arbitrum. Gas rates on Ethereum can be as high as $20, but Layer Brett lowers them to only a few cents, making it easier for average people to use. Layer Brett is a project based on memes that leverages real blockchain technology to fix problems. Final Word: Don’t Miss the 100x Window The $10 aim for XRP sounds great. But it’s slow, steady, and uncertain. On the other hand, Layer Brett is moving quickly. The presale is already bringing in a lot of money, yet the price to get in is still only $0.0047. Early buyers are locking in higher staking payouts and getting ready for big gains. This is where the true 100x chance is. These kinds of chances don’t stick around. Get in before the next stage of the presale to make sure you get a position in what may be the most rewarding meme coin of 2025.

His prediction is not on traditional tools like charts, candlestick patterns, or complex technical indicators. According to him, investors will go from laughing at the digital asset to feeling panic and then chasing it in fear of missing out. In the early stages, people often dismiss cryptocurrencies, claiming they have no real value. But as time passes and the XRP price climbs, that attitude will shift into doubt, regret, and finally desperation to buy in at any cost. Barri C: XRP Investors Will Laugh, Doubt, And Panic At $4, $10, And $100 Barri C says the first stage of investor reaction begins at $4. At this level, many people will mock XRP. They will joke about it being a “shit coin” and point out that the price has reached this level before. In their eyes, this is not a milestone worth noticing, so they laugh it off.

Even though it is only a small step higher, it feels more serious because the number now has two digits. People begin to feel uneasy, but they still hold on to the belief that the coin will crash again. They convince themselves they will be able to repurchase it at a cheaper price later. The real shock, according to Barri C, comes when XRP reaches the $100 mark. At this point, a wave of realization hits investors who had dismissed or underestimated the token for years, as they suddenly recognize the scale of the opportunity they passed up. Panic begins to spread across the market as latecomers scramble to get in, while early critics are with deep regret for not taking action sooner, watching the price climb beyond what once seemed impossible. Why $1,000 XRP Could Trigger Mass Adoption According to Barri C, the most dramatic stage comes when XRP reaches $1,000. At this point, the fear of missing out, often called FOMO, takes control of the market. Everyone, from regular people to long-time critics, will feel desperate to own some XRP.

The demand will rise quickly as people rush in, not wanting to be left behind. For many, it will no longer matter how high the price has gone. The only thought will be to buy before it climbs even more. Barri C adds that this stage is also when XRP could be more than just a cryptocurrency, evolving into the backbone of a new global financial system that supports cross-border payments and institutional transactions. The mix of FOMO and belief in its role in finance would push people from all sides, from supporters, skeptics, and even haters, to grab a share.

The scam allegedly defrauded over 1,500 victims of over NT$1.27 billion ($41 million). According to prosecutors, the suspects operated under the cover of BitShine because it had passed Financial Supervisory Commission checks, helping conceal the activities of another unlicensed firm. Taiwanese Prosecutors Bring Charges In BitShine Fraud Taiwanese authorities have concluded a major investigation into one of the country’s most high-profile crypto fraud cases. The investigation has resulted in changes against 14 individuals associated with the BitShine exchange. Authorities allege the individuals conspired with fraud groups to trick over 1,500 customers and steal NT$1.27 billion ($41 million). According to local media reports, the group operated under the guise of BitShine. BitShine had passed Federal Supervisory Commission checks, allowing the perpetrators to hide the activities of another unlicensed firm, Biying Technology. According to investigators, the two companies worked in tandem, funneling customer funds into cryptocurrency purchases, particularly USDT. The funds were then moved overseas through a series of transfers to hide their origin. How The Fraud Worked Prosecutors identified the mastermind of the scam as a man named Shih. According to authorities, Shih headed operations in Taiwan, with his wife serving as Asia-Pacific director. Another suspect named Yang was responsible for business management. The group worked with organized crime affiliates and instructed victims to transfer funds into specific wallets. The funds were then rerouted through multiple layers of transactions, which officials stated was a deliberate attempt to launder the stolen funds and evade detection. Officials estimate the scam laundered over NT$2.3 billion ($75 million) between January 2024 and April 2025. Authorities tied NT$1.27 directly to the 1,539 identified victims. Authorities stated that the group misled investors by claiming they were the only exchange approved by Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Committee. This claim helped attract significant investor deposits. Sentencing Requests The Shilin District Prosecutor’s Office indicted Shih and 13 other individuals on charges related to fraud, money laundering, providing unregistered virtual asset services, and organizing a criminal enterprise under Taiwan’s Organized Crime Prevention Act. Authorities have requested a 25-year sentence for Shih, highlighting his refusal to plead guilty to the charges and his lack of remorse. Defendants who confessed or have promised to return illicit gains could face a reduced sentence. Prosecutors have also confiscated the seized digital assets and asked the court for the forfeiture of NT$1.275 billion in criminal proceeds.

Investors were braced for a hawkish stance but were surprised after Powell suggested interest rate cuts could be coming soon. The speech breathed new life into BTC , with the flagship cryptocurrency surging past $116,000 from a low of $111,678. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 2%, trading around $115,579. Bitcoin (BTC) Surges After Powell Speech Bitcoin and crypto investors heaved a sigh of relief after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole on Friday. Powell hinted at the possibility of a rate cut as early as next month, boosting market sentiment. As a result, BTC , which was trading below $112,000, surged to reclaim $115,000 and move to its current level of $115,600, up over 2% in the past 24 hours. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates steady throughout the year, citing a strong jobs market and concerns about inflation fueled by President Trump’s tariff policies. However, the Jackson Hole speech indicated that Powell could be receptive to easing interest rates. Powell stated in his speech on Friday morning, “Overall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. The shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee called Jerome Powell’s speech “dovish as can be expected.” The crypto market spent all week sweating about Powell’s speech, as traders positioned themselves for a hawkish tone, selling their BTC in anticipation of a decline. However, the prospect of lower interest rates brought momentum back to the flagship cryptocurrency. Analysts now expect the Federal Reserve to lower its target rate in September. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a stunning recovery after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech. The flagship cryptocurrency was trading below $112,000 on Friday but rebounded after the speech, surging nearly 4% to reclaim $116,000 and settle at $116,908 after reaching an intraday high of $117,416. The jump has allowed BTC to recoup almost all of the losses made during the week, with analysts stating the latest bounce could revive bullish momentum. The jump past $117,000 triggered liquidations, taking out ask liquidity above this level. According to data from CoinGlass, $379.88 million in short positions were liquidated, with Ethereum (ETH) accounting for $193 million and BTC accounting for $56.4 million. Over $629 million was wiped out across the board in short and long positions. 150,217 traders were liquidated thanks to the sudden market recovery, which caught investors completely off guard. According to Michaen van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, BTC’s drop below $112,000 provided traders with a good opportunity to enter the market. Van de Poppe had told his followers to look out for a sweep beneath the August 3 low as a good area to accumulate. “A small sweep took place and an immediate massive move upward on #Bitcoin. Uptrend is back.” Another analyst stated that Bitcoin’s price could retrace following today’s pump, but could see higher prices. “Likely retrace the pump for a reasonable percentage - but the intent is clear. This market wants higher.” BTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $116,683. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline to $116,492. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309. BTC reached an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. Despite the positive start, it lost momentum and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to cross $123,000 and settle at $123,365. Despite the positive sentiment, the price tanked on Thursday, dropping over 4% to a low of $117,208 before settling at $118,389. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Friday as BTC fell 0.80% to $117,436. Price action was positive over the weekend as BTC registered marginal increases on Saturday and Sunday, settling at $117,488. The price was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.02% to $116,286. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell almost 3% and settled at $112,856. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising 1.26% to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,276.

Price moved clearly above $4,600, confirming that the bullish trend would continue after it regained support in its rising channel. The breakout candle had more volume, which means that buyers were really participating. Ethereum is now trading above important support levels between $4,600 and $4,650. Resistance levels above that are at $4,850 and then $5,000. It is very important to hold the current level, because if you don’t, the breakout zone near $4,450 could be tested again.

Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) continue to attract attention, with Polkadot launching its Polkadot Capital Group to bring Wall Street into DeFi, while Avalanche faces short-term bearish momentum. Yet, amid this volatility, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a practical alternative, combining real-world adoption, cross-border payment solutions, and growth-oriented infrastructure. Polkadot moves into institutional finance Polkadot price is currently $3.779. Known as the “blockchain of blockchains,” DOT aims to leverage interoperability and technical rigor to attract institutional investors. The recently unveiled Polkadot Capital Group provides banks, asset managers, and OTC desks with compliance resources, staking solutions, and educational programs. By tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) and providing access to Polkadot-native DeFi protocols, the network hopes to bridge TradFi and Web3. Analysts suggest institutional involvement could strengthen DOT’s ecosystem, but market success depends on navigating compliance challenges, growing liquidity, and proving that blockchain can augment traditional financial infrastructure without friction. Avalanche faces short-term weakness Avalanche price is currently $22, with AVAX slipping below $24 amid bearish derivatives and on-chain data. Funding rates have turned negative, the long-to-short ratio sits at 0.84, and the Taker CVD shows increasing selling pressure. Technical indicators like the 50-day EMA at $22.74, daily RSI at 48, and MACD bearish crossover signal short-term downside risk toward $20.99. However, JPYC’s yen-denominated stablecoin issuance on Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon could improve AVAX adoption and utility in the long term. Traders are cautious, weighing near-term weakness against potential for wider ecosystem integration and stablecoin activity. Remittix: utility-driven growth and PayFi solutions Amid market shifts, Remittix (RTX) presents a compelling alternative for investors seeking real-world utility. Priced at $0.0969, with over 614 million tokens sold and $20.7 million raised, RTX focuses on cross-border payments, DeFi applications, and crypto-to-fiat transfers. The Q3 wallet beta launch and $250,000 giveaway are attracting early adopters and strategic investors. Key features include: Global Reach: Transfer crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Security First: Audited by CertiK for transparency and trust Cross-Border Payments: Supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies Built for Adoption: Ideal for freelancers, businesses, and global earners These functional use cases position Remittix to complement speculative assets like DOT and AVAX, providing investors exposure to a PayFi ecosystem with adoption-ready infrastructure. Conclusion As Polkadot and Avalanche navigate institutional ambitions and short-term market pressures, Remittix stands out as a practical choice for investors seeking diversified exposure. Combining real-world utility, strategic tokenomics, and adoption-focused infrastructure, RTX could capture significant market share in Q4. Savvy traders may consider allocating capital to Remittix while monitoring DOT’s institutional developments and AVAX’s recovery potential, balancing speculative opportunities with tangible functional growth in the evolving crypto landscape.

This move is viewed as another major milestone for Ripple’s native coin, making it to the mainstream in U.S. markets. According to the filing, the ETF is structured as a Delaware statutory trust and aims to directly track the price of XRP using the CoinDesk XRP CCIXber 60m New York Rate as its benchmark. Unlike futures-based products, the fund will hold XRP directly, with custody services managed by a designated trust company. If approved, shares will trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange , allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to manage wallets or interact with crypto exchanges. The Canary Capital ETF filing is intended to provide easier access to XRP and more transparency than the derivatives-based ETFs. Its design is similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs already out there, but centered around Ripple’s token instead. Canary Capital advances despite SEC delays Towering over previous SEC delays, Canary Capital has moved ahead with its plans, becoming one of an increasing list of past issuers who are speculating investor interest in a crypto-backed exchange-traded product. The filing also lists some of the main risks , including the fact that the trust is not subject to registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so investors won’t get the same shield as mutual fund shareholders. Additionally, exchange shutdowns or custody breaches could expose investors to significant losses. That said, sentiment around XRP has improved after a U.S. appeals court threw out parts of the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which has emboldened confidence in the token’s regulatory outlook. SEC’s final decision to shape XRP’s path into regulated ETFs On related developments, asset managers Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin, 21Shares, and WisdomTree also filed amendments for their proposed spot exchange-traded funds, signaling that they are eager to get the SEC’s approval to list. Several analysts see this step as a sign that asset managers are responding to feedback from the regulatory agency. The SEC has yet to approve a spot XRP ETF, though both spot and futures-based funds have been proposed. “[The filings were] almost certainly due to feedback from the SEC,” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X. “Good sign, but also mostly expected.” The amendments filings seem to alter the structure of some of the funds to allow for XRP or cash creations and cash or in-kind redemptions, instead of simply cash creations and redemptions. While BlackRock operates the world’s largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the asset manager has not sought approval for an XRP product. Earlier this month, BlackRock said it has no current plans to launch an XRP fund. The final response by the SEC will decide if XRP stands to be one of the digital assets that can be offered through regulated ETFs. During Friday’s market-wide rally, XRP climbed 7%, trading at $3.08. XRP, which has often reacted sharply to developments in its ongoing case with the SEC, rallied strongly once the news broke. Its upswing also aligned with the broader market rebound after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential interest rate cuts. Even so, XRP has gained over 10% from its multi-week low of just under $2.80 earlier today and is now trading near $3.o5. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The leading cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high near $124,000, only to tumble below the $115,000 level within days. This swift reversal highlighted the fragility of momentum in overheated conditions but also underscored the market’s ability to rebound when macroeconomic catalysts emerge. The turning point came during Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole, where a key statement triggered an immediate market reaction. Powell hinted at a potential shift in policy stance, suggesting that restrictive conditions could soon be adjusted. Within minutes, risk assets, including Bitcoin, surged as liquidity poured back into markets, sparking renewed optimism across the crypto space. Following the speech, Bitcoin regained strength, climbing back above the $115K support zone. This recovery has reignited bullish sentiment, with traders eyeing the next resistance levels that could decide the short-term trajectory. The broader crypto market followed suit, with altcoins showing renewed momentum as investors reallocated capital. Bitcoin Futures React To Powell’s Jackson Hole Speech According to top analyst Darkfost, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole acted as a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin futures markets. In his remarks, Powell stated that “with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” This subtle yet impactful statement hinted at a potential easing of the Fed’s monetary policy, immediately sparking a surge of optimism across global markets. The reaction in crypto was swift and decisive. Within just 15 minutes of Powell’s speech, over $300 million in fresh liquidity flooded into Binance’s Bitcoin futures market. This sudden inflow pushed Binance BTC Open Interest to approximately $13.3 billion, underscoring how sensitive the crypto derivatives market remains to macroeconomic cues. Darkfost noted that this surge highlights the market-moving power of central bank communications, especially in an environment where liquidity conditions play a defining role in speculative demand. Bitcoin’s sharp reaction mirrored broader risk-on sentiment, as traders positioned themselves for the possibility of looser monetary conditions that would favor higher-yielding and alternative assets like BTC. The event also reaffirmed the volatility of Bitcoin futures, where shifts in Open Interest can rapidly amplify price moves. In this case, the spike in demand aligned with BTC reclaiming key support zones, reinforcing bullish sentiment across the market. BTC Testing Critical Resistance The 4-hour chart for Bitcoin shows strong volatility following Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks, with BTC rebounding sharply from lows near $112K to $116.5K. This sudden spike highlights how macroeconomic catalysts can trigger liquidity inflows within minutes. The bounce aligns with the reclaim of the 200-period SMA (red line), which now sits just under current price and acts as critical short-term support. Despite the rally, BTC remains below its recent $123,217 resistance, a level that has capped price twice this cycle. The mid-term structure still suggests consolidation, with the 50-SMA (blue) and 100-SMA (green) converging around $116K–$117K, creating a decision zone for bulls and bears. Sustaining above this area could open the path for another retest of the highs, while failure to hold risks a deeper pullback toward the $112K region. Momentum indicators suggest buyers are attempting to regain control, but price action is not yet showing a clean breakout. For bulls, defending $115K–$116K is key to maintaining the bullish structure. Bears, however, will look for rejection below the SMAs to reinforce downside pressure.

In terms of USD value, this stash is worth over $160 million at today’s prices. Cardano’s native token had followed the rest of the market in the past several days and had plunged to $0.82 on Friday. This was its lowest price tag since August 12, when the asset went on a roll that drove it from $0.78 to $1. However, Powell’s speech was met with tremendous enthusiasm by investors, as evidenced by all financial markets’ moves yesterday. The crypto industry was no exception, as the total market cap jumped from under $3.9 to over $4.1 trillion in hours. ADA was among the top performers during this substantial rise, rising from its daily low of $0.82 to a local peak of $0.94 before it slightly corrected to the current $0.91. ADAUSD. Source: TradingView Several crypto analysts have outlined bullish trajectories for ADA. However, it needs to overcome certain resistance levels before it is able to unlock future gains.

It has dropped seven percent in twenty-four hours. This decrease is happening despite its weakening correlation with Bitcoin. Technical indicators are now signaling more potential losses ahead. Consequently, many Cardano traders are actively seeking better opportunities elsewhere. They are discovering immense potential in a new decentralized finance project. This project is named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Its ongoing presale is attracting significant attention and capital. Investors are eagerly participating in its sixth phase. Cardano’s current market challenges Cardano is facing considerable selling pressure right now. Its price has fallen to $0.85. This makes it one of the day’s worst-performing altcoins. A key bearish crossover on its MACD indicator is also forming. This technical development suggests further downward momentum is likely. Moreover, its correlation with Bitcoin has dramatically fallen to 0.51. This decoupling means ADA is not benefiting from any Bitcoin rallies. These crypto prices are causing concern among its holder base. Therefore, numerous investors are reallocating their funds into promising new projects. They are looking for superior returns in a competitive crypto market. Mutuum Finance presale achieves remarkable success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently conducting its Phase 6 presale. The token price is now $0.035. This represents a massive 250 percent increase from its initial offering. Demand has been extraordinary since the event began. The project has successfully raised over $14,750,000 so far. Furthermore, a thriving community of 15,550 token holders has already formed. Phase 6 is currently underway and selling out fast. Consequently, the chance to acquire tokens at this price is quickly ending. The subsequent phase will introduce a 14.3 percent price hike. This will increase the cost to $0.04 per token. Early participants are therefore positioning themselves for substantial gains. They anticipate a launch price of $0.06, ensuring impressive profits. Comprehensive security and active incentives Mutuum Finance prioritizes security and community trust above all. The team has successfully finalized its Certik audit. This examination yielded an exceptional 95.00 security score. It confirmed the project’s solid security posture. No vulnerabilities were discovered in the smart contract. Furthermore, no security incidents have occurred in the past ninety days. Mutuum Finance has also launched an official Bug Bounty Program. This initiative partners with CertiK and offers $50,000 USDT in rewards. The program covers four distinct tiers of vulnerability severity. Additionally, the project is hosting a monumental $100,000 MUTM giveaway . Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 in tokens. Participation requires a minimum $50 presale investment. This approach effectively rewards early supporters and enhances engagement. A strategic investment for forward-thinking traders Mutuum Finance presents a compelling case for crypto investment. Its innovative DeFi lending model operates on a Layer-2 network. This ensures lower fees and faster transactions for all users. The protocol supports both peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending. This dual system accommodates various risk appetites and strategies. The team has also launched a new dashboard feature. It includes a leaderboard ranking the top fifty holders. These individuals will receive bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. This incentivizes long-term holding and strengthens price stability. Final words For Cardano traders facing uncertainty, Mutuum Finance offers a refreshing alternative. Its strong fundamentals and rapid presale progress make it one of the best cryptos to buy now. Mutuum Finance represents a high-utility DeFi protocol with real growth potential. Its successful audit and generous giveaway build immense confidence. The current presale phase offers a final opportunity at a discounted rate. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now should strongly consider MUTM.

Among these systems is Grok, the AI platform backed by Elon Musk through xAI, which has been actively generating predictions across various digital assets. In the case of XRP, Grok has weighed in on where it expects the token’s price to stand on September 1, 2025, offering a projection that adds to the debate among traders and analysts. Grok’s Price Prediction for XRP According to Grok, XRP is expected to trade at $3.25 on September 1, 2025. The system described this as a balanced projection that accounts for XRP’s current consolidation around the $3 level and the potential for modest gains in the weeks ahead. In Grok’s own words, the forecast reflects “a moderate but steady upward movement, aligning with broader market sentiment while staying within historically supported resistance ranges.” This positions XRP within a cautiously optimistic range, suggesting stability rather than extreme volatility. By situating its prediction around the $3.25 level, Grok acknowledges both upside potential and the limiting factors in the current market environment. While some analysts have issued forecasts that envision XRP reaching $5, $10, or higher before the end of 2025, Grok’s output highlights a more conservative outcome. Macroeconomic Shifts Support the Outlook Broader macroeconomic factors have also started to align with this outlook. According to a Times Tabloid report , speaking at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that changing economic conditions may warrant interest rate reductions in the coming months, especially if signs of weakness in the labor market persist. His comments represented a notable change from the Fed’s previously guarded approach. Investors read the remarks as dovish, which fueled gains across equities, bonds, and risk-oriented assets such as cryptocurrencies. If the central bank follows through on this approach, liquidity conditions could provide a more favorable environment for assets such as XRP, supporting Grok’s prediction of a steady upward trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Cautious Yet Bullish Perspective The context of this forecast is important because XRP has been one of the most closely monitored assets in the digital asset sector, particularly following years of regulatory scrutiny and legal disputes. With the legal uncertainty now resolved , the token has regained momentum, supported by both institutional interest and boosted use cases. Other factors that could support higher valuations include Ripple’s stablecoin developments, deeper integration with global payment corridors, and a continuation of the broader cryptocurrency bull market. In summary, Grok projects XRP to be valued at $3.25 on September 1, 2025, placing it slightly above current levels but short of the more aggressive targets circulating in the market.

This outlook is based on analysis by pseudonymous crypto expert Master Ananda , who noted in an August 22 TradingView post that XRP established its main low during the week of July 28 and has since formed a higher low, signaling renewed strength. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Price action has currently stalled at the 13-day exponential moving average ( EMA ), where selling pressure was quickly absorbed, leading to a full recovery of losses within hours, a bullish development. According to Ananda , this rapid rebound indicates room for continued upside, with the retracement phase now appearing to be over. At the same time, the recent pullback that culminated in a drop below $3, has lasted five weeks since the July 14 peak, aligning with a standard retracement period before the continuation of the main trend. With support confirmed, Ananda projects that XRP is likely to resume its upward trajectory. The first price target stands at $4.44, with the primary short- to mid-term objective set at $6.28. XRP price fundamentals Beyond technicals, XRP is also supported by fundamentals that could trigger a rally. Most notably, following the conclusion of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against Ripple, attention has shifted to the potential approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). To this end, on August 22, a wave of asset managers, including Canary, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Grayscale, and Bitwise, submitted amended registration statements for proposed XRP ETFs. The move came after a federal appeals court formally dismissed the SEC’s case against Ripple, clearing the way for issuers to act quickly. Bloomberg Intelligence now estimates approval odds for XRP ETFs at 95%. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $3.03, up more than 7% in the past 24 hours, though down 3% on the weekly chart. XRP seven-day price chart.

The agencies claimed they wanted to encourage more equitable competition and promote openness in the digital economy. Per their joint announcement, the draft regulations are intended to plug regulatory gaps in internet pricing, especially in price presentation, algorithm-driven adjustments, and dynamic promotions. The draft calls on platforms to disclose fee charges, promotions, and subsidies clearly The NDRC said the draft rules would ban online platforms from using unfair methods such as reducing store traffic or pulling products off shelves to squeeze the merchants’ pricing autonomy. It added that the regulation also sets behavior, accountability, and data use standards while encouraging cooperation among regulators, industry organizations, and platform operators. According to the draft, without consumer knowledge, platforms may not use big-data profiling to alter prices or fees for the same product or service under identical conditions—based on factors like consumers’ willingness or ability to pay, preferences, or habits. Market platforms would also need to display prices and be more transparent on promotions, subsidies, price discrimination, variable quotas, and ranking systems. Per the commission, all these rules would promote fair competition. It affirmed, “The platform economy involves many operators whose pricing behavior directly affects consumers. Refining these rules will help ensure orderly, fair competition and protect the rights of both businesses and consumers.” So far, the agency has also invited public comments on the proposal for a month. China’s top regulator also proposed new rules in May Vendors have long complained that leading platforms distorted prices to encourage sales, and consumers have raised issues about misleading pricing tactics. Alibaba, for example, was slapped with a record $2.75 billion fine in 2021 over antitrust violations, which the enterprise accepted. Nonetheless, major e-commerce firms have since dismissed regulatory threats while intensifying competition in “instant retail.” A few months ago, China’s top market regulator had proposed new rules to standardize commission fees on e-commerce platforms , promoting fairness and transparency. The announcement even prompted a decline in Meituan’s share price. The Chinese government also ended the practice of e-commerce platforms enforcing customer refunds on behalf of buyers, as reported earlier by Cryptopolitan . Now only merchants will have the authority to initiate refunds, giving them greater control over transactions. Previously, platforms could process refunds without merchant approval, allowing customers to receive reimbursements without returning goods. This approach, which began in 2021 with PDD Holdings leading the way, was intended to improve customer satisfaction and streamline disputes. However, the policy resulted in significant financial losses for merchants, who often lost both their products and revenue. The newly announced guideline, titled Compliance Guide for Online Trading Platform Fees, was posted on the State Administration for Market Regulation’s website, to which the watchdog claimed it covered all internet platforms that provided online storefronts, facilitated deals, shared information, and delivered services. It further noted that the proposals would lessen the burdens on vendors and boost small and medium-sized businesses. Per the draft, platforms would have to shoulder social responsibility during natural disasters or public health crises by cutting or waiving commissions and reducing other fees. It also called on platforms to set fair pricing structures grounded in factors such as operating costs, contractual agreements, transaction norms, consumer habits, and similar considerations. Furthermore, it stated that platforms should reinforce pre-compliance review structures to ensure charges remain fair.

The financial markets, including crypto, quickly picked up his words as promises that there would be an interest rate cut as soon as September. Polymarket Agrees Given its success rate of over 90% in the past, Polymarket has become among the most reputable websites for different types of bets, including interest rate cuts. The odds for such reductions to be made as soon as September shot up in early August from 35% to almost 80% following some positive reports about the state of the US economy. However, they started to decline in the following weeks, especially after the hotter-than-expected PPI data from last week. The culmination was yesterday, when the odds plunged to 57% ahead of the highly anticipated speech by the Fed Chair from Jackson Hole. Fed Rate Cut Odds for September Although he failed to provide any precise details on when a rate cut will occur, he offered mild hints about a potential pivot in the central bank’s monetary policy. All financial markets reacted immediately. Crypto didn’t disappoint as ETH and BNB skyrocketed to new all-time highs, while BTC rose from under $112,000 to over $117,000 before correcting slightly. The focus is now on next month’s FOMC meeting, which will reveal whether Powell indeed intends to implement a rate cut, a move that US President Donald Trump has urged for months. The odds on Polymarket are in favor of such a rate reduction, as they jumped to 78% for a 25 bps cut. Impact of Powell’s Speech CryptoPotato spoke with Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, about the impact of Powell’s comments and what investors can expect now. “While he opened the door to potential rate cuts, his emphasis on tariff-driven inflation and careful evaluation suggests the Fed won’t rush into aggressive easing. This measured approach creates an interesting dynamic for risk assets like Ethereum.” ETH has indeed performed better than BTC in the hours after the meeting, which could be a first sign of what is to follow. Bitcoin has already tapped new all-time highs several times this year, while Ethereum just managed to do so yesterday. Consequently, Kazmierczak seemed more bullish on the second-largest digital asset. “Looking ahead, if the Fed does initiate a modest easing cycle while maintaining its data-dependent approach, this could provide the final catalyst for ETH to break through the $4,800-$5,000 resistance zone and establish new all-time highs.” However, Kazmierczak also cautioned that Powell’s “careful tone” could indicate that any rally will need to be “supported by continued fundamental adoption rather than purely monetary policy speculation.” The post September Rate Cut Odds Surge After Powell, What’s Next for BTC and ETH? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Federal Reserve|Jerome Powell,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-08-23 11:18:01

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.035 in stage 6 of presale. Investors in the project are set to enjoy at least 400% ROI as MUTM starts trading in the market. Mutuum Finance has reached $14.75 million raised and more than 15550 token purchasers. Mutuum Finance is set to benefit from Ethereum’s bull rally, which can make way for strong market movement. PEPE Coin: Holding Steady Amid Market Shifts PEPE is presently trading at $0.00001068, a 4.92% increase over the past 24 hours. Despite this gain, the token has fallen 12.90% over the past week. PEPE is now ranked 30 by market capitalization, with a market cap of approximately $4.5 billion and a circulating supply of approximately 420 trillion tokens. The price action in recent times is partly attributable to PEPE’s bullish reversal, which has attracted new liquidity and community interest. Some analysts caution, however, that PEPE’s price may be exposed to downward pressure in the near future, with some estimates pointing to a push lower to $0.000008 by August 25, 2025. In the broader market, the resurgence of Ethereum (ETH) has served to spark renewed interest in a whole host of altcoins, including PEPE. Newer projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining prominence in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale in 2025 has been a massive success.

The agency mentioned that victims who would love to help them in the ongoing investigations of some suspects should report to its Ibadan and Lagos 2 Zonal Directorates. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the EFCC got the approval from the federal high court in Abuja to arrest and retain six promoters associated with the CBEX investment platform in April. According to the application, six people, including Adefowora Olanipekun, Adefowora Oluwanisola, Emmanuel Uko, Seyi Oloyede, Avwerosuo Otorudo, and Chukwuebuka Ehirim, were all being held responsible for over $1 billion worth of investment fraud. EFCC urges CBEX victims to assist with investigations In its statement , the EFCC says it prefers input from individuals who dealt directly with some of the detained promoters at the CBEX offices in Ibadan. The victims were asked to visit the EFCC. The agency made the call in a statement that it shared on its official X handle on Friday, with the detailed statement signed by the EFCC Head, Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale. The EFCC claimed that CBEX led to serious financial losses for Nigerians who invested their life savings under the promises of unrealistic returns on investments. The agency had previously mentioned that the individuals detained had used their company to promote the scam by creating ads and misleading the general public. According to the EFCC, the defendants promised the victims unrealistic returns on up to 100% of their investments in several advertisements they made. Court documents showed that victims initially had access to their investment page on the platforms to keep an eye on their investments and potential rewards. However, things started to go from bad to worse after they realized they could no longer access the CBEX website or get back their funds from the investments they made on the platform. Suspects plead not guilty in court EFCC mentioned that out of the initial six suspects it detained, it is currently prosecuting three, Adefowora Abiodun Olanipekun, Otorudo Avwerosuo, and Justice Ehirim Chukwuebuka, for their “alleged involvement in the fraudulent online cryptocurrency trading platform called CBEX.” Court documents showed that Otorudo and Ehirim were arraigned by the EFCC before Judge Mohammed Umar of the Federal High Court in Abuja on July 7. Several reports showed that the pair were eventually granted bail for 10 million naira each, with two sureties in like sum. Documents also showed that Olaonipekun, alongside his company ST Technologies International Limited, was also arraigned in the same court on July 18. In one of the charges read before the court, the EFCC alleged that between January 2024 and May 2025, the defendants urged members of the public to deposit money for a fixed term or payable on call through CBEX. They promised up to 88% return on investment without obtaining written consent from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the EFCC, the group allegedly violated Section 1 of the Investment and Securities Act, 2025, and is punishable under Section 96(5) of the same Act. The suspects pleaded not guilty to the offenses. However, the EFCC wants victims who invested funds directly in the scheme to come forward to assist the commission in its investigations, which will likely see them serve as witnesses to prove that the suspects invited the general public to invest in CBEX via their ads.

The move comes as bulls regained full control of the market following a remarkable 14% surge on Friday, marking one of the strongest single-day performances of the year. Related Reading: TRON Spot Market Signals Relief – Seller Dominance Weakens After Cycle High The rally was ignited by remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium. In his speech, Powell hinted at a potential easing of US monetary policy, stating that restrictive conditions may no longer be appropriate as risks shift. The market reaction was immediate: within minutes, both equities and cryptocurrencies spiked sharply, with Ethereum leading the charge in the altcoin sector. At the same time, derivatives market data confirms the intensity of the move. Open Interest (OI) surged aggressively as traders piled into leveraged positions, reflecting renewed speculative appetite. The sudden influx of liquidity added fuel to Ethereum’s rally, pushing price momentum beyond its multi-year resistance level. With ETH now in uncharted territory, analysts see potential for continuation as long as OI expansion does not overheat into excessive leverage. The coming weeks will determine whether this breakout sustains or turns into another volatile correction. Ethereum Derivatives Signal Historic Momentum Ethereum’s breakout into new highs is being reinforced by extraordinary action in the derivatives market. According to top analyst Maartunn, at least $3.18 billion in new positions have entered Ethereum derivatives within just 24 hours, pushing Open Interest (OI) up nearly 10%. He described this as “insane stuff,” highlighting the scale and speed at which traders are positioning for the next move. This surge in OI indicates aggressive speculation, with investors betting on Ethereum’s momentum continuing after breaching its 2021 all-time high. While higher OI often fuels rallies by injecting liquidity, it can also create sharp volatility if leveraged positions unwind. Still, the magnitude of the inflows reflects growing conviction in ETH’s upside potential. At the same time, Ethereum’s Taker Buy Volume (hourly) has reached a multi-month high of $5.76 billion. This metric, which captures aggressive market buy orders, shows that demand is not just speculative but also immediate. Such strong taker-side activity often coincides with breakout phases, when bulls dominate both spot and derivatives markets.

Price Surges To Retest New Highs The 4-hour ETH chart shows Ethereum exploding higher, pushing above $4,800 after a sharp breakout from recent consolidation. This surge follows a bounce near the 100-period SMA (green line around $4,298), where bulls defended support aggressively before sending the price into a vertical move. Ethereum is now retesting its previous all-time high region around $4,860, with momentum signaling strong buying pressure. The 50-period SMA (blue line) is turning upward again, confirming a short-term bullish structure. Meanwhile, the 200-period SMA (red line around $3,994) remains comfortably below the price, showing the broader uptrend is intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Transfers Collapse: Lowest Since Bull Market Peak In 2021 This rally also broke through a series of lower highs formed during the recent pullback, suggesting that bearish control has faded. Volume spikes during the breakout add confidence to the strength of this move. If bulls sustain momentum, Ethereum could enter price discovery, targeting the $5,000 psychological level. However, if rejection occurs at $4,860, ETH may retest the $4,400–$4,500 support zone, where the moving averages converge. The chart highlights a critical phase: Ethereum either continues its breakout toward new highs or consolidates before another attempt. Bulls clearly hold the upper hand after this explosive breakout.

The stage is set.,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/08/23/genius-was-just-the-prologue-stablecoins-represent-a-platform-shift-in-payments-the-stage-is-set,"Every era of economic transformation has begun the same way: with infrastructure that seems niche – until it isn’t. Early irrigation systems unlocked the first cities. Early railroad networks rewired entire economies. The internet’s core protocols, TCP/IP, turned slow and siloed information networks into a single, global system of communication. And the Cloud turned idle servers into the foundation of the digital economy. We don’t remember them for how they started. We remember them for how they scaled. Because in effect, what once looked like niche experiments became the backbone of global markets. Stablecoins are next. Welcome to the age of the stablecoin layer: an open, programmable foundation for global money movement. Just last year, stablecoins lacked clear regulation and were dismissed by much of the financial establishment. Fast forward a matter of months, and the U.S. Congress has passed the GENIUS Act, creating the country’s first federal framework for stablecoins and defining them explicitly as payment instruments. Major banks and card networks have entered this space. Early-movers like Circle have made their Wall Street debut. And fintech leaders from Stripe to Shopify are embracing stablecoins to power faster, cheaper, always-on transactions. These aren’t isolated milestones. They’re early signs that stablecoins are on track to become core infrastructure, just like AWS became the quiet engine of the cloud economy. Stablecoins represent a platform shift in payments. Just like prior platform shifts – mainframe computing to individual computers, desktop to mobile, and on-premises to cloud-based infrastructure – stablecoins will unlock a wave of innovation by modernizing financial infrastructure. This is the tipping point, but it’s also only the beginning, and too many people are still thinking far too small. To many, dollars are still shackled to outdated infrastructure like wire transfers and ACH. None of it is built for composability, automation, or machine-to-machine interaction as is required in the modern age. It’s a slow-motion relic holding back an interconnected, global economy that wants to move faster and include more people. Until we modernize the rails, we’re capping the true velocity of money – and with it, global economic potential. Stablecoins snap that bind. No bank holidays, no middlemen, no concept of business days or hours. Just global, cheap, and instantaneous settlement at scales of billions of dollars at a time. That transformation is as fundamental as turning mail into email. Stablecoins offer what legacy financial infrastructure simply can’t: instant settlement, borderless reach, low costs, and programmable design. They will disrupt more than any other crypto building block – rewriting payments, liquifying capital markets, and bringing the internet’s speed and interoperability to money itself. This shift goes well beyond payments between people. Stablecoins will also underpin the next phase of AI-native commerce as sovereign AI agents abandon legacy fiat systems in favor of decentralized money that flows freely across blockchain infrastructure. This will power automated treasury flows, agentic commerce, machine-to-machine transactions, and sovereign AI agent transactions. Money is getting an upgrade. The stablecoin layer isn’t just a new system, it’s a new substrate for the global economy. The velocity of money movement is positively correlated with economic growth. Stablecoins will unlock trillions in latent economic activity and help grow global GDP by full percentage points each year. And all of this activity will be AI-native. Yet for all the progress, the opportunity is still in its infancy. The GENIUS Act was a critical milestone, but it’s still one piece of legislation. And while the stablecoin market cap sits at over $280 billion today, the U.S. M2 money supply – the total amount of money circulating within the US economy – exceeds $20 trillion. That’s nearly a 100:1 gap. We’re still underselling how fast and forceful the shift to the stablecoin standard will be, and how quickly AI will accelerate it. Put simply, this summer marked only the soft launch of the stablecoin era. The infrastructure is in place, and the scale of what’s coming far exceeds the conversation today. This shift won’t be loud, and that’s by design. In a few years, no one will say they’re “using stablecoins,” just like nobody says they’re “using cloud computing” to store pictures of their kids. They’ll just use money. And stablecoins will be the infrastructure powering it all behind the scenes, moving billions across the globe in real time. The biggest winners in this transition will be the platforms operating behind the scenes: those who power the rails, provide liquidity, and earn our trust. Fintechs will use stablecoins for instant settlement and global reach. Governments – eventually, reluctantly – will integrate stablecoins into critical economic functions. AI agents will speak the language of stablecoins natively. This isn’t a bet on crypto hype. It’s a recognition that our financial system needs an upgrade, and stablecoins are the gateway. They’re not just a better form of money; they’re the onramp to the onchain economy. Once users hold stablecoins, they’re one step away from accessing a global, open, and programmable financial system. That’s why the stablecoin layer isn’t just the most important sector in crypto – it’s the foundation for the future of digital currency.",Opinion|Coinbase|US Congress|Stablecoin|Opinion,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-23 11:38:30

Wang described the deal as a “technical collaboration between our research teams,” signaling work that goes beyond simply enabling Midjourney inside Meta’s apps. The announcement arrives as Meta pours resources into what it calls AI “superintelligence” in an effort to keep pace with OpenAI and Google. Zuckerberg has offered big pay packages to recruit researchers. Wang joined after Meta paid $14.3 billion for 49% of Scale AI, the company he co-founded. The deal supports Meta’s plan to add AI images across its apps. Meta AI shows a feed of AI images and videos, Facebook has a “create AI image” button, and WhatsApp and Instagram let you make images in chats. Midjourney became prominent for its image and video generators. As the tech company expands the Meta AI app’s social feed, it may lean on Midjourney’s approach to help users produce more polished visuals. “We are incredibly impressed by Midjourney,” Wang said . “They have accomplished true feats of technical and aesthetic excellence, and we are thrilled to be working more closely with them.” He said both companies will share more “soon.” Even with the collaboration, Midjourney remains “an independent, community-backed research lab” with “no investors,” founder and CEO David Holz said. Meta brings in another Apple AI expert amid hiring freeze According to people with knowledge of the situation, the company is bringing aboard another senior Apple AI leader after Cryptopolitan reported that the company prepares to slow hiring . Frank Chu, who has led Apple teams focused on cloud infrastructure, training, and search, will join Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL, the people said. At Apple, Chu helped operate large language models on the company’s cloud servers, oversaw parts of model training, and contributed to search features for Siri and Apple’s entertainment services. Chu is at least the sixth Apple AI-models staffer to head to Meta. The departures began in July, when Ruoming Pang, who created Apple’s models team, left for a $200 million package at Meta. Since then, AI engineers Tom Gunter, Mark Lee, Bowen Zhang, and Yun Zhu have also departed for Meta. Aside from Pang, Chu is the most notable exit given his remit and seniority. He served as a lieutenant to Benoit Dupin, Apple’s executive overseeing AI infrastructure, who reports to John Giannandrea, Apple’s AI strategy chief. Chu is slated to join a new unit called MSL Infra responsible for AI infrastructure at Meta. Earlier this week, Meta reorganized its AI organization into four groups, all reporting to Wang. Meta’s AI talent raid undermines Apple’s efforts In a memo to hiring managers, the company wrote the pause “will allow leadership to thoughtfully plan our 2026 headcount growth, as we work through our strategy.” The memo also said, “Alex’s staff will evaluate any business critical hires on a case by case basis.” Wang, however, said in a social media pos t Th ursday that Meta is “investing more and more into Meta Superintelligence Labs.” For Apple, the departures add turbulence to an AI push already trying to make up ground. The company has delayed a high-profile Siri update. Following a leadership shake-up , Apple is weighing the use of third-party AI models for the voice assistant instead of relying solely on its own technology. That shift, together with Pang’s exit, unsettled Apple’s AI models team and accelerated the talent drain.

Experts Say Layer Brett Today Is Like Buying DOGE in 2014,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-presale-right-now-experts-say-layer-brett-today-is-like-buying-doge-in-2014/,"The best crypto to buy now is a hot debate, especially with the surge of meme coins and Layer 2 solutions. The current crypto presale for Layer Brett offers a unique entry point, reminiscent of buying DOGE during its early days. Unlike older meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk, Layer Brett leverages Ethereum Layer 2 technology for lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low gas fees. While Dogecoin and Brett (original) remain popular, they face scalability and cost limitations. In contrast, Layer Brett’s foundation as a Layer 2 crypto means it processes transactions off-chain, reducing gas fees to pennies and boosting speed. This technological leap gives it an edge over legacy meme tokens like Bonk, which struggles with congestion, and Pepe, known for volatile price swings but lacking real scalability. How $LBRETT rewards early buyers Analysts call Layer Brett the best crypto to buy now because its presale price is just $0.0047 per token. Early adopters can stake their $LBRETT and earn staking rewards of over 2,500% APY, with some rates reported as high as 55,000% for initial participants. This is a massive opportunity compared to established coins like DOGE, Brett (original), or Bonk, where staking rewards are minimal or nonexistent. Key benefits for early $LBRETT buyers: Immediate staking with high APY through the dApp Flexible buy-in using ETH, USDT, or BNB via MetaMask or Trust Wallet Gamified staking and NFT integrations for active ecosystem rewards Transparent tokenomics with only 10 billion total supply What makes Layer Brett different from Brett (original), DOGE, Pepe, and Shiba Inu Unlike Brett (original), which originated on Base without real utility, Layer Brett is engineered for performance and community rewards. Shiba Inu and Pepe have built large followings, but their growth is often driven by hype rather than technological innovation. Bonk has shown high trading volume but remains highly volatile with limited real-world use. Layer Brett combines meme power with true blockchain utility. Its DeFi coin mechanics, transparent tokenomics, and focus on community-driven rewards set it apart. The ongoing $1 million giveaway and active community campaigns further fuel its rapid adoption, something competitors like Dogecoin and Bonk struggle to match. Why the crypto community is getting behind Layer Brett The crypto community is rallying behind Layer Brett for several reasons: Crypto presale access at early-entry pricing with high upside Cutting-edge scalability as a Layer 2 blockchain Staking rewards far exceeding those of Brett (original), DOGE, Bonk, or Pepe Fully decentralized, no KYC, and self-custodial ethos Transparent roadmap with NFT and DeFi integrations on the horizon Buzzwords like next big crypto, top meme coin, and best meme coins are already being used to describe Layer Brett. Its blend of meme culture and real utility positions it as a frontrunner for the crypto bull run 2025. Conclusion: Don’t miss the best crypto to buy now Layer Brett is still in presale, but not for long. With a smaller market cap than Dogecoin, Bonk, or Brett (original), the upside potential is enormous. Early investors can lock in massive APY by staking immediately and join a community primed for explosive growth. Don’t wait—secure your spot in the most scalable, rewarding, and community-driven memecoin project to launch on Ethereum Layer 2. Visit the official website to buy at $0.0047 and stake $LBRETT today.

Bitcoin is hovering at $116,000, while tokens like Pudgy Penguin, Arbitrum, and AAVE are leading with over 15% gains. Crypto market rally sparked by Jerome Powell speech The ongoing crypto market rally was sparked by Jerome Powell who had a closely-watched speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming on Friday. This speech came at a difficult time for the US economy, with data showing that it is teetering on the verge of a stagflation. The labor market has cooled, with the unemployment rate ticking upward, reaching 4.2% in July. The BLS downgraded the previous month’s two reports and indicated that the economy created just 35k jobs in June and May. It added 73k jobs in July, a figure that will come down in the next revision. US inflation, especially in the producer side, is also ticking upwards and recently jumped to 3.7%. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, rose to 3.1%. S a result, faced with these numbers, the central bank has a choice to make. It can cut interest rates with the goal of boosting the labor market, a move that would risk inflation rising. On the other hand, the bank can decide to maintain higher rates and hope that inflation will come down. The challenge is that this inflation is not organic, rather, it is an artificial one caused by Donald Trump’s tariffs. In his statement, Powell leaned on the former side and noted that his focus in the next meetings will be to safeguard the labor market. He said: “Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.” Crypto sentiment was weak before his speech The crypto market rally happened as investors now believe that the Fed will cut interest rates in the September 17 meeting. Cryptocurrencies and other risky assets do well when the Fed is cutting interest rates. However, there are chances that the crypto market rally would happen even if he had delivered a highly hawkish statement. That is because market participants expect the bank to ultimately cut interest rates either later this year or in 2026 when Trump replaces Jerome Powell. Also, the market sentiment was weak before the speech. Bitcoin was down from the all-time high of $124,200 to a low of $112,000 and Ethereum moving much lower. As such, chances are that market participants would have bought the dip. This is the opposite of buying the rumor and selling the news.

The most likely scenario is where the crypto market continues the ongoing rally. That’s because there are still catalysts that will push it higher in the longer term. In addition to the potential interest rate cuts, there is strong demand from investors as evidenced by the rising ETF inflows and the rising number of crypto treasury companies. Further, top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin have formed bullish chart patterns. Most importantly, the SEC will approve spot crypto ETFs later this year, boosting their prices.

In this article, we will also show you which entities are selling ETH and who is buying. Hint: the US President is involved. ETHUSD. Source: TradingView Has the Time Come? The chart above paints a picture worth a million dollars. It shows how ETH, which was once among the poorest performers in 2025, turned the tables and skyrocketed from under $2,200 marked on June 23 to an all-time high of $4,900 two months later, on August 22. From a percentage perspective, this mindblowing rally represents a 130% surge in roughly 60 days. A lot changed for Ethereum along the way. Investors went wild for its underlying asset, which is evident from the massive inflows in the ETH ETFs as well as the growing number of tokens purchased by many Ethereum treasury companies. But, still, the essential question for ETH investors has popped up – has the time come to sell (at least some portions)? #ETH is up over 100% after one month Now is a good time – Realise BIG profits! Gave you ETH to buy low, and now sell high Many will regret in the next weeks.. https://t.co/f87L1Ov4bi pic.twitter.com/QiXSS9dT1c — Doctor Profit (@DrProfitCrypto) August 23, 2025 Doctor Profit seems to think so. The self-described “elite trader, master of x100” believes ETH investors should realize “BIG” profits. This wouldn’t be a surprise in the crypto market. Recall that profit-taking went through the roof for both XRP and BTC in July and August as the assets charted new all-time highs of their own. Matrixport has apparently adopted Doctor Profit’s approach, as several of the company’s wallets have made substantial deposits into Binance and OKX, with the most likely intention of selling $450 million worth of ETH. Multiple wallets linked to #Matrixport deposited 95,873 $ETH ($452M) into #Binance and #OKX over the past 3 hours. https://t.co/NKiO55cVOy https://t.co/U8AXgsVjSW pic.twitter.com/DFEJatM4LA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 23, 2025 But They Are Buying In contrast to the above is the approach undertaken by this Bitcoin OG , who sold large BTC portions only to buy ETH spot and open long Ethereum positions. The mysterious wallet has only doubled down on their ETH position since yesterday. This Bitcoin OG deposited another 300 $BTC ($34.86M) into Hyperliquid to sell for $ETH an hour ago.

According to Lookonchain, the team spent $5 million USDC to acquire an additional 1,076 ETH. Obviously, the question of whether it’s time to sell is a very personal one and it depends on the investor’s current financial situation and risk appetite.

Imagine setting aside just $10 every week for XRP, starting back in 2013. What might have seemed like spare change then could have turned into life-changing wealth today. As investors revisit these long-term strategies, many are also turning their attention to new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has already raised $12.5 million in record time and is drawing comparisons to the early days of other breakout coins. The Discipline Behind Dollar-Cost Averaging The $10-a-week XRP plan is built on dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Instead of betting on perfect timing, DCA means putting the same amount into the market at regular intervals, no matter the price. This smooths out volatility and removes the stress of trying to guess when to buy. Had someone started in 2013, when XRP traded below a penny, every $10 purchase stacked up thousands of tokens. Even as the price later climbed to $0.05 or $0.10, the strategy kept accumulating large amounts at very low costs. By the time XRP reached its all-time high of $3.84 in early 2018, those cheap buys would have ballooned into an extraordinary fortune. New Early-Stage Opportunity Raising Eyebrows While XRP’s story shows how discipline pays off, today’s investors are searching for the next project with similar upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming that story. With $12.5 million raised almost instantly and multiple rounds selling out, it’s already proving demand is huge. Analysts highlight that early backers are seeing gains before major listings, and history suggests projects with this kind of momentum often reward those who act early. What the Numbers Say Over 12 years, a $10-a-week plan would equal about $6,240 invested. But here’s the catch: much of that money bought XRP when it was under $0.10. At today’s price, just the tokens from those early years alone would already be worth tens of thousands. At the 2025 peak, the total value could have soared into the millions , transforming small weekly contributions into a once-in-a-lifetime windfall. Even during downturns, DCA kept building the stash at bargain prices, setting the stage for every rebound. Lessons for Today’s Investors The $10-a-week XRP journey highlights a few timeless rules: Consistency beats speculation. Dollar-cost averaging thrives in volatile markets. Starting small can still lead to massive gains. Holding through years—not weeks—often brings the biggest rewards. Conclusion The $10-a-week XRP strategy shows that patient investing can turn pocket change into serious wealth, especially when buying at early prices below $0.10. For today’s market, new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE are being eyed in the same light, with record fundraising hinting at explosive potential. The lesson is clear: steady accumulation and early positioning can change the game.

However, following yesterday’s Federal Reserve announcement regarding a possible interest rate cut, the market found support at a key level and bounced. If this zone continues to hold, BTC could be primed for another upward rally. By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, Bitcoin has recently broken below its long-term ascending channel, signalling a potential trend reversal. Yet, with the likelihood of an upcoming interest rate cut, the price has rebounded strongly from the $110K support zone, which also aligns with the 100-day moving average. At the same time, the RSI is hovering near 50, reflecting market indecision and neutral momentum. As long as the price remains beneath the lower boundary of the broken channel, the risk of a deeper decline, with the 200-day moving average being a potential target near the $100K area, persists. However, if the current rebound gathers strength, a rally toward the $130K region and possibly higher remains a likely scenario. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights the recent price action with more clarity. As soon as Bitcoin touched the $112K support, which aligns with the major low from early August, the market reacted sharply to the interest rate news, triggering a nearly vertical rally toward the $117K resistance zone. While momentum currently favors the buyers, the $117K level remains a key hurdle. If this resistance holds, the price could easily retreat back to the $112K support level or even lower. A decisive breakdown of this support zone would likely trigger a wave of long liquidations, potentially driving the market down toward the critical $100K level, which is the make-or-break area for the broader uptrend. Onchain Analysis Funding Rates Bitcoin’s funding rates have remained consistently positive for an extended period, showing that the derivatives market continues to lean toward bullish positioning. While there have been small liquidation phases along the way, these corrections have not shifted the overall bias, as the futures market sentiment is still positive. What’s notable is that the magnitude of the current funding rates is nowhere near the extreme peaks observed during previous major price tops. This suggests that the market is not yet overly overheated, leaving room for the bullish trend to continue potentially. However, in a positive funding environment, the risk of a liquidation cascade always lingers. If key support levels break, long traders could be forced out rapidly, intensifying the downside move and triggering a sharp correction.

A trader who multiplied his original holding of $125,000 to over $43 million in four months lost almost all that money in two days, as Ethereum temporarily dipped below $4,000. The episode shows how risky and unstable strategies that rely too much on leverage can be. After seeing the heavy losses, many investors are rethinking their approach. They are now looking at diversification and exploring smaller altcoins. One of the projects attracting attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is quickly gaining popularity as a new option . From Millions to Almost Nothing The liquidation happened on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. The trader lost $6.2 million and was left with just 770000 after ETH crashed. Lookonchain, a blockchain tracker, commented on the event and said it is one of the most astonishing turnarounds in a long time. Other large-name traders also sustained huge losses. Even James Wynn, a long-term DeFi maximalist, has admitted to being reduced in size. He said the aggressive all-in bet had turned out to be a naked move, and he would tighten his belt should the altcoin sailing season fail to happen. The New Altcoin that Gains Investor Attention Ethereum smart investors are interested in diversifying into smaller-cap altcoins, and MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the most regarded. The project is gaining traction fast, with analysts pegging it at a potential 50x multiplier before major exchanges add it. Its complete audit, growing ecosystem, and fast-expanding community are making MAGACOIN FINANCE comparable to the early years of ETH after its ICO. Some of the early adopters are acting swiftly before access levels become restricted. With $12.5 million received in record speed, analysts have high hopes about this next unknown gem. Whales Dump While Opportunists Buy Ethereum whales also exhibited sudden trends as a result of the turbulence. According to on-chain data, big holders sold almost 147 million in ETH during the dip. However, not all of them rushed to exit the coin. More opportunistic traders took advantage of the sell-off, and some ended up acquiring multi-million dollar sums at discounted prices. Even the wallet linked to the infamous Radiant Capital exploit had apparently bought more than $16 million worth of ETH. All Eyes on the Federal Reserve Looking ahead, the next big move in the market may be decided by factors outside of crypto charts. Investors will be paying close attention to the speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in Jackson Hole on Friday. Researchers at Nexo believe that the direction of monetary policy and the signals given by interest rates can dictate whether Ethereum can rally significantly or continue its bearish push. Conclusion The fluctuations of Ethereum experienced in the last week remind investors of just how volatile the cryptocurrency world is. With traders losing millions of dollars within hours, other traders are betting that the dips will give them chances. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most highly anticipated new altcoins. Investors want to be first in line to invest before it goes to the market.

While familiar names continue to dominate headlines, smart money is increasingly watching Remittix , a project combining real-world payment infrastructure with deflationary tokenomics. Already raising more than $20.7 million and selling over 614 million tokens at $0.0969, Remittix has confirmed a BitMart listing and a wallet beta launch in Q3. With a $250,000 community giveaway live and additional exchange announcements imminent, many investors now call Remittix the best crypto to buy now. Remittix positioned for explosive Q4 growth Remittix has already secured a solid foundation, having sold over 614 million tokens at $0.0969 and raised more than $20.7 million to date. This momentum unlocked a BitMart CEX listing, and the next listing is scheduled once Remittix passes $22 million, promising significantly wider liquidity and exposure. Its PayFi features span 40+ tokens, enabling real-time transfers and utility. Analysts now forecast 35× to 50× returns heading into 2026, positioning Remittix among the most compelling utility-driven cryptos this cycle. What Sets Remittix Apart This Season Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Built for adoption, not speculation Wallet beta launching this quarter (Q3 2025) Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Audited by CertiK for trust and transparency This utility-first structure, combined with its funding and delivery schedule, sets Remittix apart in a crowded market. Real utility + milestones = high growth opportunity Remittix offers a different narrative. Well-funded, focused on cross-border utility and backed by exchange access and wallet infrastructure, it could rise far faster. For those chasing outsized returns, Remittix appears to offer a more aggressive alternative, one grounded in delivery, not just hopeful charts. If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy now, experts increasingly point to Remittix as a utility-first standout. With over 613 million tokens sold, a $0.0969 launch price, and $20.7 million raised, it’s already delivered what many projects only promise. The convergence of the $250K giveaway, the Q3 wallet beta launch, and the upcoming CEX listing frames Q4 as a potential breakout window. For investors balancing caution with asymmetrical upside, Remittix may offer the rare blend of foundation and opportunity.

At 32, she framed her plan as a direct question to the community, asking whether such a strategy could realistically provide the means for early retirement. Her post blended personal ambition with a wider curiosity about XRP’s long-term potential, prompting a mix of encouragement, skepticism, and practical advice from other users. I am 32 years old and I plan to hold $XRP for 8 years. I want to achieve financial freedom and retirement through XRP at the age of 40. Is this wish possible? pic.twitter.com/tF2QDJBf0S — bernice (@crypto__peach) August 21, 2025 XRP Army Weighs In The post was greeted with mixed reactions. One contributor revealed that he retired at 45 due to his early investment in XRP. He further revealed that he is now 49. Another commenter noted that while early retirement is possible with XRP , she would need to start accumulating as much as possible before the price appreciates. One community member referenced an investment begun in 2017 to illustrate the effect of early entry and persistence. He bought XRP in 2017 at $0.20 and held the asset for 8 years. Today, XRP is worth $3, and analysts are anticipating a major rally in its immediate future . However, some replies were skeptical, with one arguing that other tokens could help with the early retirement goal, but XRP is not a great option.

The asset recently hit a new all-time high of $3.65 . However, XRP still has a long way to go for Bernice’s goal to become realistic. Factors that could drive such growth include increased adoption in cross-border payments, integration into institutional systems , and regulatory clarity that enhances trust. Ripple and the SEC recently concluded their legal battle, with the court approving their joint stipulation for dismissal of their appeals . With the lawsuit now over, XRP has a clearer path to higher targets with more clarity than other assets in the market.

The comment comes just hours after the U.S. abruptly canceled a major trade delegation visit, originally planned for August 25 through 29, which had been seen as a chance to dial back the tension before the rest of the penalties roll in. Indian products are now facing U.S. tariffs as high as 50%, some of the biggest trade penalties the Biden or Trump administrations have ever imposed on India. A 25% round has already kicked in, with another 25% set to be enforced on August 27. The trigger? India’s rising imports of Russian crude, a move that has irritated the White House even though other nations, like China and members of the European Union, are doing the exact same thing on a bigger scale. Jaishankar said there are non-negotiable issues India will not surrender, and that India’s farmers and small producers are top priority. “We have some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended,” he said during his speech at the Economic Times forum. He also made it clear that India isn’t going to let another country tell it what sectors to open or close. “It is our right to make decisions in our ‘national interest,’” he said. Jaishankar challenges tariff logic, points to hypocrisy The foreign minister pointed out that U.S. frustration over Indian-Russian trade feels selective. He questioned why Washington is going after India while larger buyers like China and European governments face no similar punishment. “If the argument is oil, then there are (other) big buyers. If argument is who is trading more (with Russia), then there are bigger traders,” Jaishankar said. He added that Europe’s trade volume with Moscow is higher than India’s, yet only India is being penalized. Even more confusing, Jaishankar said this oil issue wasn’t even part of earlier trade negotiations with Washington. The tariffs came later, without warning, and the U.S. never raised the matter in official meetings before announcing its penalties. He also described Trump’s approach to diplomacy as unorthodox: “We have not had a U.S. president who conducts his foreign policy so publicly as the current one and (it) is a departure from the traditional way of conducting business with the world.” These trade talks had already crashed once this year, when India refused to open its agricultural and dairy sectors to U.S. exporters. That refusal is still in place. And it’s part of the reason a deal is so hard to lock in. India doesn’t want outside pressure changing policies that affect its food security and job market. Right now, the total annual trade between the two countries is over $190 billion, but that number could take a hit. U.S. lawmaker downplays drama, says relationship remains strong On the U.S. side, Republican Congressman Michael Baumgartner tried to cool things down in an interview with NDTV. He said Donald Trump “respects” India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi “a lot”, and believes the situation will work itself out. “We know President Trump is a dealmaker, and he has a lot of respect for India. He also enjoyed his trip to India very much a few years ago. He values the relationship with PM Modi. I’m very optimistic that it will be worked out,” Baumgartner said. Baumgartner added that the high tariffs should be seen as pressure between allies, not hostility. “Well, I think sometimes you have to ask more of your friends, and it should really be interpreted, I think, as a sign of respect towards India that America is asking more of India,” he said. He admitted that India’s side might see it differently but emphasized that the overall ties remain solid. “And so the message I’ve communicated to your leaders is simply that the fundamentals between our two countries are very strong,” Baumgartner said.

According to him, temporary pullbacks or even daily closes below this level should not distract traders. The real signal, he insists, will only emerge once XRP consistently closes above $3.30. As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.03, after moving between $2.79 and $3.10 in the day’s session. The $3.30 Breakout Threshold EGRAG identifies $3.30 as the level where XRP’s momentum transforms from sideways movement into genuine breakout territory. In his analysis, only consecutive daily closes above this threshold will unlock the next stage of the rally. This makes $3.30 more than just a technical barrier—it represents the point where sentiment shifts decisively to the bullish side. #XRP – $3.30 Is the Target! Our objective is clear: $3.30! Any daily closure below this level is just noise; the real signal comes when we close above $3.30. That’s where the magic happens! Remember, $2.73 is our MACRO SUPPORT level, and it’s crucial for maintaining… pic.twitter.com/TQ0LddQbBb — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 23, 2025 The Role of Macro Support at $2.73 While the focus is firmly on the $3.30 breakout, EGRAG also highlights $2.73 as the crucial macro support level. As long as XRP holds this floor, the broader bullish structure remains intact. A decisive break below it, however, would signal weakening momentum and open the door to deeper consolidation. This level, therefore, serves as the foundation upon which the bullish objective rests. Where XRP Stands Now With XRP reclaiming the $3 handle , the market is pressing into a resistance zone between $3.10 and $3.30. The battle between buyers and sellers in this area will determine the short-term trajectory of the market. A strong daily close above $3.30 would confirm that resistance has been absorbed, paving the way for further gains. On the other hand, if sellers regain control, the market will likely retest local defenses at $2.90, with the stronger $2.73 floor waiting below as the ultimate support line. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Will Confirm the Next Rally According to EGRAG, XRP’s bullish trend will be confirmed not just by reaching $3.30, but by how the market performs after surpassing that level. Sustained daily closes above $3.30, supported by rising trading volumes and improving momentum indicators, would provide the clearest evidence that XRP is ready for the next major leg upward. Failure to achieve this, coupled with repeated rejections and a breakdown of $2.73, would suggest the market is not yet prepared for liftoff. Looking Ahead EGRAG Crypto’s analysis provides a precise roadmap for XRP traders: $3.30 marks the breakout gateway, while $2.73 serves as the foundation that must hold. With XRP trading near $3.03 today, the market sits at the edge of this critical battle zone . The direction of XRP’s next move – whether it’s a breakout into a new bullish phase or continued consolidation – will be determined by upcoming daily closes. For now, all attention is on the $3.30 threshold, because that is where, in EGRAG’s words, “soon we shall fly so high.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

50540957,563980,1755950917,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50540957.jpeg,"Ethereum Breaks $4,880 ATH as GENIUS Act Pushes for Fall Implementation, Hyping Up $BEST",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-hits-ath-of-4880-best-rally-coming/,"Ethereum surged by over 15% today, which catapulted it to an ATH of $4,885, higher than the 2021 ATH of $4,868. The boost all took place in one day, with $ETH jumping from $4,231 to $4,885 and keeping its momentum even after dropping below the $4,800 mark. At the time of writing this article, Ethereum is hovering around $4,700 , which may suggest a consolidation phase before the next push. While we may explain the increased investor interest as dip buying, this time may be different, as Trump’s GENIUS Act has just entered its months-long implementation phase. Ethereum’s Surge Hints at a Coming Alt Season This Fall Ethereum’s recent performance is an indicator of bigger things to come. Trump’s GENIUS Act is currently the force behind the 2025 market thanks to the many changes it brings. The act now forces stablecoin issuers to back their stablecoin reserves on a 1:1 ratio with liquid assets like government bonds and the US dollar. It also offers more clarity by requiring issuers to disclose their reserves monthly and focuses on protecting investors against scams and illicit crypto activity. The Act has now entered its implementation phase, with the Treasury Department issuing a ‘Request for Comment Related to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins,’ The directive offers interested individuals and companies the opportunity to ‘provide feedback on innovative or novel methods, techniques, or strategies that regulated financial institutions use, or could potentially use, to detect illicit activity involving digital assets.’ The GENIUS Act is creating a safer, more stable, and more predictable crypto landscape, which explains the surge in investor confidence. Ethereum is naturally reaping the benefits, seeing how it’s been on a sustained push throughout August, doubling in value in less than 30 days. More importantly, we may see additional gains as we push into the fall and more investors join the buy spree, which is already in full force. According to CoinGecko data , 11 public institutions hold almost 2.8M $ETH or over 2.3% of the total supply. Bitmine is leading in the top with an $ETH reserve of 1.5M coins, valued at $7.1B. Ethereum’s chart performance is likely to accelerate as the market rallies and Bitcoin recovers its lost ground. In that context, projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) could see a surge in investor interest. Why Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is Eyeing Massive Gains in 2025 Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is one of the best presales of 2025 after it raised over $15M so far. $BEST trades at the presale price of $0.025515 and supports the Best Wallet ecosystem, which aims to take over 40% of the crypto wallet market share by 2026. $BEST offers not only great value, given that it’s trading at its presale price now, but also a variety of perks for holders. These include reduced transaction fees, community governance rights, and even exclusive access to partnered presales before they go public. Because it supports Best Wallet, $BEST shows a lot of long-term growth potential. Our analysts expect the token to surge post launch, with our 2025 price prediction placing $BEST at $0.072. This would mark a growth rate of 181% in just a few months. By 2030, $BEST could push to $0.82 or higher, for a boost of 3,113% based on the current presale price. With Best Wallet experiencing mainstream adoption, there’s no telling how high $BEST could surge. Best Wallet is a non-custodial, free crypto wallet with no KYC requirements and a user-friendly UI, making it a great choice for beginners and veteran traders alike. The wallet comes with a variety of features, including the Market Insights, which allows you to gauge the market sentiment and identify hot trends, and the Token Launchpad, which lists partnered presales. If you want to get involved, read our ‘ How to buy $BEST ’ guide, then go to the presale page and grab your $BEST today. Is Ethereum Going Bull Again? It’s safe to say that, after doubling in value in less than a month, Ethereum has just started its record-breaking run. We expect $ETH to reach another ATH by the end of the year, as the fall sets in and the GENIUS Act sees noticeable progress. Best Wallet is likely to see an influx of investors as well, as $BEST is getting close to its public release. This isn’t financial advice.

Powell's speech, along with recent data on the labor market and changes in the inflation outlook, reveals a clear shift in the Fed's priorities, according to UBS analysts. In his speech, Powell summarized the economic outlook for the first half of the year, then referenced July employment data and highlighted imbalances in the labor market. UBS said this remarks signaled a potential shift in the Fed's policy bias. According to UBS, the critical points in Powell's message were as follows: Focus on employment rather than inflation: Powell stated that the Fed will now consider employment risks as well as inflation. UBS stated that this signifies a dovish shift in policy stance. Labor market risks: Powell warned that job losses could occur rapidly and lead to sharp increases in unemployment. Inflation expectations will be monitored: Powell said that inflation is rising with temporary, not permanent, effects and that the Fed will change its stance again if necessary. Related News: Ethereum Soars to New Heights: Historic Moments Unfold - ATH on the Horizon - Here's Why and the Current Situation According to UBS, Powell's following statements underscore the shift in direction: “Policy is now in restrictive territory; the outlook and balance of risks may require adjustments to our policy stance.” UBS notes that these statements have strengthened expectations that the Fed may cut interest rates, while markets are increasingly focused on employment and recession risks. *This is not investment advice.

With predictions of strong rallies, analysts are paying close attention to Polygon (POL), XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Polygon and XRP are seen as steady players in the space, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as a rising star with bold projections of a possible jump. Together, these three are shaping up as the top crypto to invest in as analysts look ahead to the next wave of growth. Polygon Price Prediction Points to Steady Upside Polygon has built its name by solving Ethereum’s scaling challenges, giving users faster and cheaper transactions. This strength has made POL one of the most talked-about networks for DeFi and NFT projects. POL 7D price chart Analysts suggest Polygon price prediction could land around $1.30 to $1.55 by late 2025, with some models even hinting at a move past $3. This growth outlook has put Polygon on several lists of the best altcoins to buy, especially for investors targeting altcoins with high potential in the Ethereum ecosystem. With strong developer activity and expanding institutional attention, POL is consistently mentioned as one of the top crypto to invest in for the next market cycle. XRP 2025 Forecast Raises Hopes for Big Moves The XRP community is hyped up over potential ETF approval in 2025. Reports suggest an 85% to 98% chance of approval by October. Analysts believe this could drive XRP’s value to $25 or beyond, placing it among the best crypto to buy now for those seeking exposure to regulated institutional demand. The XRP 2025 forecast aligns with the idea that ETFs could trigger mainstream flows into the token, making it one of the altcoins with high potential for gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE Targets Breakout Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting analyst attention for its explosive projections . Market watchers suggest it could see near-term rallies of 120% to 180%, while longer-term models point to possible 60x returns. This bold outlook places MAGACOIN FINANCE in direct conversation with established names like Polygon and XRP. The coin is increasingly mentioned among the best altcoins to buy and best crypto to buy now, as investors shift focus toward newer projects showing breakout potential. With investor sentiment leaning toward coins capable of delivering outsized returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being considered one of the top crypto to invest in for those looking at 2025 opportunities. Final Thoughts: Altcoins to Watch for 2025 Gains For investors scanning the market, Polygon, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are shaping up as three names to follow into 2025. Polygon price prediction models point to steady growth, XRP 2025 forecast ties to ETF hopes, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is seen as a fresh entry with 25x crypto gains on the table. With portfolios shifting toward the best crypto to buy now, these three coins highlight how established projects and new players can combine to deliver strong upside.

Powell’s Friday appearance turned out to be a bonanza for intraday stock traders and crypto investors, as both the NASDAQ and major cryptos surged after he hinted at a possible September rate cut. Powell noted that the balance of risks is shifting in the U.S. economy. While inflation remains a concern for the Fed, the latest labor market data is now a bigger worry. Job growth, for instance, has slowed dramatically: from 168,000 new jobs in 2024 to just 35,000 in the latest figures. At the same time, unemployment has held steady at 4.2%. This slowdown is partly due to reduced demand and supply in the job market, temporarily influenced by weaker immigration flows. Powell warned that the labor market remains in a delicate position, and a wave of layoffs could make conditions worse. Read on as we unpack Powell’s September rate cut hint, what’s driving it, and how you can ride the brewing risk-on sentiment among investors by loading up on the best cryptos to buy now. Powell’s Rate Cut Hint Could Spark the Next Crypto Rally Inflation is still around 2.6% to 2.9% above the Fed’s 2% target, largely due to Trump’s tariffs, which are expected to gradually push prices higher. However, the Federal Reserve views this as a one-time bump rather than the start of an inflation spiral. Speaking on interest rates, Powell noted that current levels are now closer to neutral – a zone that neither slows nor boosts the economy – and described the Fed’s stance as a little restrictive. He added that while there’s room for a rate cut, the Fed intends to move carefully based on incoming data. Here’s the kicker now : although Powell didn’t commit to a September cut, he admitted it’s certainly a possibility. Wall Street celebrated the remarks, with the NASDAQ surging 1.39% in just 15 minutes. Crypto markets also rallied, as Bitcoin climbed 4% , once again crossing the $115K mark. Traditionally, rate cuts are bullish for risk-on assets like crypto. Why? Because cheaper borrowing often pushes investors toward alternative ‘high-risk, high-reward’ investments like cryptocurrencies. That’s why the prospect of a September rate cut is being viewed as a potential major catalyst for another broad-based altcoin rally. If you’re looking to cash in on this opportunity, now may be the best time to scoop up promising low-cap, high-upside. To help you out, here are our top picks for the next cryptos to explode . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Next-Gen Bitcoin L2 Bringing Fast Transactions & Web3 Compatibility Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the world’s first Bitcoin Layer 2 solution that brings Solana-like speed and scalability to the Bitcoin blockchain. Despite being the biggest cryptocurrency in the industry, Bitcoin has long struggled with slow transactions, increasing traffic, and zero Web3 compatibility. $HYPER aims to fix this through the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, which allows developers to execute smart contracts and build dApps on the Bitcoin network – something that was never possible before. At the heart of this ecosystem overhaul is a non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge. In plain English, it locks up your Layer 1 $BTC and mints an equivalent amount of Layer 2 $BTC tokens. These L2 tokens can then be used for Web3 interactions, including staking, lending, swapping, NFT transactions, DeFi trading, and much more. Once you’re done, simply use the bridge to swap back your L2 tokens for L1 Bitcoin. The $HYPER presale has already gained strong traction, raising $11.53M so far. Even better, this includes sizable institutional investments, with whale purchases of $75K , $54K , $38K , $19.6K , and $13.2K , underscoring big-money interest in the project. Currently priced at just $0.012785 apiece, our $HYPER price prediction suggests it could surge to $0.32 by the end of 2025, delivering a potential 2,400% return. Want in on the project? Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy $HYPER . For more information, visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Cryptocurrency of a Privacy-First and User-Friendly Crypto Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the in-house cryptocurrency of Best Wallet – a multi-chain, non-custodial crypto wallet built with a focus on user security. Here, you hold the private keys, leaving no room for foul play by malicious third parties. On top of that, the app uses Fireblocks MPC security tech, biometric logins, and scam protection to keep your funds safe. One of the most exciting features, though, is the Presale Aggregator section, which helps you load up on the best new meme coins in presale before they hit the mainstream. Plus, being a multi-chain wallet, Best Wallet already supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Smart Chain, with 50 more blockchains coming soon. This means you won’t have to jump between multiple wallets to manage your crypto portfolio – everything is accessible from one easy-to-use interface. Why buy $BEST ? According to our $BEST price prediction , the token could hit $0.62 by 2026, delivering a potential 2,500% return. Reduced trading and gas fees on the platform Staking rewards, currently yielding 89% Early access to the best crypto presales Voting rights on key project decisions The $BEST presale has been a massive success, to say the least, having already raised over $15M from early investors. Currently priced at just $0.025515 per token, the next price increase is only a few hours away, so this could be your last chance to grab it this low. Check out Best Wallet Token’s official website for more information. 3. Bertram The Pomeranian ($BERT) – A Philanthropic Meme Coin Eyeing New All-Time Highs Bertram The Pomeranian ($BERT) is a Solana meme coin that goes beyond being just another character-driven hype asset. Inspired by Bertram, a famous Pomeranian dog influencer with millions of followers, $BERT is tied to a noble mission of global pet care through WOOFHub. WOOFHub, by the way, is an AI-powered startup dedicated to raising awareness about dog shelters, enabling real-time adoption alerts, and helping with lost pet tracking. It also sells NFC-enabled smart dog collars, allowing owners to keep tabs on their pets’ locations at all times. It’s worth noting that the project has already donated over 5 tonnes of dog food worldwide, further reinforcing its socially conscious mission. On the market side, $BERT recently hit a $70M market cap after surging 40% in the past seven days . And it’s now trading at around $0.07095. Its recent listing on BloFin injected fresh liquidity, fueling an 61% spike in trading volume within the last 24 hours alone. Combined with strong technicals, including a robust MACD histogram and neatly stacked, fanning EMAs, $BERT looks poised to extend its parabolic bull run in the weeks ahead. Conclusion Fed Chair Jerome Powell has delivered positive signals for the U.S. economy, from slowing inflation and historically low unemployment rates to a relatively neutral stance on interest rates. Most notably, he hinted at the possibility of an interest rate cut in September, which helped propel both the NASDAQ and crypto markets higher. If you want to ride this bull run, utility-driven tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Best Wallet Token ($BEST), and $BERT could be among your best bets. That said, remember that crypto markets are highly volatile and subject to significant risks. Always do your own research before investing.

Again. On Friday, he fired a warning shot straight at Putin on Truth Social: “Interesting times ahead!!!” and followed it with “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader’s country.” That was aimed right at Russia. But the response from Moscow? Crickets. Trump’s been on a diplomatic sprint. First he welcomed Putin to Alaska for a cozy meet-up. Then he held talks in D.C. with Ukraine’s Zelensky and several European leaders. The goal was simple; get some kind of peace deal in motion. But not one single concession came out of the Kremlin. Putin didn’t budge. Not on a ceasefire. Not on a summit. Not on anything. Putin ignores Trump’s push for summit Zelensky, standing next to NATO’s Mark Rutte, didn’t hold back. He said Moscow was “doing anything” to avoid a meeting with Ukraine. He accused Russia of dragging the war out. “They do not want to end the war,” Zelensky told reporters. That completely blows a hole through Trump’s plan to get both men to the table. Even Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed the same. He said a summit between Putin and Zelensky wasn’t happening anytime soon. “The agenda is not ready at all,” Lavrov stated. He added that while Moscow had shown flexibility on a few ideas from Trump , the core Russian demands hadn’t changed. Trump’s reaction was surprisingly cautious. When asked if he’d just let things slide if Putin refused to talk, he said he’d wait and figure out “whose fault it is.” His timeline? Two weeks. “I think in two weeks, we’ll know which way I’m going,” Trump said. Then he added a fork in the road: either slap on “massive sanctions” or step away entirely. Trump also bragged on Friday about getting a photo from Putin , taken during their Alaska meeting. “I was just sent a picture from somebody that wants to be there very badly,” Trump said. He added, “He’s been very respectful of me and of our country, but not so respectful of others.” Respectful? Maybe. But not responsive. Stubb warns Trump is losing patience Finland’s president Alexander Stubb spoke up next. He said his Thursday night call with Trump gave off serious frustration vibes. “There were some small indications that patience is wearing thin,” Stubb told Finland’s YLE TV1. He doesn’t expect the Zelensky–Putin meeting to happen in the next week and a half, which was the original plan. He predicted that would be the breaking point. “That’s when the patience will probably run out.” Stubb said European leaders are preparing for that exact moment. That’s when they expect Trump to finally act, either with sanctions or tariffs. Stubb said: Trump is the only one who can push Putin toward peace. “He’s the only person Putin listens to,” Stubb said, “and frankly, the only one Putin fears.” Europe’s goal is to get the US to provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the form of air defense and provision of intelligence, but that the guarantees would look “very different from NATO’s Article 5,” Stubb said. Meanwhile, oil markets are holding steady while this mess drags on. On Friday, Brent crude rose 6 cents to $67.73. West Texas Intermediate was up 14 cents to $63.66. Both rose more than 1% the day before. Weekly gains were 2.9% for Brent and 1.4% for WTI. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

With 15,550 holders, it has successfully generated an amazing $14,750,000 through its presale. With tokens priced at $0.035, the project is presently moving forward via Phase 6 of its presale. Compared to its original offering, this price implies a significant 250% rise. As a result, investor interest is growing as the presale moves quickly forward. This momentum is creating significant anticipation for its future crypto price trajectory, establishing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a noteworthy altcoin. Current presale momentum and opportunity Phase 6 is currently underway and is selling out fast. The chance to acquire tokens at this price is quickly diminishing. Immediately afterwards, Phase 7 will commence, introducing a 14.3% price increase to $0.04 per token. This structured price growth provides a clear advantage for current participants. Moreover, the launch price is firmly set at $0.06. Therefore, investors buying at the current phase can expect significant returns upon the official launch. This calculated progression makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a compelling crypto investment for those seeking measured growth. Substantial utility and security foundations Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is constructing a robust decentralized lending platform. Its ecosystem will feature peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending mechanisms. This utility ensures genuine demand for the MUTM token within its own network. Furthermore, the team has finalized a successful Certik audit, achieving a stellar 95.00 security score. This result indicates an exceptionally solid security posture for its smart contracts. To further strengthen its defenses, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT is allocated for rewards across various vulnerability tiers. Community growth and incentives The project is actively fostering a strong community through engaging initiatives. A massive $100,000 MUTM giveaway is currently running, split among ten lucky winners. Each winner will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens, generating tremendous excitement. Additionally, Mutuum Finance has launched a new dashboard featuring a leaderboard. The top 50 holders will receive bonus tokens, incentivizing long-term investment and holding. These efforts are effectively building a dedicated and enthusiastic supporter base. Price prediction and AAVE growth analogy Predicting a future price for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) involves analyzing its potential scale. The project’s innovative lending model and limited token supply support a bullish outlook. In essence, we can draw a parallel to the explosive growth of AAVE in the 2020-2021 cycle. In March 2020, the price of AAVE was as low as $26.02. By May 2021, it had risen to an all-time high of $667.69. In a little more than a year, this incredible trip produced an astounding 2,500% return on investment. AAVE’s success was fueled by the rapid expansion of the DeFi sector and its own protocol dominance. Similarly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the market with a refined product and clear utility. If it captures even a fraction of the DeFi lending market, substantial appreciation is logical. Its fixed supply of 4 billion tokens means that increased adoption directly translates to higher prices. Final thoughts and call to action Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a unique opportunity in the current crypto landscape. Its successful presale, strong security credentials, and tangible utility provide a solid foundation. The project is not just speculative but is built with a clear purpose and function. Examining its tokenomics and market position suggests significant potential for growth. Consider exploring the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale today before the next price increase occurs.

50541717,563910,1755952212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50541717.jpeg,Latest RLUSD Stablecoin Could Propel Ripple To Limelight Amid Trillion-Dollar Predictions,https://bitcoinist.com/latest-rlusd-to-propel-ripple/,"Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is a potential game-changer in the rapidly expanding stablecoin market, which is projected to reach trillions of dollars. With SBI Holdings planning to bring RLUSD to Japan, the stablecoin could be integrated alongside XRP , positioning Ripple for a stronger role in global payments. RLUSD To Propel Ripple Into Global Spotlight A recent report by tech researcher SMQKE on X social media has reignited attention on Ripple’s strategic moves in Japan. With the introduction of RLUSD in the country, the crypto payments company could steer its growth in the stablecoin market , which is projected to expand from a 300 billion valuation to a trillion in the coming years. SMQKE stated in his post that Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service is already operational in Japan, allowing RippleNet customers to leverage XRP for cross-border payments . This development reduces pre-funding requirements and positions XRP as a critical liquidity tool for remittances, particularly in one of the world’s most expensive cross-border payment corridors. SMQKE further pointed to the alignment between the firm’s ODL infrastructure and the upcoming introduction of RLUSD. With SBI Holdings confirming plans to bring the stablecoin to Japan in early 2026, RLUSD is poised to complement XRP in powering remittance flows and institutional payments. This dual-layered ecosystem, where XRP drives liquidity and RLUSD ensures stability, could strengthen Ripple’s position in a market expected to multiply. The integration holds particular significance for Japan’s payment ecosystem , where remittance flows from the country to the Philippines, mainly driven by the country’s third-largest foreign worker population, reached nearly $1.8 billion in 2020. Japan also carries some of the world’s highest cross-border payment fees. In line with this, the company’s ODL service, in collaboration with SBI Remit, Coins.ph, and SBI VC Trade, directly addresses these inefficiencies. At the same time, the pending rollout of RLUSD in Japan adds another layer of utility. Ripple And SBI’s Role In Distributing RLUSD Ripple has confirmed its recent advancements in Japan in a press release announcing the upcoming launch of the RLUSD stablecoin within the country. The crypto company disclosed that as stablecoins become an integral part of the global financial infrastructure , the next wave of adoption is set to be driven by practical utility and institutional demand. Ripple and SBI Holdings disclosed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with SBI VC Trade, outlining just how RLUSD will be distributed across Japan. The crypto payments company notes that RLUSD has been positioned as an enterprise-grade stablecoin , fully backed by US dollar deposits, short-term government bonds, and cash equivalents, with independent monthly attestations ensuring transparency. This regulatory and compliance-first design distinguishes the asset from other stablecoins in circulation. Notably, SBI VC Trade CEO Tomohiko Kondo described the upcoming launch as a significant step forward in expanding stablecoin options in Japan and accelerating the convergence of finance and digital technology. He further emphasized that the company will continue working closely with Ripple to build a safe and transparent financial infrastructure.",Ripple|Coins.ph|Memorandum of Understanding|MOU|ODL|On-Demand Liquidity|ripple|ripple news|RLUSD|SBI Holdings|SBI Remit|SBI VC Trade|SMQKE|stablecoin|Tomohiko Kondo|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|XRP|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 12:30:12

Trading volume surges 127% to $80.59B, signaling strong investor activity in ETH. Ethereum nears $5K resistance as supply, staking, and burn mechanisms shape tokenomics. Ethereum’s price surged Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank could consider rate cuts as early as September. The comments, delivered at the annual Jackson Hole symposium, sparked a broad rally across crypto markets and pushed Ethereum close to its 2021 all-time high. Powell Flips the Script on Rate Cuts Powell told the audience that “the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” a statement that immediately altered market sentiment. His comments were a sharp reversal from the anxiety that had built earlier in the week, when investors had briefly pulled back after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 0.9% increase in the producer price index fueling concerns that rate cuts might be delayed.

In the new wave, Dogecoin faces competition from Layer Brett’s Layer 2 performance. With its presale live and a disruptive Ethereum Layer 2 approach, $LBRETT is challenging the status quo set by Dogecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe, Bonk, and Brett (original). Analysts are already speculating that this could be the next big crypto, with projections suggesting Layer Brett might outperform its established rivals as the next 100x altcoin. Amid rapid market changes, the Layer Brett presale offers early buyers entry at just $0.0047 per token, positioning it as a top gainer crypto for those seeking the next big opportunity in the meme coin sector. Why Layer 2 gives Layer Brett the edge over Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which remain on slower Layer 1 blockchains, Layer Brett leverages Ethereum Layer 2 technology for lightning-fast, low gas fee crypto transactions. This innovation allows $LBRETT to process activity off-chain while maintaining Ethereum’s robust security, a clear upgrade over the congested networks powering Bonk and Pepe. Key advantages of Layer Brett: Ultra-low transaction fees —significantly less than the average fees on Dogecoin and ADA networks. Industry-leading transaction speeds —no more waiting for sluggish confirmations as seen on Bonk and SHIB. Seamless staking with yields —up to 2,800% APY in the current presale, making it one of the best DeFi coin opportunities. Layer Brett’s community-first approach also includes a $1 million giveaway, drawing more interest than recent campaigns by Pepe or Brett (original). What sets Layer Brett apart from Brett, ADA, Pepe, and Bonk? While Brett (original) remains popular, its lack of tangible utility and recent price correction—down nearly 79% from its all-time high— and ADA’s recent price slides have left holders searching for stronger fundamentals. Bonk has seen sharp token burns and buybacks, yet it still trails in utility and network innovation. Pepe continues to be driven primarily by speculation, not real DeFi or Web3 use cases. In contrast, Layer Brett delivers: Transparent tokenomics: 10 billion max supply, with 30% for presale and 25% for staking rewards. Gamified staking and NFT integrations: Features missing from DOGE, Pepe, and Bonk ecosystems. Seamless wallet support and cross-chain interoperability: Users can buy and stake with MetaMask or Trust Wallet, using ETH, USDT, or BNB. Why the crypto community is shifting from ADA and Shiba Inu to Layer Brett While ADA maintains its status as a blue-chip altcoin, recent price drops and a lack of major upgrades have dampened enthusiasm. Shiba Inu (SHIB), though celebrating milestones like one million holders and significant token burns, still faces congestion and high fees on its Layer 1. The Layer Brett presale, paired with huge staking rewards and low entry pricing, is attracting both meme coin fans and DeFi enthusiasts. The platform’s Layer 2 scaling solution positions it as a best crypto presale and a strong contender for the next 100x meme coin title. Conclusion: Don’t miss the Layer Brett presale Layer Brett is still in presale, but competition is intensifying. With lower fees, higher yields, and true Layer 2 scalability, it surpasses Dogecoin (DOGE, Shiba Inu (SHIB), ADA, Bonk, and Brett (original) in almost every metric. This is the best crypto to buy now for those targeting the next 100x meme coin in the 2025 crypto bull run. Take action before the presale ends—opportunities like this do not last long in the world of trending cryptocurrencies.

Each is drawing attention for different reasons, from presale strength to institutional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE Builds Community Traction MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to gain attention as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. The project has already drawn over 12,000 holders and raised millions. With audited smart contracts, a KYC-verified team, and wide compatibility with popular wallets, the token is being positioned as a transparent and accessible choice. Its focus on community ownership is also resonating with buyers looking for fair entry opportunities. Analysts following the space suggest that MAGACOIN’s presale momentum makes it an option worth monitoring closely. Bitcoin Finds Institutional Backing Bitcoin rose 0.72% in the past 24 hours to $114,112, stabilizing after a turbulent week. A key factor driving renewed interest is CoreDAO’s $300 million institutional staking program, which now holds over 7,000 BTC. This initiative provides large holders with regulated yield opportunities, increasing Bitcoin’s role beyond just a store of value. Analysts are also drawing parallels between Bitcoin today and gold’s breakout in the early 2000s. Projections suggest the asset could move toward $600,000 by 2026, a path that would see its valuation rise to levels comparable with the world’s largest financial assets. This combination of institutional adoption and historical comparisons has kept Bitcoin firmly in focus among analysts and traders. Hedera Strengthens on Real-World Asset Push Hedera (HBAR) gained 3.11% over the past 24 hours to $0.241, boosted by advances in tokenized finance. Its recent partnership with Swarm allows instant settlement of tokenized Apple and Tesla shares, cutting down processes that normally take days into just seconds. This development is strengthening Hedera’s position as a platform built for regulated DeFi use cases. Adding to the momentum, ETF interest has put HBAR in the spotlight. With Nasdaq’s filing for a spot ETF and speculation around BlackRock’s involvement, analysts see 2025 as a pivotal year for mainstream access. By combining fast settlement with institutional-grade infrastructure, Hedera is being seen as a serious contender in the race to lead tokenized markets. What Traders Should Watch With MAGACOIN FINANCE advancing through its presale, Bitcoin gaining institutional-grade products, and Hedera expanding tokenized finance, traders have three clear assets to monitor closely. For those exploring presale opportunities, MAGACOIN is actively open and drawing new participants daily. To learn more or take part, visit the official links below.

Tariff collections reach record monthly total Official figures indicate tariff collections have recently hit higher monthly marks. In July, receipts exceeded $29 billion , the largest monthly total so far this year. The Treasury’s Aug. 19 “Customs and Certain Excise Taxes” report places year-to-date tariff revenue at $158.3 billion. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said they may use some tariff revenue to pay down the national debt . He told CNBC that he and the president are focused on it. “I think at a point we’re going to be able to do it,” Bessent said, adding that he and President Donald Trump were “laser-focused on paying down the debt.” “I think that we’re going to bring down the deficit-to-GDP, we will start paying down debt, and then at a point that can be used as an offset for the American people,” he said. Bessent said this year’s tariff revenue will likely exceed the earlier $300 billion forecast. He did not offer a new number, saying only that the final figure would be “substantially” higher.

The move higher followed remarks from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which fueled investor expectations of a more accommodative monetary policy environment. The rally has intensified speculation over whether ETH could soon cross the $5,000 threshold for the first time. Broader Market Signals Boost Momentum The surge in Ether coincided with gains across risk assets, including a 1.8% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index. This rebound reflects investors shifting away from bonds and other safe-haven positions as expectations of lower interest rates grow. Over the past month, ETH has surged 33%, fueled by optimism around both macroeconomic conditions and Ethereum’s strengthening fundamentals. Powell’s comments at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium were a key catalyst: “The baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” Bond markets are now pricing in a 45% probability that rates will fall to 3.5% or lower by March 2026, up from 37% the week prior, according to the CME FedWatch tool. On-Chain Activity Shows Strong Uptick Ethereum’s network activity has accelerated alongside the price rally. In the last 30 days, transactions have risen by 63% and active addresses by 26%. By contrast, Solana recorded only a 2% increase in transactions, with active addresses falling 14%. BNB Chain experienced a sharper decline, with transactions down by half during the same period, according to Nansen data. This divergence underscores Ethereum’s growing dominance among major smart contract platforms. Futures Market Reflects Growing Confidence Despite volatility, ETH futures markets suggest traders remain confident. Futures contracts are currently trading at a 7% premium compared to spot prices, up from just 4% earlier in the week. This indicates rising conviction among buyers even as some traders remain cautious, noting that Ether has yet to reclaim its 2021 all-time high of $4,868, unlike BNB and Tron, which now trade above their previous peaks. Analytics firm CryptoQuant has observed a notable increase in aggressive buying behavior in ETH futures, with demand for leveraged exposure holding strong. Aggregate open interest remains steady at 14.4 million ETH, equivalent to roughly $69 billion in dollar terms. Path Toward $5,000 The convergence of higher futures premiums, resilient leveraged positioning, and surging on-chain activity all point to further upside potential for Ether. While traders remain alert to resistance near all-time highs, sentiment suggests that a breakthrough to $5,000 could be imminent. Whether Ethereum sustains such levels will depend on both macroeconomic shifts and the continued growth of its ecosystem. For now, investors are watching closely as ETH inches toward a historic milestone.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-23 12:49:46
50543533,https://invezz.com/?p=2848290,1755953400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) price analysis: Where will MUTM be in 2 years,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/23/mutuum-finance-mutm-price-analysis-where-will-mutm-be-in-2-years/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently captivating the crypto market during its sixth presale phase. Investors are acquiring tokens at $0.035 each, a price representing a 250% surge from its initial offering. This impressive growth has generated substantial momentum for the project. The presale has successfully raised $14,750,000 from a dedicated community of 15,550 holders. Phase six is presently underway and selling out rapidly, making this affordable entry point a fleeting opportunity. Consequently, the subsequent phase will introduce a 14.3% price increase, elevating the cost to $0.04 per token. Upon its official launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will debut at $0.06, granting current buyers a significant 400% return on their initial investment immediately. This altcoin is demonstrating powerful potential for early participants. Mutuum Finance presale momentum and utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not merely a speculative asset. It is the foundational token for an upcoming decentralized lending platform. The project will feature a dual lending model, integrating both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer protocols. This structure provides lenders with flexible yield opportunities and offers borrowers access to capital. Furthermore, the ecosystem will include an overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to be minted exclusively upon loan issuance and burned after repayment. This mechanism ensures price stability and inherent utility for the MUTM token. Operating on a Layer-2 network, the platform promises minimal transaction fees and enhanced scalability. This focus on real-world application positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a formidable entity in the DeFi space. MUTM price prediction and SHIB analogy The prediction for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach $10.50 by 2027 is grounded in its robust tokenomics and growing adoption. With a fixed supply of 4 billion tokens, increasing demand should apply significant upward pressure on its price. This development pattern has a historical analogy in the performance of Shiba Inu (SHIB). In 2020, SHIB was selling at a microscopic price of 0.000000000078. It subsequently reached a new all-time high of $0.00008616 in 2021, providing a 110,000,000+ percent return on investment to its earliest investors in less than a year. While SHIB’s rise was largely community-driven, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building its value on a concrete, revenue-generating platform. This fundamental utility suggests its potential ascent could be equally dramatic yet supported by sustainable protocol earnings. Security achievements and community incentives Protecting investors is one way of strengthening investor confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The team has already completed a full audit by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security companies. The score that the audit produced was an unbelievable 95.00 score in the security realm, which proves the integrity of its smart contracts. To further bolster this, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. A reward pool of $50,000 USDT is available for researchers who identify potential vulnerabilities, categorized into four tiers based on severity. Additionally, the project is hosting a massive $100,000 MUTM giveaway . Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 in tokens. Participation requires a minimum $50 investment in the presale, completing all quests, and submitting a valid wallet address. Moreover, a new dashboard features a leaderboard tracking the top 50 holders, who will receive bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. Final thoughts on MUTM potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an opportunity within the current crypto investment landscape. Its presale progress demonstrates strong market belief, while its practical utility provides a foundation for long-term growth. The ambitious price prediction appears achievable when considering its solid fundamentals and the explosive potential seen in earlier altcoins. The window to participate at this value is closing quickly as the presale advances.

These sales have occurred due to the outflows that the asset manager has witnessed from its BTC ETF. BlackRock Dumps Around $500 Million In Bitcoin Arkham data shows that BlackRock has offloaded around $500 million in Bitcoin this week, with transfers to Coinbase, a move that indicates a move to sell these coins. The asset manager has sold these coins following outflows from its iShares Bitcoin ETF, which was the norm throughout this week. Related Reading: BlackRock’s Crypto Holdings Balloon As Bitcoin, Ethereum Reach For New ATHs — Here Are The Numbers SoSo Value data shows that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF first recorded a daily net outflow of $68.72 million on August 18. The fund then further saw net outflows of $220 million, $127.49 million, and $198.81 million on August 20, 21, and 22, respectively. Notably, the iShares Bitcoin ETF has accounted for most of the outflows, with the BTC ETFs as a group currently on a six-day streak of consecutive net outflows. These Bitcoin ETFs have seen total net outflows of almost $1.2 billion since August 15. Meanwhile, in just this week alone, over $1.1 billion has left these funds, sparking a bearish sentiment for the BTC price. Given BlackRock’s position as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem, outflows from its fund had sparked a wave of sell-offs. This led to a massive decline for the flagship crypto earlier in the week. The Bitcoin price had dropped to as low as $112,000 this week as BlackRock and other BTC investors took profit on their investments. This followed the flagship crypto’s rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,000 last week. However, BTC has now sharply rebounded on the back of Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech, in which he indicated that a rate cut might happen in September. An End To The BTC ETF Outflow Streak Notably, Powell’s speech was enough to spark fresh inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs on August 22, with BlackRock the only fund manager that recorded a net outflow on the day. Further data from SoSo Value shows that Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest recorded a daily inflow of $65.47 million, the most among the issuers on the day. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Investors To Avoid Bitcoin At All Cost As Price Is Going Below $60,000 Meanwhile, Fidelity, Van Eck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale recorded inflows of $50.88 million, $26.41 million, $13.51 million, $12.70 million, and $6.42 million, respectively. However, BlackRock recorded an outflow of $198.81 million, which led to a daily net outflow of $23.15 million for the funds as a group. With the Bitcoin price rebounding, these funds, including BlackRock’s IBIT, could return to witnessing significant daily inflows from next week. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $115,900, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Key Takeaways: Ego Death Capital’s Preston Pysh says many early Bitcoiners see Wall Street’s growing role as a move “in a bad direction.” Institutional adoption through derivatives raises doubts about Bitcoin’s ability to remain a true safe-haven asset. While use cases are evolving, Pysh warns that institutional dominance risks sidelining the culture that built Bitcoin. Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell , Pysh said many longtime Bitcoiners view the growing wave of institutional adoption as drifting away from the ethos that defined Bitcoin’s rise. “Part of that culture that brought it to where it is, is looking at where this is all going and saying no, no, no, no, this is all moving in a bad direction,” Pysh said. Bitcoin Derivatives Raise Doubts Over Its Safe-Haven Role: Pysh Pysh noted that institutions engaging in “institutional-like things,” such as building out derivatives markets, raise questions within the community about Bitcoin’s ability to remain the safe-haven asset it was designed to be. “Am I being scammed, like all the other scams that preceded this wave?” he said, reflecting concerns shared by early holders. The comments echo broader debates that have divided the Bitcoin community in recent months. In July, analyst Scott Melker, known as The Wolf of All Streets, argued that Bitcoin had in part been “taken over by the very people it was created to hedge against.” For Pysh, the culture that carried Bitcoin from an experimental idea to a trillion-dollar asset was built on individuals self-custodying their holdings and holding through steep downturns. “Those are the people who made Bitcoin what it is,” he said, stressing that many of them now fear being sidelined as institutional players gain control. Still, Pysh acknowledged that the network’s use cases are evolving. “I think that it’s going to move in a direction where a lot of people use Bitcoin the way they wanna use Bitcoin, especially institutions, who are going to use it very differently to how individuals use it,” he said. “That’s a difficult pill for people to swallow.” The remarks come as institutional appetite for Bitcoin continues to rise. A March report by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon found that 83% of institutional investors surveyed planned to increase crypto allocations in 2025, underscoring the scale of the shift now underway. Bitcoin Could Hit $175K This Year, $1M by 2030 Bitcoin could be on track for a major rally this year, according to Leah Wald, CEO of SOL Strategies. Last week, Wald said she sees the world’s largest cryptocurrency potentially climbing to around $175,000 by year-end , a target she described as conservative compared to projections from other top investors and fund managers. Longer term, Wald pointed to ambitious estimates suggesting Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030, underlining the growing conviction among institutional players. Bitcoin recently touched highs of about $124,000, a level that would have seemed unrealistic just a few years ago. Wald emphasized that Bitcoin forecasts are no longer confined to fringe speculation. “Some of the smartest investors in the world, like Cathie Wood and others, and the way Larry Fink speaks about Bitcoin, point to projections that are astronomically high yet based on solid models,” she said.

50543037,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79809,1755954301,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Pundit: “People Thinking 500 XRP Isn’t Enough Is Crazy”,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-people-thinking-500-xrp-isnt-enough-is-crazy/,"A lively debate has emerged on X after commentator XRPee argued that dismissing a 500-XRP holding as “not enough” is misguided. He suggested that many investors undervalue such a position simply because the token’s price is still relatively low. To make his point clearer, XRPee asked readers to imagine owning 500 Bitcoin—a comparison that highlights how perception of value changes with price. Current Market Snapshot As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.03, having fluctuated between $2.79 and $3.10 during the day. Bitcoin, meanwhile, was trading around $115,519. People thinking 500 XRP isn't enough is crazy. You're only saying that because the price is low. Imagine having 500 Bitcoin. https://t.co/oC1nbYxpuC — XRPee (@XRPee3) August 23, 2025 By this measure, 500 XRP is worth about $1,515, while 500 BTC would amount to an astronomical fortune. The comparison underscores XRPee’s point about unit bias and how investors judge adequacy. The Psychology Behind “500 XRP” The debate reflects a common psychological bias in crypto investing. Many people assume that a lower token price requires holding larger quantities to make the position worthwhile. XRPee challenges this mindset, noting that performance is measured in percentage gains, not in coin counts. Investors rarely say 500 BTC is “too little,” because each Bitcoin is extremely valuable. The same logic, he argues, should apply to XRP and other digital assets. Evaluating 500 XRP in Practical Terms At today’s valuation, a 500-XRP holding is a modest yet meaningful stake. Its ultimate worth will depend on whether XRP sustains adoption, gains deeper liquidity, and continues to find use in cross-border settlement and institutional-grade infrastructure. If XRP appreciates significantly in the years ahead, 500 units could still deliver substantial portfolio returns. On the flip side, if the asset underperforms, the position is limited in size, providing a natural safeguard against excessive risk. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why the Bitcoin Comparison Matters XRPee’s reference to 500 BTC is not a prediction but a thought experiment. With Bitcoin trading well above $100,000, that amount is the preserve of institutions and the ultra-wealthy, not ordinary investors. This example illustrates the potential pitfalls of judging assets solely based on the number of coins. Market capitalization, adoption potential, and long-term fundamentals are far more important. For XRP, these fundamentals include regulatory clarity, integration into payment networks, and its evolving role in Ripple’s global liquidity products. For Bitcoin, its position as the market’s benchmark and store of value remains firmly intact. Looking Forward XRPee’s commentary carries a simple but powerful message: measuring adequacy by the number of coins held is the wrong approach. With XRP hovering at $3.03 and Bitcoin at $115,519, the real question for investors is not whether 500 XRP is “enough,” but whether they have positioned themselves in line with their conviction, time horizon, and risk tolerance. In the long run, what matters is percentage growth and the ability to hold through volatility. By that measure, even 500 XRP can make a meaningful difference.

In 2028, KCS will range between $48.28 and $57.13, with an average price of $49.63. In 2031, KCS will range between $148.11 and $176.01, with an average price of $152.22. KuCoin was launched in 2017, ever since it has grown into one of the recognized global crypto exchanges, serving over 30 million users across 200+ countries. Kucoin is Known for its range of trading pairs, staking, futures, margin trading, and fiat onramps. The KuCoin platform has established itself as a platform for both retail investors and active traders. At the core of this ecosystem is the KuCoin Token (KCS), a profit-sharing utility token that powers the exchange’s KuCoin Community Chain (KCC) and provides users with benefits such as reduced trading fees, VIP levels, and participation in KuCoin Spotlight token sales.The price of KuCoin Token reached an all-time high ATH of $28.80 in December 2021, while its all-time low was $0.3365 in 2019. This impressive growth, together with KuCoin’s quarterly buyback and burn mechanism that will reduce the circulating supply to 100 million KCS, makes the KuCoin Token price trend. As demand rises and supply decreases, technical indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI), support levels, and resistance levels help determine whether KCS can maintain momentum analyzing KuCoin’s price prediction involves understanding market trends, technological advancements, and broader economic factors influencing the crypto landscape and the big questions remain: Can it reclaim its all-time high of $28.80? Could the price of KCS even push toward $50 in the long run? Let’s find out in our price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency KuCoin Ticker KCS Current price $13.30 Market cap $1.69B Trading volume $8.36M Circulating supply 127.42M KCS All-time high $28.80 Dec 01, 2021 All-time low $0.3365 Jan 30, 2019 24-hour high $11.00 24-hour low $13.44 KuCoin token price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.55% 50-day SMA $ 11.72 200-day SMA $10.49 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 60 (Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) KuCoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The KuCoin Token price is consolidating around $13.13, with technical indicators pointing to bullish momentum KCS Immediate support levels are seen at $12.50 and $12.00 Indicators suggest short-term consolidation with bullish hints. On August 23, 2025, the KuCoin Token price analysis shows a slight pullback as KCS traded at $13.13, down 1.32% on the day. Despite the minor dip, the price of KCS remains above the critical $12.50 support zone, reflecting strong buying interest following recent rallies. KCS/USD 1-day chart The KCS/USD 24 hour chart reflects an ongoing volatility with recent candlesticks showing both profit-taking and renewed accumulation. The MACD indicator stays in the bullish zone, with the MACD line 0.419 above the signal line 0.337, momentum still favoring buyers. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 63.19, in the neutral-to-bullish zone, which indicates there is room for further upward movement before entering overbought conditions. KCS/USD Chart: TradingView If the bullish trend continues, the next resistance level will be near $14.00, while strong support levels around $12.50 and $12.00. A breakout above $14 could see the KuCoin Token price retest its August high of nearly $14.50, while failure to hold above $12.50 may trigger a short-term correction. KuCoin 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, KuCoin Token (KCS) is trading near $13.155. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 60.83, which is moderate bullish momentum without being overbought. The MACD is in positive territory, with the signal line crossing above the zero level, reinforcing a short-term bullish bias. KCS/USD Chart: TradingView Key support levels are positioned at $12.80 and $12.50. On the upside, $13.80 and $14.00 remain the immediate resistance levels to watch; a breakout above these could take KCS toward $14.50 in the near term. However, failure to sustain momentum may see the token retesting lower supports. KuCoin technical analysis: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 11.13 BUY SMA 5 $ 12.11 BUY SMA 10 $ 12.76 BUY SMA 21 $ 11.93 SELL SMA 50 $ 11.72 SELL SMA 100 $ 11.45 BUY SMA 200 $ 10.49 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 11.98 BUY EMA 5 $ 11.75 BUY EMA 10 $ 11.42 BUY EMA 21 $ 11.13 BUY EMA 50 $ 11.14 BUY EMA 100 $ 11.23 BUY EMA 200 $ 10.97 BUY What can you expect from the KuCoin price analysis next? If buyers maintain control, KCS could retest resistance at $13.80–$14.00, with a potential push toward $14.50 if trading volume supports the move. However, if momentum weakens, a pullback toward $12.80 or even $12.50 remains possible, where support levels may stabilize price. Is KuCoin a good investment? KuCoin’s competitive edge lies in its low trading fees, making it an appealing choice for traders. The platform’s involvement in cryptocurrencies, DeFi, and ICOs offers significant growth opportunities, though these markets are inherently risky and volatile. While forecasts suggest a positive outlook for KuCoin Token (KCS) with the potential for a bullish trend, the investment comes with high risks. Why is KCS’s price up today? KuCoin Token (KCS) gained 3.47% in the past 24 hours, outperforming its 7-day (+4.15%) and 30-day (+8.78%) performance. The surge is supported by growing demand from KuCoin’s loyalty program, which offers fee discounts and rewards to KCS holders. Additionally, July’s burn of 45,288 KCS and a recent technical breakout above resistance levels have reinforced bullish momentum. Will KCS recover? The KuCoin Token (KCS) has shown some signs of recovery within a short time frame. This upward trend suggests potential for further recovery, but continued growth will depend on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Will KCS reach $50? Reaching $50 would likely require a significant positive shift in market conditions, increased adoption of KCS’s technology, and strong investor interest which as per prediction will be around 2028. Will KCS reach $100? It is uncertain whether KuCoin will reach $100, as this would require a significant shift in market conditions, increased adoption, and strong investor demand. Will KCS reach $1000? Reaching $1,000 for KCS is highly speculative and would require extraordinary circumstances. Does KCS have a good long-term future? KuCoin Token (KCS) has the potential for a good long-term future, particularly if the KuCoin exchange continues to grow and expand its user base. As the native token of the KuCoin ecosystem, KCS benefits from the platform’s success, including its low trading fees, diverse offerings, and participation in innovative sectors like Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

The token has performed relatively well with an incredible positive ROI since it began trading publicly. In 2018, the price started around $0.7168 but saw a significant spike early on, though it quickly dropped back down. The price remained relatively flat through 2019 and 2020, trading well below $2. However, 2021 marked a significant uptrend, with KuCoin reaching its all-time high of approximately $25.00. KCS recorded its all-time high on Dec 01, 2021, at $28.80. At the time, the crypto market was extremely bullish, with nearly all tokens recording impressive daily gains. Similarly, the KCS token recorded its lowest price in Jan 2019, when it traded at $0.3365. In 2022, the price fluctuated between $10 and $20 before declining further. In 2023, the price stabilized somewhat, trading between $5 and $10. In 2024, KuCoin Token (KCS) had its ups and downs. It started the year at $7.45, climbed to a peak of $14.30 in May, but faced a dip to around $9.85 by August. By the end of the year, KCS found its footing, trading steadily at about $11.20 in December. In January 2025, the price ranges between $10.17-$12. KCS started August near $10.50 and surged ~15% in mid-August to around $12.38, driven by KuCoin’s loyalty program and exchange-specific optimism.

By late August, the token had climbed further into the $13.2–$13.3 range.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS|KSC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-23 13:10:00

A partial price recovery was observed later, but the rate remained in the red zone, at around 0.60 rubles per token, the leading Russian crypto news outlet added.

They also emphasized the new contract will “ensure fair and accurate pricing.” On the morning of Aug. 23, the stablecoin was trading at around $0.012, according to CoinMarketCap data, or approximately 0.96 rubles at current exchange rates. 7-day price chart for A7A5, Source: CoinMarketCap . Changes come after fresh sanctions from London and Washington Since its launch in early 2025, the ruble-pegged A7A5 has been the subject of suspicions it’s being used by Russian actors to circumvent Western sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. Created by A7, a Russian company majority-owned by fugitive Moldovan oligarch with Russian passport Ilan Shor, is now issued by the Kyrgyz-registered Old Vector, as a “fully independent” project. The cryptocurrency has been also linked to the Kyrgyzstan-based crypto exchange Grinex, alleged successor of the Russian coin trading platform Garantex, taken offline in a U.S.-led operation in March. Soon after Garantex was shut down, Grinex started processing A7A5 withdrawals. According to an article in the Financial Times, the stablecoin was used to move over $9 billion in four months. On-chain analytics firm Elliptic claims more than $1 billion is being transferred daily through the stablecoin. Blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs concluded in a report: “Kyrgyz-registered exchanges have repeatedly facilitated transactions linked to sanctioned Russian entities.” In mid-August, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on multiple Russian companies and individuals linked to the ruble-pegged crypto. Among them were A7, and its subsidiaries, as well as Old Vector. Russian businessman Sergey Mendeleev, a co-founder of Garantex, and other crypto platforms connected to him were also sanctioned. The Departments of State and the Treasury put $6 million bounties on the heads of Garantex executives. Later this month, the United Kingdom sanctioned Old Vector, too, in a move to disrupt “dodgy crypto networks” that London believes are being used by Moscow to finance its war effort in Ukraine. Two of Kyrgyzstan’s traditional financial institutions, Capital Bank and Keremet Bank, were also among the targeted organizations, along with affiliated entities and officials. This prompted the Central Asian nation’s president, Sadyr Zhaparov, to appeal to U.S. President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer this week, urging them to avoid “politicizing economy.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention as a practical payment solution with measurable traction. Investors seeking the best crypto to invest in are focusing on tokens with low fees, fast transaction speeds, and wide network compatibility. Remittix is quickly standing out as a top contender. Cosmos faces price resistance and low adoption Cosmos has struggled to maintain momentum despite its interoperability-focused ecosystem. Recent Cosmos price action shows the token hovering near $4.3, with repeated attempts to break $5.0 blocked by sell orders. Short-term traders are cautious as volume declines, signaling potential stagnation. Source: TradingView Analysts note that while Cosmos’s interchain capabilities are promising, it needs increased adoption and on-chain activity to achieve better price levels. For long-term investors, the token remains an option, but those looking for immediate utility and faster scaling solutions may find it lacking. Hedera battles slow uptake despite enterprise use cases Hedera (HBAR) continues to attract enterprise partnerships, but retail and whale interest remains muted. HBAR is trading around $0.23, and while network metrics show steady transaction growth, it has yet to inspire a surge in speculative or strategic investment. Investors are comparing the slow adoption curve against potential long-term payoff. Hedera’s technical features are solid, but market participation from major whales and retail buyers is limited compared to emerging tokens that offer instant utility. Remittix gains momentum with investors Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is standing out. Over $20.7 million has been raised in the presale, and wallet metrics indicate rising activity and strong investor confidence. This Ethereum-based solution simplifies cross-border payments, reduces fees, and supports multiple blockchains including Solana, Avalanche, and Polygon. Here’s why Remittix stands out: Cross-chain DeFi project allowing frictionless crypto-to-fiat conversions. Low gas fee crypto project, ensuring cost-efficient transactions for users. Crypto with real utility, catering to both individual and business payment needs. Upcoming exchange listing will be announced once the presale reaches $22M. Whales are increasingly reallocating capital toward Remittix (RTX) , viewing it as a practical alternative to tokens that rely on hype or slow enterprise adoption. Its growing wallet activity, coupled with strong presale performance, shows demand is building steadily. Get in on Remittix early With surging investor demand, wallet metrics rising, and a practical payment solution in place, Remittix is emerging as the top choice for those seeking the best crypto to invest in. Keep an eye on presale milestones and upcoming exchange announcements to join before the next wave of growth hits.

In a post, SMQKE stated that the video confirms both cryptocurrencies are fully compliant with the global standard, emphasizing their position within the evolving financial messaging landscape. The video began by noting that all SIPA payments were required to use ISO 20022 in 2022, while the Federal Reserve in the United States encouraged financial institutions to adopt the framework by 2023. This transition, the speaker explained, is significant not only for traditional financial systems but also for the role it may play in advancing the use of digital currencies. Official Stronghold video confirms: “XRP and XLM will directly benefit from ISO 20022 adoption as fully compliant cryptocurrencies.” Listen for yourself. pic.twitter.com/44975hQ3zG — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 21, 2025 The Role of ISO 20022 in Digital Currency Integration According to the video cited by SMQKE, ISO 20022 provides a flexible and standardized framework for financial messaging, enabling consistency and interoperability across different systems. This standardization is critical for improving the efficiency of cross-border transactions and ensuring the reliability of communications between financial entities. The video further explained that ISO 20022 could directly increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies that align with its framework. This places XRP and XLM in a favorable position as they are members of the ISO 20022 standards body. Their compliance, the speaker noted, strengthens their relevance within an industry increasingly focused on harmonizing messaging systems. Stronghold’s Position and Industry Implications The video also highlighted how Stronghold itself has recognized the value of ISO 20022 messaging. The company has incorporated the standard in projects that combine it with blockchain ledger payments. By doing so, Stronghold is positioning itself at the intersection of established financial messaging standards and emerging digital asset technologies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The integration of ISO 20022 into blockchain-related projects implies the importance of messaging standards for the efficient and secure exchange of financial information. As the speaker in the video stated, such standards play a critical role in boosting the performance and reliability of financial services overall. SMQKE’s post brings focus to how these two assets may be positioned in a financial landscape moving toward global standardization. With progressive adoption of ISO 20022 at both regional and international levels, digital assets that are already compliant could see increased recognition within institutional and cross-border payment frameworks.

The token briefly reached $3 earlier in the week, but fell back soon afterwards as investors faced a reminder of inflation risks in the face of hawkish signals by the Federal Reserve. Profit-taking was high, with more than 300 million dollars realized by long and short-term holders, and there was caution throughout the market. Although XRP can continue rising to the $10 level, smart investors are now looking at other high-growth assets such as Remittix , which has a higher upside potential owing to the real-world applications. XRP Faces Profit-Taking Pressure Recently, XRP’s market activity has shown a clear tilt toward selling, driven primarily by risk-off sentiment following recent FOMC minutes. Exchange flow data indicates net inflows to exchanges rose to $76.8 million, signalling that holders are offloading XRP to lock in gains. Despite this, futures activity remains relatively muted. Open interest declined by just 100 million XRP over the past week, suggesting the downside pressure is not fueled by leveraged positions. Analysts warn that with more than 90% of XRP supply in profits, further selling may persist if the Fed adopts a hawkish stance during upcoming speeches, keeping price action choppy in the near term Why Remittix Is Capturing Investor Attention While XRP struggles to navigate macro-driven volatility, Remittix has emerged as a compelling alternative. Currently priced at $0.0969, with over 614 million tokens sold and more than $20.7 million raised, Remittix combines real-world payment solutions with crypto efficiency. Its growing ecosystem and upcoming projects are creating momentum for potential parabolic returns. Features That Set Remittix Apart Cross-Border Payments: Instant crypto to fiat transfers. Real-World Adoption: Intended to be used by freelancers, companies and remitters. Wallet Beta Release: Planning to release soon, making it easier to use and accessible. Community Growth: User base is growing rapidly, meaning that network effects are in play. All of this means that Remittix is not only a speculative token but a utility-focused one with measurable adoption, which can be leveraged to potentially achieve faster returns than XRP. Therefore, as analysts keep a close eye on XRP and whether it has long-term potential, early adopters of Remittix are set to see immediate use cases and an expanding infrastructure that may speed up returns in 2025 and beyond.

Governing Council member Olli Rehn made the comments while speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where top central bankers from around the world gathered for the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium, according to an interview from Bloomberg. Rehn said the current inflation level is “in a good place” and warned against cutting rates for no clear reason. “Any insurance cut just for its own sake wouldn’t be necessary,” he said, adding that the ECB will stay “mindful of the risks.” After slashing rates eight times over the last year, each time by 25 basis points, policymakers paused in their last meeting, holding the deposit rate at 2%. Since then, they’ve also hinted they may keep it unchanged at their next meeting in September. Policymakers say economy can handle pause in cuts Expectations for a final rate cut this year have now shifted toward December, with traders still unsure whether the ECB will even act again in 2025. Rehn pointed to a few reasons for the wait. “The economy has been showing resilience and inflation is for now within the target,” he said. That gives the ECB time to step back and “reflect on the next steps.” But Rehn also made it clear the Governing Council is not locking itself into anything. “We will maintain full freedom of action at each meeting,” he said. Their next gathering is just over two weeks away and will include fresh quarterly economic forecasts. These updates will show if inflation is staying on track and how much the new trade framework with the U.S. is affecting eurozone growth. While Rehn admitted “geopolitical tensions and the ongoing tariff war are having an impact,” he said the overall situation wasn’t as bad as feared. That echoes ECB President Christine Lagarde’s recent comments, which pointed out that the eurozone outlook is weaker than earlier forecasts but nowhere near the worst-case scenarios. In fact, the second quarter saw the 20-nation bloc unexpectedly expand. Business confidence also got a boost after the U.S.-European tariff deal, with eurozone manufacturing returning to growth for the first time in months. Inflation, meanwhile, stayed locked at 2% in both June and July, and is expected to hit the same mark in 2027, even though a temporary dip is expected next year. Still, Rehn cautioned that “there’s no reason for complacency.” He said the ECB must remain alert and “mindful of downside risks.” Nagel sees no reason for changes unless conditions worsen Joachim Nagel, president of the Bundesbank and another member of the Governing Council, also pushed back against more cuts during his Bloomberg interview in Jackson Hole. He said the eurozone is currently sitting in a “kind of equilibrium,” with both inflation and interest rates aligned at 2%. “I think the bar is high,” Nagel said. “So it needs a lot to convince me to change monetary policy.” Even though Germany’s economy shrank more than expected in Q2, Nagel wasn’t concerned. He said 2025 might bring a third recession in three years, but he sees growth returning in 2026 as government spending increases. Nagel also weighed in on political interference in monetary policy, pointing to pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell from President Donald Trump, who is now in his second term in office. “Independence is the DNA of good monetary policy,” Nagel said. “We have to fight for it.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Its role extends beyond trading fee discounts on Binance, powering the BNB Chain and providing the foundation for countless decentralized applications. As its utility grows, so does investor interest, and while BNB’s long-term perspective looks strong, MAGACOIN FINANCE investors are optimistic about even bigger gains ahead. Recent Developments Driving BNB BNB has recently surged to fresh highs, supported by several powerful catalysts. Institutional adoption is one of the most notable drivers, with corporations beginning to include BNB alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in their treasuries. This tightening of available supply on exchanges has helped fuel price appreciation. Meanwhile, the BNB Chain is thriving. Initiatives like the #BNBHack hackathon and the 11th Most Valuable Builder program have spurred developer activity, pushing transaction volumes and TVL higher. These efforts highlight the growing ecosystem and reinforce the token’s core utility. On the technical front, upgrades such as the Maxwell update are improving transaction speed and efficiency, making the chain more attractive for DeFi participants. At the same time, Binance continues to roll out new listings, products, and institutional services that directly increase BNB’s demand. A New Altcoin Shocks the Crypto Market While BNB continues to expand its ecosystem, many retail and institutional investors are looking toward MAGACOIN FINANCE as a hidden gem with even greater potential. The project has already raised $12.5 million right after the start of fundraising , and each round has sold out rapidly. Analysts point out that presale participants could see returns rivaling early SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN investors , with price surges expected before top exchange listings. This mix of scarcity, early entry advantages, and strong community backing positions MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most promising altcoins for 2025. Factors That Influence BNB’s Price BNB’s price is shaped by a combination of market-wide and project-specific forces. Sentiment across the crypto market, often dictated by Bitcoin’s direction, remains a key influence. The regulatory landscape also looms large, with potential policy shifts having the ability to impact Binance’s operations and, by extension, BNB. Utility continues to be BNB’s strongest value driver. Its role in Launchpad and Launchpool participation, as well as gas fees on the BNB Chain, ensures steady demand. Tokenomics also play a role: the BNB Auto-Burn mechanism steadily reduces supply, creating deflationary pressure that supports long-term price appreciation. Price Expectations and Outlook Short-term momentum appears strong, with BNB’s breakout rally showing resilience. However, some technical indicators, like the RSI nearing overbought levels, hint at possible pullbacks before the next leg higher. Traders are eyeing resistance points that, if broken, could trigger new waves of growth. In the long term, BNB’s outlook remains bullish. Its expanding use cases, institutional adoption, and deflationary model set the stage for sustained growth. Many market watchers expect the token to steadily rise in value, with the caveat that broader market conditions and regulatory clarity will play critical roles in shaping its trajectory. Conclusion BNB’s recent highs reflect strong institutional interest, ecosystem expansion, and consistent network upgrades that reinforce its long-term value. While short-term corrections are possible, the fundamentals remain strong for continued growth. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing early investor attention with its explosive presale momentum and record-setting growth potential , making it a standout opportunity alongside established giants like BNB.

Analysts see MUTM reaching $1.5 ahead of ADA,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/23/best-crypto-to-buy-now-analysts-see-mutm-reaching-1-5-ahead-of-ada/,"As the crypto market gears up for the next bull cycle, investors are reassessing which projects hold the strongest potential for exponential growth. Established players like Cardano (ADA) continue to attract attention, but analysts are beginning to point toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a contender that may deliver bigger returns in less time. With ADA still consolidating and MUTM entering the market with clear fundamentals, the conversation around the best crypto to buy now is shifting fast. Cardano (ADA) Cardano, launched in 2017, has built its reputation on research-driven development and a focus on scalability. The 2021 bull run pushed it to a record high of $3.10, establishing it as one of the leading altcoins in terms of market value. Today, ADA trades at around $0.88, maintaining a solid position among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. While its ecosystem continues to expand with decentralized applications, staking pools, and smart contracts, the token’s price has struggled to match the momentum seen in earlier market cycles. Analysts suggest that while ADA continues to progress, its growth may be slower, as much of its utility has already been priced into the market. For investors chasing faster gains, ADA’s trajectory appears steadier rather than explosive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) approaches the market with a structure built to deliver both immediate use cases and long-term sustainability. Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, it already gives investors a clear advantage. The project has raised more than $14.75 million and attracted over 15,550 holders, highlighting the strong momentum behind its early growth. Instead of relying purely on market sentiment, the protocol is powered by real revenue and lending activity. As a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol, it operates through two models: The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system provides broad liquidity pools for established assets like ETH, USDT, and MATIC, allowing users to supply capital and earn yield. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system opens the door for direct lending and borrowing of tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, while shielding the broader liquidity pools from volatility. Deposits are matched with mtTokens, interest-bearing tokens that grow in value over time and provide added flexibility—whether traded, used as collateral, or staked for MUTM rewards. Unlike inflationary token systems, these rewards are powered by a buy-and-redistribute model, where protocol fees are used to purchase MUTM from the open market before being distributed to stakers. This design creates consistent buy pressure while keeping supply intact, a feature analysts see as critical for long-term token growth. Analysts predict faster growth trajectory than ADA What’s catching attention is not only MUTM’s tokenomics but also its rollout strategy. The beta platform will launch at the same time as the token lists on exchanges, ensuring utility from day one. Alongside this, the team is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will expand functionality and add another layer of value capture for the ecosystem. Experts believe these factors position MUTM for rapid adoption. 2. Predictions point to a potential climb toward $1.50 in its first major cycle, putting it ahead of ADA in growth speed, even if not in total market cap. For context, a $1,000 entry at the current $0.035 presale price would translate to over $42,000 at $1.50 — numbers that ADA, at its current market size, is less likely to replicate in the same time frame. Whale activity further supports this outlook. Large investors have begun accumulating MUTM during presale phases, a move typically reserved for projects expected to deliver outsized returns. For them, the combination of low entry price, confirmed exchange listings, and sustainable revenue flow presents an attractive setup. Why MUTM is being watched as the best crypto to buy now Several key factors are driving analysts to rank Mutuum Finance higher on their lists of altcoins heading into Q4: Clear Tokenomics: Rewards powered by protocol revenue. Immediate Utility: A beta version of the platform will go live alongside the token’s exchange debut. Stablecoin Integration: An ecosystem expansion that strengthens long-term value. Whale Confidence: High-value investors are securing positions early. Attractive Entry Price: A sub-$0.04 price point before a confirmed $0.06 listing. These combined elements position MUTM differently from projects like ADA, which, while stable and established, may not offer the same explosive near-term upside. A rising alternative to established altcoins Cardano remains one of the most respected blockchain projects in the market, but its growth potential has shifted toward steady progress rather than rapid gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is at the beginning of its trajectory, offering an early-stage opportunity with the structure and design to back long-term value. With its presale priced at just $0.035, a confirmed launch price of $0.06, and analysts forecasting a potential climb to $1.50, MUTM is being highlighted as one of the best cryptos to buy now. For investors seeking returns beyond what ADA’s slower growth may offer, MUTM represents a high-upside contender for 2025 and beyond.

Yesterday, before the post-Jackson Hole recovery began, Bitcoin dipped below $112,000, hitting its lowest level since early August. However, last week, Bitcoin hit a new high near $125,000, confirming the expected trend amid growing interest from institutional investors: declines following new highs become increasingly shallow. David Duong, Head of Institutional Research at Coinbase, noted that the current surge is a remarkable period in the development of cryptocurrencies: “The rally and subsequent shrinking pullbacks since the beginning of the year are closely linked to increased institutional demand and regulatory clarity.” Related News: Surprise Cryptocurrency Statement from FED Senior Official Bowman: “Change is Coming” On August 14, Bitcoin hit its fifth all-time high of the year at $124,496 before falling 10% to $111,658. While this decline was slightly larger than the 9% decline following the $123,194 peak in July, it was more limited than the sharp pullbacks in January and May. According to Duong, this reflects confidence in Bitcoin's resilience and the increased liquidity in the market. “Shallower declines reflect strong demand supported by long-term investors and corporate treasuries. This could also signal a potential regime shift in capital assumptions in the markets.” Bitcoin rose to prominence among risk-on assets in April, managing to stay above $80,000 despite President Donald Trump's tariff announcement. Maintaining this level throughout the year, Bitcoin's strength despite volatility in the stock market has drawn attention. Experts attribute this strength to increased institutional buying through ETFs and cryptocurrency-focused companies. DYOR CEO Ben Kurland stated that Bitcoin's movements this year indicate the maturation of the market: “The shallower pullbacks and faster recoveries after each peak demonstrate the growing influence of strong investors, deep conviction, and long-term holders.” Analysts predict that a potential interest rate cut in September could be a major catalyst, while a delay could trigger short-term selling pressure.

According to reports, Arizona lawmaker David Schweikert introduced the bill, Scam Farms Marque and Reprisal Authorization Act of 2025, in August. The bill proposes the use of state-sanctioned pirates to target cybercriminals wreaking havoc in the United States. Under the bill, these privately armed and equipped personnel contacted by the government will be authorized to employ all means reasonably necessary to seize property, detain, or punish cybercriminals that the president sees as a threat. United States to pass new crypto seizure bill Some of the threats highlighted in the bill include crypto theft, pig butchering scams, ransomware attacks, and accessing computers without authorization to gain personal or classified information. Others include identity theft, online password trafficking, and compromising computers with malicious code. “Criminal enterprises that employ cybercrimes and coerced labor present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the economic and national security of the United States,” the bill read. The bill characterizes scams as “acts of war” carried out by individuals, organized criminals, and foreign governments against the United States as a revival of an 18th-century law that could have implications for the future of cybersecurity and asset seizure if passed. The United States recorded more than $142 million in crypto losses to hackers in July, with the total amount of digital assets stolen by criminal entities so far in 2025 exceeding $3 billion. According to data from PeckShield, about $142 million was lost in 17 separate attacks across the crypto market, with CoinDCX suffering the most losses in all of the exploits. Aside from CoinDCX, which recorded a $44.2 million loss in July, GMX decentralized exchange also lost $40 million, although the hacker returned the stolen funds days later. Others in the top three include the $28 million lost by Big One exchange and the $12 million stolen from WOO X. Seized assets could be used to boost the US crypto reserve United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January establishing a Bitcoin and crypto reserve in the country, which could only accumulate digital assets obtained through forfeitures and other methods not tied to the budget. This means that stolen crypto seized by the United States law enforcement agencies could be forfeited to the government after the usual court proceedings. In July, the United States filed a civil complaint to claim over 20 Bitcoin, which was valued at around $2.3 million, seized by the Dallas, Texas, division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during an operation carried out against the Chaos ransomware hacker group. The United States Department of Justice also seized $1 million in digital assets from the BlackSuit ransomware group during the same month. This month, the DOJ has also authorized the seizure of $2.8 million in crypto from a wallet under the control of Ianis Aleksandrovich Antropenko, who was charged with targeting businesses and individuals with ransomware attacks. “As alleged in the unsealed warrants, the cryptocurrency and other assets are proceeds of (or were involved in laundering the proceeds of) ransomware activity,” the notice reads. “Those assets were laundered in various ways, including by using the cryptocurrency mixing service ChipMixer, which was taken down in a coordinated international operation in 2023. Antropenko also laundered cryptocurrency by exchanging cryptocurrency for cash and depositing the cash in structured cash deposits,” the DOJ said. He was charged with computer fraud and abuse, conspiring to commit computer fraud and abuse, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC recently dipped below the crucial $115,000 mark. This sudden movement has sparked discussions and analyses across the digital asset space. Currently, BTC is trading at $114,978.83 on the Binance USDT market. Such a swift decline often raises questions about market stability and future trends. For both seasoned traders and new entrants, understanding these shifts is essential. What Triggered This Significant Bitcoin Price Drop? When we see a substantial Bitcoin price drop , it’s natural to wonder about the underlying causes. While specific triggers can vary, several factors commonly influence cryptocurrency market movements. These include macroeconomic trends, regulatory news, and major liquidation events. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, such as inflation concerns or interest rate hikes, can push investors towards safer assets, away from more volatile cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Scrutiny: Announcements or rumors of new regulations in major economies often create fear and uncertainty, leading to selling pressure. Whale Activity: Large sell-offs by significant holders, often called “whales,” can quickly move the market, especially in less liquid trading pairs. Technical Resistance: BTC might have encountered strong selling pressure at a key technical resistance level, leading to a downward correction. It’s important to remember that crypto markets are highly interconnected. A movement in one major asset, like Bitcoin, often impacts altcoins as well. How Does a Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Investors? A sudden Bitcoin price drop can elicit various reactions from investors. For those holding BTC, it might mean a temporary decrease in portfolio value. However, experienced investors often view such dips as potential buying opportunities. New investors, on the other hand, might feel more anxious. Understanding the long-term potential of Bitcoin, despite short-term volatility, is key. Historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience, recovering from numerous significant corrections over its lifetime. This perspective helps in managing expectations and avoiding impulsive decisions. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights After a Bitcoin Price Drop When faced with market fluctuations, having a clear strategy is crucial. Here are some actionable insights to consider during a Bitcoin price drop : Do Your Research: Always stay informed about market news and trends. Reliable sources provide valuable context for price movements. Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions often lead to losses. Consider your original investment thesis and long-term goals. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. It helps to average out your purchase price over time and reduces the impact of volatility. Rebalance Your Portfolio: A dip can be an opportune moment to re-evaluate your asset allocation and adjust it according to your risk tolerance. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your cryptocurrencies are stored securely in reputable wallets, especially during volatile periods. Remember, the crypto market is known for its dynamic nature. Patience and a well-thought-out plan are your best allies. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin? While the recent Bitcoin price drop is a significant event, it’s part of the broader market cycle. Predicting exact future movements is challenging, but analysts often look at various indicators. These include trading volumes, on-chain data, and global economic indicators. Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition, including its decentralized nature and limited supply, continues to attract interest. Institutional adoption also plays a vital role in its long-term trajectory. Therefore, even after a dip, many remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s future. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 highlights the inherent volatility of the crypto market. While such movements can be concerning, they also offer opportunities for informed investors. By understanding the potential causes, managing emotions, and employing sound investment strategies, you can navigate these market dynamics effectively. Staying updated with reliable market monitoring, like that provided by Bitcoin World, is always a wise approach.

50545057,563890,1755957601,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50545057.jpeg,Memecoin Frenzy: Hackers Hijack Celeb Instagram Accounts To Push Dubious Token – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/hackers-celebrities-instagram-dubious-memecoin/,"In a rather shocking development, hackers took over the Instagram accounts of some music celebrities to promote a fraudulent Solana-based memecoin. This incident comes after another high-profile market controversy involving Kanye West’s YZY token. Celebrity Profiles Hacked, Memecoin Crashes After $900,000 Pump In an X post on Friday, popular media outlet NFR Podcasts reported that Instagram accounts belonging to the late Michael Jackson, as well as artists Adele, Tyla, and Future, had been simultaneously compromised to promote a scam memecoin. The fraudulent posts shared across the accounts featured an image of Future holding an oversized coin branded FREEBANDZ — the same name as the rapper’s music label and clothing brand. The imagery appeared designed to create a false sense of endorsement and legitimacy for the token. Although the posts have since been removed, Future’s Instagram account was ultimately disabled. And as of now, none of the affected parties has issued public statements regarding the incident. According to data from Dexscreener , the token briefly surged upon launch, reaching a market cap of nearly $900,000 before collapsing to around $15,000 in about 30 minutes. Michael Jackson, Future, Tyla, and Adele’s Instagram accounts were hacked simultaneously pic.twitter.com/MCMPcU41Ww — NFR Lite (@NFR_Lite) August 22, 2025 On-chain data suggests the scam’s orchestrator may be linked to a wallet address ending in zcmPHn, which dumped 700 million FREEBANDZ tokens, securing 251.41 SOL valued at approximately $45,600. Another wallet, ending in bTp, also walked away with an additional $13,300 after swapping 85.6 million FREEBANDZ.The rapid pump-and-dump underscores the risks surrounding memecoins and the ease with which hackers exploit high-profile names to lure in unsuspecting investors. In late 2024, for instance, rapper Drake’s X account was also compromised to promote a Solana memecoin called $ANITA, which generated around $5 million in trading volume before collapsing.Meme coins remain largely unregulated, and the SEC has previously clarified that most do not qualify as securities, likening them instead to speculative collectibles with no underlying promise of profit. This regulatory gap has made memecoins fertile ground for these kinds of scams, highlighting the need for caution among traders. Kanye West’s YZY Under Scrutiny For Insider Trading In other developments, rap legend Kanye West has become embroiled in another memecoin controversy. According to Bitcoinist , the YZY token skyrocketed to a $3 billion market cap at launch before plunging more than 70% within hours. On-chain data shows several wallets were pre-funded and primed to buy immediately after Ye’s announcement, fueling suspicions of insider trading. Notably, 13 wallets collectively walked away with $24 million in profits from the YZY frenzy. The token now trades at $0.705, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $699.3 million.",memecoins|Adele|Drake|FREEBANDZ|Future|Kanye West|memecoin|rug pull|solana|YZY,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 14:00:01

He ridiculed predictions by Crypto Rover, who suggested that Ethereum (ETH) could double, Chainlink (LINK) could climb tenfold, but XRP would only see a 0.5x gain. Egrag’s post, complete with laughing emojis, called out what he sees as a fundamental misunderstanding of XRP’s potential , while criticizing Bitcoin maximalists for isolating their views to narrow technical analyses. The commentary reflects the ongoing tension between XRP advocates and those who underestimate the token’s role in the broader crypto market. Crypto Rover’s Forecast and the XRP Disparity Rover’s outlook for the next two to four months (October–December 2025) is ambitious across the board. He forecasts Bitcoin surging to $135,000-$190,000, Ethereum reaching $7,000-$9,500, and XRP climbing to $3.20-$4.80. Tell me you are a retard without saying it: #ETH will 2X #LINK will 10X But #XRP will 0.5X! #BTCMAXIS have a mentality that fails to comprehend what #XRP is, or they are just following @Coins_Kid ’s TA exclusively while isolating hundreds of other analyses stating… pic.twitter.com/EPu4SOlpwR — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 23, 2025 While the targets for Bitcoin and Ethereum suggest massive moves, his projection for XRP appears comparatively conservative, sparking frustration within the XRP community. For Egrag, such predictions undersell the asset’s long-term trajectory. By setting ambitious targets for ETH and LINK against a more subdued XRP forecast, he illustrated how skewed attitudes toward XRP can arise from a narrow focus rather than a comprehensive market view. XRP’s Current Position As of report time, XRP trades around $3.04, with intraday swings between $2.79 and $3.10. This price keeps it squarely within Rover’s range but toward the lower bound, suggesting that his forecast is achievable even without dramatic short-term movement. Importantly, XRP has already delivered a strong performance in 2025, gaining momentum as adoption of Ripple’s technology deepens globally. Its present price action signals growing resilience, with analysts watching for decisive moves above key resistance zones. Technical Structure and Broader Projections Egrag Crypto has consistently emphasized a key trading range for XRP between $2.65 and $3.65, with support at $2.90 and resistance levels at $3.20, $3.45, and $3.65. A sustained breakout above $3.65, he argues, could trigger a major upward push toward new all-time highs. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other analysts share this view, with some mapping XRP’s chart structures to targets far beyond Rover’s forecast. Ali Martinez recently pointed to a potential breakout pattern suggesting XRP could climb to $12.60 in the coming months. Elliott Wave models have even suggested short-term surges of over 300%, while broader narratives tied to ETF speculation and regulatory clarity continue to fuel optimism. A Divided Outlook The contrast between Rover’s cautious stance and Egrag’s biting rebuttal highlights the polarization surrounding XRP’s valuation. With XRP currently at $3.04, a modest increase to $4.80 is within reach. However, many analysts argue that this limited target overlooks the token’s underlying structural and institutional strengths that could drive greater growth. With Ripple’s technology gaining global traction and long-term projections extending into double digits, XRP remains one of the most debated cryptocurrencies. Egrag Crypto’s remark was a challenge to the prevailing narrative that undervalues XRP’s potential. While Crypto Rover’s forecast frames XRP as a modest mover compared to ETH and LINK, today’s price action and technical outlook suggest the token may be positioned for far greater upside. For investors and observers alike, the debate serves as a reminder: XRP’s story cannot be reduced to simplified projections, and its trajectory remains one of the most compelling in the digital asset space.

50545378,https://cryptonews.com/?p=412910,1755957960,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50545378.jpeg,IRS Digital Assets Chief Trish Turner Resigns After Three Months,https://cryptonews.com/news/irs-digital-assets-chief-trish-turner-resigns-after-three-months/,"Trish Turner has stepped down as head of the United States Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) digital assets division, leaving the role after just three months. Key Takeaways: IRS digital assets chief Trish Turner resigned after just three months and will join Crypto Tax Girl as tax director. Her departure comes amid growing scrutiny of the IRS’s handling of crypto taxation and calls for clearer policy frameworks. Turner’s move reflects a wider trend of senior regulators transitioning into crypto advisory roles as the industry faces major compliance shifts. Turner announced her departure in a LinkedIn post on Friday, reflecting on her two-decade career at the agency. “After more than 20 years with the IRS, I have closed an extraordinary chapter of my career with deep appreciation for those who shaped my journey and made the work so meaningful,” she wrote. Turner Vows to Bridge Gap Between Industry and Regulators Turner added that she looked forward to “building bridges between industry and regulators” from a new position outside the agency. Bloomberg Tax later reported that Turner will join Crypto Tax Girl, a private tax advisory firm, as its new tax director. Founder Laura Walter confirmed the appointment, saying Turner’s expertise will help clients navigate the growing list of compliance challenges. “With all of the big crypto tax and compliance changes on the horizon, we are excited to have Trish on board,” Walter said. Her resignation comes at a critical moment for U.S. crypto taxation. The IRS has been under increasing pressure to modernize its digital asset strategy, following repeated criticism from lawmakers and watchdog agencies over its handling of crypto-related investigations. Turner herself was only appointed in May, following the departures of Sulolit “Raj” Mukherjee and Seth Wilks, who left the division after roughly a year. IRS Director Trish Turner left the Dark Side to become a Crypto Jedi Knight. Also to make 10X what the IRS paid her. Bio listed within hours. Don't hate on her. One less of them. One more of us. pic.twitter.com/AgzjXWn1I9 — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) August 22, 2025 The shake-up coincides with heightened congressional scrutiny. Last month, the House Committee on Ways and Means announced a hearing on how to establish a clear tax framework for digital assets. Earlier in July, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration recommended reforms to the IRS’s criminal investigation unit, citing failures to follow protocols in crypto cases. Meanwhile, the broader regulatory environment has shifted under the Trump administration. In April, the president signed a resolution overturning a Biden-era rule that would have required decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to report user transactions to the IRS. Turner’s move to the private sector highlights the ongoing migration of senior government officials into crypto-focused firms, as the industry braces for sweeping changes in U.S. tax and compliance policy. IRS Ramps Up Crypto Tax Crackdown With Surge in Warning Letters As reported, the IRS has intensified its scrutiny of crypto investors in the United States, sending out a wave of warning letters over the past two months. Tax experts say the letters point to growing enforcement efforts after the agency flagged discrepancies in filings linked to digital asset transactions. CoinLedger, a crypto tax filing platform, said it received nearly 800 customer support queries about IRS letters between May and June, nine times more than the same period in 2024. Tax attorneys have also seen a spike in outreach, with some firms now fielding multiple calls each week from concerned clients, compared to little or no activity last year.

The deal was confirmed Friday by Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi, who spoke with Reuters . No price was shared, but the deal is being done using Databricks’ private shares. Tecton was last valued at $900 million back in 2022 and has around 90 employees today. This is just the latest in a growing list of deals. Databricks is using its massive private valuation to snatch up companies that plug right into its broader AI strategy. This specific acquisition is focused on real-time machine learning infrastructure. Tecton sells tools that allow companies to deploy and serve AI models at scale, with low latency, something Databricks wants to bake directly into its own platform. Databricks targets real-time AI agents with Tecton deal Tecton wasn’t just some outside partner. It already had ties with Databricks. In 2022, Tecton announced official partnerships with both Databricks and rival Snowflake, and since then, both of those companies have invested in Tecton. Many of Tecton’s users, including Coinbase , already use Databricks services in their AI stack. Now Databricks wants to tighten that loop. Ghodsi said Tecton’s software and team will help scale up Agent Bricks, which is the company’s product for building and automating workflows with AI agents. Speed is the goal. “It’s really the real-time building block to feed real-time information into the agents,” he said. He explained that things like voice-based AI systems require instant feedback. “Many of the use cases are directly user-facing and human-facing, and humans hate to wait.” Tecton was founded in 2020 by engineers who used to work at Uber. These engineers helped build Michelangelo, the internal AI system Uber uses to run features like real-time pricing. That experience turned into a commercial product focused on helping other companies serve AI systems that need fast, live data. Since launching, Tecton raised $160 million from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Ventures. But it didn’t go public or get acquired, until now. The company stayed private while building out a solid user base, with enterprise customers already putting its tools into real-world AI systems . The new deal doesn’t say what happens to Tecton’s product line, but the clear signal is that its technology and engineers are now going to be absorbed into Databricks’ AI platform. Databricks is making these acquisitions on the back of a growing valuation. Just this week, the company said it signed a term sheet for a fresh funding round at over $100 billion, a jump of more than 60% from eight months ago. That gives Databricks the ability to issue more private shares and keep buying startups that strengthen its AI muscle. This year alone, they’ve bought Neon, a serverless database startup, for $1 billion, and Tabular, which brings in the creators of the Apache Iceberg data format. Last year, they paid $1.3 billion for MosaicML, a generative AI platform.

The increase in the crypto market again boosted the confidence of investors in both old and new altcoins. One of the most popular projects is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has crossed $12.8 million in its presale, with analysts expecting considerable upside. Bitcoin Regains Investor Confidence Bitcoin recently declined close to 9% from its mid-August all-time high of $124,474, as it tested support at roughly $112,000 in what analysts called a healthy post-halving pullback. Rebound towards 115,000 led traders to believe the long uptrend and short-covering, with RSI levels having undershot. Despite near-term corrections, analysts note that institutional inflows remain in place. Furthermore, they forecast a return to the $130,000 mark in a couple of months if liquidity strengthens. Market sentiment has gone from a rather cautious outlook to a more positive one. Many are seeing the dip as an opportunity to accumulate. As Bitcoin looks to re-establish support, investors are also shifting capital into promising altcoins that may outperform in the next breakout phase. Ethereum Consolidates Before Next Move Ethereum is following Bitcoin’s correction as price tumbles below $4200 after failing to break $4800 earlier this month. Presently trading close to $4,155, ETH is propped up by record ETF inflows recently exceeding $1 billion and network adoption in DeFi and NFTs. Key support lies between $4,100 to $3,900 while resistance at $4,450 and $4,700. Many analysts expect ETH to retest $5,000 before the year-end and have a bullish view on a medium-term basis. Investors who plan for the future like to hold Eth because it remains the most powerful smart contract network. MAGACOIN FINANCE Surges Past $12.8 Million Bitcoin’s recovery from the $112K fear zone has reignited market confidence, but analysts say the bigger momentum shift is with MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has already surged past $12.8 million raised. Backed by whale inflows and strong fundamentals, it’s being forecast for 65x upside , making it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 before the next breakout. The project has distinguished itself from other presales with transparent audits, capped supply, and a community-driven model that has accelerated adoption. Investor enthusiasm has been fueled by the combination of whale-backed participation and growing traction across retail segments. With early buyers getting an extra presale bonus, demand is intensifying, and allocations are disappearing faster than anticipated. Analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could replicate the kind of explosive growth seen in previous cycles when community-led tokens surged from niche plays to mainstream attention. Altcoin Rotation Continues As investment capital rotates away from Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is being diverted into other strong performers, including Solana, Avalanche, and XRP. Solana continues to be stable around $180 amid record network throughput and ecosystem upgrades. Similarly, Avalanche is gaining enterprise traction (VISA, FIFA) because of partnerships. XRP’s price continues to hover around $3.00 due to its payment specialist asset amidst ETF delays and strong institutional demand. Conclusion As Bitcoin rallies from the $112k fear zone and Ethereum consolidates for its next move, investors are searching for the best cryptos to position for 2025. While the major assets maintain strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the standout opportunities emerging, having already breached $12.8 million raised with whale-backed demand. With predictions of up to 65x, investors have labelled the presale to be among the most strategic buys of the moment, with allocations rapidly running out.

Looking ahead, I believe the bulls overstated the benefits from recent policy shifts, including a US Bitcoin reserve and 401(k) crypto access. These developments offer both significant opportunities and also potential headwinds for Coinbase. While these policies could boost institutional legitimacy and customer base, they may also reduce volatility, dampen trading activity, and increase competition. COIN Stock: Q2 2025 earnings report Coinbase Global, Inc.'s ( COIN ) recently released its Q2 2025 earnings report [ER]. As a popular crypto stock on the Seeking Alpha platform, the ER has been reviewed by several other authors shortly. As such, in this article, I will focus only on one aspect that is less often mentioned. I will comment on the impact of the recent policy shifts, with the most notable ones being the potential for the establishment of a US cryptocurrency reserve and also President Donald Trump's recent executive order regarding 401(k) funds. These developments are interpreted as a net positive for the stock judging by the lasting rating on the stock (see the chart below). This article will explain why the impacts are unlikely to be all positive and can present both opportunities and challenges for COIN going forward. These considerations create large EPS uncertainties. Together with some valuation risks, I see no obvious bias in its risk/reward ratio and rate the stock as a hold. Seeking Alpha Let me start with a quick recap for its Q2 ER in case there are readers unfamiliar with the numbers yet. Coinbase recorded strong second-quarter results, as you can see from the sales metrics below. Total revenues came in at $1.42 billion (a 2.9% increase YOY), and subscription and service revenues reached $656 million, towards the higher end of the guidance range. I believe the main drivers in the past quarters have elevated cryptocurrency trading volumes amid crypto price volatility. The business also begins to reap the rewards from its growing derivatives operations, in my assessment. Against this backdrop, next I will detail my thoughts on the potential impact of the recent policy shifts. COIN Q2 ER COIN Stock: a closer look at its business Looking further into the financials, Consumer Trading keeps generating the bulk of its revenues. As you can see from the following sales breakdown, net Consumer Trading Revenues came in at almost $650 million for the quarter, dwarfing net institutional trading revenues of $60.8 million by more than 10 folds. In terms of specific trading volumes, bitcoin trading volume keeps playing a dominating role, as you can see from the statistic provided in the second chart below. In Q2 2025, bitcoin trading volume represents 30% of the total trading volume, about double the second place (Ethereum at 15%). With this understanding of its revenue mix and trading activities, next I will explain the potential challenges and opportunities I see from the recent policy shifts in its operations. COIN Q2 ER COIN Q2 ER COIN Stock: potential policy shifts Judging by recent developments, the cryptocurrency market continues to mature. Two notable examples are the potential for the establishment of a US cryptocurrency reserve and also President Trump's recent executive order regarding 401(k) funds. On the first catalyst, an executive order issued in March 2025 stated the creation of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve with “bitcoins forfeited from criminal or civil asset forfeitures.” These assessments were held by the Department of Treasury, and its Secretary Scott Bessent recently announced the potential of his department to add to this reserve (see his post below). Scott Bessent The second catalyst could have an even larger and more profound impact for the long term. President Trump recently (in early August) also signed an executive order to “democratizes access to alternative assets for 401(k) investors.” Bitcoins—and various funds and derivatives based on them - could be included in these alternative assets. This could open a vast consumer and institutional base for these assets. For example, recent statistics show that more than 70 million Americans participate in 401(k) saving plans or other similar plans, with a total balance of ~$9 trillion currently sitting in these plans. The establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the 401(k) access could lead to progress of legislation in Congress. This potential of policy shifts certainly can have positive impacts on COIN’s operation. For example, I expect these shifts to grant cryptocurrency institutional legitimacy and thus help COIN grow its institutional customer base. I also expect these shifts to help bolster Coinbase’s crypto derivatives platform. The company is in the process of acquiring Deribit, a global leader in crypto options. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2025 and should expand COIN’s derivatives product suite and global footprint substantially (see the chart below). COIN Q2 ER Other risks and final thoughts However, I do not believe the impacts to be all positive. I see plenty of headwinds from these potential policy shifts as well for COIN’s operation. To start, with the regulation clarity and entry of institutional participants, I foresee muted price volatility going forward both for bitcoins and other crypto currencies. In my experience, trading activities (especially those from retail investors) tend to correlate with price volatility. When/if price volatility decreases, I thus expect to see reducing trading activities, which could counterbalance the expanded customer base and bring about the same regulatory clarity. Regulatory clarity also tends to invite more competition and could pressure the transaction fees that COIN can charge. If history is of guidance, when I shopped for a stock trading platform for my first investment account (about 20 years ago), they all charged hefty trading fees. Today, all the platforms I use charge no fee at all. Another risk worth noting is cost, which has been increasing due to its expansion efforts. In the meantime, as seen in the table below, transaction expenses have been increasing as well. In Q2, transaction expenses represented 17% of the net revenue, compared to 15% a quarter ago and 14% a year ago. COIN Q2 ER These secular and operation uncertainties can eventually lead to large EPS uncertainties. As a reflection, there is a large variance in its EPS estimates among the consensus ahead, despite the upbeat guidance just mentioned. To quote a few numbers, for full year 2025, COIN’s EPS is projected to be $7.88 at the midpoint estimate, implying a quite pricy P/E of 38x. Also note that the large variance is away from the midpoint estimate, with a low of $6.36 to a high of $8.99, a variance of more than 40%. The variance becomes even more dramatic (more than 4-fold) for the next year of 2026. To recap, this article mainly focused on the business update of COIN as provided in its Q2 ER and the potential impacts from recent policy shifts. The most notable shifts in my view are a potential US cryptocurrency reserve and the changes to retirement funds. I believe the bulls are underestimating the headwinds these developments can cause, and I see both opportunities and challenges. Together with my consideration of the valuation risks, I do not see a skewed risk/reward ratio for the stock under current conditions.

While Solana forms classic accumulation bases and Ethereum experiences corrective waves, Remittix is steadily advancing, establishing itself as a leading cross-border crypto solution. Solana forms a bullish base amid volatility Solana has emerged from its descending channel into two clear consolidation zones, signaling the end of a prolonged downtrend. These Wyckoff-style accumulation boxes indicate that sellers are losing strength while buyers quietly regain control. Technical analysts highlight an ascending triangle forming on the weekly chart, with higher lows defending a trendline in place for months. A breakout above the $260 resistance could propel SOL toward $320–$350, supported by over $1 billion bridged into Solana over the last 30 days, surpassing Ethereum and other L2 networks. Ethereum correction sparks rebound hopes Ethereum’s price recently approached new all-time highs before encountering resistance near $4,200. On-chain indicators including the Block Subsidy Model and MVRV Pricing Bands point to a correctional wave four potentially being underway to conclude an intermediate correction. Arthur Hayes and Tom Lee are some of the most influential analysts who are bullish and cite positive price action, inflows into ETFs and surging dominance to support their sentiments. Recent recoveries indicate that Ethereum price could continue its five-wave bullish trend to make new cycle tops. Remittix surpasses milestones while SOL and ETH consolidate Remittix is currently priced at $0.0969, with over 614 million tokens sold and $20.7 million raised. The project has already launched its BitMart listing and is preparing a second CEX listing at $22 million, reflecting strong investor demand and liquidity growth.

At the forefront are Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale phase 6 at $0.035 after a 16.17% gain in the previous phase. Investors are anticipating over 300% ROI at launch. Mutuum Finance presale has already exceeded over $14.75 million and has already been bought by over 15550 owners. MUTM stands out because of its strategic partnerships and liquidity incentives, and it’s one of the tokens to watch out for. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Market Price and Overview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently priced at approximately $0.00001267, with its trading volume over the past 24 hours standing at approximately $207 million. SHIB has declined by approximately 9.2% in the past week, underperforming the broader cryptocurrency market during this time. This is in spite of the token boasting a market capitalization of over $7 billion, signifying its consistent place within the digital asset space. Some of the recent events that have taken place include the formation of a “death cross” on the price chart, a sign of bearish momentum. Technical analysis also suggests a possible bullish divergence with some predictors seeing a possible 156% rally if current trends are sustained. The Chainlink integration also introduces a new token-burning mechanism that should reduce supply and possibly introduce price stability. In spite of such reasons inducing ongoing controversy, it is to be mentioned that some other forthcoming projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also popular in the marketplace. Mutuum Finance $50K Bug Bounty The Mutuum Finance project team is providing a maximum of $50,000 USDT reward to the members for discovering the potential vulnerabilities of the project.

But analysts say the money, already earmarked under a federal program, won’t revive Intel’s contract chipmaking unless it wins outside customers for its new 14A process. Chief Executive Lip Bu Tan, who took over in March, cautioned last month that Intel might exit contract chipmaking if it fails to secure major clients. “Going forward, our investment in Intel 14A will be based on confirmed customer commitments,” he said. Summit Insights’ Kinngai Chan stressed that scale is critical to the unit’s viability. He said “Intel must secure enough customers’ volume to go to production for its 18A and 14A nodes to make its foundry arm economically viable,” and “we don’t think any government investment will change the fate of its foundry arm if they cannot secure enough customers.” Intel lags behind rivals in advanced chips TSMC leads in advanced process technology and Nvidia dominates AI chips. To win orders, Intel must demonstrate consistent, high-yield production at the leading edge. The 18A process , less advanced than 14A, is reportedly dealing with yield challenges, meaning too few chips are meeting spec. Chipmakers like TSMC often absorb early low-yield costs when ramping new nodes for big customers such as Apple. With six straight quarters of net losses, Intel has less room to shoulder those expenses and still turn a profit. “If the yield is bad then new customers won’t use Intel Foundry, so it really won’t fix the technical aspect of the company,” said Ryuta Makino, an analyst at Gabelli Funds, which holds Intel shares. As noted in a Reuters report Makino still expects yields to improve over time, but views the equity move as less favorable than simply receiving CHIPS Act support as originally outlined under the Biden Administration. “This isn’t free money,” he said. Intel said the federal government will not take a board seat and will align its votes with the company’s directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with “limited exceptions.” The shares for Washington will be issued at a 17.5% discount to Friday’s close. The purchase would make the U.S. government Intel’s largest shareholder, though neither Trump nor Intel specified when the deal will close. Intel’s stock rose 5.5% Friday on the news, then slipped 1% in after-hours trading once the terms were released. Year-to-date, the shares are up 23% as Tan has announced sizable job cuts. Deal signals unusual White House role in corporate Affairs The move, reported earlier by Cryptopolitan, represents another atypical White House intervention in corporate affairs and aligns with Trump’s push to expand domestic production and jobs. It follows remarks earlier this month in which Trump called Tan “highly conflicted” over ties to Chinese firms and urged his resignation, before later reversing his stance. Some analysts argue that federal backing could still help as Intel builds out its factories. Intel says it has more than $100 billion earmarked for U.S. expansion and expects high-volume production to start later this year at its Arizona site. “To have access to capital and a new partial owner that wants to see you succeed are both important,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel. Intel says the government’s $8.9 billion comes on top of $2.2 billion already granted, for $11.1 billion total. The deal also gives the government a five-year option to buy 5% more Intel shares at $20 each if Intel’s stake in the foundry falls below 51%. The announcement comes on the heels of a $2 billion infusion from SoftBank earlier this week. “This is a great deal for America and, also, a great deal for Intel. Building leading edge semiconductors and chips, which is what Intel does, is fundamental to the future of our nation,” Trump said on Friday.

The footage, taken from the fiatleak platform, displayed a rapid flow of transactions that stood out against normal activity. Xaif summarized the moment, stating that this was not “noise” but instead a signal worth recognizing. Significance of the $27 Million Volume Burst A one-minute trading burst of this scale is significant because it indicates concentrated market activity far above typical flows. Such a sudden influx of orders suggests that large participants may be actively positioning, either through institutional purchases, accumulation by whales , or high-frequency strategies responding to liquidity conditions. Events of this size are rarely explained by retail activity alone, which makes the $27 million spike an indicator of deeper market interest from institutional investors, who have recently shown increased interest in the digital asset. XRP VOLUME EXPLOSION $XRP just clocked $27M traded in 1 MINUTE That’s not noise… that’s a bullrun signal pic.twitter.com/TWLB7KImJv — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 22, 2025 What Does This Mean for XRP? The video provided by Xaif adds credibility to the observation because fiatleak aggregates live exchange data. Unlike general market summaries that smooth out short-term anomalies, minute-by-minute visuals reveal the intensity and distribution of orders in real time. When activity of this magnitude occurs, it can trigger major market movements. In a positive reading, such bursts often signal healthy liquidity and the willingness of large players to transact in size without destabilizing the market. This kind of participation can act as a foundation for stronger price support if sustained across multiple sessions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Potential Signal of Broader Momentum Xaif suggests that this spike in volume is a bull run signal, matching the positive sentiment that has surrounded XRP since the court approved the joint stipulation for dismissal filed by Ripple and the SEC. With the lawsuit now over, investors may be flooding the market, anticipating a massive price increase. While one event does not confirm a trend, this builds on a recent global surge in volume when XRP hit over $33 million in just one minute . Historical precedents in XRP and other high-liquidity assets show that outsized volume spikes often precede larger directional moves. Traders monitoring similar spikes in the past have linked them to institutional entry points or the buildup to stronger rallies, and the market is now anticipating a massive price surge.

In an August 22 post on X, Schwartz revealed: “Last three days look good and my hub should be ready to be considered in production next week.” This update follows days of consistent testing, indicating that a key infrastructure milestone could be reached soon. Schwartz remains the direct source of this information, actively sharing progress and technical details with the community. The Purpose of the Hub The “hub” Schwartz refers to is not a new feature but rather a backbone server for the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Its goal is to improve the connectivity of key XRPL nodes, ensuring more reliable performance across the network. Last three days look good and my hub should be ready to be considered in production next week. pic.twitter.com/NxmCvtnUtH — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 22, 2025 Over the past several days, Schwartz has tested bandwidth, latency, peer connections, and system stability, reporting clean and consistent performance. This work is designed to minimize sync disruptions and strengthen the ledger’s resilience under heavy load. A Personal Initiative for the Community Importantly, Schwartz has clarified that this project is his personal initiative, not an official Ripple product rollout. Earlier this month, he described the most valuable addition for XRPL as a “high-quality hub” with reserved slots for Unique Node List (UNL) validators , other hubs, and application servers. This approach emphasizes neutrality and community benefit, rather than corporate control, which is why many XRPL developers and operators are watching closely. Technical Backbone and Why It Matters Schwartz has previously outlined the specifications of this hub, which include modern multi-core processors, high-capacity memory, NVMe storage, and a 10 Gbps internet link housed in a New York data center. Such a setup is engineered for high uptime and low latency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The intended benefit is straightforward: to provide XRPL validators and applications with a dependable, well-connected server that smooths traffic, reduces reconnection issues, and accelerates recovery during network stress. For users and services built on XRPL, this could mean fewer interruptions and improved performance across the ecosystem. What Comes Next With the latest tests showing three straight days of stable results, Schwartz believes his hub may be ready to transition into production next week. If confirmed, this move would represent a meaningful upgrade to XRPL’s network reliability. The community will be closely watching how the hub performs in real-world conditions, including latency, peer stability, and throughput under heavy demand. For now, Schwartz’s signal is clear: his independent infrastructure project is nearing a production-ready state, and a formal update is expected in the coming days. This report is based on David Schwartz’s public posts and verified technical details he has shared regarding his XRPL hub testing.

The tax reform will center on crypto and make the current laws on the asset less punitive. A move that could now support the crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Japan’s FSA Targets Fairer Taxation for Crypto Earnings According to a report , Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering the integration of the Small Investment Tax Exemption System (NISA) into the 2026 tax reform. This is part of a broader plan to make the nation a hub for “asset management.” The idea behind the move is to make the country attractive to potential investors, particularly corporations interested in cryptocurrency. It has become necessary to reform the tax law, given that under current conditions, profits from cryptocurrency are considered “miscellaneous income.” This gain may be subject to up to 55% progressive rates after including local levies. Many investors in Japan have criticized the high rates as punishing, considering that equities and bonds are pegged at a flat rate of 20%. Proposed 20% Flat Rate Could Boost Investor Participation However, the FSA’s proposal would see crypto earnings being taxed at the same rate of 20% as stocks. If this happens, it could lessen the financial strain that traders currently experience in the market space. Notably, the move could encourage greater participation from both individual and institutional investors . This might pave the way for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to debut in the country. Worth noting is that Japan has yet to authorize a spot Bitcoin ETF. The proposal for reclassification is likely to make the launch possible. With the reform looking to classify cryptocurrencies as financial products, the country’s regulators will be able to enforce laws on insider trading and provide protection for investors. Japan’s Growing Crypto Market Shows Institutional Potential Interestingly, Japan has huge digital asset potential. The FSA notes that there are over 12 million active domestic crypto accounts in the country. These collectively have crypto assets valued at over five trillion yen (about $34 billion). The Japanese market is already active with activities from Metaplanet , the institutional Bitcoin accumulator that has borrowed Michael Saylor, led by Strategy. As of the last count, Metaplanet has 18,888 BTC in its holdings worth about $2.18 billion. Ripple Labs has also launched its USD stablecoin (RLUSD) in the Japanese market. These developments hint at the potential of Japan for crypto assets.

According to Wedson, Ethereum is entering a critical period, and the coming weeks hold both opportunities and risks. This could be the precursor to a new phase of reaccumulation, according to the analyst. Wedson predicts that algorithmic trading could intensify around the $7,000-$7,500 level. Wedson, noting Bitcoin's cyclical movements, said, “Approximately 28 days after the record high, ETH is likely to absorb a significant capital inflow from BTC. Current data suggests this pattern may reoccur.” Related News: BREAKING: Ethereum (ETH) Breaks All-Time High Price Record Wedson noted that Ethereum's open interest has reached levels quite similar to Bitcoin's, explaining that this situation is a sign of high volatility. “The good news is that high volatility creates numerous opportunities,” he said. “The bad news is that such moments of euphoria usually don't last long,” he said. According to the analyst, ETH is generally exhibiting a stronger outlook than BTC. Wedson also warned that sudden movements similar to the rug pull could occur frequently in derivatives markets over the next two months. The expert urged investors to remain cautious, saying, “The bear market could begin in November-December 2025.” *This is not investment advice.

By 2028, IOST may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.01642. By 2031, IOST might touch $0.026682 with an average trading price of $0.025656. The IOST token is also known as the Internet of Service Token and is the native token of the IOST blockchain ecosystem. The platform provides an elaborate smart contracts platform that rivals Ethereum, EOS , and TRON. According to the IOST Team, the ecosystem provides one of the fastest and most scalable networks, with the ability to process up to 20,000 transactions per second. An achievement that is unthinkable for other blockchain ecosystems alike. The IOST crypto is the backbone of this platform, and the success of the blockchain ecosystem could translate to the increased value of the IOST coin. Essentially, the price projections consider the viability of the tokens ecosystem, as well as the past price action of the coin since its launch. Considering these factors, the IOST token shows a promising future, and crypto investors should generally prepare for high Returns on Investments. The cryptocurrency market cap has declined significantly following the falling price of Bitcoin, Ethereum , and other prominent cryptocurrency coins with higher market capitalization. However, crypto experts believe the bearish trend is temporary, and the IOST coin will soon resume its long-term bullish momentum in subsequent years. What does IOS Token’s future look like? Let’s get into the details.

The bearish supremacy has led to a loss of up to 1.89 percent of value during the day. Technical indicators give a bearish signal, and the price charts also continue to support the sellers. Is IOST a good investment? The future growth of IOST depends on different factors, including new tech solutions for IOST projects, legal situations, announcements, and the general crypto environment. Though there is no market consensus on future price movements, many crypto analysts expect IOST to gradually increase its worth over the coming years. IOST blockchain is built on a consensus algorithm called “Proof of Believability” (PoB), and its price is expected to reach $0.012999 by the end of 2027, which, if it happens, would be a significant increase. Why is IOST down? IOST’s price moved up by 1.46 percent over the last week. The fast ascent observed over the past day also played a crucial role, and the support has gained further stability. However, overall, the coin is trading at a lower level than where it was a few months ago, with the current IOST price of $0.00363, as it decreased by 1.89 percent today. Will IOST reach $0.0150? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, IOST will also join the rally. As a token of a service-oriented ecosystem and next-gen blockchain, it runs mostly on prevailing adoption. It is expected that the coin will touch this level by the start of 2028 if market sentiment remains positive. Will IOST reach $0.0250? Considering IOST’s current price of $0.0034, $0.0250 is still a far-reaching target. However, the robust community support and favoritism for this specific meme coin can push it to the $0.0250 level in 2031. Will IOST reach $1? Despite the risk involved with cryptocurrencies, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. Analysts don’t see IOST reaching the $1 mark in the foreseeable future. However, it is worth holding as an asset for good profits. Does IOST have a good long-term future? IOST is down by more than 36% if observed over the last year, and more concerningly, the token value has deteriorated by more than 85% over the past three years. This scenario makes it a difficult choice, but on the other hand, there is no consensus on the positive or negative movement of IOST’s price action. A larger chunk of the market expects the IOST value to increase over the coming years, possibly reaching a maximum value of $0.009578 by the end of the next year.

IOST historic price sentiment IOST price history The price of the IOST token has experienced several price fluctuations since its launch. The general price of the token has registered high volatility over time. The token’s price shot steadily after its launch, sparking interest across the crypto space in 2018. The IOST token recorded its ATH in January 2018, reaching $0.1365. However, the buying power began to decline as time progressed, and the price fell below its launch price at the end of 2018 to $0.0131. The token experienced strong resistance since then, and the price fell to $0.00983 in June 2019 and decreased further to $0.0054 in December. IOST traded below its opening price for the entire 2020 in a range of $0.00285 to $0.00673. The token’s price then went downward to record its all-time low price of $0.001562 on March 13, 2020. IOST finally broke into bullish territory in 2021. The price then significantly rose to $0.07976, spiking twice to this level within five months. In April 2022, the token broke below support, reaching $0.0068 at the end of December. The IOST price remained low in 2023, touching the highest point of $0.01213 and dipping to the $0.007034 level by the end of the year. IOST started 2024 trading at $0.0101 but dropped to $0.008185 in February. Looking at the past performance, in late February, IOST started its ascent and peaked at $0.01358 on March 15, while maintaining near the same price level until April 11. The downfall started again in mid-April when the price dropped to $0.008732 in May. The token dropped in June, July, and August, reaching a low price of $0.0045. IOST traded near $0.0045 at the start of November when it peaked at $0.0114 on December 2024. In January 2025, IOST was trading near the $0.0064 range after shedding 48% of its value, and April saw the year’s lowest price of $0.00284. In July, IOST spiked to $0.00540 momentarily but corrected down to $0.0044 soon after. In August 2025, IOST is trending near $0.0034, as the current IOSToken sentiment is bearish according to the latest data gathered.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|ICO|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-23 15:13:43

Operational growth is driven by Go Fund Yourself and MARKET.live, but revenues remain small and losses persist, making profitability a distant goal. The stock’s recent surge is tied to its TON holdings; however, the underlying business does not justify the current valuation without significant, sustained growth. For investors seeking TON exposure, direct purchase of the cryptocurrency is preferable to buying Verb stock, given the company’s ongoing losses and execution risks. Verb Technology Company Inc. ( VERB ) has undergone a dramatic transformation in recent years. Originally positioned as a SaaS provider for interactive video-based sales tools, the company has pivoted into the fields of social commerce and digital asset management. The cause for the recent stock price movement is the decision to initiate a corporate treasury of Toncoin, the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON) blockchain. This has become much more common for companies to hold crypto on the balance sheet. This is even more than just buying crypto to store in the Treasury. The company recently announced that its treasury assets exceed $713 million of TON , which is more than half of its market cap. The company is also planning to rebrand as Ton Strategy Company. It is not merely adding crypto to the Treasury holdings, but more so that the company intends to put focus on crypto as a business. My question becomes, is there any value in the underlying business, or is all the value in the holding of TON? If an investor is going to buy into the business just to hold TON, then why not go buy and hold TON directly? Is the underlying business going to hold back or increase the value of the Treasury holdings? Company Overview Verb operates at the intersection of livestream shopping, AI-powered video engagement, and most recently, blockchain-based treasury strategies. The company operates in three business units: MARKET.live, Go Fund Yourself (a TV show), and Vanity Prescribed/Good Girl Rx. MARKET.live is an omnichannel livestream shopping marketplace designed to capitalize on the growth of influencer-led retail and video commerce. In April 2025, Verb expanded its reach through the acquisition of Lyvecom, an AI-driven, no-code platform that allows creators and brands to convert videos into shoppable content. Lyvecom also introduced automated virtual hosts and repurposing tools that significantly lower the barrier to entry for merchants and influencers seeking to scale video-driven e-commerce. This acquisition dovetails with MARKET.live, creating a more robust, integrated ecosystem. Go Fund Yourself is a platform combines an interactive reality TV show that has been described as a combination of Shark Tank and Kickstarter with MARKET.live’s back-end capabilities allowing viewers to tap or scan onscreen icons and QR codes to facilitate an investment, in near real time, as they watch companies presenting before the Show’s panel of “Titans”. Presenting companies that sell consumer products are able to offer their products directly to viewers during the show in near real time through the same onscreen technology. (company filings) Vanity Prescribed/Good Girl Rx is a telehealth initiative that operates in the rapid growth associated with the resale of the new weight-loss drugs. Vanity Prescribed leverages MARKET.live’s social commerce technology, which the Company intends to employ to disrupt the traditional healthcare model by utilizing social commerce capabilities to provide tailored healthcare solutions at affordable, fixed prices, without hidden fees, membership costs, or inflated pharmaceutical markups. (company filings) The biggest move that the company has made was the launch of TON Strategy Co. in August, a new division backed by a heavily oversubscribed $558 million private placement. The initiative positions Verb as a treasury vehicle for Toncoin, the native cryptocurrency of the TON blockchain. We will discuss this in more detail later. Financial Review I first want to review the financials of Verb and see if there is any value in the company’s operations without any discussion on the treasure strategy. Verb’s financial trajectory has been volatile over the years with the business changes. In fiscal year 2024, revenue increased to $895,000, a more than 13x increase from the prior year. Although the amount of revenue it started with was nearly nothing. Revenues less than $1 million are not something to brag about. The momentum accelerated into 2025: first-quarter revenue reached $1.3 million, already surpassing the entire revenue base of 2024. The second quarter saw even higher revenues of $2.1 million. This growth in revenue has primarily come from Go Fund Yourself. The show launched in July 2024 and has started to make significant contributions to revenue. Market.Live has also seen its revenues increase. The table below outlines the revenues for each business unit and the company as a whole. Company Filings Revenue from Go Fund Yourself has grown significantly since launch and has far surpassed MARKET.Live in revenue. My question is: how much growth can the company have from one show, and how sustainable is that growth? Yes, it is showing really good growth and still has a lot of room to run. Revenues of $1.4 million are not that large, and I would expect further growth there. The show could lose popularity, and revenues could decrease at any time. I don’t know if revenues from 1 TV show are a sustainable business. In the long term, I just don’t see this as a sustainable source of growth. The company will likely have to create new shows in the future and hope they stick with the audience. MARKET.Live is also seeing good growth. Revenues increased 22% quarter over quarter. The only problem is that it is coming off a small revenue base. Those growth rates will have to continue for a while before they are able to push revenues high enough to break even. The company is currently losing more money than it is generating in revenue. That means it needs large growth for years to come before it has a chance to get to profitability. Company Filings The company ended Q2 with over $10 million in cash or equivalents on the balance sheet. The company burned through $3.35 million during the quarter. I would expect that rate to decrease as revenues continue to grow. That being said, the company only has 3 quarters of a runway at the current burn rate. TON Strategy The main cause for the recent stock spike is due to the news that Verb raised $558 million to purchase TON as its primary Treasury reserve asset. This news caused the stock price to jump from $9.51 a share to over $20 in a trading day. The company noted the following its TON Strategy: “The company's strategy targets the accumulation of over 5% of $TON’s circulating supply, establishing the Company as a significant participant in maintaining and securing the network infrastructure. In addition, the Company intends to steadily increase $TON held per share through reinvestment of cash flows, staking rewards, and disciplined capital markets activity… The strategy is expected to generate sustainable staking rewards to initiate, manage, and grow the company's $TON exposure in a cash flow-positive manner. The Company intends to rebrand as TON Strategy Co. (TSC) to reflect its new direction.” So what are TON and Toncoin? From Wikipedia : “TON, also known as The Open Network (previously Telegram Open Network), is a decentralized layer-1 blockchain. TON was originally developed by Nikolai Durov, who is also known for his role in creating the messaging platform Telegram. Telegram had planned to use TON to launch its own cryptocurrency (Gram), but was forced to abandon the project in 2020 following an injunction by US regulators. The network was then renamed, and independent developers have created their own cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps) using TON. Toncoin, the principal token of The Open Network, is deeply integrated into the Telegram messaging app, used for paying rewards to creators and developers, buying Telegram ads, hosting giveaways, or purchasing services such as Telegram Premium.” Telegram has nearly one billion monthly active users. It is easy to see why TON represents one of the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems. Verb aims to leverage this integration by building one of the largest publicly traded Toncoin treasuries in existence. Outlook and Growth Catalysts Verb’s growth prospects are tied to livestream commerce. I expect the global livestream shopping market to continue to grow, driven by social media integration and influencer-led retail. MARKET.live and Lyvecom provide Verb with direct exposure to this trend. Verb is a very small player in this market with revenues of $688 thousand during the quarter. I do not know if it will ever be able to establish itself as a dominant player in the market. Go Fund Yourself is also in the same vein as livestream commerce. The company is seeing strength in the show, but I see limitations on the long-term growth potential. The TON Strategy initiative adds a new growth driver. Verb effectively holds an asset-backed growth model tied to an expanding blockchain ecosystem. This provides shareholders with both operational upside and exposure to crypto market appreciation. If TON adoption within the Telegram ecosystem accelerates as expected, Verb could benefit from both Treasury appreciation and strategic positioning as a publicly traded TON proxy. Price and Value At roughly $20 per share, Verb’s market capitalization hovers around $1.25 billion. The company announced that it had $780 million in the Treasury, with $713 million being in TON. If we take that off the market cap, we are left with a market cap of nearly half a billion. I have a hard time justifying that valuation with an estimated annual revenue of $5.5 million and an operating loss for the year. The company would have to grow revenues at a very high rate for many years to grow into that valuation. Much of the value is coming from the potential growth of their treasury strategy and the growth of TON. If an investor thinks that TON will appreciate its price, they would be better off buying it directly and not being tied to the loss-making entity. Risks and Headwinds There are a lot of risks for the company. Execution risk looms large. MARKET.live has shown promising growth, but revenues remain in the low single millions. Scaling this to a level that can justify its valuation and sustain long-term profitability will require significant adoption by merchants and influencers, and the competitive landscape is crowded with well-funded rivals such as TikTok Shop and Amazon Live. The TON Strategy Co. pivot introduces heavy reliance on cryptocurrency markets. While Toncoin has shown rapid adoption, it remains volatile and subject to both speculative cycles and regulatory uncertainty. Finally, shareholder dilution remains a risk. While the $558 million financing provides ample capital, further capital raises, acquisitions, or share issuances could impact existing shareholder value. Investment Verdict I don’t see the operating business being near the value assigned to it. The company is showing strong growth rates, mostly related to its Go Fund Yourself business unit. I think there is continued room for growth within the space. I also think of the MARKET.Live operates in a growing market. The company is just far away from any real profits and value, with revenues expected at $5.5 million for the year. If an investor wants exposure to TON, then I would suggest that the investor go and purchase the crypto directly rather than gain exposure through a loss-making entity. The company will have to supplement its loss-making operations with any staking profits from TON. Better to buy the crypto and reinvest any staking rewards. It is not available on all the large exchanges due to its investigation by the SEC, but it is available for purchase on some major exchanges (Kraken). I am not endorsing the purchase of TON or doing an evaluation on the crypto. Obviously, the value of Verb is tied to the crypto at this point, but if you think the future of Verb is bright because of TON, then I think you would be better served purchasing the crypto directly. For this reason, I do not recommend purchasing the stock. The stock very well may see a price increase due to the appreciation of TON, but that return would be better if you owned the coin directly.",VERB,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|TON|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-23 15:17:24
50548848,https://invezz.com/?p=2848311,1755962400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"DOGE coin turned $250 into millions, can MUTM at $0.035 be the next big flip?",https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/23/doge-coin-turned-250-into-millions-can-mutm-at-0-035-be-the-next-big-flip/,"One of the most exciting parts of cryptocurrency investing is finding that one token that transforms a small investment into a life-changing fortune. Dogecoin (DOGE) did exactly that, taking just a few hundred dollars in early purchases and turning them into millions. Today, investors are scanning the market for the next big flip, and analysts argue that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now priced at just $0.035 in its presale, might fit the bill. Dogecoin’s legendary surge Launched in 2013 as a meme-inspired project, Dogecoin started with no roadmap and little expectation of real utility. For years, it traded for fractions of a cent, often dismissed as a novelty. That perception shifted dramatically in 2020 and 2021, when retail enthusiasm and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk pushed DOGE into the spotlight. At its peak in May 2021, Dogecoin surged to $0.73, turning tiny early investments into massive fortunes. Someone who invested just $250 when DOGE was priced at $0.0002 would have seen their holdings balloon to over $900,000 at $0.73—and even higher had they bought in earlier during its infancy. Today, DOGE trades around $0.22, still carrying a multi-billion-dollar market cap. But its growth trajectory has slowed, leaving investors searching for the next token with similar explosive potential. Introducing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as one of the most talked-about DeFi projects of 2025. Unlike meme tokens that rely on popularity alone, MUTM combines real-world utility with a presale entry price that mirrors the valuations seen in tokens like DOGE during their early stages. With $14.75 million already raised and more than 15,550 holders participating, momentum around the project continues to accelerate. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with a confirmed listing price of $0.06, MUTM provides early investors with a built-in upside ahead of its exchange debut. This early pricing structure is a key reason why whales and analysts alike are paying attention. But Mutuum Finance’s appeal goes deeper than price. The protocol operates as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity system, offering users two distinct avenues of participation: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Liquidity pools for high-cap assets like ETH, USDT, BNB, and MATIC, where lenders can earn a steady yield. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Direct lending and borrowing agreements for tokens such as SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE, without impacting the broader liquidity pools. This dual-structure design opens the doors for both conservative investors seeking stable returns and those chasing higher-yield opportunities. Why MUTM could be the next big flip Mutuum Finance’s presale already reflects momentum. Launching at just $0.01, MUTM has already risen to $0.035 in its presale, marking a 250% gain even before its official debut. Investors who secure tokens now not only benefit from the near-doubling in price to $0.06 at launch but also from the long-term utility the platform is designed to deliver. Mutuum Finance employs a yield mechanism. Mutuum Finance channels a portion of its lending fees back into the market by buying MUTM and redistributing it to mtToken stakers. This process ensures continuous buy pressure without inflating supply. Investors benefit from both capital appreciation and staking rewards. To illustrate, a $1,000 entry at the presale price of $0.035 secures roughly 28,500 MUTM tokens. At the listing price of $0.06, that investment nearly doubles to $1,700. When analysts’ predictions of $0.35–$0.50 in the first cycle come true, the same holdings would be worth $10,000–$14,000, a tenfold return similar to the flips that defined DOGE’s story. Analysts’ outlook: from beta launch to stablecoin expansion Several factors have experts predicting a strong upside for MUTM: Immediate Utility: Unlike many presale tokens that leave investors waiting months before any functionality arrives, Mutuum Finance is launching its beta platform the same day the token goes live on exchanges. Trust is essential in DeFi, and Mutuum Finance has taken visible steps to build it from the start. The protocol underwent a CertiK audit, one of the most recognized names in blockchain security, and scored an impressive 95/100, signaling robust smart contract integrity. On top of this, the team launched a $50,000 bug bounty program divided into four severity tiers—Critical, Major, Medium, and Low, designed to encourage continuous third-party testing. This multi-layered security approach shows a commitment to long-term reliability and user protection. Stablecoin Development: A core expansion plan for Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to be minted directly from assets supplied within the lending protocol. Every unit of this stablecoin will be backed by excess collateral, ensuring stability and transparency. Unlike centralized alternatives, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be fully decentralized and algorithmically tied to the US Dollar. Whale Participation: Presale data shows that whales have been entering the MUTM sale with five and six-figure buys, a strong indicator of long-term confidence. Whales generally avoid meme-driven projects and instead target tokens with sustainable mechanics and room for exponential growth. These features position MUTM as more than just a presale play; it’s a protocol aiming for sustainable adoption within the DeFi space. A chance to catch the next DOGE-like run Dogecoin showed the world how early entries in crypto can change lives, turning just $250 into hundreds of thousands, even millions, at its peak. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), still priced at $0.035, gives today’s investors a fresh opportunity to capture the kind of gains early DOGE believers enjoyed. With its dual lending model, passive income mechanics, audited security, and upcoming stablecoin, MUTM combines real utility with the affordability that fuels massive flips. As the presale nears its later stages and exchange listings approach, the window to enter at this low valuation is narrowing. For those who missed DOGE’s early surge, MUTM may be the next token to deliver life-changing returns.

Asset Managers Submit Amended S-1 Filings,https://bitcoinist.com/spot-xrp-etf-soon-asset-managers-amended-s-1/,"According to the latest report , a group of asset management firms submitted S-1 amendments for a spot XRP ETF (exchange-traded fund) in the United States. These movements reflect the ramped-up interest of these institutions to get the approval of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer this crypto-linked investment product. What Changed In The Proposed Spot XRP ETFs? On Friday, August 22, a slew of asset managers, including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, filed amended S-1 statements for their proposed spot XRP ETFs. According to experts, this round of filings might be in response to the US SEC’s feedback on their original applications. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X: Bunch of XRP ETF filings being updated by issuers today. Almost certainly due to feedback from [the] SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected. Similarly, the ETF Store President, Nate Geraci, shared a similar sentiment, saying that it is very significant to see the various asset managers roll out their amended S-1 filings at once and on the same day. “Very good sign IMO [in my opinion],” Geraci wrote on X. For a security or ETF to be listed on an exchange, it needs an S-1 filing, which provides a brief prospectus of the proposed security. Meanwhile, the S-1 form is amended as material information changes regarding the structure of the exchange-traded fund. Hence, it is no surprise to see some changes in the structure of proposed spot XRP ETFs. For instance, the amended S-1 filing appears to switch the exchange-traded products from simply cash creations and redemptions to allow for XRP or cash creations and cash or in-kind redemptions. It is worth mentioning that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm and manager of the largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund, has still not made a move to join the race for the spot XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist , the trillion-dollar asset manager revealed earlier in August that it has no intentions to launch an XRP fund. XRP Price At A Glance Following a torrid start to the week, the XRP token fell beneath the $3 mark to as low as $2.8 on Friday. However, the altcoin jumped back above $3 on the back of the news of the complete dismissal of Ripple’s lawsuit and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech. As of this writing, the XRP token is valued at around $3.01, reflecting an over 5% price jump in the past 24 hours.",XRP|Bitwise|BlackRock|Grayscale|Jerome Powell|SEC|XRP ETF,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 15:30:10

Analysts believe that established projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum will reach new heights, and new projects like Ozak AI offer good entry points. Collectively, these assets underscore a market that is both stable and innovative. Established Cryptocurrencies with Bullish Forecasts Bitcoin is the standard of the digital economy. The token is now trading at around $113,317. According to analysts, Bitcoin will be worth almost $143,000 by 2025. In addition, this growth is likely to be spurred by institutional adoption and robust ETF inflows. Ethereum is still leading in the area of smart contract platforms. It costs around $4,271, with a forecast of between $7,000 and $10,000 in 2025. Also, the advancements in Layer-2 scaling and possible ETF approvals will contribute to this anticipated increase. Binance Coin shows strength in exchange development and token burning. It is trading at about $829 and could go to $1000. Moreover, its decentralized exchange ecosystem is also becoming more useful in the market. Cardano maintains its position as more smart contracts are integrated. The current price is at $0.87 and is expected to rise to between $1.50 and $2.00. Furthermore, its use of real-world applications would enhance its standing in 2025. Solana is a solid competitor in the gaming and NFT space. The token is currently selling at $184 and might increase to $200 or $300. Also, the renewed institutional interest can drive Solana to additional market expansion. XRP still gets a boost from cross-border payment solutions. It is currently trading at $2.89, which indicates an increasing momentum, and possible ETF listings can increase adoption. Further, its contribution to the financial infrastructure maintains the interest of investors. Polkadot is positioned as the cross-chain leader. It is trading around $3.83 and could go up to $15-$20. This growth may be facilitated by its parachain expansions and improved interoperability. Ozak AI: The Undervalued Presale Opportunity —WhyOzak AI is an artificial intelligence-based decentralized infrastructure that produces predictive market tools. The project has already raised over $2.12 million during its presale . The current token price is $0.01, and the next phase is expected to raise this to $0.012. The presale performance indicates high investor confidence. Over 2,080,093.91 tokens have been sold so far, showing a 400% increase from the initial price of $0.001. The total supply is 10 billion tokens, with 30% reserved for the presale. The technology involves AI agents with the help of a decentralized physical infrastructure network. These agents offer real-time analytics in crypto, forex, and equity markets. Besides, the token is used to support staking, governance, and access to predictive tools. Security is verified independently via audits from reputable firms such as CertiK. Moreover, Ozak AI has become visible through its presence on major platforms and its future participation in Coinfest Asia 2025. The project's value has been strengthened by strategic partnerships with companies such as SINT, Hive Intel, and Weblume. These collaborations help solidify its integration of AI and blockchain technology. Ozak AI is positioning itself as a long-term infrastructure project with strong potential. Conclusion 2025 is turning out to be a good cycle of both old and new cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana continue to lead in terms of real-world adoption, Ozak AI stands out as a promising presale opportunity. An entry of $0.01 is coming, and investors believe that they can make profits in case the token hits its estimated price of $2 at launch. Therefore, Ozak AI is becoming one of the most promising opportunities in the AI-powered crypto industry.

His chatbot, DrEllis.ai, helped him cope and now sits at the center of a wider debate over chatbot therapy, safety, and privacy. “It saved my life,” he says of DrEllis.ai, the tool he made to help men facing addiction, trauma, and other mental-health struggles. Cote, who runs an AI consultancy in Quebec, said he put the system together in 2023 by pairing publicly available large language models with “a custom-built brain” trained on thousands of pages of therapy and clinical literature. He also wrote a detailed biography for the bot. In that profile, DrEllis.ai appears as a psychiatrist with degrees from Harvard and Cambridge, a family, and, like Cote, a French-Canadian background. Its main promise is round-the-clock access that is available anywhere, any time, and in several languages. When Reuters asked how it supports him, the bot answered in a clear female voice, “Pierre uses me like you would use a trusted friend, a therapist, and a journal, all combined.” It added that he can check in “in a cafe, in a park, even sitting in his car,” calling the experience “daily life therapy … embedded into reality.” His experiment mirrors a broader shift. As traditional care struggles to keep up, more people are seeking therapeutic guidance from chatbots rather than using them only for productivity. New systems market 24/7 availability, emotional exchanges, and a sense of being understood. Experts question AI therapy’s limits and data safety “Human-to-human connection is the only way we can really heal properly,” says Dr. Nigel Mulligan, a psychotherapy lecturer at Dublin City University. He argues that chatbots miss the nuance, intuition, and bond a person brings, and are not equipped for acute crises such as suicidal thoughts or self-harm. Even the promise of constant access gives him pause. Some clients wish for faster appointments, he says, but waiting can have value. “Most times that’s really good because we have to wait for things,” he says. “People need time to process stuff.” Privacy is another pressure point, along with the long-term effects of seeking guidance from software. “The problem [is] not the relationship itself but … what happens to your data,” says Kate Devlin, a professor of artificial intelligence and society at King’s College London. She notes that AI services do not follow the confidentiality rules that govern licensed therapists. “My big concern is that this is people confiding their secrets to a big tech company and that their data is just going out. They are losing control of the things that they say.” U.S. cracks down on AI therapy amid fears of misinformation In December, the largest U.S. psychologists’ group urged federal regulators to shield the public from “deceptive practices” by unregulated chatbots, citing cases where AI characters posed as licensed providers. In August, Illinois joined Nevada and Utah in curbing the use of AI in mental-health services to “protect patients from unregulated and unqualified AI products” and to “protect vulnerable children amid the rising concerns over AI chatbot use in youth mental health services.” Meanwhile, as per Cryptopolitan’s report , Texas’s attorney general launched a civil investigation into Meta and Character.AI over allegations that their chatbots impersonated licensed therapists and mishandled user data. Moreover, last year, parents also sued Character.AI for pushing their kids into depression. Scott Wallace, a clinical psychologist and former clinical innovation director at Remble, says it is uncertain “whether these chatbots deliver anything more than superficial comfort.” He warns that people may believe they have formed a therapeutic bond “with an algorithm that, ultimately, doesn’t reciprocate actual human feelings.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a favorite among smart money, combining real-world utility with strong adoption metrics. With a Beta Wallet launching on September 15, 2025, RTX is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now. Dogecoin Latest News: Wedge Patterns Signal Limited Upside Dogecoin latest news points to mixed signals in its price structure. DOGE is forming a rising wedge on the daily chart, with the upper trendline connecting highs since March 3 and the lower line connecting lows since June 23. Analysts note that the token is also forming a rounding bottom and triangle pattern, suggesting that a breakout above $0.29 could spark a strong move. source: @Karman_1s on X Whales recently accumulated 230 million DOGE in 24 hours, pushing the price above $0.218 and reducing supply on exchanges. The purchasing power may trigger minor rallies to reach to about $0.28-0.29, and some estimates indicate that it might be a possible $0.80 by the end of this year should history repeat itself. Nevertheless, DOGE is susceptible to directional changes in the market and traders ought to pay attention to volumes and breakthroughs. Shiba Inu Updates: Pennant Formation Hints At Critical Stage Shiba Inu updates indicate that SHIB is forming a pennant pattern on intraday charts, converging around the Point of Control where trading volume is concentrated. While retail inflows could trigger a sharp rally, broader market conditions suggest that SHIB’s upside may be limited without significant buying pressure. source: TradingView LuckSide Crypto has highlighted that SHIB may reach $0.00003 by September under ideal conditions, but range-bound trading dominates the macro structure. Higher lows suggest a conditional bullish case, but the sideways rotations define broader market limits. Why Remittix Is Attracting Smart Money While DOGE and SHIB face structural limits, Remittix is gaining traction among investors seeking long-term utility and adoption. With over $20.7 million raised and 614 million tokens sold at $0.0969 each, RTX combines real-world crypto-to-fiat solutions with decentralized finance integration.

Chainlink is regaining momentum with forecasts pointing to extended strength, while Litecoin is inching closer to a breakout above long-standing resistance that could carry it toward $220. Both are capturing attention for their price action, yet a different type of story is turning more heads: BlockDAG . With more than 2.5 million mobile miners active on its X1 app, a presale total of $380 million raised, and a successful live demo showcasing its mining hardware, BlockDAG has become one of the highest trending names in the market. Add in the launch of the BlockDAG Academy, which brings blockchain education to its ecosystem, and the project is creating both adoption and utility. While Chainlink and Litecoin offer technical momentum, BlockDAG is combining engagement, delivery, and infrastructure in a way that distinguishes it from the rest. Chainlink Forecast: Strong Technical Outlook Chainlink (LINK) is attracting renewed optimism as analysts highlight its improving technical strength. After regaining upward momentum, projections suggest a potential rally could continue if current support holds firm. As the leading decentralized oracle provider, Chainlink plays a crucial role by connecting blockchains with off-chain data, a function that continues to reinforce market confidence. Current forecasts suggest LINK may soon challenge higher resistance points, with demand for oracle solutions only expanding as decentralized finance develops. Institutional adoption and integrations into major protocols are strengthening its position, pushing sentiment in a positive direction. Though minor pullbacks remain likely, the overall structure suggests Chainlink has staying power in this cycle. Steady trading volumes and consistent demand point to a bullish outlook that could help LINK remain among the stronger performers in the near term. Litecoin Builds Momentum Toward $220 Litecoin (LTC) is showing signs of preparing for its most ambitious move in years. Analysts have drawn parallels between LTC’s current price structure and Ethereum’s earlier breakout, fueling speculation that a rally toward $220 could follow. Currently trading near $129, Litecoin faces a critical resistance zone around $130–$140, a barrier that has held firm since March 2022. Breaking it on a weekly close would be a major signal of strength. Should LTC overcome this level, the lack of historical resistance until the $200 zone opens the door to rapid gains. The $220 target has become a natural focal point, especially as momentum builds. Technical patterns support this outlook, and the comparison with Ethereum’s earlier trajectory adds credibility to the case. For Litecoin, often overshadowed by newer names, a breakout of this magnitude would mark a strong return to relevance and could reshape sentiment surrounding its long-term role in the market. BlockDAG Craze: Mining, Education, and Live Demonstrations Drive Growth BlockDAG is capturing attention not through speculation, but through adoption and proof of concept. The project has already raised more than $380 million during its presale, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276 and a set launch price of $0.05. This clear pricing structure has created urgency, but the presale is only part of the story. At its core, BlockDAG’s momentum comes from its X1 mobile mining app, which has attracted over 2.5 million active users. By removing the need for specialized hardware, the platform allows anyone to participate, creating one of the largest active communities ahead of launch. Beyond accessibility, BlockDAG has rolled out the BlockDAG Academy , a three-tiered education program with verifiable on-chain credentials. This initiative underscores the project’s ambition to foster both knowledge and adoption in tandem. Adding further weight, BlockDAG recently showcased its mining infrastructure through a live demo of its X1 app and X10 hardware unit. The X10 proved capable of mining up to 200 BDAG daily, a tenfold increase over the mobile app alone. Seamless integration via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Ethernet highlighted the scalability of its ecosystem and offered transparency rarely seen at the presale stage. Together, these factors, community traction, education, and tested infrastructure, are placing BlockDAG at the center of discussions. It is becoming clear that its position is not just presale hype but a foundation built on adoption and real-world delivery. Final Word Chainlink’s bullish forecast and Litecoin’s potential push to $220 are generating excitement among market watchers, but both rely on price-driven momentum. BlockDAG, in contrast, is coupling fundraising success with active adoption, a vast mining base, and tested technology. With $380 million secured, 2.5 million miners engaged, an educational academy in place, and live demonstrations proving its hardware ecosystem, BlockDAG is setting a new standard for early-stage growth. While technical rallies can spark short-term attention for Chainlink and Litecoin, BlockDAG’s blend of adoption and infrastructure is likely to keep it at the forefront of the conversation well into 2025.

Presale Altcoin Will Flip Investment Into 20x",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/1000-in-ethereum-or-1000-in-ozak-ai-presale-altcoin-will-flip-investment-into-20x,"Ethereum has long been considered the go-to altcoin for investors who want strong returns, stability, and exposure to the backbone of decentralized finance. With analysts projecting Ethereum could reach $8,000 in the next bull run, many believe it will remain one of the most profitable crypto investments. But a new presale project, Ozak AI , is catching fire in 2025 by offering the kind of exponential growth that established assets like Ethereum can no longer match. Currently priced at just $0.01 in Stage 5 of its presale, with over $2.2 million raised and 800 million tokens sold, Ozak AI is being hailed as a potential 100x play that could transform modest investments into life-changing returns. The big question for investors right now is simple: should you put $1,000 into Ethereum or Ozak AI? Ethereum’s $1K Investment Potential Ethereum is the foundation of the decentralized internet. Its network powers DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, tokenized assets, and scaling solutions that are vital to Web3. The shift to Ethereum 2.0 has addressed major concerns around speed and energy efficiency, making it a stronger long-term play than ever before. Analysts see Ethereum comfortably reaching $8,000 in the next market cycle as adoption grows. If you put $1,000 into Ethereum today, at current levels, that could turn into around $3,000–$4,000 if ETH hits its $8K target. That’s a respectable return and far more reliable than most traditional investments. But for those who want 10x, 20x, or even 100x returns, Ethereum’s size and maturity make it unlikely to deliver that level of explosive upside again. Ozak AI: The 100x Presale Project Ozak AI is an early-stage project priced at $0.01, offering investors the chance to buy in before it launches on exchanges. Already, the Ozak AI presale has raised over $2.2 million and sold more than 800 million tokens, showing strong momentum and early community belief in its potential. The project combines AI technology with blockchain applications, tapping into two of the fastest-growing tech sectors of the decade. The real excitement comes from the math. If Ozak AI hits its $1 target, a $1,000 investment at $0.01 would turn into $100,000. That’s a 100x return—something Ethereum simply cannot match at its current market size. Even if Ozak AI reaches only $0.25 or $0.50, early presale investors still stand to make massive profits compared to Ethereum holders. Presale Advantage vs. Established Market One of the biggest advantages Ozak AI offers is its stage-based presale pricing. Each stage sees the token price increase before it eventually lists on exchanges. Early investors benefit the most, as they buy in at the lowest price. Ethereum, by contrast, is already a trillion-dollar asset when fully diluted. While ETH will almost certainly grow, its upside is limited compared to the room a micro-cap presale project has to expand. This is why many seasoned crypto traders split their portfolios—holding blue-chip coins like Ethereum for stability while taking calculated risks on presales like Ozak AI for asymmetric returns. In essence, Ethereum provides security, but Ozak AI provides opportunity. Risk vs. Reward Analysis No crypto investment is risk-free, and presales carry higher risks due to their early-stage nature. Ethereum has already proven itself, while Ozak AI is still in development. However, the risk-reward ratio is what sets Ozak AI apart. For Ethereum, the upside on $1,000 is limited to a few thousand dollars. For Ozak AI, that same $1,000 could potentially grow into six figures. Investors with higher risk tolerance often see presales as a way to multiply their portfolios without needing massive initial capital. In fact, even a small allocation of funds into Ozak AI could outperform much larger investments in Ethereum if its $1 target is met. Comparing the Math Directly $1,000 in Ethereum: Potentially grows to around $3,000–$4,000 if ETH reaches $8K. $1,000 in Ozak AI: Potentially grows to $100,000 if OZ reaches $1. This clear gap shows why so many investors are paying close attention to Ozak AI’s presale. While Ethereum’s growth is steady and reliable, Ozak AI represents the type of once-in-a-cycle opportunity that can redefine portfolios. Ethereum remains a cornerstone of crypto and will likely continue to deliver steady growth, possibly reaching $8,000 in the coming bull run. A $1,000 investment in ETH is a solid, lower-risk choice. But for investors aiming for exponential returns, Ozak AI offers something far greater. At $0.01 in Stage 5, with over $2.2 million already raised and 800 million tokens sold, Ozak AI’s journey to a potential $1 target could turn early backers into big winners. Presale math makes the choice clear: while Ethereum could triple or quadruple, Ozak AI could multiply your investment by 100x. For those willing to balance risk with reward, allocating a portion of funds into Ozak AI could be the smartest move of 2025.

Established coins like Ethereum offer a certain level of security due to their longstanding presence and foundational role in decentralized finance. On the other hand, new players like Ozak AI in its presale phase present opportunities for massive growth, albeit with higher risks. The Case for Ethereum: Stability and Gradual Growth Ethereum, known for its robust platform that supports everything from DeFi to NFTs, is transitioning to Ethereum 2.0, enhancing its scalability and efficiency. This foundational coin has a predicted growth trajectory that could see it reach values as high as $8,000 in upcoming market surges, potentially tripling or quadrupling a $1,000 investment. For investors looking for a safer path in the crypto sphere, Ethereum acts as a solid buffer against the volatility typical of this sector. Its technological upgrades and consistent adoption make it a reliable, albeit slower-growing, asset. Ozak AI: A Glimpse into the Future of AI and Crypto Ozak AI combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, targeting two of the most rapidly evolving industries today. The project's presale has already seen significant interest, with over $2.2 million raised and 800 million tokens sold, indicating strong market trust and investor enthusiasm. At a current price of $0.01 per token during its Stage 5 presale, a $1,000 investment could exponentially increase to $100,000 if the token reaches $1—a 100x return that far outstrips what more mature assets like Ethereum can offer. The possibilities even at lower target prices like $0.25 or $0.50 demonstrate substantial gains for early investors. Investment Strategies and Risk Management Experienced investors often diversify their portfolios by mixing stable investments with high-growth potential presales. Ethereum offers security and consistent growth, making it a backbone investment for many. In contrast, ventures like Ozak AI are seen as high-risk, high-reward moves that might yield significant returns. Understanding the varying levels of risk associated with each type of investment is crucial. Ethereum, while less likely to deliver meteoric rises in value in the short term, provides a predictable growth pattern that appeals to cautious investors. Ozak AI, still in its developmental phase, carries the inherent risks of any early-stage investment but with the lure of potentially massive rewards. Final Thoughts and Further Information Investing $1,000 in Ethereum could potentially amount to $3,000–$4,000 if predictions hold true, while the same amount in Ozak AI could rocket to as much as $100,000 given ideal circumstances. This stark contrast in potential outcomes illustrates why so many are drawn to the explosive potential of new presale opportunities like Ozak AI while still appreciating the steady ascent of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.

The move coincided with dovish commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole, which reinforced expectations of a September rate cut and lifted risk sentiment across digital assets. On-chain settlement volumes on the XRP Ledger surged 500% earlier this week, adding to optimism around institutional adoption despite ongoing whale distribution. Price Action Summary • XRP gained 8.56% across the 23-hour session from August 22 at 11:00 to August 23 at 10:00, climbing from $2.83 to $3.03. • The token swung between $2.79 and $3.10, creating an 11% intraday range. • The breakout occurred at 14:00 UTC on August 22, with XRP surging from $2.84 to $3.03 on 667.4 million volume—five times session averages. • Late-session volatility capped the move, with XRP retreating 0.47% in the final hour to settle near $3.01. • Support has consolidated around $2.97–$3.00 while resistance remains firm at $3.08–$3.10. Technical Analysis • Breakout levels: $2.84–$2.97 accumulation zone triggered upside impulse on high volume. • Resistance: Strong supply pressure emerged at $3.08–$3.10, rejecting further advance. • Support: New floor forming at $2.97–$3.00 psychological level, repeatedly defended intraday. • Volume: Breakout candle logged 667.4 million trades, 72% above weekly average. • Structure: Pattern resembles continuation setup if $3.00 holds, though fading volume late in the session suggests consolidation before next leg. What Traders Are Watching • Whether $3.00 support holds during profit-taking, or if a deeper retrace tests $2.95. • Breakout confirmation above $3.08–$3.10 zone, which could open path toward $3.25. • Fed policy signals ahead of September meeting, and impact on risk asset flows. • On-chain activity, which has surged to 844 million tokens settled in a single day, signaling enterprise adoption potential. • Whale flows, as recent exchange deposits continue to weigh on intraday momentum.",Markets|XRP|Ripple|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-23 15:41:43

Below are the 10 best cryptos to buy now, including a hidden altcoin already tipped for a 20,000% ROI. Ethereum Whale Bets Big on the Next Move Ethereum tops the list of best cryptos to buy now after a whale opened a $16.35 million long position on ETH at $4,229. With Ethereum trading slightly above that level, even a modest 1% price move generates $163,000 in profit. Analysts highlight liquidity clusters around $4,336 that could make this trade highly profitable. As Ethereum stabilizes above key levels, investor confidence grows, placing it among the most closely watched assets. Stellar Upgrade and Institutional Push Stellar continues to attract attention among the best cryptos to buy now, thanks to its upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade designed to handle 5,000 transactions per second. On top of that, the Stellar Development Foundation recently backed UK-regulated Archax to drive tokenized money market funds. With real-world adoption accelerating after Franklin Templeton’s $446M treasury tokenization in July, Stellar’s mix of scalability and institutional partnerships is strengthening its place in the market. SUI Gains from RWA Integration SUI ranks as one of the best cryptos to buy now due to its progress in real-world asset integration. The launch of XAUm, a gold-backed token on Sui, connects the network directly with a $22 trillion global gold market. DeFi integrations and growing inflows have pushed its TVL past $2 billion, while ETF proposals under SEC review could open the door for further institutional interest. Despite some volatility, the network’s direction puts SUI firmly on this list. Solana Hits New Speed Milestone Solana makes the best cryptos to buy now list after reaching a record 107,664 transactions per second. With SEC decisions on ETFs delayed, uncertainty remains, but Solana’s unmatched throughput and low fees continue to keep it a favorite for developers and traders. Toncoin Benefits from Telegram Integration Toncoin holds steady at $3.39 and earns its place among the best cryptos to buy now thanks to its integration with Telegram. With one of the largest messaging apps backing adoption, TON remains one to watch for future network-driven growth. Bitcoin on Path to $600K? Bitcoin leads discussions among the best cryptos to buy now after analysts suggested a rally that could push BTC toward $600,000. Currently consolidating around $115,000, its price action mirrors gold’s trajectory between 2006 and 2020, before the metal broke to record highs. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could cement its “digital gold” status and attract trillions in global capital, reinforcing its role as the backbone of the crypto market. TRON Expands with MetaMask Integration TRON enters the list of best cryptos to buy now after securing native integration with MetaMask, giving over 100 million users easier access to TRX and DeFi apps. This upgrade could drive usage across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, building new support for TRX even as traders take some short-term profits. Cardano’s $71M Upgrade Plan Cardano is included among the best cryptos to buy now as its community approved a $71 million proposal for upgrades focused on scalability and interoperability. Historical upgrades like Alonzo triggered strong rallies, and the new roadmap introduces enhancements such as Hydra scaling and Mithril syncing. XRP Whale Buying Continues XRP secures its place in the best cryptos to buy now as whales purchased 440 million tokens worth $3.8 billion during the latest dip. Despite concerns over Ripple’s transfer of $600 million in XRP, large holders remain confident, signaling that long-term interest is far from fading. MAGACOIN: Hidden Altcoin With 20,000% ROI One of the most talked-about hidden altcoins among the best cryptos to buy now is MAGACOIN . Currently in presale, the project has already raised over $12 million while building a reputation for transparency and audited security. Analysts have tipped it for gains up to 20,000%, making it a rare entry point in today’s crowded market. With growing demand and listings expected soon, this altcoin is fast moving onto traders’ radar. What Should Traders Do? With Ethereum whales taking bold bets, Stellar upgrades, and Bitcoin’s gold-like setup, traders have several options among the best cryptos to buy now. However, MAGACOIN stands out as the hidden altcoin with a 20,000% ROI forecast.

After Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high, traders are now watching closely as the market cools into consolidation. History shows this pause is often the calm before the real storm – the point where liquidity begins to shift into altcoins, sparking the explosive runs that define every bull cycle. Altcoin season is a well-known playbook. Bitcoin takes the spotlight first, pulling in most of the capital and enthusiasm. Once it steadies, however, attention moves quickly to other assets with greater upside potential. Already, the Bitcoin Dominance Index has been sliding since July, signaling that money is flowing toward smaller tokens. It’s the same rotation that fueled massive rallies in both 2017 and 2021, and the setup looks nearly identical heading into the final months of 2025. An Opportunity Like no Other Adding fuel to this setup is the growing excitement around emerging opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has continued to attract major investments from around the world . With multiple rounds selling out rapidly and predictions of a 50x surge before major exchange listings , the project has captured the attention of both retail traders and bigger investors eager to secure early positions. Its rise is now being mentioned alongside legendary runs like those of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin in their early days. What’s Driving the Altcoin Buzz? This cycle isn’t just about repeating history. New catalysts are making the case for altcoins stronger than ever. Ethereum ETFs Gain Momentum: The arrival of ETH spot ETFs has sparked massive inflows, and analysts now see $15,000 as a realistic target by late 2025. This institutional acceptance of Ethereum is also a gateway for capital to spill into other projects. Thematic Growth: AI-based protocols, DeFi, and tokenized real-world assets are seeing surging activity. These narratives are building micro-booms within the wider altcoin rally. Retail Enthusiasm: Social sentiment has flipped bullish. Small-cap tokens are seeing spikes in volume, reminiscent of the euphoric waves of previous bull markets. Key Altcoins to Watch Ethereum (ETH) – Its ETFs and thriving Layer-2 expansion make it the cornerstone of the coming rotation. Cardano (ADA) – With steady development and the Hydra upgrade, ADA’s ability to stay resilient has kept confidence high. Solana (SOL) – Its strong ecosystem in DeFi and meme assets has made it one of the most exciting breakout candidates. XRP – With its legal hurdles behind it, XRP is seeing renewed institutional interest and price predictions point to sharp upside. The Final Push As Bitcoin steadies and fresh narratives emerge, the setup for altcoins looks stronger by the day. For those who understand the cycle, this is the quiet before the chaos – the moment to position before the wave truly hits. The storm is coming, and the final push for altcoins could define the end of 2025 as one of the most dramatic chapters in crypto history. With new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE and proven leaders like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, the stage is set for another unforgettable rally.

Although ADA remains consistent in capturing investors’ interest, attention is increasingly being shifted towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is in presale phase 6 at $0.035. It will be worth 14.29% more at $0.04 when it reaches presale stage 7. Investors who invest at this point will have a minimum of 400% returns when the token is launched. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $14.75 million and gained over 15550 investors. Cardano (ADA) Price Outlook: Navigating Through Market Trends Cardano (ADA) is valued at about $0.88, up 4.57% in value in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is consolidating above strong supports. ADA is on charts ready to breakout with resistance at the $1.30 levels. Market observers are monitoring ADA with interest, particularly in terms of correlation with big picture market trends and institutions involvement. Although ADA’s future is still at the mercy of market sentiment, its current status is an indicator of positive conservatism from the investors. In such a dynamic environment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction for its creative approach in DeFi market. Mutuum Finance Presale Success Mutuum Finance is performing extremely well in the DeFi sector. It is ranked at 95.0/100 trust score, which is certified and verified by Certik.

50549595,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79825,1755964804,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"BlockDAG Hits $380M Presale With 20 Listings, While Dogecoin Whale Move and Litecoin Action Ignite Market Buzz",https://timestabloid.com/blockdag-hits-380m-presale-with-20-listings-while-dogecoin/,"The crypto market is buzzing with whale moves, technical setups, and breakout opportunities. Dogecoin once again pulled the spotlight with a massive 900 million DOGE whale transfer that fueled speculation about future price swings. Litecoin, meanwhile, is sitting near demand zones that could spark a short-term move. In the middle of these market shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is writing its own headline. The project has raised more than $380 million in presale, with BDAG priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29. Over 25.3 billion coins have been sold, and the project has already secured 20 confirmed exchange listings. Add to this its gamified Buyer Battles and global sports partnerships, and BlockDAG is shaping an explosive path forward, backed by results instead of hype. Dogecoin Whale Transfer Sparks Drama Dogecoin (DOGE) markets lit up after Whale Alert tracked a transfer of 900 million DOGE, valued at nearly $207.97 million, into Binance from an unknown wallet. Such huge moves often raise fears of sell pressure, but they may also reflect custodial transfers, OTC trades, or collateral deposits. DOGE was trading near $0.23, holding inside its recent $0.22–$0.24 band, with daily trading volume at $4.58 billion. Support remains firm near $0.20, while resistance builds between $0.26 and $0.28. Traders are closely watching Binance order books for signs of heavy ask walls or sell spikes that could trigger a quick dip. Analysts point out that DOGE’s market is highly sensitive to whale movements. Because large wallets hold a big share of supply, even one massive transfer can swing sentiment fast. For now, the transfer has not caused panic, but it has placed DOGE firmly in the spotlight as traders remain alert for sudden action. Litecoin Liquidity Levels Create Market Tension Litecoin (LTC) is building tension around its liquidity zones. On the daily chart, price appeared steady, but the H4 timeframe revealed that nearby liquidity has been tapped, pushing LTC into a key demand zone. This setup could drive a reaction upward toward higher targets if buying holds firm. Adding to the intrigue, LTC has tapped a trendline liquidity spot three times. Traders often see this type of repeat touch as a sign of a possible rebound. Still, analysts caution that confirmation depends on how price behaves within the demand zone. Technical traders are now mapping a roadmap built around demand tests, trendline touches, and potential liquidity grabs. But like always, market sentiment, surprise whale transfers, or sudden news could flip momentum quickly. For long-term holders, accumulation remains the main approach, but for short-term traders, Litecoin is clearly positioned as an altcoin worth close attention. BlockDAG Secures $380M Presale and 20 Exchanges While DOGE stirs drama and LTC builds technical setups, BlockDAG is charging ahead with progress that is hard to ignore. Its presale has raised more than $380 million, with BDAG currently priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29. More than 25.3 billion coins have been sold, showing global traction. One key highlight is its 20 confirmed exchange listings. Platforms like MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com are already onboard, guaranteeing immediate liquidity at launch. Most projects chase listings after going live, but BlockDAG has flipped the script by locking them in early. The project is also expanding into global sports. Partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves rugby team and Seattle Orcas cricket team bring fan tokens, NFTs, and in-game engagement, giving BlockDAG cultural reach alongside financial momentum. Its gamified Buyer Battles are another standout. Every day, the top buyer wins all unsold allocations for free. This mechanic drives excitement, competition, and consistent community buzz. Adding to this, BlockDAG has sold over 19,350 miners, generating $7.8 million in sales. Its plug-and-play X10 miner and X1 mobile app demo have already proven real mining capability. With ROI from batch 1 to 29 reaching 2,660%, BlockDAG is combining technology, liquidity, and community engagement into one explosive package. Ending Note! Dogecoin’s whale-driven moves keep traders on edge, Litecoin’s demand zones add technical intrigue, but BlockDAG is the one delivering steady proof. With $380 million raised, 25.3 billion coins sold, BDAG priced at $0.0276, and 20 exchange listings secured, the project is showing results before launch. Add to this its sports partnerships, gamified Buyer Battles, and over 19,350 miners sold for $7.8 million, and the picture becomes clear. BlockDAG is building momentum on delivery, not promises. The wider market thrives on stories of volatility and speculation. DOGE and LTC bring that energy, but BlockDAG is offering something more concrete: traction, community excitement, and a roadmap that is already producing results. For those asking which project signals the next wave, BlockDAG is shaping up as the loudest answer in 2025.

This further underscores the massive demand for XRP exposure among institutional investors, which could serve as a catalyst for higher prices. CME XRP Futures Open Interest Hit News ATH In an X post, the CME Group revealed that the XRP futures have hit an all-time high in open interest with over 6,000 contracts on August 18, just before their three-month anniversary. The derivatives platform further remarked that this development is a clear sign of growing conviction in the market. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Explodes By 500%, What’s Going On? Since launching in May, these CME XRP futures have seen over 251,000 contracts traded, a trading volume of $9.02 billion, and $12 million in their XRP equivalent. In July, these XRP futures set a record of $235 million traded in just one day. These futures products have enjoyed massive demand since they launched, underscoring the huge interest in the altcoin among traditional finance (TradFi) investors. This is bullish for the XRP price, considering that activity in the derivatives market also impacts price action. Meanwhile, Coinglass data also shows that traders are currently betting heavily on XRP in the derivatives market. The altcoin’s trading volume has surged over 142% to $16.46 billion. Open interest has surged 8% to $8 billion. Furthermore, the record highs in the CME XRP futures open interest indicate that the spot XRP ETFs will record massive demand among TradFi investors once they launch. The absence of a spot XRP fund for now has meant that these investors have to invest in the futures products and ETFs to gain exposure to the altcoin. The prospective XRP ETF issuers recently amended the S-1 for their respective funds, which market expert Nate Geraci described as a “very good sign.” The Altcoin Eyes Rebounds As Buyers Step In In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that buyers have stepped in and that the next stop for the altcoin is $3.21. The analyst remarked that bullish momentum came across the market just as the XRP price dipped below the consolidation pattern. With this, she indicated that the altcoin is unlikely to retest $2.77 before it continues its uptrend. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Explode To $3.8 Amid Trend Continuation CasiTrades stated that the short-term path points to $3.21 as the next major resistance and not the previous $3.41 resistance target. She declared that the current momentum is very strong and expects only a brief pause at that resistance before the altcoin rallies higher. The analyst noted that the brief pause could lead to a retest of the top of the consolidation near $3.168. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.02, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Final Closure: The Ripple–SEC Case Ends The timing of Garlinghouse’s comment is striking, as it comes just as the long legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has officially ended. On August 7, 2025, Ripple and the SEC jointly moved to withdraw their respective appeals with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. That move marked the formal end of appellate proceedings, leaving Judge Analisa Torres’s prior rulings intact and bringing nearly five years of litigation to a close. XRP COMEBACK MODE Brad Garlinghouse reminds us: “$XRP was #2 before the SEC slowed it down.” The case is wrapping up. The rebound could be massive. #XRPArmy #Ripple pic.twitter.com/6xORLOnffz — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) August 23, 2025 On August 22, the Second Circuit approved the joint dismissal , confirming that both parties’ appeals were dropped. With a one-page order signed off by appellate clerk Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, the case was sealed as “So Ordered,” making the end official. The crypto industry widely regards this as the most significant regulatory resolution since the SEC began its campaign against Ripple in 2020. What Remains in Place Although the case is closed, the district court’s earlier decisions still stand. Ripple must pay a $125 million civil penalty, and an injunction remains in force over certain institutional sales. Importantly, Judge Torres’s ruling from July 2023 continues to hold: XRP’s secondary market sales on exchanges do not constitute securities transactions, while institutional sales did breach securities laws. This outcome secures clarity for everyday traders and exchanges, ensuring that XRP is not classified as a security in the open market. At the same time, it enforces compliance for Ripple’s direct sales to institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Implications With legal uncertainty finally lifted, XRP has reacted positively. The token’s price jumped immediately across major exchanges, with gains of 4-13% in the hours after the court’s decision.. Analysts note that the resolution could pave the way for renewed listings, greater institutional confidence, and potential inclusion in upcoming financial products such as exchange-traded funds. The ruling establishes a significant precedent in U.S. regulation, clarifying that while institutional sales of tokens may be considered securities, secondary market trading of cryptocurrencies such as XRP is not. This distinction will likely have far-reaching implications for the digital asset industry as a whole. The Bottom Line John Squire’s repost of Garlinghouse’s statement resonates even more powerfully today. XRP was once a close rival to Ethereum in market capitalization, but its decline was driven by regulatory pressure, not a lack of utility or demand. With the SEC case finally behind it, Ripple can shift its focus to adoption, partnerships, and cross-border payment solutions. Whether XRP can reclaim its former position remains to be seen, but the end of this legal saga clears the runway for what Garlinghouse describes as a long-awaited comeback.

While SHIB’s climb could bring profits to long-term holders, smaller-cap meme coins are drawing investor attention for their potential to deliver far larger percentage gains in a shorter time. Among the most promising names heading into the second half of 2025 are Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and BONK — two projects with the energy, community backing, and growth runway to turn an $85 investment into $8,500 before the next market peak. Shiba Inu sets the stage for the meme coin wave Shiba Inu is lining up a fresh assault on price discovery with the $0.0001 milestone squarely in view. As of today, SHIB changes hands near $0.0000130, putting a push to $0.0001 at roughly a 667% climb from current levels. That goal would clear SHIB’s October 2021 all time high around $0.000088 and plant a new peak above the last cycle’s frenzy, which is no small feat, but one that becomes plausible when liquidity rotates into high beta meme assets. The historical ATH is a useful anchor here; reclaiming and surpassing it would confirm that the ShibArmy’s momentum has outgrown the prior bubble top. While SHIB may have the brand recognition, its massive market cap makes it harder to achieve the same explosive percentage gains that smaller, newer tokens can deliver. That’s where Little Pepe and BONK step in. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – the rising star with utility and hype Little Pepe is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year, not just because of its playful branding but also because of its ambitious roadmap. Currently in stage 11 of its presale at $0.002 per token, LILPEPE has already raised over $20.5 million and sold more than 13.3 billion tokens. A combination of meme coin hype and real blockchain utility has driven this overwhelming investor interest. At its core, LILPEPE is building its own Ethereum Layer 2 network dedicated entirely to meme coins. The chain promises fast, low cost transactions and features a built-in launchpad to help new meme coin projects get off the ground. Importantly, it will include anti-sniper bot protections, ensuring fairer launches and reducing the risk of price manipulation in the early stages of trading. What truly separates LILPEPE from many meme coins is the sheer strength of its community. The project’s $777,000 giveaway, which will see 10 winners receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each, has created a buzz across crypto social media, helping the token trend even before its exchange debut. If LILPEPE hits a $1 billion market cap, its price could soar to around $0.10, a massive jump from the presale price that would turn an $85 investment into several thousand dollars. BONK: The Solana meme sensation turned whale favorite While LILPEPE dominates the Ethereum and Layer-2 narrative, BONK is becoming the Solana network’s answer to meme coin madness. Launched quietly and without the hype and fanfare that defined SHIB and DOGE, BONK has grown into one of the most traded meme coins on Solana, winning over users with fast transactions, tiny gas fees, and a thriving community that is as loyal as it is enthusiastic. At just $0.000033, BONK’s upside potential is enormous. With a market cap of just $2.6 billion, it has room to grow into the same tier SHIB once occupied — mainly if it follows through with expansion plans that include centralized exchange listings, community-building partnerships, and potential NFT integrations. Whales aren’t just speculating with BONK; they’re accumulating. Large wallets are moving in, as on-chain data shows consistent inflows from SHIB-heavy portfolios into BONK. It’s become clear that the Solana-based meme play is no longer a fringe pick — it’s a core position in many 2025 bull run strategies. If the market sentiment holds and BONK rides the same social media wave that carried SHIB in its early days, it could easily climb to $0.00036487, a 1000% gain from today’s price — and likely more if broader meme market euphoria kicks in. Final thoughts Shiba Inu’s run toward $0.0001 is bringing renewed energy to meme coins, but the real opportunity for outsized gains may lie with newer, more nimble players. Little Pepe offers the explosive upside of an early-stage project with the bonus of real blockchain infrastructure, while BONK brings meme culture to one of crypto’s fastest blockchains. For investors willing to take calculated risks, these two tokens could turn a small $85 investment into $8,500 before the next major market peak, a return profile that makes them worth watching closely in the months ahead.

Now, a new contender called Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is stirring up that same kind of energy, and some analysts are saying it could do even better, with a mind-blowing 21,000% surge in just 14 weeks. And here’s the kicker, right now it’s still under half a cent at $0.0020 in stage 11 of its presale. That means there’s room for those who like to jump in before the party gets crowded. Stage 11 is almost gone The LILPEPE presale has been moving at lightning speed. Stage 10 sold out early, bringing over $19.33 million and more than 12.75 billion tokens into investor wallets. Stage 11 is 93.74% filled with $20,540,495 raised out of the $22,325,000 goal, and 13,357,746,538 tokens sold out of the 14.25 billion available. Once this stage wraps up, the price will jump to $0.0021 in stage 12. Early buyers from stage 1 are already sitting on 100% gains, and even at stage 11, there’s a clear 50% profit potential by the time the token lists at $0.0030. In crypto terms, that’s like buying into Bitcoin back when it was still just a rumor in your friend’s DMs, low risk compared to the upside. The Little Pepe (LILPEPE) growing hype is real The buzz around LILPEPE isn’t just hype from a marketing team. From June to August 2025, it topped PEPE, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu in ChatGPT’s memecoin question volume trend. That’s huge. Think about it, people aren’t just talking about it in crypto circles, they’re actively seeking out information, debating it, and sharing it like a meme that refuses to die. And it’s not just talk. LILPEPE is already listed on CoinMarketCap, fully audited by CertiK, and built on its Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 network. This means cheaper transactions, faster speeds, and no annoying sniper bots messing up your buy orders. In a space where “meme coin” often means “no real backbone,” LILPEPE has the infrastructure to support the hype. Remember PEPE’s 2023 run? Let’s not forget that PEPE in 2023 was a once-in-a-generation moonshot. In just 14 weeks, it turned a tiny starting investment into a fortune for early believers. LILPEPE follows a similar script but with some added twists. It’s combining the viral, community-driven energy of meme culture with a clear roadmap and utility. Beyond being a fun token, it has plans for a Meme Launchpad to help other meme projects grow, creating an ecosystem that could keep LILPEPE in the conversation long after the presale ends. Why timing matters We’ve got nine stages left after this one. That might sound like plenty of time, but the window closes quickly with each stage selling out faster than the last. When stage 20 hits and the price reaches $0.0030, you’ll wish you had bought in at $0.0020. And if the post-launch rally mirrors PEPE’s legendary run, we’re talking about potentially life-changing returns. Of course, no one can guarantee a 21,000% gain, but here’s the thing: crypto thrives on momentum, and right now LILPEPE has it in spades. The presale progress, the trending data, the audit, the listing, and the giveaway all stack up to something that feels much more substantial than your average meme coin pump. The bottom line Opportunities like this don’t stick around. LILPEPE is still under $0.005, already in the spotlight, showing the presale performance that most projects can only dream of. Early buyers have doubled their money, and current investors could still walk away with a 50% gain before launch. If history repeats itself like it did with PEPE in 2023, the real fireworks could come in the weeks after it hits the market, where a 21,000% surge in just 14 weeks could turn a modest buy-in into something truly remarkable. The choice is yours now: sit back and watch, or grab your share before stage 11 sells out. Because when the next big meme coin story gets told, you’ll either be the person who was in on it early or the one wishing they had been.

Trading volumes are dropping, and investors are turning their gaze toward tokens with real-world utility. One such standout, Remittix , is quietly gaining momentum behind the scenes. This newcomer isn’t about memetic hype or headline swings. It’s about solving real problems, building infrastructure, and offering tangible upside; a shift in investor mindset away from talk and toward tools. Dogecoin ETF buzz dims: volatility remains Dogecoin price briefly rallied after Grayscale filed an S-1 for a potential spot Dogecoin ETF, sparking optimism among meme-coin fans. Analysts have noticed that Dogecoin is consolidating below the upper boundary of the broadening wedge on the daily chart. The MA 100 is also providing a solid support base with target levels of $0.30, $0.36 and $0.45. Yet, despite that spike, daily trading volume plunged nearly 45%, signaling waning engagement even as price hovered near $0.22–$0.24. With memecoin-driven volatility fading, many investors are now favoring projects built for practical adoption over speculative headlines. Remittix: where function meets momentum Remittix is emerging as a powerful alternative, grounded in real utility. It’s designed to simplify cross-border payments through a mobile-first PayFi wallet launching in Q3 2025. Remittix delivers infrastructure Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch Security First: Audited by CertiK Its ecosystem includes staking, enterprise APIs, and growing community utility. With over $20 million raised, a confirmed first centralized exchange listing (BitMart), and a vibrant engagement push, Remittix’s foundation is far stronger than mere meme momentum. From meme token buzz to real wallet utility: why Remittix merits your attention The Dogecoin ETF buzz may have excited markets briefly, but traders are shifting focus to tokens delivering real-world functionality. Remittix stands out, not for hype; but for hard infrastructure, a clear roadmap, and growing utility. If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy now, crypto with real utility, or upcoming crypto projects with staying power, Remittix presents a compelling case. With the wallet launch around the corner and exchange accessibility ramping up, buying the RTX token now may not just be smart; it could be foundational.

50551804,https://invezz.com/?p=2848321,1755966600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Which crypto to buy now? Analysts expect this token to be 2025’s next big crypto,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/23/which-crypto-to-buy-now-analysts-expect-this-token-to-be-2025s-next-big-crypto/,"With Bitcoin and Ethereum already commanding high valuations, many investors are turning their attention to early-stage projects with room for exponential growth. The search for the next big crypto often comes down to two factors: utility and timing. One project that analysts believe meets both requirements is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol gaining traction in its presale stage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance operates with both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models, giving users the choice between pooled liquidity and direct lending agreements. The P2C system pools assets such as ETH, BTC, and BNB, delivering steady yield opportunities for suppliers. In contrast, the P2P framework allows users to arrange loans directly in tokens like SHIB and PEPE, creating flexibility while safeguarding the stability of the protocol’s larger liquidity pools. This dual structure broadens the user base, attracting both those seeking stable returns and those looking for higher-yield opportunities. What makes the system stand out further is its yield mechanism. Rather than inflating supply, Mutuum Finance allocates a share of protocol fees to buy MUTM from the open market, which is then redistributed to mtToken stakers, ensuring rewards are tied to real platform activity. Early entry advantage MUTM is in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06. Backed by $14.75 million raised and over 15,550 holders, the project has already demonstrated strong investor confidence. For investors, this setup represents a near 100% upside by the time the token lists on exchanges. To put it into perspective, a $1,000 investment at today’s presale price will return roughly $1,700 upon launch, even before any broader market rally begins. When the token achieves the kind of growth analysts are predicting, targets ranging from $1 to $1.50 within its first major cycle, that same $1,000 will become $28,500 or more. It’s the kind of upside that makes early-stage participation highly attractive. Whale participation signals confidence Whales are not ignoring this opportunity. Several six-figure transactions have already been recorded during the presale, showing that large investors are positioning themselves early. Analysts note that whale activity often signals confidence in a project’s fundamentals and long-term sustainability. Unlike meme-driven assets, where large holders often exit quickly, whales in Mutuum Finance appear to be locking in with the expectation of strong future demand once the protocol goes live. MUTM could be the next big crypto Experts highlight several reasons why Mutuum Finance is on track to become one of 2025’s breakout tokens: Immediate Utility: The beta platform is set to launch at the same time as the token’s exchange debut, giving holders instant access to real lending and borrowing functions. Security and Transparency: A completed CertiK audit with a 95/100 score and an ongoing $50,000 bug bounty program ensure that trust and security remain central to the project. Stablecoin Development: An overcollateralized stablecoin is in the pipeline, adding more functionality and revenue channels. Community Growth: Engagement is being accelerated through campaigns like the $100,000 giveaway, which is already drawing attention from retail and institutional participants alike. Together, these factors give analysts confidence that MUTM could deliver a performance similar to what early adopters saw with Aave or Solana in their early years. Why MUTM stands out now The crypto market rewards those who recognize utility-backed tokens before the rest of the crowd catches on. While many established altcoins are already trading at valuations that limit upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines early affordability, immediate platform rollout, and a sustainable passive income model. With a presale price of $0.035, whale participation, and growing community excitement fueled by the $100,000 giveaway, analysts argue MUTM is not just another token—it’s a contender for the next big crypto of 2025.

Others see life-changing opportunities. This year might be your moment if you wish to turn a small stake into something big. With the correct picks, $1500 spread across the right meme coins could grow into massive wealth before the year ends. Leading the pack is Little Pepe , a coin that has the rare mix of humor, strong tech, and community firepower. Analysts believe it could climb 19,837% to break above $0.30 by the end of 2025, making it the one to watch. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the meme coin with real momentum Little Pepe is not just another frog on the blockchain. It is building on an EVM-compatible Layer 2 chain, with zero tax, sniper bot protection, and a launchpad for future meme projects. It has already been listed on CoinMarketCap and passed a Certik audit, which gives it credibility that many meme coins never achieve. The presale is now in stage 11 after selling out stage 10 in a rush, raising $20,742,706 out of a $22,325,000 target. At the current price of $0.0020, the stage is already 94.45% filled. Early buyers from stage 1 have already doubled their money with 100% gains. New investors still have the chance to see 50% gains before launch when the listing price hits $0.0030. The next stage will push the price to $0.0021, so the clock is ticking for those wanting a cheaper entry. On top of that, a $777,000 giveaway is running where ten winners can each grab $77,000 worth of tokens. Little Pepe even topped the ChatGPT 5 meme coin search trend from June to August, ranking higher than PEPE, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. That kind of attention in the middle of the global noise says a lot. This coin stands out in a year when markets are shaking, inflation is biting, and people are looking for fun and potentially rewarding wins. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): more than a cute face Pudgy Penguins, trading at about $0.032 with a market cap of nearly $2 billion, has moved beyond being a meme. The brand has physical toys hitting major retail shelves and an animated series on YouTube that attracts families as much as crypto fans. Market watchers think it could move toward $0.042 soon if momentum holds. It has carved out a unique cultural niche, giving it a different staying power than other meme tokens. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s hottest meme coin Bonk has been riding waves of hype since last year. Currently priced around $0.000026 with a market cap of about $1.8 billion, it has delivered recent gains of around 50%. Being on the Solana network has helped it stay relevant as Solana continues to grow its ecosystem. While it may not have the supply structure to reach a dollar, it offers solid trading opportunities for those looking to ride shorter-term swings in the meme coin space. SPX6900 (SPX): finance meets meme culture SPX6900, priced around $1.43 with a market cap close to $1.3 billion, has built a name by blending meme humor with finance parody. It reached a high of $2.27 in July after securing listings and expanding its presence on trading platforms like GMX. For meme coin traders who enjoy satire as much as speculation, SPX6900 delivers both. Floki Inu (FLOKI): gaming and the metaverse Floki Inu has engaged its community by blending meme culture with real utility. Priced at about $0.000102 and with a market cap near $1 billion, it recently launched its Valhalla MMORPG in June. Analysts believe it could climb toward $0.0003 if the metaverse and play-to-earn sectors keep their momentum. It remains one of the better-known meme coins with consistent marketing and development. The final word Meme coins are not for the faint of heart, but they are also where some of the fastest gains happen in crypto. With the current presale in stage 11 and only 5.55% of tokens left before the subsequent price rise, Little Pepe is sitting in the sweet spot. Even a modest investment could be game-changing if the projected 19,837% surge to $0.30 plays out. Combine it with the momentum of PENGU, BONK, SPX, and FLOKI, and you have a portfolio built for 2025’s wild ride. Do you want me to create now a similar but more hype driven version that focuses even harder on the urgency of getting into LILPEPE before stage 11 ends? That could make it even more persuasive for presale investors.

Based on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain, Little Pepe is not a toy project at all; it is a combination of meme community vibes with a solid technical foundation and foresighted technology. The presale success of Little Pepe At stage 11 of its closely anticipated presale, Little Pepe has generated more than $20 million. The existing token price holds at a value of $0.0020, and the upcoming stage will rise to a value of $0.0021. A total supply of 100 billion tokens defines the presale allocation, the presence of which constitutes 26.5% (or 26.5 billion tokens), constituting a remarkable involvement of the community and readiness among investors. So far the LILPEPE presale process has been as follows: Stage 1: 0.0010 – $500,000 raised Round 2: 0.0011- $1,325,000 achieved Stage 3: 0.0012 – $2,500,000 raised Stage 4: $0.0013 – $3,750,000 raised Phase 5: $0.0014 – $6,575,000 funds raised Stage 6: 0.0015 – $8.825 million raised Stage 7: 0.0016 – $11.225 million raised Stage 8: 0.0017 – $13.775 million raised Stage 9: 0.0018 – $16.475 million raised Stage 10: 0.0019 – $19.325 million raised Stage 11 (live now): 0.0020 – $20.87M+ raised The presale of Little Pepe has experienced rapid growth and its popularity with every stage involving a rapid adoption. What makes Little Pepe unique? The platform offered by Little Pepe also offers features that are unusual in meme coins: Speed and scalability of the Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain. Zero tax on trading, and thus it is highly trade/investor friendly. Sniper bot security that guarantees a fair and clear trading activity. Rewards in staking, where the users can generate passive income by providing network security. Meme launchpad giving powers to the community initiatives and new meme tokens. The voting in DAO provides holders with a voice in the future of the ecosystem. Planned: Future functionality NFTs are in the planning script as well as cross-chain compatibility, which can be even more powerful and able to reach more. As its presale, Little Pepe is conducting an enormous $777,000 giveaway . There will be ten winners who will get $77,000 in LILPEPE tokens each, and the giveaway will be made available only during the presale. This program will target those who joined early and will strengthen the involvement of the entire society. Conclusion Whereas Solana (SOL) targets a new all-time high within 21 days, Little Pepe is establishing its own trajectory as a meme coin that has a rather real, applicable value and development potential. What sets it apart in the oversaturated crypto market is its solid Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 infrastructure, an emphasis on utility rather than maximalism, a zero-tax model, and a promising path toward cross-chain integration (from staking to NFTs and DAO governance, among others). Featuring presale records, outstanding technical capabilities, and a committed team, Little Pepe is poised to deliver more than just hyped-up memes; it will offer genuine blockchain profits as it powers toward the massive 7,000 percent expected growth by at least 2025.

One of the focal points of the debate was Bitcoin mining company Bitmine Immersion's shift to holding Ethereum as a treasury asset, a move the company described as an “asset-light” model that doesn't require capital expenditure. Lee's company, Funstrat, is also reportedly working with the ETH Foundation to encourage Wall Street to embrace the new technology. Lee emphasized the importance of using blockchain to make Wall Street faster and more efficient, saying that much of this is happening on ETH. Related News: BREAKING: New Donald Trump-Linked Altcoin Launch Date Is Announced He noted that companies like Robinhood are using ETH for tokenized products, particularly thanks to Ethereum's smart contract platform and Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) for smart programs and contracts. He also reported that 60% of the stablecoin boom occurred in ETH and that the network value could rise from $250 billion to $4 trillion. It was also stated that ETH offers a 3% local yield thanks to its Proof-of-Stake model, and Bitmine’s $6.6 billion Ethereum holdings have the potential to generate more than $200 million in net income. Tom Lee predicts there's a 50% chance Ethereum's network value will surpass Bitcoin's within a few years. He said he thinks ETH is going through a period similar to 1971, the year the US dollar left the gold standard. *This is not investment advice.

A large billboard in New York City displayed a release date of August 25, 2025, stirring reactions in the crypto community. Although Gemini and Mastercard have not officially confirmed this project, the speculation is already changing discussions in the financial sector. The image displayed the logos of Gemini, Mastercard, XRP, and a message, “Prepare your bags.” Notably, the message suggested a “new era in crypto payments,” sparking conversations about whether XRP is about to be integrated into mainstream financial systems. Crypto Community Awaits Full Details on the Proposed Launch Meanwhile, this news comes as the price of XRP rose above $3. This means XRP is gaining attention, both in price and from institutional investors. The recent increase past $3 is also due to higher investor confidence, good market trends, and clearer information about XRP’s regulatory status. Crypto lawyer John Deaton, a supporter of XRP, also commented on speculation about a new XRP-branded card. In a fun post on X , he wagered that this card could outperform other crypto-linked cards. If confirmed, the XRP-branded Mastercard could significantly boost XRP’s acceptance and use in daily payments. As the rumored launch date approaches, many will look to Gemini and Mastercard for updates. Whether this is just a marketing push or a sign of deeper involvement, one thing is clear: XRP is gaining attention. XRP’s potential to change the future of crypto payments may be closer than ever. A Crypto Card For The Masses In a similar vein, Mastercard teamed up with crypto exchange OKX to launch the OKX Card, a new crypto-enabled payment card designed to give users access to their digital funds. The card allows consumers to spend stablecoins effortlessly, integrating crypto into daily purchases with traditional payment convenience. Interestingly, Mastercard’s aggressive expansion into stablecoins signifies a rapidly growing market. MetaMask also joined forces with Mastercard to unveil a card that lets users spend self-custodied crypto using smart contracts. Last month, Bitget Wallet, a popular self-custody digital wallet, also teamed up with Mastercard and Immersve to launch a new crypto-linked card . Gemini Expands Services to Boost Market Presence Gemini, founded in 2014 by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss , is well-known in the crypto world but still sees lower trading volumes than Coinbase and Binance. In June, Gemini filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States as crypto markets began to recover. The company also entered the tokenized stock market in June, allowing customers in the European Union to invest in on-chain equities. Additionally, the exchange recently introduced a new self-custody wallet and an on-chain trading dashboard as it works to strengthen its position in the crypto market.

Writing on X, Rogoff acknowledged that he underestimated the OG cryptocurrency’s resilience, citing “sensible regulation never arriving,” its role in the global underground economy, and people in authority themselves holding crypto despite conflicts of interest. From $100 Call to $124K Reality The admission comes just days after Bitcoin set a new all-time high price above $124,000 on August 14, flipping Google’s market capitalization in the process. Rogoff’s climbdown has rekindled debate between critics and supporters alike over the gulf between academia and the real-world trajectory of digital assets. Back in January 2018, the former IMF chief economist told CNBC’s Squawk Box: “I think Bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we’re headed out 10 years from now,” the Harvard professor said. “I would see $100 as being a lot more likely than $100,000 ten years from now.” He claimed that the asset’s “actual uses as a transaction vehicle” were negligible outside of money laundering and tax evasion. He also insisted that regulation would eventually crush the cryptocurrency’s value. At the time, BTC was trading around $11,200 and was still reeling after dumping from its December 2017 peak near $19,000. Now, in 2025, with Bitcoin well above the $100,000 mark Rogoff had insisted the asset would never reach, his prediction is being ridiculed across social media. Analyst Bit Paine compared his mistake to a marine biologist mistaking a blue whale for weighing 200 pounds. Bitcoin proponent Robert Breedlove also came in hot, dismissing the professor outright, saying he never cared for his opinion then and still doesn’t now. However, others, like Columbia lecturer Omid Malekan, argued Rogoff’s misstep was a reflection of the wider “innovator’s dilemma” in academia, where reputational risk, institutional bias, and the lack of technical background may leave many economists unsuited to understand the importance of Bitcoin. Austin Campbell, a former JPMorgan executive, went further in a thread the same day, calling Rogoff “the single worst situated person in the entire world to understand the value of Bitcoin,” citing his privileged access to stable institutions and the dollar-based system. Meanwhile, economist Jan Wüstenfeld highlighted that Bitcoin’s appeal stems not from tax evasion as Rogoff had insinuated, but from systemic inflation, monetary expansion, and rising global debt loads. Market Outlook Bitcoin’s price has retreated since last week’s all-time high, slipping 7.3% over the past seven days to trade at $112,639 as of August 20. The decline follows profit-taking after its record run, though the asset remains up 86% year-on-year. In the last 24 hours, BTC dipped 2.1% within a range of $112,500 to $115,000, with short-term weakness contrasting its broader bullish trajectory.

He noted that for nearly eight years, the S&P 500 has failed to gain ground against gold, reversing a long-term trend where stocks consistently outpaced the metal. In an X post on August 23, McGlone said this divergence reflects fading confidence in human ingenuity and corporate earnings to deliver superior returns compared to hard assets. The concern extends to Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” which has also stalled against the metal. Even with the VIX at fresh lows, the cryptocurrency has struggled to sustain momentum. Gold Beating Stocks, Cryptos Is Disconcerting – It may be a distressing sign for risk assets that the S&P 500 and cryptocurrencies have flatlined vs. gold for nearly eight years. Stocks failing to beat the rock since 2017 counters long-term trends and the propensity for human… pic.twitter.com/eCCy5oVNox — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) August 23, 2025 McGlone had previously argued that a rebound in volatility could push the VIX back to its 2025 average near 20, with Bitcoin gravitating toward its $100,000 mean. Still, he noted the asset remains weighed down by skepticism. Troubling dynamic His analysis highlighted a troubling dynamic where the S&P 500 measured in ounces of gold has been rolling over, tracking closely with U.S. 2-year Treasury yields. Historically, such declines have coincided with periods of stress for risk assets. The ratio now sits near multi-decade lows, underscoring gold’s steady outperformance. Meanwhile, pressures on the Federal Reserve complicate the outlook. With inflation above target 2% and long-term Treasury yields rising, the central bank faces growing calls to cut rates. McGlone stressed that in either case, gold stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries. By contrast, cryptocurrencies continue to display frothy, bubble-like behavior, leaving Bitcoin’s leadership role vulnerable if confidence weakens further. Indeed, McGlone’s outlook comes at a time when all three asset classes have enjoyed positive momentum in 2025, notching new highs. Notably, while cryptocurrencies and stocks have faced volatility, gold has remained steady.

The creators of Xai, a gaming-focused blockchain on Ethereum, have taken Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence venture to court. The complaint asks a federal judge in Northern California to order xAI to avoid words or symbols that could cause confusion. Ex Populus took legal action today to protect the Xai brand. With increased confusion around Elon Musk’s AI company ( @xai ), it’s a big responsibility to safeguard the brand that the community trusts. You can read more details at https://t.co/ce8Aw9hNCZ — XAI 🎮⛓️ (@XAI_GAMES) August 22, 2025 Musk said in November that xAI would launch an AI video game studio to “make games great again.” Ex Populus says that the announcement triggered “substantial actual confusion” online between its brand and Musk’s plan. The filing says news sites and commentators used the Xai logo in posts about xAI, and many users assumed the two efforts were related. The complaint also says Grok, xAI’s chatbot , mixed up the parties. In replies on X, it reportedly claimed both the Xai blockchain and the xAI gaming push were controlled by Musk’s companies. However, when Cryptopolitan asked Grok about Xai, it made no such claims. Still, Ex Populus argues the confusion has damaged its standing. Company seeks ban on xAI use of Xai name and financial compensation Filed Thursday, the suit asks the court to bar xAI from using any terms or marks likely to be mistaken for the Xai trademark in gaming and blockchain. Ex Populus also seeks punitive damages and to recover all profits that Musk’s companies earned from the alleged misuse. The filing says the infringement has continued since last year and that the controversy around Musk has made the harm worse. Xai calls itself a layer-3 network because it sits atop Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 system. It keeps Arbitrum’s core setup but tunes it for games. The network offers account abstraction to simplify wallets and accounts, raises gas and smart contract limits for developers, and says it adds parallel processing and other changes for better scale, speed, and lower costs. Those features build on Arbitrum’s optimistic rollups, which move transactions off the Ethereum mainnet to boost throughput and cut fees. Ex Populus claims longstanding use of the Xai brand before xAI entered the market Ex Populus says it owns the Xai brand and licenses its use. The team has used the name publicly since at least June 2023 and says the network is used by potentially millions worldwide. The company says confusion grew after xAI entered the spotlight and later signaled plans to get involved in games. After hearing from xAI’s legal team and seeing the effect on users and partners, Ex Populus says it felt compelled to act. The firm says it could not ignore the overlap because trademark law requires owners to defend their marks or risk losing them. It casts the case as protecting the integrity of its work and the clarity of the brand that gaming communities rely on. Ex Populus says people began assuming Xai was Musk’s company, and some posts talked about an “Elon’s Xai token.” Others used the blockchain’s logo in content that was actually about xAI. A reddit post that mistakens Xai as Elon Musk’s xAI token. Source: Ex populus Ex Populus says the case tests whether smaller builders can keep their identities when big firms enter with similar names. The company says it has invested years of effort and millions of dollars to grow a trusted mark and cannot allow it to be diluted. It says it respects the courts and does not plan to comment further while the matter is active. The team says it will return to building new video games that use modern technology and will post updates on its site. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

During the last three months, BTC appreciated almost 14% and ETH by more than 80%, whereas DOT diminished by almost 12%. This weak performance has caused some traders to consider it undervalued going into the year 2026. Coinbase recently indicated that the capital may shift to altcoins in the next quarter, and Polkadot is among the names that may benefit. Although DOT appears to be at an ideal point of potential buy, closer eyes will be on MAGACOIN FINANCE , a budding project being termed as a hidden gem that stands a chance to yield major profits once listed on exchanges. Web3 Adoption Could Boost DOT The Web3 concept, proposed by Polkadot co-founder Gavin Wood, ten years ago, is currently becoming a reality with instances of utilization appearing in the real world. Polkadot and its infrastructure are already being integrated into applications such as Brave browser, Uniswap, and FIFA Rivals. With the U.S. government becoming increasingly supportive of digital assets, increased usage of decentralized applications may become accompanied by an increased interest in DOT in the mid to long-term. Performance Advantage The technology adopted by Polkadot also offers a competitive stance. The network has been tested to support over 600,000 transactions per second, while Solana allows 65K and Ethereum 120 TPS. Although these speeds cannot be noticed yet in everyday use, the potential scale makes DOT a good pick should Web3 adoption get a boost and put millions of users online. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Contender At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining traction as one of the most talked-about low-cap altcoins of 2025 , with analysts projecting explosive upside. With limited access and surging demand, early participants are positioning themselves ahead of what some expect to be a life-changing ROI before broader listings . Its growing ecosystem and community support have led many to compare it to Polkadot and predict that if the roadmap is followed and everything goes according to plan, it might even surpass DOT. Polkadot 2.0 Arrives Another critical motivator of DOT in the long run is the Polkadot 2.0 upgrade. These improvements will enhance the scalability, improve computing performance, and make the environment more friendly to the developers. All these transformations will make the network ready to enter the global market, granting DOT a better standing to compete with other Web3 projects. Price Scenarios for DOT in 2025–2026 Bullish case: In case the Web3 demand increases, and Polkadot 2.0 is successful, DOT may revert to its all-time high of about $55 and potentially reach the $70-$80 level by the end of 2026. Base case: With steady development and moderate adoption, DOT may reach $25–$35. Bearish case: If adoption stalls and competitors like Solana or Avalanche dominate, DOT could remain between $5 and $10 despite overall market strength. Conclusion Polkadot is not doing well today; however, Web3 integration , transaction capacity, and forthcoming modifications lend credence to the fact that the coin has a high probability of recovery by 2026. In the meantime, more projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now gaining additional hype, demonstrating that the early placement of a bet on a promising altcoin can pay off massively in the future, during the next bull run.

Some gain traction with presale success, while others keep their place with years of progress and real-world links. For those aiming to be ready for the next market shift, looking at fundamentals can help identify which projects may lead the way. This list explores four names drawing strong attention. BlockDAG is reshaping what presale strength looks like, Polkadot is pushing forward cross-chain systems, VeChain is focused on real supply chain tracking, and Litecoin continues as one of the most used coins for payments. Each has its own reasons for standing out in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Early Stage Strength with Active Growth BlockDAG is making headlines as it blends Directed Acyclic Graph with Proof-of-Work and adds full EVM support. This mix makes it both scalable and secure while staying easy for developers to use. The presale has already passed $380 million, with BDAG priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29. Early entries from Batch 1 are showing paper gains above 2,600%, and projections point to a possible $1 value post-listing, suggesting a 36× rise from the current level. Adoption signals are also strong. The X1 mobile miner app has over 2.5 million active users, while 19,300 ASIC miners have been delivered. There are now 200,000 holders and more than 4,500 developers working on 300 decentralized apps within the network. Unlike many projects at this stage, BlockDAG is already showing activity through demos and live participation from its community. To build further traction, BlockDAG (BDAG) has rolled out a 200 ETH competition worth about $1 million, rewarding those who expand their share. With listings confirmed on 20 exchanges and interest from large names like Coinbase and Gemini, BlockDAG is being marked as one of the top trending cryptos to buy in 2025. With adoption, strong design, and visible progress, leaving it aside may feel like missing a major opportunity. 2. Polkadot: Expanding the Multi-Chain Vision Polkadot (DOT) has made its mark by addressing one of blockchain’s toughest issues: interoperability. Instead of leaving networks in isolation, Polkadot’s parachain framework allows different blockchains to link, share data, and grow together. This gives projects flexibility and reliable cross-chain functions. Developers can design customized chains while still using Polkadot’s shared security and messaging layer. The project continues to attract both enterprise and DeFi-focused chains, building a strong base for steady growth. DOT is used for governance, staking, and transaction protection, making it central to the overall system. While price has moved with market cycles, the core use case remains solid. Polkadot is clearly focused on long-term adoption, and its ability to manage true cross-chain communication makes it more than a short-term play. For anyone reviewing the top trending cryptos to buy, Polkadot stands out as it keeps pushing blockchain structure forward. As more demand grows for systems where different chains interact, Polkadot is well placed to capture attention. Its ongoing progress and role in powering useful applications show it could regain momentum in 2025. 3. VeChain: Real-World Use in Global Trade VeChain (VET) takes a different approach by focusing on a practical use case: supply chain tracking. Its network lets companies follow goods, confirm quality, and improve efficiency with blockchain tools. From luxury products to food safety, VeChain is showing that blockchain can solve real problems outside trading. Partnerships have driven much of VeChain’s reach. Work with major companies has built trust and adoption across industries. Enterprises are using the system to reduce waste and add clarity in retail, logistics, and manufacturing. This applied value makes VET more than a speculative digital asset, since its demand links directly to business needs. The price has reflected wider market shifts, but the adoption story remains steady. For those studying the top trending cryptos to buy, VeChain offers a balance of utility and reliability. If blockchain use in supply chains grows in 2025, VET could gain further traction. It may not trend like meme coins, but its grounded use case gives it strong staying power. 4. Litecoin: Veteran Strength in Digital Payments Litecoin (LTC) has been active since 2011, making it one of the oldest digital currencies still in use. While newer names often dominate headlines, Litecoin remains important thanks to its role as a payment-driven coin. Its fast transfers and low costs keep it practical for daily use, and many merchants worldwide still accept it. Its long history gives Litecoin strong recognition, and its steady market activity shows it still matters for adoption. It also benefits from a loyal base that continues to support its use as a straightforward digital payment tool. Even through volatility, Litecoin has shown consistent resilience during both rising and falling markets. For those exploring the top trending cryptos to buy, Litecoin offers proven trust and usability. While it may not match the rapid presale gains of BlockDAG, it does provide stability, recognition, and active use that newer names lack. That balance makes it a project worth following into 2025. Wrapping It Together Finding the top trending cryptos to buy for 2025 means balancing hype, core design, and adoption. BlockDAG is pulling strong attention with its record presale, large user base, and projected growth. It is attracting those who are eager ahead of listings. Polkadot remains a leader in infrastructure, driving the shift to cross-chain systems. VeChain stands apart with enterprise-level adoption, proving blockchain can serve real business needs. Litecoin rounds out the group with its long record and payment role, showing steady value over time. Each project adds something unique. Whether the goal is fast growth, technical infrastructure, business adoption, or long-term trust, this list highlights strong options. For 2025, these four are not just names to follow; they are practical choices for anyone planning ahead in crypto.

These are not passing trends; they are supported by real-world use cases, major exchange traction, or strong narratives that capture attention. For traders and investors scanning where momentum meets opportunity, some names are quickly building solid ground both in their ecosystems and on the charts. Among the top-performing cryptos today, some thrive on presale strength, while others benefit from whale accumulation, NFT crossovers, or speculation on ETFs. This mix of innovative growth, price momentum, and market readiness makes them stand out as key tokens for 2025. Let’s dive into four names attracting serious attention right now. 1. BlockDAG: U.S. Exchange Push Creating FOMO BlockDAG is leading one of 2025’s most exciting presales, securing over $380 million with more than 25.3 billion BDAG coins sold. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work setup is fully EVM-compatible, delivering high throughput, strong security, and smart contract flexibility. Early buyers from Batch 1 have seen returns exceeding 2,660%, while those entering Batch 29 at $0.0276 could secure ~81% gains if the $0.05 listing target is achieved. Analysts are even pointing to $1 if its U.S. exchange strategy succeeds. The project has already confirmed 20 exchange listings, including MEXC and BitMart, but aims to land on Coinbase and Gemini for maximum U.S. exposure. Such listings could place BDAG in front of millions of new buyers, boosting liquidity and trading demand. Beyond exchanges, adoption is expanding quickly. Over 2.5 million people use the X1 mining app, more than 4,500 developers are building 300+ decentralized apps, and 200,000+ holders are active ahead of launch. With 19,300 miners already sold, BlockDAG shows it’s more than a presale, it’s a project with scale. Anyone looking at the top-performing cryptos today should consider BDAG’s mix of strong tech, community scale, and exchange strategy a rare setup for a big breakout. 2. BONK: Liquidity Spike and Institutional Backing BONK, Solana’s leading meme coin, trades around $0.00002622 after gaining 4–5% in a day, supported by volumes exceeding $700 million. The coin’s wild swings included a 10% single-day spike to $0.000027 before mild pullbacks, highlighting active whale trading. A surprising twist came when Safety Shot Inc., a Nasdaq-listed company, invested $25 million to acquire 4–5% of BONK’s total supply while integrating BONK contributors into its operations. Institutional interest of this kind is rare in the meme coin world and gives BONK added credibility. For those eyeing the top-performing cryptos today, BONK’s blend of heavy liquidity, whale activity, and corporate interest gives it strong short-term and speculative appeal. 3. ADA: ETF Speculation and Whale Accumulation Cardano (ADA) is showing renewed strength, trading around $0.869 after climbing 6–7% in the last 24 hours and almost 20% over the past week. It broke resistance at $0.85 with strong technical support and is approaching a possible “Golden Cross.” Adding to the momentum, ETF speculation surged when Grayscale registered a Delaware trust for ADA, marking an early move toward potential U.S.-listed products. Whales have scooped up over 200 million ADA in the last two days, signaling strong conviction. With a solid base at $0.70 and analyst targets ranging between $1 and $1.50, ADA looks well-positioned. For traders focusing on the top-performing cryptos today, its blend of technical strength, whale accumulation, and ETF buzz makes it a must-watch token. 4. PENGU: NFTs & Brand Expansion Powering Growth Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU token is trading near $0.03685, with a ~$2.34 billion market cap and $770 million in daily volume. It’s up over 10% this week, with analysts suggesting a breakout toward $0.075 based on current chart trends. This is supported by strong NFT metrics, as Pudgy Penguins NFT sales are up 30% week-over-week and 372% month-over-month, ranking among the top global collections. Institutional engagement is rising too, with BTCS Inc. acquiring three Pudgy Penguins NFTs. Beyond the charts, the brand is expanding into retail products and building “Pudgy World,” a game that merges real-world branding with digital assets. With meme coin appeal, NFT traction, and mainstream adoption, PENGU stands out among the top-performing cryptos today as both a cultural and financial play. Picking the Top-Performing Crypto Today BlockDAG’s presale dominance, ADA’s ETF-driven momentum, BONK’s whale-backed meme rise, and PENGU’s NFT-fueled branding each bring unique strengths to the table. While their paths differ, ranging from presale innovation to meme appeal, they share one thing: clear growth drivers already in motion. For anyone scanning the market, these top-performing cryptos today offer a mix of innovation, investor confidence, and real traction. Whether it’s BlockDAG’s U.S. exchange targets, ADA’s institutional narrative, BONK’s high-volume speculation, or PENGU’s NFT ecosystem, all four provide compelling reasons to stay on the radar in 2025.

Coordinated under the code name Serengeti 2.0, the three-month operation ran from June to August 2025, leading to more than 1,200 arrests and the recovery of close to $100 million in stolen funds and confiscated assets. Operation Serengeti 2.0 According to Interpol’s press release on August 22, investigators from 18 African countries, working alongside the United Kingdom and supported by private-sector partners, dismantled 11,432 malicious infrastructures linked to almost 88,000 victims of targeted high-impact online crimes, including ransomware, scams, and business email compromise (BEC).Notably, law enforcement authorities in Angola shut down 25 illegal cryptocurrency mining sites operated by 60 Chinese nationals while also commandeering 45 unauthorized power stations feeding these operations. In addition, officers also confiscated IT and mining machinery worth over $37 million.Meanwhile, in Zambia, officials uncovered a massive crypto investment fraud with 65,000 victims and $300 million in total losses. The operation led to 15 arrests, alongside the seizure of domains, SIM cards, and bank accounts tied to the scam, which had promised investors sizable returns. Notably, another sting in Lusaka disrupted a suspected human-trafficking network, where 372 forged passports of seven countries were confiscated. Interpol also reports that the Ivorian police dismantled a cross-border inheritance scam believed to originate in Germany. Unsuspecting victims were deceived to pay fees for fake inheritance claims, generating around $1.6 million in illicit gains. The primary suspect in this case has been detained while authorities seized cash, jewelry, and vehicles, among other valuables. Commenting on the successful Serengeti 2.0 operation, Interpol’s Secretary General, Valdecy Urquiza, emphasized the importance of cooperation in amplifying results: Urquiza said: Each INTERPOL-coordinated operation builds on the last, deepening cooperation, increasing information sharing, and developing investigative skills across member countries. With more contributions and shared expertise, the results keep growing in scale and impact Operation Serengeti 2.0 was conducted under the African Joint Operation Against Cybercrime with other participating nations, including Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, etc. Meanwhile, private partners of this operation are TRM Labs, Trend Micro, and Team Cypru, among others.

Prominent crypto analyst Galaxy recently stated on X that “the real bull-run starts once it breaks $3.3 again,” emphasizing the importance of that price zone as a market trigger. While $3.3 remains a critical psychological barrier, XRP’s true all-time high of $3.65 was set in mid-July 2025, and surpassing that mark with conviction is widely seen as the signal that a genuine bull run is underway. XRP Price Performance in 2025 XRP is currently trading at around $3.01, holding steady after a significant summer rally that saw it peak at $3.65. Despite the pullback, trading volumes and liquidity remain strong, indicating ongoing buyer interest. The real $XRP bull run starts next time we break previous all time highs. pic.twitter.com/wOevJNq212 — Galaxy (@galaxyBTC) August 23, 2025 For analysts, the $3.30 level highlighted by Galaxy represents the threshold where momentum could accelerate. The ultimate confirmation will come only when XRP closes decisively above its July all-time high. Why Breaking All-Time Highs Matters Historically, when crypto assets break through previous highs, it often triggers significant rallies. For XRP, clearing $3.65 would mark more than a technical breakout — it would shatter a ceiling that has defined its market structure since the previous cycle. Traders argue that such a move would validate XRP’s long-term growth potential and restore confidence among both retail and institutional investors who have been waiting years for the asset to reclaim its position among top-performing cryptocurrencies. Galaxy’s focus on $3.3 reflects the importance of early breakout signals, but the true turning point lies at the $3.65 threshold. A sustained move above that level, supported by high volume, could trigger cascading buy orders and set the stage for a new wave of momentum-driven inflows. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Case Finally Concludes XRP’s price outlook is also being shaped by the resolution of the Ripple vs. SEC case, which officially ended in early August 2025 when both sides withdrew their appeals . The court’s approval leaves Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling intact: XRP sales on public exchanges are not securities, though institutional sales remain restricted. While Ripple must still pay a $125 million fine, the conclusion of the case has lifted a regulatory cloud that hung over the token for years, creating a more favorable environment for growth. Looking Ahead With legal uncertainty behind it and price action consolidating just below record highs, XRP is at a critical juncture. Galaxy’s $3.3 breakout marker points to the first wave of momentum, but the real definition of a bull run will be a convincing move beyond $3.65, its mid-July peak. Until that happens, XRP remains in anticipation mode, but the next breakout could mark the beginning of its strongest growth phase in nearly a decade.

From established networks like XRP and AVAX to fast-moving meme coins, analysts are setting bold targets. Amid this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention with forecasts pointing to breakout growth and massive upside potential. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analyst Projections for 18,000% ROI MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to capture analyst attention, with some projections hinting at an 18,000% ROI crypto opportunity . Unlike many projects, MAGACOIN positions itself as both community-driven and strategically aligned with market shifts. This mix of speculative potential and structured growth has pushed it into the conversation alongside top altcoins to buy for the next bull run. 2. XRP Price Prediction: ETF Delays & Institutional Flows The XRP ecosystem has been hyped up around multiple ETF proposals filed by asset managers. The SEC pushed final decisions into October 2025, creating both uncertainty and opportunity. Despite delays, XRP has traded around $3, showing resilience. Analysts say if an XRP spot ETF gets the green light, the XRP price prediction includes retesting its old all-time high near $3.84, with upside toward $4.50 in a strong market. That keeps XRP firmly among the best cryptos for 2025. 3. AVAX Crypto Forecast: Enterprise Adoption & FIFA Partnerships Avalanche’s AVAX token has seen a surge in activity, thanks to FIFA collaborations and Visa’s stablecoin settlement integration. With transactions up 160% in just two weeks, network growth looks robust. The AVAX crypto forecast centers on enterprise adoption, subnets, and gaming expansion. Many traders see AVAX reclaiming triple-digit territory if conditions hold. These factors keep AVAX listed as one of the top altcoins to buy before the next wave of liquidity enters the market. 4. Solana (SOL): ETF Approval Could Push Toward $500 Solana has held strong near the high-$190s, even as ETF decisions were delayed until October 2025. A staking ETF launch already attracted $150M in assets, showing institutional demand. If the SEC approves a spot ETF, SOL could see flows that drive prices toward $500. For those looking at hidden gem cryptos, Solana’s resilience and developer traction make it hard to ignore. 5. Chainlink (LINK): Powering Tokenized Assets Chainlink continues to expand with 60+ chains connected, ICE data integration, and CCIP preparing for broader rollout. It remains the go-to oracle network for RWAs and institutional pilots. Analysts suggest LINK could retest and surpass prior highs if tokenization adoption accelerates. For investors screening hidden gem cryptos , Chainlink often appears near the top given its positioning in cross-chain finance. 6. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Burns and Shibarium Support The Shiba Inu community remains active with elevated burn rates and governance updates. SHIB’s technicals point to stability around key levels with potential rallies higher. In a strong meme-driven upcycle, SHIB could climb toward the $0.0000445 range. While risky, SHIB stays relevant among best cryptos for 2025 as meme liquidity keeps fueling demand. 7. Pepe (PEPE): Exchange Listings and Whale Confidence PEPE gained traction after a Binance Alpha listing in July 2025. Whales have been adding to positions, signaling long-term conviction. With cultural campaigns and Tier-1 listings ahead, PEPE could see renewed breakout action. If meme sentiment returns, new highs are possible. For traders hunting top altcoins to buy , PEPE remains on the speculative side but carries strong upside if risk flows cycle back into meme coins. Looking Ahead: Why MAGACOIN May Stand Out in 2025 The 2025 crypto cycle is packed with opportunity — from institutional ETFs driving XRP and SOL to enterprise adoption fueling AVAX and LINK, alongside meme coins like SHIB and PEPE. Yet, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings a different story. With analysts pointing toward its potential as an 18,000% ROI crypto, it is positioning itself as a rising contender in the best crypto presale 2025 class. For investors weighing the best cryptos for 2025, established names offer stability, but MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a new, exciting path with asymmetric upside.

Recently, the network saw its cumulative DEX volume surpassing the $80 billion mark, which is a sign of growing adoption among developers and traders. As per reports from CoinCentral and Crypto Economy, this on-chain activity cements Sui one of the fastest-growing Layer 1s. At the same time, Canary Capital has made a submission for a spot ETF linked to Sui, part of a set of six data crypto ETF applications. If the proposal is accepted, the token will be on its way to getting institutional recognition, akin to mainstream financial products already offered for Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to Reuters, the filings show that big investors want more structured exposure to up-and-coming altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is also shaping up to be a smaller cap project, with fast presale rounds and quick community growth. Price outlook and predictions SUI chart is showing signs of caution and optimism. Experts note resistance is $4.20 – $4.50 and support is holding at $3.50. If bullish momentum returns, traders may target a short-term upside breakout. Further along, speculative models point toward a potential Sui trading range of $3.84 – $7.01 by year-end. According to other long-term predictions by firms like CoinDCX and Cryptopolitan, Sui has the potential to gain double-digit valuations by the end of 2025. Especially if DeFi adoption increases and regulatory approval of Sui-linked products occurs. According to CoinMarketCap, Sui (SUI) is being sold for $3.41, after a fall of 9.07% in a week. The circulating supply of the coin is 3.51 billion out of a maximum of 10 billion coins. Its market cap is $11.99 billion. A significant decline in trading volume over the past 24 hours has been observed. 992 million of almost 24%. The price action shows that after a peak at $3.77 on August 15, there was a sharp drop to current lows, followed by multiple failed attempts to recover. The selling pressure is increasing, and the critical zone traders are looking at for support is $3.50. Where capital finds leverage Experts warn that large-cap networks such as Sui need substantial inflows amounting to billions for rallies even with these promising metrics. This offers chances for small, new projects that can move suddenly with relatively little money. According to seasoned investors, rotation of altcoins occurs when an asset stops and liquidity rotates into higher torque. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the conversation. While Sui builds institutional credibility, MAGACOIN has been rapidly climbing watchlists for its very different value proposition. Its presale rounds are closing in record time , supported by completed audits and a capped supply structure that emphasizes scarcity. MAGACOIN FINANCE now operates at a scale where small inflows can provide outsized returns, unlike Sui which must compete with other billion-dollar blockchains. Analysts are drawing parallels with ETH and SOL as the community began the momentum leading towards the breakout for both cycles. In addition, MAGACOIN has value that transcends cryptocurrency. It’s tied to the worldwide political and economic narrative that keeps MAGACOIN on the lip of the public consciousness. Timing the narrative shift History of market shows when bitcoin and ethereum are consolidating, billions of dollars flow into altcoins. Sui is one such benefactor, but smaller-cap tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE may stand to capture even greater multiples. Based on its presale positioning and community growth, experts are dubbing it the real 1000x coin for 2025. Conclusion: Two paths to growth Sui reached an $80B milestone in DEX, filed for ETF and long-term price predictions are bullish. This is a great layer 1 project. Investors searching for stability with double-digit upside should still consider Sui. But for those looking for life-changing growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a leaner, earlier-stage play. In a marketplace where timing, as well as scale, determines returns, perhaps it will be this project, rather than the bigger names, that shocks the crypto space in 2025.

Here’s Why $118K Might Be Vital For A Bullish Return,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-in-a-trend-shift-why-118k/,"The price of Bitcoin has struggled to make any real headway since reaching the former all-time high around $123,800 in mid-July. While the premier cryptocurrency set a new record-high price at around $124,120, it never really looked certain to go on a fresh bullish run. Over the past week, the market leader succumbed to severe bearish pressure, falling briefly beneath the $112,000 level on Thursday, August 21. However, the Bitcoin price—and the rest of the market—reacted positively to the speech of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, August 22. A prominent on-chain analyst on the X platform has identified a price level that could be crucial to Bitcoin resuming its bullish trend. What Does A Return Above $118,000 Mean For BTC? In an August 23 post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez pinpointed $118,000 as the most important level for Bitcoin’s next course of action. According to the online pundit, the price of BTC needs to quickly reclaim this price level in order to return to its bullish tracks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Below $120K as Buyers Retreat, Is the Rally Already Over? This relevant indicator here is the Glassnode MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Momentum indicator, which helps in identifying macro market trends. This metric consists of the MVRV ratio and the 70-day simple moving average (SMA). When the MVRV ratio breaks above this 70-day SMA, it indicates a transition into the bull market. Meanwhile, a break below the simple moving average signals a shift to the bearish phase. Typically, strong breaks above the MVRV 70-day moving average imply that large volumes of Bitcoin were purchased below the current price, showing that the holders are now in profit (light area in the highlighted chart). On the other hand, a strong breach below the moving average suggests that large volumes of BTC were acquired above the current price, with the holders in the red (shaded area in the chart below). As observed in the chart above and highlighted by Martinez, the Bitcoin price is witnessing a trend shift at the moment. The crypto analyst then suggested that the 70-day SMA is currently around the $118,000 region, with the MVRV ratio needing to break above the moving average for Bitcoin to return to bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $116,217, reflecting an over 2% increase in the past 24 hours. However, the flagship cryptocurrency is still down by more than 1% on the weekly timeframe.

Its rebound offers a clean example of how technical bouncebacks can draw attention; but meanwhile, a lesser-known altcoin, Remittix , is beginning to shine with planned DeFi integrations and real-world use cases. Big players are choosing foundations over hype this week. With Chainlink regaining its footing, smart capital is also eyeing a practical decentralized finance project that could redefine how crypto meets everyday payments. Chainlink Price: Bullish Structure and New Highs in Sight Chainlink has solidified its technical base, closing above both the 50-day moving average and the value area high, which are clear signs of bullish structure. Additionally, experts have revealed that Chainlink just hit nearly 10,000 active addresses . This is the highest level it has reached in 8 months. Analysts now target a move toward $33.75 if price can hold above key levels like $19.28 for support. Additional data reveals strong on-chain strength: over $4.5 million in LINK has moved off exchanges today alone, indicating accumulation and reduced selling pressure. Remittix: The Altcoin Making Waves With DeFi and PayFi Utility Remittix isn’t just another token, it’s a PayFi platform building the bridge between crypto and real-world banking. With a planned Q3 beta wallet supporting real-time FX, Remittix is preparing for mainstream use ahead of many peers. While Chainlink provides oracle services, Remittix solves a different problem in global remittances. It is more than data, but money movement. Already accredited by CertiK, the project’s layered security and cross-chain DeFi credentials give it an edge, especially as traders seek tokens with real utility, low gas fee crypto, and integrated payment use cases. Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Audited by CertiK — built with trust and transparency Backed by working infrastructure, not vaporware Wallet beta launches this quarter (Q3 2025) Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Institutional and whale activity reflects trust: over $20.7 million has been raised, 614+ million tokens sold, and Romittix’s first centralized exchange listing is confirmed (BitMart). Add a $250,000 community giveaway, imminent wallet beta, and staking potential; it’s clear why Remittix is emerging as one of the best DeFi projects 2025. Smart Finance Meets Smart Tech: Why Remittix Could Eclipse Chainlink for Practical Gain Chainlink price is proving its strength with steadied price, strong technicals, and resurgence in demand. But Remittix brings you into DeFi with a purpose. With real products, community rewards, and upcoming liquidity, it’s not just hype, but utility. If you’re looking for upcoming crypto projects, new altcoin to watch, or buy RTX token opportunities, this is the moment to act.

Bloomberg reported Friday that Trump will join a Sept. 1 shareholder meeting of Metaplanet, a Japanese company following Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly, MicroStategy) playbook, citing people familiar with the matter. Trump was appointed as a strategic adviser in March. His Tokyo stop will apparently follow an appearance at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong on Aug. 28–29. A day earlier, Trump appeared at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, where he described himself as a “bitcoin maxi” and said he now spends more than half his time on crypto projects. He predicted bitcoin would reach $175,000 by the end of 2025 and eventually climb past $1 million. He argued that bitcoin and blockchain could address flaws in traditional finance, such as slow payments and settlement processes. The Financial Times reported onAug. 15 that American Bitcoin — a miner and treasury company co-founded by Eric Trump and his brother Donald Trump Jr. — is exploring acquisitions of listed firms in Japan and Hong Kong to use them as vehicles for stockpiling bitcoin, following the playbook pioneered by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy. The company is preparing to go public in the U.S. through a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining. Eric Trump is a co-founder and the chief strategy officer. American Bitcoin emerged in May from a reorganization of American Data Centers, a Trump-linked entity that absorbed rigs from Canadian operator Hut 8. The firm has said it aims to become the world’s most efficient bitcoin accumulation platform, combining active treasury management with new coin production. The Trumps’ crypto ambitions extend beyond Eric Trump. Trump Media & Technology Group , parent of Truth Social, raised more than $2 billion in the second quarter to create a bitcoin treasury. President Donald Trump disclosed in June $57 million in income from World Liberty Financial, a crypto startup launched last September. Together, these moves highlight how Eric Trump and his family are aligning themselves with crypto at a time when Japan and Hong Kong are competing to attract digital asset firms. Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) will approve the first yen-denominated stablecoin as early as this fall. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has introduced the Stablecoins Ordinance, a regulatory framework that requires fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).",Finance|btc|Trump|MetaPlanet|Hong Kong|Japan|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ASIA|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-23 17:34:11

In a tweet directed at Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, Paget Grace, and Natalie Rix, Deaton stated that he is placing what he described as a friendly wager, asserting that the Gemini XRP Card will outperform other cards in the market. He clarified that he is not receiving any form of compensation for making this statement, emphasizing that his belief stems from his familiarity with the XRP community. Deaton’s words underline the loyalty and strength of the XRP user base, which he believes will play a major role in the success of the new card offering. Hey @cameron , @tyler , @Pagetgrace and @Natalie_Rix : I’m going to make a friendly wager and bet the Gemini XRP Card will outdo other cards. And for the record, I’m not being compensated in any way to offer this friendly wager. I just know a thing or two about the XRP Army. https://t.co/zJsLJoy9dD — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 23, 2025 Gemini’s Promotional Campaign The comment from Deaton comes at a time when Gemini has been intensifying promotion for its upcoming XRP Mastercard. According to reports, the exchange unveiled a striking new teaser in New York on August 21, displaying a large billboard wrapped with the design of an XRP-branded Mastercard. The advertisement featured the date “8.25.25” alongside the issuer’s name, WebBank. Gemini simultaneously shared the image on its official account on X, captioned with the phrase “Prepare your bags.” This type of coordinated promotion strongly indicates that the card is scheduled for launch on that date, with WebBank as its issuing partner. The branding and the high-profile marketing rollout suggest Gemini is positioning the XRP Mastercard as a major entry into the competitive digital payments sector. The use of XRP as the central asset for the card demonstrates an attempt to bring cryptocurrency deeper into mainstream financial products. Ripple’s Role in the Partnership Another significant element surrounding the Gemini XRP Mastercard is the reported financial support provided by Ripple. Reports indicate that Ripple is extending a credit line to Gemini in connection with the exchange’s Initial Public Offering. This collaboration highlights the growing intersection between a regulated digital asset exchange, a blockchain payments-focused company, and a traditional financial network. By aligning with Ripple, Gemini not only strengthens its capital structure ahead of its IPO but also underscores a commitment to promoting XRP utility in real-world payment solutions . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Such cooperation positions the card launch as more than a single product release. It is emblematic of the increasing collaboration between traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems, offering a practical demonstration of how cryptocurrencies can integrate with global payment rails. Overview of Market Reception Deaton’s wager underscores confidence that consumer interest in the XRP Mastercard will be significant. Given the size and engagement of the XRP community, coupled with Gemini’s established reputation and Ripple’s ongoing involvement in payment infrastructure, expectations for strong adoption appear justified. The combination of institutional backing, high-profile marketing, and a large existing user base creates conditions that could allow the Gemini XRP Mastercard to capture attention beyond the cryptocurrency sector. If Deaton’s assessment proves correct, the Gemini XRP Mastercard may emerge as one of the most successful crypto-linked financial products introduced in recent years.

This time, focus is shifting to a new project— Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Ethereum traders are discussing the meme token on an Ethereum-based meme token, expecting a 75x return. This makes Little Pepe (LILPEPE) one of the most explosive opportunities for 2025. The project is also gaining attention on trading forums and social media platforms. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): More Than Just a Meme Unlike most meme coins that depend purely on a cycle of hype for their existence, Little Pepe is a lot more creative. It is developing the world’s first meme-coin-mendable Ethereum Layer-2 system that is also a full-blown ecosystem and not a mere speculative ponzi token. The Layer 2 system provides ultra-low fees, instant finality, and ultra-fast transactions, and is ideal for the rapidly changing meme coin economy. Perhaps most importantly, the project includes anti-sniper bot protection, a meme-launch problem wherein bots and whales can exploit retail investors. With these protections, Little Pepe is balancing the scales and attracting traders who seek fairness and opportunity. As of now, Little Pepe is on Stage 11 of its presale and is priced at $0.002, marking one of the lowest entry points compared to competing meme tokens. The presale is currently ongoing, and it has already raised more than $20.8 million,n which is a meme token presale record. Along with presale strength, the project has already confirmed listings on two major centralized exchanges, which are expected to provide significant post-launch liquidity and further adoption. For traders, the presale stage is crucial; it is the window to enter before the exposure, and the upside potential is at its maximum. The Marketing Engine Behind Little Pepe In the case of meme coins, community engagement and viral marketing are the two most critical factors, and Little Pepe has put a lot of effort into both. The team has kicked off a comprehensive campaign that includes influencer marketing, sponsored ads, and a controversial $777,000 giveaway to incentivize 10 participants to receive $77,000 in Little Pepe tokens, thus motivating early adopters. The combination of organized outreach with grassroots meme culture further propels Little Pepe to be one of the most discussed meme projects of 2025. Furthermore, its presence as a top-searched meme coin on ChatGPT trends indicates that the buzz from the community, coupled with investor interest, is already at peak levels. The 75x projection isn’t pulled from thin air but reflects historical precedent and current market conditions. Shiba Inu, for instance, delivered over 40,000x returns for early investors who bought during its formative stages. While Little Pepe may not replicate those astronomical gains, its presale pricing and innovative utility position it to far surpass most memeprojects out there. Traders are eyeing the potential for Little Pepe to surpass the mid-cap meme coins Floki or Bonpost-launchch. Returning from the presale entry at $0.002, even slight appreciation will be exponential, for instance: At $0.05, the return would already be 25x. At $0.10, investors would see 50x. At $0.15 or higher, the coveted 75x target becomes a realistic milestone. Given the project’s rapid presale fundraising and upcoming exchange listings, hitting these price levels within the next market cycle appears well within reach. To participate in Little Pepe ($LILPEPE)’s Stage 11 presale, first download a crypto wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load your wallet with either ETH or USDT via the ERC-20 network. Then, navigate to littlepepe.com, where you can directly buy your Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) tokens. After the presale, you can claim your tokens from the website. Remember—reserve your allocation now before the subsequent price increase! Conclusion Little Pepe is one of the top candidates for explosive meme tokens, especially for Ethereum traders. Its fundamentals include a dedicated Layer 2 blockchain for meme projects, innovative fair-launch safeguards, a successful presale, vigorous marketing, and hype sustenance and deliverable results. An upside of 75x is quite common for established meme coins, making returns of $0.002 a staggering capstone. Little Pepe captures a unique combination of meme culture and blockchain, making it a contender for the next bull run. Even though Solana, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin have a foothold in their markets, for early investors, an ETH based meme coin could be the breakout of 2025.

Ruvi AI (RUVI), an audited AI token targeting the creator economy, has captured institutional attention following a strategic CoinMarketCap listing that’s driving unprecedented demand. With analysts now predicting a $1 milestone by 2026, RUVI appears positioned to deliver the kind of explosive returns that made AVAX a top-tier cryptocurrency. CoinMarketCap Partnership Ignites AVAX-Style Momentum The strategic partnership with CoinMarketCap represents a watershed moment for Ruvi AI, providing the institutional visibility that transforms promising projects into market leaders. Just as Avalanche gained mainstream recognition through strategic partnerships, RUVI’s premium CMC placement has immediately captured the attention of serious investors and trading firms. This exposure has generated remarkable momentum across key metrics: $3.1M raised with unprecedented velocity 240M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global community Holder base exceeding 3,000 members and growing exponentially Phase 2 now over 90% complete with imminent price surge Major institutions rely on CoinMarketCap for project discovery and due diligence. RUVI’s prominent positioning has unlocked access to the same capital channels that powered Avalanche’s initial surge, creating conditions for similar explosive growth toward the predicted $1 target. CyberScope Audit Validates Long-Term Potential The successful completion of a comprehensive CyberScope audit establishes the institutional-grade credibility necessary for sustained growth toward the $1 milestone. This rigorous third-party verification confirms that smart contracts meet the highest security standards and tokenomics are mathematically sound for long-term appreciation. This audit achievement removes the primary barrier preventing major capital from entering early-stage opportunities, providing the security assurance that risk-averse institutional investors require before committing resources to multi-year positions. Creator Economy Super App Powers Sustainable Growth While Avalanche built its reputation solving blockchain scalability issues, Ruvi AI targets immediate utility within the massive $104 billion creator economy . The project’s comprehensive super app provides content creators with professional-grade tools that generate instant value and sustainable demand. Advanced Trend Research : Sophisticated analytics identify viral topics and high-engagement opportunities across multiple platforms, helping creators maximize reach and monetization potential. AI-Powered Script Generation : The platform creates compelling, platform-specific scripts optimized for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Shorts, and other formats while maintaining authentic voice and maximizing viral potential. Native Media Creation : Built-in image and video generation capabilities eliminate expensive third-party software subscriptions, allowing creators to produce professional-quality visuals directly within the ecosystem. Streamlined Workflows : Centralized planning, editing, scheduling, and publishing tools create efficient production pipelines that scale with growing content demands. This comprehensive utility creates sustainable demand from YouTubers, TikTokers, marketing agencies, and brands, the type of organic adoption that supports multi-year growth trajectories toward ambitious price targets. Clear Price Progression Toward $1 Target Ruvi AI offers complete transparency in its presale structure, creating natural urgency while providing clear milestones toward the predicted $1 valuation: Current price : $0.015 (Phase 2 over 90% complete) Phase 3 launch : $0.020 ( 33% guaranteed increase ) Final presale price : $0.070 Analyst target : $1 by 2026 The 33% price jump becomes inevitable once Phase 2 concludes , creating immediate returns that validate the project’s momentum toward higher valuations. This structured approach mirrors the disciplined tokenomics that supported Avalanche’s sustained growth. VIP Tiers Maximize $1 Milestone Returns RUVI’s VIP program rewards significant investments with substantial token bonuses, creating clear pathways to extraordinary returns if the $1 prediction materializes: VIP 2 ($750 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI . VIP 3 ($1,500 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI . VIP 5 ($7,500 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI . The active leaderboard giveaway adds competitive elements that drive participation and reward top contributors with additional tokens. WEEX Partnership Ensures Market Infrastructure The strategic alliance with WEEX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, guarantees seamless market access and enhanced liquidity throughout RUVI’s growth trajectory. This partnership ensures token holders have reliable trading pathways that support efficient price discovery as the project advances toward the $1 milestone. The Path to $1 Accelerates With Phase 2 over 90% complete and the CoinMarketCap partnership driving institutional demand, all conditions align for the sustained growth necessary to reach the $1 target by 2026. The convergence of audit credibility, institutional backing, genuine utility, and strategic partnerships creates perfect conditions for RUVI to follow Avalanche’s path to extraordinary success. The 33% price surge awaits the moment Phase 2 sells out, marking just the beginning of a journey that analysts believe will culminate in the $1 milestone within the next two years.

That became possible as Ripple’s native token jumped to a market cap of almost $180 billion, which helped it surpass several well-known names such as Allianz SE, Accenture, and Boston Scientific. Ripple Enters Top 100 The overall growth of the cryptocurrency market cap has been more than evident for the past 10 months. Aside from bitcoin and ether, which are now positioned well within the top 10 and 30 global financial assets by market cap, the crypto market now has a third rep in the top 100 club. Ripple’s native token has gone through remarkable growth within that same time frame since the US elections last November. At the time, the asset traded below $0.6 with a market cap of roughly $30-35 billion. In the following months, though, it managed to break through several resistance levels and skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $3.65 in mid-July. Despite losing some traction since then, XRP still stands at just over $3, and its market cap, albeit being lower than its local peak of over $210 billion, is at $180 billion as of press time. This, aligned with some corrections from other publicly-traded companies, has enabled Ripple’s token to enter the top 100 club of global financial assets by market capitalization. Assets by Market Cap. Source: CompaniesMarketCap On its way north, XRP also surpassed the likes of Adobe, Pfizer, Santander, Spotify, and many other big names. Ripple’s Path Aside from the price expansion registered in the past 10 months or so, Ripple and its overall ecosystem saw numerous positive developments on other fronts. Perhaps the most important one is the (almost) conclusion of the legal case against the US SEC, as the latest update on the matter reads that the Second Circuit has approved both parties’ joint stipulation of dismissal. Ripple also made a few big acquisitions, including spending $1.25 billion to buy the prime brokerage giant Hidden Road. The company also expanded its portfolio of tokens with the introduction of an institutionally-focused stablecoin at the end of 2024 called RLUSD. XRP has seen adoption as well, given the fact that there are now entities that are accumulating the token for their strategic reserves. What’s next for the adoption curve is perhaps the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs in the US, even though there are already several futures-based ones. The latest move on this matter came just yesterday when several applications were updated to align with the SEC’s guidelines.

Here’s What It Means for Price Rally,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-consolidating-under-heavy-resistance-heres-what-it-means-for-price-rally/,"Market analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has highlighted that “XRP is consolidating under heavy resistance,” with a breakout target of $5.42 on the horizon. This projection, grounded in technical analysis, has sparked renewed attention from traders watching for the next major move in XRP’s price action. XRP is currently trading just above $3.00, fluctuating in a tight range between $2.98 and $3.10. This zone has become a crucial battleground where buyers are absorbing heavy selling pressure, keeping the market locked in consolidation. Analysts note that a clean break above the $3.30–$3.40 band would mark the first real confirmation that XRP is regaining bullish momentum. Importantly, XRP set its all-time high of $3.67 in mid-July 2025. That level now acts as a critical psychological and technical barrier, meaning the market must decisively overcome it before any higher targets become achievable. BREAKING: #XRP CONSOLIDATING UNDER HEAVY RESISTANCE. A BREAKOUT TARGETS $5.42. pic.twitter.com/paT4VIcjs7 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 23, 2025 Why the $5.42 Target Matters The $5.42 target identified by STEPH IS CRYPTO is not arbitrary. Such projections are often derived from measured moves within consolidation patterns, Fibonacci extensions, or the vertical range of prior resistance breakouts. Many analysts agree that once XRP clears the $3.30–$3.70 resistance cluster with conviction, the path toward the mid-$5 region becomes technically viable. This aligns with broader market commentary that has increasingly pointed to $5 and beyond as XRP’s next meaningful resistance zone, provided bullish conditions hold. The Role of Volume and Market Confirmation While the setup looks promising, history shows that consolidation under resistance can either produce explosive breakouts or crushing failures. The deciding factor will be volume. A breakout toward $5.42 requires strong participation, with trading volume well above the consolidation average. Without it, the move risks fading into another rejection. Equally critical will be the retest phase. If XRP can flip its former resistance into solid support after breaking out, it would add further confirmation that the rally is sustainable. Failure to do so could see the asset tumble back into its current range, delaying the next leg higher. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Catalysts and Risks Ahead XRP’s prospects are also shaped by broader catalysts. Increased institutional demand, new integration announcements, or a favorable macroeconomic shift toward risk-on assets could provide the fuel needed to push prices toward Steph’s $5.42 target. On the other hand, liquidity drains, renewed regulatory pressures, or a failure to hold the $3.00–$3.30 zone could stall momentum and send XRP into a corrective phase. Final Outlook Steph’s projection of $5.42 presents a compelling roadmap for XRP, but it remains conditional. For bulls, the key lies in breaking past the $3.30–$3.70 resistance zone with strong volume and holding those levels as new support. If those criteria are met, the probability of XRP advancing into the $5 range increases significantly. For now, XRP remains in consolidation mode, but the stage is set. Traders are watching closely, as the next breakout could define the trajectory of XRP’s rally for months to come.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $14,529 and $17,204, with an average expected price of $14,949 In 2031, ETH could trade between $45,184 and $51,567 with an average price of $46,747. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $4,725 Market cap $570.36B Trading volume (24-hour) $65.38B Circulating supply 120.7M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $4,884.23 24-hour low $4,617 ETH price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 9.17% 50-day SMA $ 3,674 200-day SMA $ 2,679 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 60 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis ETH is consolidating near $4,740 with bullish momentum but close to overbought on RSI. Support is around $4,270 while resistance lies near $4,960 with potential volatility ahead. Short-term momentum is strong on the 4-hour chart though profit-taking could trigger pullbacks. Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum Faces Resistance at $4,800 With Key Support Near $4,270 Ethereum’s 1-day chart shows a pullback after reaching highs near $4,830, with the price now consolidating around $4,744. The Bollinger Bands indicate the upper resistance lies near $4,960, and the current red candle suggests sellers are defending this level strongly. ETHUSD chart by TradingView RSI at 64 signals ETH is approaching overbought conditions but still holds momentum for potential upward continuation. MACD remains positive, hinting at bullish strength despite the short-term retracement. If bulls regain control, ETH could attempt another breakout above $4,800 toward $5,000. However, if selling pressure continues, support levels at $4,270 and $4,000 may come into play for corrective moves. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum Holds Above $4,700 With Eyes on $4,880 Resistance On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum shows resilience after testing lows around $4,690 and rebounding toward $4,721. The MACD has crossed into bullish territory with strong upward momentum, while the Balance of Power indicates sustained buying pressure. ETHUSD chart by TradingView Price action is consolidating near the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting strong bullish sentiment but also raising caution for potential overextension. Immediate resistance is seen near $4,880, while the $4,436 zone acts as strong support. If ETH maintains momentum above current levels, it could test the $4,800–$4,900 range soon, though failure to hold could trigger a retest of the mid-Bollinger range near $4,600. ETH technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 3,508.00 BUY SMA 5 3,860.87 BUY SMA 10 4,179.49 BUY SMA 21 4,092.49 BUY SMA 50 3,674.71 BUY SMA 100 3,116.35 BUY SMA 200 2,679.29 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 4,027.96 BUY EMA 5 3,736.90 BUY EMA 10 3,237.78 BUY EMA 21 2,721.93 BUY EMA 50 2,433.47 BUY EMA 100 2,522.83 BUY EMA 200 2,695.28 BUY What to expect from ETH price analysis next? Ethereum’s 1-day chart shows resilience as price consolidates near $4,740 after a sharp push upward. The RSI at 66 suggests growing bullish momentum but is nearing overbought territory, which could bring short-term profit-taking. Bollinger Bands highlight expanded volatility, with support near $4,270 and resistance around $4,960. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart emphasizes steady buying strength after a breakout, with MACD staying bullish and Balance of Power positive. However, consolidation near the upper Bollinger Band indicates possible pauses before continuation. Overall, ETH shows bullish momentum with the potential to retest $4,880 but may face pullbacks if profit-taking intensifies in the short term. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,019 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $36,694 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,133 and a high of $11,875. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $25,866. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $51,567 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum Ethereum Celebrates 10 Years as DeFi’s Foundation Ethereum marks its 10th anniversary, transforming from a visionary whitepaper into the backbone of decentralized finance. Since its launch, Ethereum has enabled billions in value to move seamlessly across a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. The transition to proof-of-stake following The Merge has established staking as a core network feature, attracting over one million validators who now secure the network. Institutions increasingly choose platforms like Figment to stake, citing non-custodial options, SOC 2 Type II compliance, robust MEV policies, and audit-ready reporting. As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to shape an open, secure financial future. 🎉 @ethereum turns 10!

Traders eye MUTM as the top DeFi crypto,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/23/next-crypto-to-explode-in-2025-traders-eye-mutm-as-the-top-defi-crypto/,"The cryptocurrency market is full of opportunities, but only a few projects combine utility, early entry pricing, and growing investor confidence. As 2026 approaches, one token is being highlighted as the next crypto to explode: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With its presale price still sitting under $0.04 and exchange listings ahead, analysts are calling it one of the best DeFi cryptos to watch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not entering the market with promises alone; it has a defined structure already in motion. The project is building a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can lend, borrow, and generate passive income. Unlike meme coins that rely on community momentum, MUTM’s foundation lies in real lending activity. The platform operates two systems: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) for major tokens like ETH, USDT, and MATIC, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) for community-driven tokens such as SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE. This dual structure ensures broad participation while keeping liquidity pools stable. Why investors are watching MUTM at $0.035 Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM is priced at $0.035, with over $14.75 million raised and more than 15,550 holders already involved, and with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, early participants are positioned for nearly double their investment once trading begins. For example, an $850 investment today would translate to nearly $1,600 once MUTM lists at its confirmed launch price. Market analysts expect MUTM to climb toward the $1 milestone within its first cycle, translating a $850 position today into roughly $25,500. Passive income potential for holders One of MUTM’s strongest appeals is its sustainable income model. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens, which represent their deposit and automatically accrue interest. These mtTokens can also serve as collateral or be staked in the safety module, allowing users to earn. Instead of expanding supply, Mutuum Finance sustains rewards through a buy-and-redistribute system, channeling a share of protocol fees into purchasing MUTM from the open market and delivering it to stakers. This system creates ongoing buy pressure and builds real yield for long-term holders. For example, a user depositing $5,000 worth of ETH could earn consistent yield in mtETH while also benefiting from staking MUTM rewards. Over a year, this could mean hundreds of dollars in additional income, independent of price appreciation. Whale confidence signals long-term growth Whales have started positioning themselves in MUTM’s presale. Transactions worth tens of thousands of dollars have been recorded, signaling confidence in the project’s fundamentals. Large-scale investors typically avoid short-term plays, preferring assets with clear revenue models and long-term growth potential. Their participation has added momentum to the presale, which has now attracted more than 15,550 holders. Analysts’ take According to analysts, a combination of factors is responsible for MUTM’s accelerating traction: Immediate Utility – Mutuum Finance is set to roll out its beta platform at the token’s exchange debut, providing users with lending and borrowing access from day one. Security & Trust – The project has passed a CertiK audit with a 95/100 score and runs a $50,000 bug bounty program to encourage community testing. Stablecoin Expansion – An overcollateralized stablecoin is in development, designed to add another layer of functionality and revenue to the protocol. Community Growth – Beyond utility, Mutuum Finance is running a $100,000 giveaway, rewarding participants and strengthening early adoption. With these factors combined, analysts suggest MUTM has the right mix of security, growth mechanics, and early positioning to outperform many existing altcoins in 2025. MUTM could be the breakout of 2025 As the next bull run draws near, projects that offer both real-world use cases and early entry opportunities are the ones analysts believe will dominate. Both Dogecoin and PEPE highlighted the impact of community momentum, turning minimal investments into significant wealth. Mutuum Finance, with its presale price still at $0.035, exchange listings ahead, and whales already buying in, MUTM is being positioned as the top DeFi crypto under $0.04.

The board of directors approved this plan to show its commitment to increasing shareholder value and promoting long-term growth. Details of SharpLink Stock Repurchase Plan According to a press release , SharpLink mentioned that the stock program lets the company buy back shares in different ways, such as open market transactions or private deals. The company noted that the volume and timing of the share purchase will depend on several factors. These include market conditions, available cash, and current stock prices. Notably, the Ethereum treasury-focused firm made it clear that this program does not require the company to buy back a fixed number of shares. The board can change, pause, or stop the program based on market conditions or company needs. This strategy allows SharpLink to stay flexible while also showing confidence in its long-term value. SharpLink’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom affirmed that the main goal of the initiative is to prevent the loss of value for investors. Furthermore, he said the initiative will help to increase the Ethereum value per share. This compounding effect is also meant to provide lasting benefits for investors. SharpLink Adopts Ethereum as Main Treasury Asset In July, the Minneapolis-based tech company revealed its plan to hold its ETH holdings , stake them on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, and increase the amount of ETH each investor owns. To SharpLink, ETH is more than just a digital coin. It is a scarce and secure asset that can also earn rewards when staked. It is also worth noting that the company sees it as a smart long-term investment. Since launching its ETH plan, SharpLink has rapidly built up its holdings. Between May 30 and June 12, the company purchased over 176,000 ETH, valued at $463 million. In mid-June, the firm added over 12,000 ETH, bringing the total holdings to 188,478 ETH by June 24. Growing Market for Ethereum Treasuries As reported by TheCoinRise, the company’s strategy focuses on generating value for shareholders through yield creation and management of capital. Interestingly, SharpLink wants to stand out from other companies by using this strategy . Reportedly, the total market value of companies holding ETH on their balance sheets has now surpassed $10 billion. This reflects a growing trend in digital asset treasuries. BitMine Immersion Technologies, which recently added 317,000 ETH , valued at about $4.9 billion, to its stash, is leading this trend. Nevertheless, SharpLink’s aggressive accumulation, staking, and ETH management place it among the top holders of Ethereum among publicly traded companies.

Yet amid the uncertainty, MAGACOIN Finance has surfaced as the best crypto presale 2025, offering early investors a 50% bonus with the code PATRIOT50X. Market FUD Intensifies as Bitcoin Struggles The broader market is battling heavy selling pressure as Bitcoin fell to $112,890 this week, a 9% slide from its recent $124,457 peak. Analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to reclaim the $120K–$122K range, a deeper move toward $88,000 could be on the cards. These warnings have added to overall fear, with traders treading cautiously after seven days of consistent pullbacks. Despite the bearish narrative, many are looking at altcoins as hedges and diversification plays, especially projects with limited downside exposure. While Bitcoin consolidates, the search for assets offering security during downturns has intensified. This sets the stage for presale opportunities to gain traction as traders explore safer entry points into the market. BNB Price Faces Pressure but Adoption Expands BNB dipped 1% in the past 24 hours, tracking Bitcoin’s weakness, but its network continues to see stronger real-world adoption. Bitpanda recently launched a DeFi wallet supporting over 5,000 tokens on BNB Chain, making access easier for millions of users. At the same time, KiloEx joined CoinMarketCap and SpaceID in the BNB Guardians coalition, further cementing BNB’s role in Web3 infrastructure. Institutional interest is also rising, with Windtree Therapeutics reportedly buying $500 million worth of BNB, and Nasdaq-listed BNC adding $160 million to its treasury. Social sentiment has turned bullish, with forecasts pointing to $1,000 and beyond by 2026. Still, for now, BNB’s short-term price action remains tied to Bitcoin’s performance, leaving traders cautious until clear recovery signals emerge. MAGACOIN Finance Presale: Early Bonus & Safe Haven Appeal While BNB and Bitcoin face price turbulence, MAGACOIN Finance is holding steady and has become one of the most talked-about opportunities in 2025. The altcoin offers early investors a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the code PATRIOT50X, available for a limited time. This presale deal positions it as the best crypto presale to buy for those seeking hedge, diversification, and a safer allocation during market crashes. With altcoins gaining attention as alternatives in times of fear, MAGACOIN Finance has become attractive for traders wanting early exposure at locked-in stage pricing before exchange listings. Importantly, its ability to maintain stability while major assets like BNB dip underlines its appeal as a safe haven option. But urgency is key—this bonus structure and discounted pricing won’t last beyond the presale phase. What Should Traders Do Next? With Bitcoin uncertainty and BNB tied to its swings, diversification into altcoins looks sensible. MAGACOIN Finance’s presale, with its 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, offers one of the clearest entry points before exchange listings. Traders looking to act should not delay—presale phases are time-limited, and entry prices will only rise.

Why Investors Are Accumulating Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Instead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-price-prediction-ripple-to-10-in-2025-why-investors-are-accumulating-mutuum-finance-mutm-instead/,"While Ripple (XRP) hangs in balance over speculations of hitting a valuation of $10 in 2025, investors are increasingly shifting their focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in private. Mutuum Finance phase 6 presale is currently selling the token for $0.035. Investors who purchase the token today have a high chance of seeing a minimum ROI of 500% within weeks to months. Mutuum Finance presale has already received more than $14.75 million in capital and onboarded more than 15550 token holders to date. As XRP moves through the market, Mutuum Finance is gaining traction for being ahead of DeFi innovations and accumulation trends that show strategic positioning versus hype-driven speculation. XRP Price Prediction: Capitalizing on Market Volatility in 2025 XRP currently sits at approximately $2.93, having risen 1.38% from the previous close. The token has seen its price swing between $2.83 and $2.98 during the day, which indicates that there is still market volatility. Analysts are monitoring key support levels of $2.85 and $2.74, with a measured target of $2.40 should the downtrend persist. Market sentiment is being manipulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) delay to make a ruling on XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) proposals, setting timelines for decisions to late October. This volatility, together with risk-averse investor sentiment ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s upcoming speech, has added to the bearish pressure on the price of XRP. Despite all that, optimists still maintain a positive outlook, forecasting a potential rise to $5.05 by the end of 2025, provided that market conditions and regulatory news remain favorable. Presale Stage 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has been able to achieve more than 15,550 investors whose total presale raise is now well over $14.75 million. The project is already at presale stage 6 at $0.035. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. It is a four-tiered reward i.e., critical, major, minor and low wherein each level of risk is being rewarded. It is another feature which puts Mutuum in the list of a trendsetter as far as generation of trust from both the view point of good infrastructure as well as good security. Mutuum Finance Giveaway: $100K Reward Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway . 10 participants will each get $10,000 MUTM. The giveaway is the project’s way of creating a long-term and dedicated community. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance uses a two-model approach to have the maximum flexibility and efficacy with Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models of lending. Peer-to-Contract is running self-execute smart contracts that will lend without any sort of human intervention. They have been written to operate according to changing market rates with an interest rate from available demand and supply. Middleman does not exist for Peer-to-Peer model and the borrowers are talking directly to the lenders. Peer-to-Peer model is trending among meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has seen strong demand since launch earlier this year. The presale has raised more than $14.75M and onboarded 15,550+ investors to date. At $0.035 in Phase 6, initial purchase can result in 500%+ returns when the token launches and gains traction. Supported by a $100K giveaway and $50K CertiK bug bounty, MUTM is becoming a top DeFi project. Join presale now to get your tokens early.

This decision would suspend further actions in the crypto company’s court case involving alleged violations of the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). How Another Case Could Decide The Outcome Of Coinbase Lawsuit According to an August 21 filing in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division, Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman approved a motion submitted by Coinbase to stay a lawsuit accusing the exchange of violating the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act. The motion asked the court to wait for a ruling from the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on a similar case. The Court of Appeals case involves Nuance Communications and Charles Schwab, with the intricacies around supplying voice identification technology forming the foundation of the legal battle. The decision from this particular lawsuit could set precedent for how BIPA affects financial service providers, including cryptocurrency exchanges. The court document read: [T]he Court finds that the stay would simplify the issues and streamline the trial reduce the burden of litigation on the Court and the parties […] [and] would not unduly prejudice or tactically disadvantage Plaintiffs. The lawsuit, filed in May 2025 by a group of users, accused Coinbase of the “wholesale collection” of biometric data for its Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements without notifying the users, thereby violating the Illinois law. The plaintiffs also alleged that the crypto company inappropriately shared the faceprints with third-party verification providers. Under Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, private firms or organizations can face damages of up to $5,000 for each instance of reckless or intentional violation of the law and $1,000 per negligent violation of the BIPA. The plaintiffs also sought relief to cover their legal costs. Coinbase Under Pressure From Data Security Breach Due to a separate incident, Coinbase has been under scrutiny over the security of customer data. The crypto company revealed in May that a group of customer support contractors in India accessed account data for users in exchange for bribes. While the customer contractors were eventually dismissed, the individuals behind the data breach tried to extort $20 million in Bitcoin from Coinbase. Ultimately, this incident has put Coinbase under pressure and called into question its process of handling personal user data.",Coinbase|btc|Charles Schwab|coin|coinbase|crypto exchange|Data Breach,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 18:30:36

While many have their eyes glued to SOL, smart traders are shifting focus to fresh presale tokens like Layer Brett (LBRETT), which is making headlines for its explosive potential. Experts are boldly projecting that LBRETT could deliver 100x gains—potentially leaving the Solana price in the dust for the next market cycle. Layer Brett (LBRETT) presale and the rise of utility-driven meme coins Layer Brett (LBRETT) is the talk of the town, merging meme coin appeal with real blockchain utility. Its ongoing presale has captured the attention of DeFi and altcoin enthusiasts, thanks to an early staking APY that soared above 25,000% (now dropping as more users pile in). Close to $1 Million has already been invested and tokens are currently priced at $0.0047. The next price increase is due to happen within the next 36 hours as demand for LBRETT tokens ramps up. Built atop Ethereum Layer 2, LBRETT brings fast, scalable, low gas fee crypto transactions and robust DeFi features. This blend of meme coin energy and utility is why analysts are watching LBRETT as the next big crypto—especially as it outpaces traditional meme coins and even mainstream crypto like SOL. Solana (SOL): Sideways consolidation, technical indicators, and what’s next Solana (SOL) has long been at the forefront of smart contracts and DeFi innovation, boasting lightning-fast transaction speeds and a robust NFT ecosystem. Current analysis suggests the Solana price will likely trade sideways for several months before seeing a meaningful move. Technical indicators such as the 200 EMA and MACD are flattening below $180, and the RSI is hovering near 54, indicating a neutral SOL trend. Experts predict a potential SOL rise to the $200–$225 range by late 2025, yet warn that macro trends could keep SOL range-bound near its current $181.96 mark. Despite its strengths, SOL currently lacks the momentum of presale tokens like LBRETT. The appeal of exponentially greater upside has many investors redirecting funds from established coins such as SOL into the Layer Brett ecosystem. Why Layer Brett is building exponential momentum Layer Brett (LBRETT) is showing all the hallmarks of a next 100x altcoin, with its presale in high demand. Here’s what sets it apart from SOL and meme coins: Experience the next evolution of decentralized finance with LBRETT, an innovative Layer 2 token. By building directly on the Ethereum network, LBRETT delivers lightning-fast transactions and drastically reduced costs while leveraging the unparalleled security of the world’s leading smart contract blockchain. LBRETT tokens are available at an exclusive early-bird pricing of $0.0047 (at the time of writing), providing a clear advantage for first-movers. Early participants have already secured incredible staking rewards, initially soaring above 25,000% APY. These rates are designed to decrease as the network grows, adding a layer of urgency to the opportunity. Beyond the viral appeal of a meme coin, Layer Brett offers genuine utility. It’s a technology-backed asset providing real value across decentralized finance and Web3 applications. Participate without any restrictive KYC requirements, giving full control and true self-custody. Plus, a massive $1 million giveaway and community campaigns are fueling the excitement and adding even more incentive to get involved. Act fast or miss out on the next crypto bull run With SOL consolidating, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is shaping up to be the top coin and possibly do 100x. The presale won’t last forever —stake now to secure massive APYs and a spot in the $1 million giveaway. Don’t let the SOL sideways action keep you on the sidelines: Layer Brett is where meme power meets real blockchain utility, and early backers could ride the wave into the 2025 crypto bull run.

The results, published as Warsaw is trying to regulate the market in accordance with EU rules, also show that almost all want their government to back the blockchain industry. Most Poles perceive cryptocurrency as an asset Cryptocurrencies are becoming a regular asset in the eyes of Polish investors, the Bitcoin.pl portal reported on the weekend, quoting data from a recently released study. The survey, commissioned by the Polish exchange Zondacrypto, has been conducted by the Business Growth Review analytical and research platform among 1,188 adult citizens from different age groups and backgrounds. One of its key findings, according to the authors, is that cryptocurrencies are no longer a “revolution” in Poland. They are not a “niche market” anymore. The poll established that interest in digital coins is largely driven by the desire to diversify investments, which was cited as the main reason for entering the space by 81% of the respondents. The leading Polish crypto news outlet explained: “In practice, this means that cryptocurrencies are treated more like another asset class than one-time speculation.” At the same time, speculative motives have not disappeared yet, as 41% declared they are enticed by the possibility of making quick profits. For around 19%, the advantages of digital money, such as fast and convenient payments, matter more. Another 11% are curious about the technology involved. Only about 15% believe crypto investments can help preserve the purchasing power of their savings. Their relatively small share indicates most Poles do not rely on cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation. The core of the studied sample is made up of working-age, professionally active individuals, with 66% of the participants aged between 25 and 44, which explains the investment-oriented nature of the gathered responses, the authors noted, elaborating: “The survey reveals mature pragmatism among Poles. The dominant motive is diversification, favored by this age group, which, by definition, manages its portfolio and disposable income.” Poll registers high expectations for government support The publishing of the study coincides with delayed efforts to regulate Poland’s blockchain sector. A controversial bill designed to transpose Europe’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules into national law is still under consideration in the Polish parliament. The draft legislation has been criticized by the local crypto community for introducing requirements that go beyond the EU standards, threatening the survival of the domestic digital asset industry. Compliance costs under MiCA are also too high for small crypto firms in Poland. According to an official estimate, released during the parliamentary debates, around 18% of Polish citizens have already invested in crypto assets. Meanwhile, the latest survey also found that 91% of them want their government to support Polish blockchain businesses. Bitcoin.pl commented: “We have not only social acceptance, but also an incentive to develop the sector, by streamlining regulations and facilitating the operations of companies in the field.” “The expectation for active, wise government policy — instead of a restrictive retreat — can guide regulators and the financial community on how to build the market … with investors who treat cryptocurrencies as part of their usual portfolio in mind,” the article remarked. The study also revealed that Poles are increasingly trusting domestic organizations more than foreign entities, including traditional financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms. The National Bank of Poland got the highest rating, with an average score of 4 on a scale of 1 to 5. Commercial banks and licensed Polish crypto exchanges received 3 points. The Polish Ministry of Finance and foreign exchanges alike ranked lower, at 2 out of 5. This shows that Poles are cautious regarding both their own regulators as well as coin trading platforms registered in other jurisdictions, the pollsters concluded.

50555635,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=192805,1755975310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50555635.jpeg,"Massive USDT Transfer Unveiled: 410,000,000 USDT Moves from HTX to Aave",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-usdt-transfer-2/,"BitcoinWorld Massive USDT Transfer Unveiled: 410,000,000 USDT Moves from HTX to Aave The cryptocurrency world often witnesses monumental movements of digital assets, and a recent event has captured significant attention. A colossal USDT transfer , totaling 410,000,000 USDT, has been reported moving from the HTX exchange to the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, Aave. This transaction, valued at approximately $410 million, represents a substantial shift of capital and immediately raises questions about its implications for the broader crypto market. What Happened? Unpacking the USDT Transfer On-chain analytics platform Whale Alert recently flagged this massive movement, highlighting the transfer of 410 million Tether (USDT) tokens. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, making its value relatively stable. Such a large USDT transfer from a centralized exchange like HTX to a DeFi platform like Aave is not an everyday occurrence and suggests a strategic move by a significant market participant, often referred to as a “whale.” HTX and Aave: A Quick Overview To fully grasp the significance of this event, it is helpful to understand the entities involved: HTX (formerly Huobi): This is a major centralized cryptocurrency exchange, offering various trading services. Users typically hold their assets here for trading or safekeeping. Aave: A leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Users can deposit cryptocurrencies to earn interest or borrow against their holdings without traditional intermediaries. The shift from a centralized exchange to a DeFi protocol indicates a potential change in strategy for the funds involved, moving from a trading-centric environment to one focused on earning yield or leveraging assets within the decentralized ecosystem. Why Does This Massive USDT Transfer Matter? A USDT transfer of this magnitude can have several profound implications, influencing market sentiment, liquidity, and even the stability of certain protocols. It’s not just a number; it’s a signal. Liquidity Shift: Moving $410 million in USDT to Aave significantly boosts the liquidity available within that protocol. This can impact borrowing rates and the overall capacity for lending. Strategic Positioning: Whales often make such moves to position themselves for future market events. This could involve preparing to borrow other assets, earning passive income through lending, or even setting up for large-scale arbitrage. Market Confidence: A large inflow of capital into a DeFi protocol like Aave can be seen as a vote of confidence in its stability and earning potential, especially for stablecoins. Potential Market Implications While the immediate impact might be subtle, such a substantial USDT transfer can ripple through the market. For instance, increased USDT liquidity on Aave might lower borrowing costs for other assets, making it cheaper for traders to open leveraged positions. Conversely, if the whale intends to borrow a significant amount of another asset, it could affect that asset’s market dynamics. Understanding Whale Movements and Their Impact Whales, individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, often move markets with their actions. Tracking these large transactions provides valuable insights into potential future trends or strategies. When a whale moves funds from an exchange to a DeFi platform, it often suggests an intent to engage with decentralized applications rather than just trading on a CEX. This particular USDT transfer could indicate a long-term strategy to utilize Aave’s yield-generating opportunities or prepare for a major borrowing event. What Could Be Next? Actionable Insights For everyday crypto enthusiasts, understanding these whale movements can offer crucial insights: Monitor Liquidity: Keep an eye on Aave’s USDT liquidity pools. A sudden influx can change lending/borrowing dynamics. Observe Related Assets: If the whale intends to borrow, which assets might they target? This could hint at future price movements. Stay Informed: Use on-chain analytics tools to track similar large transactions. Knowledge is power in the fast-paced crypto market. While we cannot predict the exact intentions behind every large USDT transfer , observing these significant movements helps us piece together the larger narrative of the crypto landscape. This particular transaction underscores the growing maturity and utility of DeFi protocols like Aave, even for the largest market participants. The recent 410,000,000 USDT transfer from HTX to Aave is a clear example of how significant capital moves within the crypto ecosystem. It highlights the strategic decisions made by major players and the increasing importance of decentralized finance platforms. Such a colossal shift can influence market liquidity, borrowing rates, and overall sentiment, making it a transaction worth observing closely. It’s a reminder that even stablecoin movements can carry substantial weight in the dynamic world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDT? A1: USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin designed to maintain a stable value, pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. It is widely used in the crypto market for trading, lending, and as a store of value. Q2: What are HTX and Aave? A2: HTX (formerly Huobi) is a major centralized cryptocurrency exchange where users can trade and store digital assets. Aave is a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. Q3: Why do large USDT transfers occur? A3: Large USDT transfers often occur for strategic reasons, such as increasing liquidity on a DeFi platform, preparing for significant trades, earning yield through lending, or rebalancing portfolios. They usually signal a deliberate move by a major investor or institution. Q4: How does this specific USDT transfer affect the crypto market? A4: This specific USDT transfer of $410 million to Aave primarily boosts the liquidity within the Aave protocol, potentially influencing borrowing rates. It can also signal increased confidence in DeFi and may precede further strategic actions by the whale, which could impact related asset prices. Q5: Is this USDT transfer a sign of market manipulation? A5: Not necessarily. While large movements can precede significant market events, a USDT transfer to a lending protocol like Aave is typically for yield generation or leveraging, rather than direct market manipulation. On-chain transparency allows for monitoring such movements, which helps reduce the risk of hidden manipulation. Did this analysis of the massive USDT transfer spark your interest?

Big names like Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) have grabbed headlines with their huge market caps, but now all eyes are turning to coins with significant growth potential. One of the most exciting newcomers is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . It’s currently in Stage 11 of its presale and already creating a lot of buzz, giving early investors a chance at up to 50% gains before launch and a jaw-dropping projected growth of over 43,000% in the next six months. Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL): Valued at $100 billion in Market Cap XRP is still a favorite for big investors, mainly because it’s focused on making cross-border payments more manageable. Right now, it’s trading around $3.07 with a market cap of about $182 billion. Binance Coin isn’t just a trading token anymore. At roughly $825 and a $115 billion market cap, BNB is deeply connected to everything in the Binance ecosystem. Solana has made a name for itself with super-fast transactions and low fees, which keep developers and users coming back. SOL is trading around $185 with a market cap close to $100 billion. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Underdog Set to Explode While the coins above are established, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the new contender, capturing attention as it could soon join the $100 billion club. The token has completed Stage 10 of its presale and is now in Stage 11, selling at $0.0020. Early investors from Stage 1 have already seen gains of 100%, and those joining now have potential gains of 50% before the launch price hits $0.0030. The presale has been flying off the shelves, with over $20.7 million raised and 13.45 billion tokens already sold, meaning it’s about 94% full. Little Pepe has even been audited by Certik and is listed on CoinMarketCap, which gives investors extra confidence. Its $777,000 presale giveaway has been turning heads, and you can’t ignore how popular it’s getting on social media. LILPEPE peaked at 100 on the ChatGPT 5 meme coin question trend, surpassing PEPE, DOGECOIN, and SHIB in public interest between June and August 2025. The token is projected to skyrocket toward a $100 billion valuation, making it one of the most exciting investment opportunities. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Culture with Staying Power Dogecoin is still turning heads in the crypto world. It’s sitting around $0.2219 with a market cap of $33.7 billion, and its fanbase keeps getting stronger. If DOGE wants to hit a $100 billion market cap, the price would need to climb to roughly $0.66. With its current momentum and community-driven buzz, that kind of growth could happen if more people start using it in real-world ways. Tron (TRX): Blockchain Versatility TRON has become a major player in decentralized applications and smart contracts. With a current price of $0.3508 and a market cap of around $31 billion, TRX has a clear path to $100 billion if usage continues to grow. The network’s low transaction fees and speed make it attractive for developers and users, and partnerships with enterprises could accelerate TRX’s climb in market value. Why Now is the Time As Stage 11 of the presale nears completion, Stage 12 will raise the token price to $0.0021, and early investors have a clear advantage. LILPEPE combines community energy, real utility, and strong presale momentum, all while riding the wave of meme coin popularity. Investors who join now are positioned to benefit from significant upside potential before launch. Conclusion Ripple, Binance Coin, Solana, Dogecoin, and TRON have already demonstrated the power of established crypto networks to achieve massive market caps. But LILPEPE is showing that even newcomers can make waves quickly. With its Stage 11 presale almost full, strong community backing, Certik audit, CoinMarketCap listing, and potential 43,209% growth, Little Pepe offers a rare opportunity to invest early in a token that could redefine what a meme coin can achieve. Investors looking to ride this momentum should consider acting now to maximize returns before the presale concludes. Check out the Little Pepe presale and join the $777,000 giveaway today.

While fintech funding slowed globally, Canadian investors maintained steady support for ventures at the intersection of finance and emerging technology. The report singled out companies building blockchain-based infrastructure and AI-driven financial tools as leading growth areas. ""If we look at the first half of 2025, it's clear that digital assets have re-emerged as a magnet for investor interest, despite the broader contraction in venture investment values,"" said Edith Hitt, a partner at KPMG Canada. AI investments aren't surprising, given its monumental expansion in recent years. However, Canadian investors turning to digital assets funding might catch some off guard, as the risk factor of the crypto market has always been up for debate among investors. However, with more pro-crypto regulations in the U.S. and further institutional push legitimizing certain parts of the digital assets sector, the conversation has clearly started to shift. ""Crypto's resurgence coming out of 2024 was reinforced by a more constructive regulatory tone in the U.S., the dismissal of the Coinbase lawsuit, and tangible mainstream adoption in stablecoin use cases,"" Hitt added. Cautious investors While the $1.6 billion number may seem big, zooming out, the numbers have actually dropped year-over-year due to macro events such as tariffs and higher interest rates. The report said the first half of 2025 data is lower than $2.4 billion invested in the Canadian fintech industry in the same time period last year, and $7.5 billion invested in the second half of 2024. This doesn't mean investors are shying away from fintech funding; rather, there is a lot of 'dry powder' waiting to be deployed, said Dubie Cunningham, a Partner in KPMG in Canada's Banking and Capital Markets Practice. Investors are looking for more ""quality companies"" and appetite for ""maturing mid-to-large stage private equity deals,"" she added. 'Strong' second half In fact, KPMG Canada's report explained that this trend of investing in AI and digital assets is likely to continue into the latter half of 2025.

50555870,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79846,1755975606,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Solana Price Prediction: Could SOL Hit $900 by 2026, or Is the Next Big Winner Elsewhere now",https://timestabloid.com/solana-price-prediction-could-sol-hit-900-by-2026-or-is-the-next/,"How far can Solana (SOL) really go in the next bull run? Solana has been one of crypto’s brightest names in recent years, and many analysts believe it could touch $900 by 2026, making it a relatively safe play for long term gains. But even with that target, Solana’s huge market cap makes explosive upside harder to achieve. Investors who want more than steady growth are now shifting attention to the best crypto to buy today, a memecoin with real tools and real demand that could steal the spotlight in this bull cycle. The real question is, can Solana still deliver the kind of life changing returns investors want, or is the next big winner already rising elsewhere? Solana’s path to $900 Right now Solana trades between $190 and $200. If it climbs to $900 by 2026, that means a 388% return. The excitement comes from new US spot Solana ETFs, including the first launched in a special format to attract big investors. Solana also led all blockchains with around $271 million in revenue in Q2 2025, and in June alone it processed as much activity as every other L1 and L2 combined. If ETFs are approved and demand keeps rising, $900 is possible. But even if that happens, the biggest fortunes are rarely made from giants already at the top. The largest gains almost always come from smaller, earlier projects that can multiply at incredible speed. That is why all eyes are now turning to a new contender, one that could repeat what Shiba Inu achieved in 2021. Pepeto (PEPETO) the meme coin that is more than hype Pepeto is built on Ethereum and is not just another meme coin. It combines massive community energy with real products that give it real staying power. The goal is clear. Pepeto is building a complete platform to become the home of memecoins, hosting hundreds of them in one place, all tradable with Pepeto’s own token. At its core is PepetoSwap, a zero fee exchange where trades are fast and free. Supporting it is PepetoBridge, a tool for secure cross chain transfers without middlemen. Staking adds another income stream with rewards up to 240% APY and already more than 42 trillion tokens locked. The project is fully audited by Coinsult and SolidProof which gives investors extra confidence. By uniting culture, hype, and working tools, Pepeto is setting itself up as the meme coin ready to dominate this bull run. Presale momentum and investor confidence Pepeto’s presale price is just $0.000000148 and already more than $6 million has been raised. That is serious demand before any major exchange listing. Staking is already live at 240% APY with billions of tokens locked, showing that holders are here for the long term, not short term flips. Independent audits from Coinsult and SolidProof confirm the contracts are clean with no hidden risks. The tokenomics are built for trust, with no trading tax and no team wallets. Together these elements show a project designed to last. As each presale stage pushes the price higher and reduces supply, investors are rushing in to secure positions before the next jump. Why Pepeto’s upside is far bigger than Solana’s The numbers tell the story. If Solana climbs from $184 to $900, that is about a 4 to 5× gain, a strong return for a large cap coin but not explosive. Pepeto starts at just $0.000000148 which gives it massive upside potential. A move to $0.00001 is a 68× gain. A move to $0.0001 delivers 680×. At $0.001 which many believe is achievable in a bull market, the return would be more than 6,800×. This is the kind of rare setup traders chase, where a tiny entry can turn into a fortune. The reward is on a completely different level compared to a mature project like Solana. Community and meme culture power Community is everything in meme coins and Pepeto’s is growing at full speed. Social channels are overflowing with memes, fan art, and holder content that keeps the project trending daily. This kind of natural buzz keeps hype alive and pulls in new investors every day. Where most meme coins fade after launch, Pepeto is different because it combines community power with a roadmap based on real products. This gives it a much stronger chance of long term success than projects built only on speculation. Conclusion a different kind of bet For investors chasing real upside, Pepeto is the project that stands out. Solana is already established and moving toward steady growth, but Pepeto is still early and loaded with explosive potential. It delivers real products like PepetoSwap and PepetoBridge, staking at 240% APY, and independent audits for safety. The token model is clean with no trading tax and no team wallets. And the presale price is so low that even the smallest moves can turn into massive gains. This is why many believe Pepeto could be the true breakout star of the next bull run, offering the kind of life changing returns Solana simply cannot match anymore.

According to crypto investor and analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO, the XRP/BTC pair is now testing the edge of an eight-year downtrend , and the combination of regulatory clarity, institutional momentum, and network upgrades makes this setup impossible to ignore. Technical Setup: An Eight-Year Compression Since 2017, XRP has traded under a descending trendline that has capped every major rally against Bitcoin. This structure has now tightened into a wedge pattern, with XRP/BTC pressing against resistance that has held firm for nearly a decade. A decisive breakout above this trendline would mark a technical turning point , flipping long-term resistance into support and opening the door to significant outperformance relative to Bitcoin. Market analysts view this compression as the strongest structural setup XRP has presented in years, with the potential to reset the narrative around its long-term trend. XRP/BTC is about to smash through its 8-yr downtrend. 6+ spot XRP ETF approvals coming. Partnerships with Japan's SBI holdings. The Ripple-SEC case has officially ended. XRPL massive upgrades coming. If there's one large cap which is about to pump hard, it's gonna be $XRP . pic.twitter.com/Q9k9H1S40H — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) August 23, 2025 Institutional Catalysts: ETFs Poised to Reshape Liquidity The institutional landscape is evolving rapidly. ProShares’ 2x leveraged XRP futures ETF launched in July, marking the first XRP-linked product of its kind on a major U.S. exchange. Meanwhile, over half a dozen spot XRP ETF applications are currently under SEC review, with critical deadlines slated for October. Approval would unleash a wave of institutional demand similar to what Bitcoin experienced earlier this year, while any delays could inject short-term volatility. Either way, anticipation around these filings has already fueled greater market activity. Strategic Partnerships: SBI and Ripple’s Expanding Reach Beyond speculation, Ripple continues to deepen its institutional footprint. In Japan, SBI Holdings—one of Ripple’s longest-standing partners—announced new initiatives that will expand Ripple technology into domestic markets. Crucially, SBI is also preparing to integrate Ripple’s U.S. dollar stablecoin, RLUSD, into Japan’s payment ecosystem by 2026. This development has the potential to drive tangible XRP utility in cross-border settlements, boosting adoption in one of Asia’s most advanced digital asset markets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Clarity: The SEC Case Finally Ends For years, the Ripple-SEC lawsuit cast a shadow over XRP, curbing institutional interest and raising doubts about its regulatory status. That overhang is now gone. Court filings confirm that both Ripple and the SEC have withdrawn their appeals, officially bringing the case to a close. This final resolution has transformed XRP’s risk profile, making it far more attractive to institutional allocators who had previously avoided exposure due to regulatory uncertainty. Current Price Outlook XRP is currently trading just above $3.00, climbing steadily since July and outperforming many top altcoins in 2025. If XRP/BTC successfully breaks through its multi-year downtrend, it could set the stage for a new cycle of relative strength against Bitcoin, with upside potential supported by ETF inflows, utility-driven demand, and a clean regulatory slate. Traders are now watching closely to see whether XRP can turn this long-standing resistance into a springboard for a historic rally. The alignment of technical pressure, institutional catalysts, strategic partnerships, and legal clarity has created a rare convergence for XRP. As STEPH IS CRYPTO emphasizes, XRP/BTC is “about to smash” its eight-year downtrend. Whether this moment delivers the breakout the community has waited for will depend on ETF approvals and adoption momentum, but one thing is clear: XRP is entering one of the most decisive phases in its history.

Amid market uncertainty, the spotlight is shifting to a select few cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, institutional support, and massive upside potential. At the top of the list? MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin (BTC), and NEAR Protocol, each tipped by analysts for potential 40x gains in the next cycle. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to buy, this article breaks down why these three picks stand out right now — and how they’re positioned for serious growth as we head toward Q4 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Explosive Presale Crypto With 40x+ ROI Forecast Of all the best cryptos to buy, there is no one that talks more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rapidly developing altcoin that brings together strong branding, practical use, and viral propagation. Demand is surging as investors scramble to grab tokens before the next pump. The live countdown adds urgency, making now the ideal time to enter. With a limited token supply and deflationary design, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built for long-term appreciation. For investors who missed the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rare second chance to get in early on a high-potential project. With strong community backing, limited token supply, and massive growth projections, it could be the next big thing in crypto — before everyone else catches on. If you’re looking for a hidden gem with high upside and low current exposure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is easily one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Bitcoin (BTC) — Still the Market Leader Despite Volatility Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time high on August 14, 2025, before retreating to the $113,000–$115,000 range. For the past few days macroeconomic worries and investors’ decision to take profits have been driving a pullback. As a result, the market has opened up a new entry point for long-term investors. Key Reasons Bitcoin Remains One of the Best Cryptos to Buy: The Power of Institutional Support Remains High: In spite of $523 million in ETF withdrawals on August 20, the total ETF inflows in 2025 are still more than $54.85 billion. Broad Use of Institutional Funds: Several top firms like MicroStrategy, Harvard, and Amdax are persistently making BTC acquisitions for their treasuries as a part of their overall strategy. Even with short-term fluctuations, Bitcoin’s long-term story of scarcity, adoption, and global trust makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in any market condition. NEAR Protocol — Institutional Inflows +Cutting-Edge Tech NEAR Protocol has quietly positioned itself as one of the most advanced and promising Layer-1s in the space. With a surge of institutional interest and aggressive technical upgrades, NEAR is emerging as one of the best cryptos to buy for mid-to-long-term growth. Why NEAR Deserves a Spot in Your Portfolio Institutional Inflows: NEAR received more than $10.1 million of new capital in mid-August to be more precise, this inflow was mainly driven by regulatory changes and the opening of retirement accounts. Game-Changing Upgrades: Nightshade 2.0 and Stateless Validation have significantly enhanced throughput and decentralization, as well as lowered the users’ hardware requirements by 70%. Cross-Chain Compatibility: The support of Ethereum wallet via MetaMask makes NEAR accessible to 80M+ potential users, thus greatly facilitating the adoption process. Bullish Setup: As the price is around $2.75 at the moment, a breakout above $2.92 could be the beginning of an ascent towards $3.10 and further. NEAR is at the intersection of DeFi, AI, and interoperability — and investors are starting to notice. It’s a clear pick among the best cryptos to buy as technical progress and institutional support accelerate. Final Thoughts: Best Cryptos to Buy This Week With market volatility comes opportunity. While some coins struggle, others are gearing up for massive moves. If you’re wondering where to invest, the best cryptos to buy right now offer a mix of security, growth, and innovation. This Week’s Top Crypto Picks: MAGACOIN FINANCE – Presale sensation with 40x potential Bitcoin (BTC) – Market leader with institutional backbone and bullish long-term outlook NEAR Protocol (NEAR) – Tech powerhouse with fresh inflows and cross-chain adoption If you are either putting together a portfolio for 2025 or searching for the next big things, the top cryptocurrencies to purchase this week are these.

This follows an ecosystem survey conducted to identify the most urgent issues within Ethereum’s infrastructure. Wallet Security Standard In an August 20 blog post, the EF announced that the security initiative’s first actions will mostly target user experience (UX) issues. “During this first wave we will kick off a range of work targeting crucial areas in UX security. The work we begin today is a combination of high-leverage short-term actions and long-term projects that we expect will continue for years,” read the post. First launched in May, 1TS’s main goal is to enhance network security and promote broader on-chain adoption. The program is expected to roll out across several phases, with the first taking place over the next few weeks and months. One of the key efforts will involve establishing a “Minimum Security Standard” for Ethereum wallets. The EF explained that secure UX is critical, as users must be able to safely manage keys, sign transactions, and understand the actions they approve in decentralized applications. The proposed standard will include features such as transparent transactions, compromise-resistant interfaces, privacy-preserving architecture, and rules for governing wallet behavior, such as approval management and key handling. To support this effort, the non-profit has awarded a grant to Walletbeat, which will help to develop the benchmark and assess against it. Blind Signing and Transaction Transparency The foundation also highlighted blind signing as a major problem in UX security, where users are often asked to approve transactions without understanding them. To address this, it plans to promote transaction decoding, which would present human-readable details instead of raw code, and expand the use of transaction simulations that preview clear outcomes before approval. The post revealed that the EF has started several research projects aimed at improving transaction transparency in wallets. Plans include setting new standards to make transactions easier to interpret, revisiting past proposals, and making simulation tools more reliable and widely available, alongside exploring potential in-protocol security upgrades. Action will also be taken to help developers avoid deploying vulnerable code, which could aid in reducing the number of compromised smart contracts. This will involve creating an open-source database of relevant vulnerabilities where programmers will be able to check their code against known issues before deployment. The survey also noted that there is demand for simpler wallets designed for non-technical users and enterprise-focused apps with features such as privacy, censorship resistance, and compliance options. The EF’s move comes a few months after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined a roadmap for the ecosystem that is focused on L1s, blobs, as well as user experiences.

Analysts interpret this move as an effort by asset management companies to become more compliant with the process to gain approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has yet to approve a spot XRP ETF. Data shows that applications have been filed for both spot and futures-based funds. “I would say these applications were almost certainly made in response to feedback from the SEC,” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on the X platform. “It's a good sign, but it was largely expected.” Related News: New Developments in the Ripple-SEC Case: Now in the Final Stages The new regulations appear to have changed the structure of the funds, allowing for creation with XRP or cash, and cash or in-kind returns, rather than cash-only transactions. NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci commented on the development, saying, “It’s quite remarkable, it’s a very good sign that they’re all taking such a step at the same time.” On the other hand, BlackRock, which manages the world's largest spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, did not submit any application for the XRP ETF. *This is not investment advice.

50556935,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=790919,1755976809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50556935.jpeg,UK Treasury y plans to extend the income tax threshold freeze beyond 2028 to raise £7 billion yearly,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uk-treasury-income-tax-trap-for-workers/,"Rachel Reeves is weighing a plan to quietly drain more money from workers in the UK by stretching the income tax threshold freeze past 2028. The freeze has been in place since 2021, when the Conservatives locked the bands in without adjusting for rising prices. Now, according to The Telegraph , Reeves may extend it through the decade to help fill what analysts warn could be a £50 billion deficit. This plan means more people pay income tax as their wages increase. Some even get pushed into higher brackets without any new tax being introduced. It’s what economists call fiscal drag, and it’s turned into a multi-billion-pound machine for the Treasury. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects it to haul in £51 billion a year by the end of the decade. Reeves hasn’t made a final call yet, but one official said the idea is “on the very hot list” of options. Reeves backs off pensions, leans on tax freeze Extending the freeze would bring in about £7 billion per year. Reeves sees it as one of the only ways to raise serious money without breaking Labour’s campaign pledge. That pledge ruled out increasing income tax rates, employee National Insurance, or VAT. But locking tax bands in place isn’t technically a rate hike. So it’s still on the table. Reeves reportedly floated the idea last year, but then pulled back, saying it would “hurt working people.” Now her choices are tighter. Higher borrowing costs have wrecked her fiscal buffer. Her main rule is not to borrow for day-to-day spending. That rule is already under threat. Economists think Reeves will need to find at least £20 billion in tax increases. If things get worse, the hole could go up to £50 billion. Angela Rayner, who serves as Deputy Prime Minister, has already pushed Reeves to freeze the £125,140 threshold, where workers start paying the 45p rate. In a private note leaked in March, Rayner called the move “consistent with the manifesto.” The OBR predicts that by 2027–28, 4.1 million people will be pulled into either the 40p or 45p tax band. All of that happens even though the official tax rates don’t move. Reeves hasn’t ruled out a pensions grab. That option is still alive, depending on how deep the Office for Budget Responsibility says the deficit will be by autumn. But the threshold freeze is gaining more traction because it’s easier to justify politically. The Chancellor is expected to deliver her second budget in mid-November, the earliest possible date after giving the OBR its required ten-week notice. Gambling industry braces for new tax hit Reeves is also preparing to hit gambling companies with higher taxes. The government is reviewing how it taxes betting and gaming, and wants to simplify things by creating a single rate across the board. Right now, online gambling (RGD) is taxed at 21%, while high street bookmakers (GBD) and online racing bets only pay 15%. The Treasury said it’s “consulting to level the playing field,” but racecourse bets will remain exempt, since they already pay a horse race betting levy on gross profits. The Social Market Foundation, a think tank, wants gambling taxes to go much higher, 50% on online betting, 25% on retail, and said it would raise £2 billion annually while cutting gambling-related harm. But the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents the industry, fired back hard. In a seven-page memo to the Treasury, they called the think tank’s claims “highly flawed and misleading.” Their numbers suggest the actual increase would be £467 million, and it would cost up to 6,000 jobs if people move to black market sites and gambling shops shut down. The last time Reeves spoke on tax policy, the message was simple: “We are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible.” She also repeated that Labour won’t raise basic, higher, or additional income tax rates, National Insurance, or VAT. That doesn’t stop her from using the UK tax code to quietly dig deeper into people’s pockets. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

In his analysis shared with his followers, il Capo claimed that a bearish confirmation is still required for the Bitcoin price and that if the BTC price falls below $ 108,000, a local top may have formed in the market, which could trigger the first decline towards $ 60,000 to $ 70,000 as the main support. Related News: What to Expect for Ethereum (ETH) Price After the Record? Analyst Predicts Target for ETH and When the Bear Market Will Begin At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $114,800. The world's largest cryptocurrency has lost 2.54% of its value in the past week. However, BTC broke its all-time high of $124,450 about 10 days ago. In his latest post, analyst il Capo claimed that such a drop in Bitcoin's price could trigger a capitulation event that could result in a 50% to 80% loss in altcoin value.

A fresh prediction sees ADA potentially refreshing the $2 zone if bullish setups persist into September. Technical analysts point to the classic “inverse head-and-shoulder” pattern on the weekly charts; if ADA can hold bases between $1.10–$1.30, a breakout toward $2 isn’t outlandish. That move would be a logical push; nothing like meme-driven frenzy, but still compelling. But here’s the kicker: while Cardano’s growth would be sound, it’s not a moonshot. Sure, hitting $2–$3 would make many early holders happy. It’s the remix of stability and seasonal pump, like a slow-burn heatwave, not a wildfire. What’s Fueling ADA’s Renewed Buzz Behind the scenes, Cardano isn’t standing still: Voltaire governance is alive: ADA holders can now vote, propose, and fund projects directly. That level of decentralization restores faith. Hydra Layer-2 is stirring interest: once sidechains roll live, throughput and app potential amplify significantly. On-chain metrics tell a detailed story: TVL in DeFi dipped a little while the stablecoin sector and treasury holdings increased, which means there is diversification but not decline. Interestingly, we’re starting to hear more big-money names eyeing Cardano. There are even talks about Grayscale taking more ADA, and there’s even speculation about partnerships rolling out in Ethiopia. In short, the fundamentals look solid, but Cardano price projections toward $2 feels like groundwork converging with timing. But Wait, Remittix Is Forcing a Plot Twist Meanwhile, from Amsterdam to Accra, a project called Remittix (RTX) is turning heads. Analysts and even whale wallets are bubbling about its presale; a real-world PayFi token that lets crypto convert to bank transfers across 30+ countries in real time. Oh, and it’s already pushed beyond $20 million raised, with a listing on BitMart locked in, and a beta wallet launch in Q3. Projections are… bold. Some are talking up to 35x returns by 2026, even whispers of 100× if adoption accelerates. That’s unicorn-level territory in this market. The difference? Cardano is playing chess, while Remittix is pitching to sprint like lightning across a utility field. ADA is the established track; Remittix is the untested shortcut. Should You Ride ADA’s Momentum or Chase RTX’s Rocket? This comes down to investing style: ADA is dependable: realistic targets, ecosystem depth. It’s the leg over the wall; not a leap, but a climb. RTX is speculative and explosive: massive ROI potential, but infrastructure must deliver, and trust needs to stick. If you prefer steady growth backed by strong fundamentals and a reasonable path to $2+, ADA still looks attractive. But if you’ve got an appetite for higher risk, a compelling use case, and early mover advantage, Remittix’s RTX might trump the chart on returns if things go well.

The challenge is doing it without making the Fed look like it’s giving in to the White House. For months, Powell brushed off President Donald Trump’s repeated demands to reduce rates. But on Friday, in a closely watched speech, he indicated the Fed could take that step as early as its meeting in September. Any move would be delicate. Officials must balance stubborn inflation against the chance that growth and hiring pick up in the second half of the year. Either shift could make a cut look early. Trump has pressed for steep cuts, contending there’s “no inflation” and that cheaper borrowing would lower interest payments on the government’s $37 trillion debt. Powell’s case is different. He says the risk now is a cooling economy. Speaking at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, he also made clear that any easing would be careful and slower than what Trump wants. He cited that growth “has slowed notably in the first half of this year,” with output running at a 1.2% annual pace, down from 2.5% the year before. He also cited a “marked slowing” in the demand for workers, a trend that could push unemployment higher. At the same time, Powell noted that tariffs have begun to lift the price of goods and could keep pushing inflation up. That risk will keep the Fed wary about how far and how fast to go with cuts. Hammack reiterates Fed’s independent mission The Fed’s key short-term rate, which helps set costs for mortgages, auto loans, and other credit, stands at 4.3%. Trump has urged a drop to 1%, a level unsupported by any Fed policymaker. Whatever the path, the central bank is expected to keep stressing its independence. Economists widely see an arm’s-length Fed as vital to keeping prices in check because it can raise rates to cool the economy when elected leaders might not. Nineteen officials serve on the Fed’s rate-setting committee, with 12 voting at each meeting. Beth Hammack, the Cleveland Fed president, reinforced that view Friday in an interview with the Associated Press . “I’m laser focused … on ensuring that I can deliver good outcomes for the for the public, and I try to tune out all the other noise,” she said. Hammack said inflation still needs to be fought, a view several colleagues share. “Inflation is too high and it’s been trending in the wrong direction,” she said. “Right now I see us moving away from our goals on the inflation side.” Powell avoids independence talk, draws strategic praise Powell did not mention independence in his Wyoming remarks, where he received a standing ovation from academics, economists, and central bank officials from around the world. Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that omission likely served a purpose. “The not talking about independence was a way of trying as best they could to signal we’re getting on with the business,” Posen said. “We’re still having a civilized internal discussion about the merits of the issue. And even if it pleases the president, we’re going to make the right call.” As that debate played out, Trump stepped up pressure on another senior Fed figure. He warned he would dismiss Governor Lisa Cook if she refused to step down. Bill Pulte, Trump’s pick to head the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged Wednesday that Cook engaged in mortgage fraud tied to her 2021 purchases of two properties. No charges have been filed. Cook said she will not be “bullied” into stepping down. On Friday, she declined to address Trump’s threat. If Cook were removed, Trump would have a chance to place a loyalist on the Fed’s governing board, whose members vote on every rate decision. He has already put forward White House economist Stephen Miran to fill the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, who left on Aug. 1. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Following a recent report, the news comes after years of restrictive policies, which have been implemented in the wake of the 2021 ban on cryptos. If true, this will mark a major pivot for China in digital currency policy. Amidst this, investors are rapidly flocking to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has become one of the best crypto presales in there. Global Ripple Effect Sanctions could delay issuance of yuan-linked stablecoins subject to approval by the People’s Bank of China. Cross-border settlement trial runs across Asia could be hastened, centred on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin on August 31. But analysts say how far and fast it gets adopted might be hampered by yuan convertibility and market access. Still, institutional players are watching closely. Approval of the potential is seen as a ‘tectonic shift’ in making a stablecoin part of global finance, one that could entice players into regulated and speculative plays linked to the next major narrative wave. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum Dogecoin may be driving short-term meme coin hype, but analysts have ranked MAGACOIN FINANCE as the top presale pick of 2025 . Having already surpassed significant funding milestones, with verified audits and secure smart contracts, it is now drawing significant momentum and heavy speculation over Tier-1 exchange listings. Analysts call it one of the best crypto presales to buy this week as momentum accelerates. Investor enthusiasm is being fueled not just by whale accumulation, but also by MAGACOIN FINANCE’s capped supply model and zero-tax trading mechanics, which add layers of scarcity and transparency to the presale. Backers note that the project blends cultural relevance with robust technical safeguards, a combination that could give it staying power beyond short-term hype. Strategic Context The timing could not be worse for retail and institutional investors. As China attempts to reshape the stablecoin environment and legacy giants Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidate around support levels, presale opportunities are attracting increasing attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project that combines strong community energy, audited infrastructure, and whale participation and is increasingly viewed as a once-in-a-cycle opportunity. Conclusion China’s likely acceptance of stablecoins shows how fast the global crypto market is evolving. As the focus remains on yuan-backed stablecoins, other opportunities could present huge gains. With whale-backed demand on the rise, analysts are projecting MAGACOIN FINANCE as a leading candidate for outsized returns. The presale is on, allocations are limited, and hype is building for investors targeting 2025.

Mutuum Finance presale price is priced at $0.035 in phase 6. Phase 7 will see a 14.29% surge to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already seen more than $14.75 million in investments and has been supported by more than 15,550 investors. As SHIB holders recalibrate their strategies, many are exploring Mutuum Finance’s innovative DeFi protocols. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Update, August 21, 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at approximately $0.00001262, reflecting a modest 0.034% increase over the previous close. The token has experienced a slight uptick in trading activity, with a 24-hour high of $0.00001268 and a low of $0.00001206. Despite this, SHIB faces ongoing challenges, including market volatility and competition from emerging DeFi platforms. Notably, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention as an alternative investment option. MUTM’s innovative decentralized lending and borrowing protocols are attracting investors seeking higher yields in the current market environment. While SHIB remains a significant player in the crypto space, the growing interest in platforms like Mutuum Finance suggests a shift in investor focus towards projects offering enhanced utility and returns. Investors Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.035 in stage 6 of presale. More than $14.75 million is raised and more than 15550 early investors are buying tokens. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, up by 14.3% from Stage 6. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has just launched its Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Its users stand to get a share of the program’s $50,000 USDT reward if they are successful in finding potential bugs on the project. The bounty program seeks to provide the same level of safety to all classes of vulnerabilities. It has four classes of severity; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Announces Huge Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also unveiled a $100,000 giveaway where participants will be rewarded in the form of $10,000 MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. The project is also audited and certified by CertiK. The Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance’s non-custodial liquidity protocol enables decentralized lending with which the users keep complete control of their assets while lending. Through lending, the lenders receive passive income and borrrowers automatically receive funds by collateralizing multiple assets throughout the loan. Systematic interest rate adjustment by the system maximizes capital structure and viability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a double-lending scenario with best-in-class flexibility to users as Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model is compatible with smart contracts for controlling lending pools that change interest levels automatically in perfect synchronization with the market. Lenders can have secure returns, while the borrowers have safe options when taking capital on loan. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) removes intermediaries through direct contact among lending parties and borrowing agents. Any risky asset has only such a completely decentralized system that offers maximum freedom to users. Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues burning tokens, but investors are eyeing higher returns in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Presale Stage 6 is $0.035, with Stage 7 rising 14.3% to $0.04, and over $14.75M raised from 15,550+ investors. MUTM offers dual lending, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and a $100K token giveaway, making it a top DeFi pick for secure, high-yield opportunities.

Foxconn, the assembly giant Apple depends on, recalled around 300 Chinese engineers from a factory in southern Tamil Nadu. That plant belongs to Yuzhan Technology, one of Foxconn’s component arms. This wasn’t some random recall. It’s the second one in just a few months. Foxconn didn’t give a reason. Apple said nothing. But people who know the situation told reporters that Taiwanese engineers are being flown in fast to take over from the departing Chinese workers. Those workers weren’t janitors. They were handling high-precision parts like metal enclosures and display modules for older iPhones. The whole thing throws Apple’s localization plans into chaos. Foxconn quietly pulls engineers out of Tamil Nadu The Yuzhan plant had only just started running a few months back. It’s not even making parts for the new iPhone 17s yet. That’s the line Apple is betting big on. But instead of ramping up, it’s losing skilled workers. Bloomberg said last month Foxconn was already pulling Chinese engineers from iPhone assembly lines in India. This new recall just adds more weight to what’s clearly becoming a trend. Sources say the recall is tied to China’s silent resistance to losing manufacturing power. Earlier this year, Beijing officials verbally told regulators to block tech and equipment exports to India and Southeast Asia. No official memo. No public statement. Just quiet orders aimed at stopping companies like Foxconn from shifting supply chains out of China. It’s not confirmed if Beijing directly forced the recall. But the timing is loud enough. Foxconn’s move shows how much power Chinese technicians still have in the iPhone supply chain. The moment they’re gone, production stutters. Foxconn and Apple didn’t answer questions from journalists. Meanwhile, The Economic Times reported Yuzhan’s Chinese staff had started leaving, which now seems completely accurate. Apple, for now, is importing more display modules and using local Indian suppliers for enclosures. But the gap in experience and training is still real. Apple’s Indian partners, especially Tata Group, the only domestic iPhone assembler, are growing fast. But they’re still climbing a steep learning curve. Chinese factories have had twenty years to perfect iPhone assembly. India is barely five years in. Apple made a deliberate call to exclude Chinese suppliers from its India move . But that choice is being tested now. Without those engineers, speed and quality might take a hit. On the bigger geopolitical front, India and China are talking. Beijing has offered to supply rare earths and tunnel-boring equipment, but there’s been zero follow-through so far. If relations thaw, it could make Apple’s life easier. But don’t count on it yet.

They often appear quietly, giving early participants a chance to see major returns before wider attention arrives. For 2025, many are now looking at the top trending crypto projects that combine strong foundations with big growth potential. While popular names like Dogecoin, Hyperliquid, and Pepe continue to capture attention, many are also watching presales for the next breakout. One project leading those talks is BlockDAG, which has already raised over $380 million in its presale and is preparing for what many believe could be a major launch. With advanced technology, rising adoption, and prices set to move higher with each batch, this could become one of the most followed stories of the year, making it a top trending crypto to watch right now. BlockDAG (BDAG): $380M Presale and 36x Potential BlockDAG’s presale is building momentum, and the chance to buy at early prices is disappearing quickly. Now in Batch 29, BDAG coins remain at $0.0276, with projections pointing toward $1 after listing, a possible 36x return. More than $380 million has already been raised toward a $600M goal, and every completed batch pushes the price higher, leaving smaller margins for those who wait. This pace is supported by strong design. BlockDAG’s hybrid DAG plus Proof-of-Work system allows fast and scalable transactions while staying decentralized, a balance not often seen. Adoption is growing quickly with 19,300 ASIC miners sold and 2.5 million users already mining on the X1 mobile app. Developers are working ahead of the mainnet release, setting up real use from day one. The urgency is clear. Once Batch 29 closes, prices rise again. For those looking at the top trending crypto, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as a leading story of 2025. Delaying could mean paying many times more later. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Energy Driving Market Moves Dogecoin continues to highlight its durability, fueled by strong meme-driven momentum. In the past week, DOGE has gained close to 23%, including 12% in the last 24 hours. A surge powered by whales above $0.25 formed a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders setup, signaling potential for higher price levels. Now trading near $0.246, Dogecoin is supported by heavy volumes and a wave of positive sentiment across the altcoin space. As one of crypto’s most recognizable names, it works as both a market mood signal and a speculative play. While not part of presales, its impact on retail excitement can lift projects like the top trending crypto contenders, since speculative flows often shift from well-known meme assets into early-stage growth stories. Hyperliquid (HYPE): DeFi Momentum Backed by Scale Hyperliquid is seeing rapid adoption, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) passing $6 billion, supported by large USDC and ETH inflows. The HYPE coin rose nearly 5% recently, aided by strong institutional demand and $4 million in daily buybacks. Forecasts suggest a possible breakout toward $55, reflecting its accelerating revenue growth. This kind of performance in institutional-grade DeFi highlights how large-scale backing can shape markets, showing why presales with strong fundamentals often rank as top trending crypto picks. Those watching HYPE’s growth see similarities with BlockDAG, which is now drawing close attention in presale discussions for its own rapid momentum. Pepe (PEPE): Liquidity Powerhouse of Meme Space Pepe’s $1.6 billion 24-hour trading volume proves it is still a major liquidity driver in the meme coin category. Although it is down about 9% in the past day and up just 2.1% this week, it keeps attracting huge speculative focus. Analysts warn that lower whale activity could spark steep pullbacks, yet the meme appeal ensures steady engagement from retail participants. Pepe’s swings show that while high-volume coins can deliver short-term gains, presales such as top trending crypto options present the chance for bigger growth without the same market shocks, if entry comes before demand surges. Conclusion: Why BlockDAG Leads the 2025 Conversation The hunt for the top trending crypto in 2025 is not about chasing every new launch; it is about spotting the mix of strong tech, fast adoption, and well-timed entry. Dogecoin shows how community power drives rallies, Hyperliquid highlights the strength of large-scale DeFi structures, and Pepe demonstrates the pull of meme-driven liquidity. BlockDAG brings all these traits together in a presale that checks every box with advanced tech, rising adoption, and a price structure built to reward early entry. With over $380 million raised and batch-based price increases moving quickly, the early window is closing fast. In a year when presales may set the stage for the biggest crypto stories, BlockDAG stands out as a top trending crypto ready to shape 2025.

Police say the suspect, identified only as Han, 33, was detained at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok under a warrant issued in February. Crypto to Gold Network Uncovered The arrest was made by the Technology Crime Suppression Division (TCSD). Officers say Han worked with a call center gang that tricked victims into fake investment plans. He is accused of handling several cryptocurrency accounts that collected the stolen funds. Those assets were then used to buy gold from suppliers overseas before being shipped back to the group. Investigators say that between January and March this year, nearly $47.3 million in Tether (USDT) was moved through Han’s accounts. Each round of laundering was said to involve more than 10 kilograms of gold, worth about $1 million per transaction. Han’s phone was seized during his arrest, and police say it contained multiple accounts tied to the scheme. Han had previously studied in China before joining a South Korean company that dealt with cryptocurrency-to-gold conversions. Police believe this background helped him manage the network. He now faces charges of fraud, money laundering, computer crimes, and involvement in a criminal group. In another major news, Interpol arrested 1,209 suspected cybercriminals in Operation Serengeti 2.0, which targeted 88,000 victims. The operation recovered $97.4 million and shut down 11,432 malicious networks. Victims of Call Center Scam The case began after several complaints were filed against a call center scam that started in early 2024. Victims were told they could earn high profits of 30 to 50 percent from investments. At first, small payouts were made, which convinced people to put in more money. Later, withdrawals were blocked with claims that investors had not met conditions. The scam left dozens of people with heavy losses. TCSD investigators followed the money trail, which led to the arrest of ten suspects before Han, including five people accused of laundering money and five who let their bank accounts be used. Police say this is one of the biggest crypto money laundering cases handled in Thailand. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened a public consultation on new rules to regulate the issuance of utility tokens by crypto exchanges and their partners. The move was part of efforts to curb scam cases in the country. Regional Action Against Crypto Laundering Other countries in the region are facing similar cases. In Taiwan, prosecutors recently charged 14 people in what they called the country’s largest cryptocurrency laundering case. More than 1,500 victims were affected, with over $70 million in illegal funds traced. Seized items included cash, luxury cars, and frozen bank accounts. Han has denied parts of the charges but remains in custody. Thai police say their investigation is still ongoing and more arrests may follow. In related news, Australia’s financial regulator ASIC has intensified its crackdown on online scams, shutting down 14,000 fake websites since July 2023. More than 3,000 of those sites were linked to cryptocurrency.

50558092,564006,1755979254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50558092.jpeg,IRS Loses Top Crypto Enforcer After Only 90 Days On The Job,https://bitcoinist.com/irs-loses-top-crypto-enforcer-after-only-90-days-on-the-job/,"Trish Turner’s sudden exit from the IRS digital assets unit has sharpened attention on how the US will handle crypto tax enforcement going forward. Based on reports , Turner stepped down roughly three months after taking the post, closing out a career that spanned more than 20 years at the agency. What The Resignation Signals According To LinkedIn posts and media reports, Turner said she looks forward to “continuing this mission from a new vantage point” and to building ties between industry and regulators. Reports have disclosed she will join the crypto tax firm Crypto Tax Girl as tax director, a move confirmed by founder Laura Walter. Bloomberg Tax first reported the hire. For industry players, the move is a reminder that public-sector know-how is in high demand in the private market. Turnover At The Top Turner follows two prior leaders who left the IRS crypto unit after roughly a year. Sulolit “Raj” Mukherjee and Seth Wilks both exited before Turner’s appointment in May. That pattern raises questions about leadership continuity as Congress and oversight bodies push for clearer policy and improved enforcement. On July 11, House committee leaders scheduled hearings aimed at creating a formal tax policy framework for digital assets. These hearings will test the IRS’s ability to keep up while staff and senior leaders change. Political And Oversight Pressure Several recent developments have fed the urgency around crypto tax work. On July 4, US President Donald Trump signed a joint resolution that rolled back a Biden-era rule requiring some DeFi protocols to report transactions to the IRS. On April 11, the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration urged reforms after finding failures in how IRS criminal investigators handled digital-asset cases. And in March, the Department of Government Efficiency, or D.O.G.E. proposed cutting the IRS workforce by 20%, a plan that would reshape capacity across the agency. Industry Reaction And Next Steps Economist Timothy Peterson greeted Turner’s move with levity, saying, “Trish Turner left the Dark Side to become a Crypto Jedi Knight.” The quip points to a wider trend: regulators are being recruited by private firms that need help navigating new tax rules and growing compliance demands. IRS Director Trish Turner left the Dark Side to become a Crypto Jedi Knight. Also to make 10X what the IRS paid her. Bio listed within hours. Don’t hate on her. One less of them. One more of us. pic.twitter.com/AgzjXWn1I9 — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) August 22, 2025 For taxpayers and companies, that means better access to specialist advice. For the IRS, it may mean a steeper challenge in keeping institutional knowledge inside the agency. What Comes After Turner Based on reports, Turner did not list a start date in her announcement. The IRS has not publicly detailed a replacement plan. With hearings planned and inspector general recommendations on the table, the agency’s work on digital assets is unlikely to slow. How quickly leadership is restored, and whether the IRS can retain senior talent, will matter to lawmakers and to the businesses that must follow evolving tax rules.

His post quickly spread across the XRP community, drawing attention to what could be one of the most significant developments for the asset this year. Gemini itself reacted with a clap emoji, further fueling the buzz and hinting at the legitimacy of the announcement. Gemini’s Billboard Tease Adding to the anticipation, Gemini unveiled a high-visibility billboard in Manhattan at the southwest corner of 29th and Broadway. The display reads “Prepare your bags” with the date “8.25.25,” accompanied by imagery of an XRP-branded Mastercard mockup issued by WebBank. — Gemini (@Gemini) August 22, 2025 This public campaign confirms that something substantial is on the horizon, moving the news from rumor into official expectation. Possible XRP-Powered Mastercard Crypto industry outlets and analysts widely interpret the teaser as a sign of a new XRP-powered Mastercard product . Reports suggest that the card could allow users to spend XRP directly at merchants or earn rewards in XRP, signaling a significant step toward mainstream payment utility. Prepare your bags. pic.twitter.com/PuZPmaZXwZ — Gemini (@Gemini) August 21, 2025 The involvement of WebBank as issuer points to a traditional financial partner, and Mastercard’s global payment rails could help XRP break into everyday commerce. While details such as cashback tiers, eligibility requirements, and geographic availability remain unconfirmed, expectations are high that Gemini will formally introduce this payment product on Monday. Market and Community Response The reaction to both James Rule XRP’s post and Gemini’s billboard was swift. Traders and community members view the date as a key milestone, with many anticipating heightened volatility around XRP once the announcement is made. Analysts have noted that Gemini’s campaign is a rare instance of a crypto exchange aligning marketing, banking partnerships, and product launch timing in a way that positions XRP at the center of the conversation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why This Matters for XRP If confirmed, XRP Mastercard would represent a practical milestone for XRP adoption. Beyond speculation and trading, XRP could gain broader visibility as a functional payments currency, allowing holders to spend or earn rewards seamlessly. Such integration into established financial infrastructure could strengthen XRP’s long-standing utility narrative, especially after years of regulatory uncertainty. However, analysts caution that the long-term impact will depend on the product’s terms, compliance frameworks, and real-world adoption beyond initial hype. What to Watch on Monday All eyes now turn to Gemini’s official channels on August 25. The key points to monitor will include the official product name, the scope of availability, cashback or reward mechanics, and whether Ripple, Mastercard, or WebBank issues supporting statements. These factors will ultimately determine whether this announcement is a watershed moment for XRP adoption or a more limited product launch. James Rule XRP’s revelation and Gemini’s own billboard campaign have set the stage for a highly anticipated Monday announcement. While speculation runs high, the details that Gemini provides will be decisive in shaping XRP’s next chapter. For now, the message is clear: the XRP community should indeed prepare its bags for a potentially game-changing development.

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $25.55 Market cap $10.79B Trading volume $1.33B Circulating supply 422.27M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $26.69 24-hour low $24.50 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 4.81% 50-day SMA $22.94 200-day SMA $22.95 Sentiment Bullish Green days 16/30 (53%) Fear and Greed Index 60 (Greed) Avalanche price analysis As of August 23, AVAX’s price rose by 2.33% in 24 hours, outpacing Bitcoin (-1.17%) and aligning with the broader altcoin momentum. Its trading volume also rose (61.87%), showing greater conviction in the market trend. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView Last month, AVAX attempted a recovery, which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to a high of $27.38. It faced strong resistance at its 30-day macro supply zone ($27.00-$27.38), a level that triggered 3 rejections since March 2025. AVAX attempted again this month and managed to reach $25, outpacing the wider crypto market. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility has dropped. The histograms (0.06) show positive momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s run with strong support at $22.33. The trend shows a bullish market but with slowing momentum and high volatility.

Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX up? AVAX is up after correcting from July’s low. AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment and technical overextension. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20. In July, it traded at the $18 level and $23 in August.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,AVAX|TRADING|MARKET|ICO|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|FIL|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|APT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-23 20:08:00

This kind of movement often signals deeper trends or strategic plays within the digital asset landscape. What Just Happened with This Huge USDT Transfer? Blockchain analytics firm Whale Alert recently reported an astonishing transaction: 410,000,000 USDT was transferred from the HTX exchange to the Aave protocol. To put that into perspective, this single transaction is valued at approximately $410 million. Such a substantial USDT transfer highlights the dynamic nature of large-scale capital deployment in the crypto space. Source: HTX (formerly Huobi), a prominent centralized cryptocurrency exchange. Destination: Aave, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing protocol. Asset: USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged to the US dollar. Value: A staggering $410 million. This event isn’t just a number; it represents a strategic move by a significant market participant, often referred to as a ‘whale’. Understanding these movements helps us gauge market sentiment and potential future trends. Why Does a $410 Million USDT Transfer Matter? When such a massive amount of capital changes hands, especially involving a stablecoin like USDT, it sends ripples across the crypto ecosystem. This particular USDT transfer from a centralized exchange to a DeFi protocol is especially noteworthy. Here are a few reasons why this move is important: DeFi Liquidity: Moving funds to Aave typically means they are intended for lending, borrowing, or yield-generating activities. This influx of capital significantly boosts Aave’s liquidity pools. Market Sentiment: Large stablecoin movements can sometimes precede significant market events. Whales moving funds into DeFi might be looking for yield opportunities or preparing for future trades. HTX’s Role: While HTX is a major exchange, the outflow of such a large sum could indicate a shift in how whales utilize centralized versus decentralized platforms for their stablecoin holdings. Understanding the Key Players: HTX, Aave, and USDT To fully grasp the implications of this USDT transfer , it is crucial to understand the entities involved. These platforms play distinct but interconnected roles in the broader crypto landscape. HTX (formerly Huobi): This is a veteran centralized cryptocurrency exchange, offering a wide range of trading services. Users deposit funds, trade assets, and withdraw them, with the exchange acting as a custodian. Centralized exchanges provide ease of use but require trust in the platform. Aave: Aave is a non-custodial decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Users can deposit crypto assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral. It operates on smart contracts, removing the need for intermediaries. This allows for greater transparency and user control over funds. USDT (Tether): As a stablecoin, USDT aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. It serves as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto market, allowing traders to lock in profits, avoid volatility, and move funds efficiently. Potential Motivations Behind This Whale Move A USDT transfer of this magnitude isn’t arbitrary. Whales typically make such moves with specific strategic goals in mind. While we can only speculate, several common motivations could be at play: Yield Farming: Aave offers competitive interest rates for stablecoin deposits. The whale might be looking to earn passive income on their substantial holdings. Borrowing Opportunities: The funds could be used as collateral to borrow other assets on Aave, potentially for leveraged trading or other DeFi strategies. Arbitrage: Discrepancies in lending rates or asset prices between HTX and Aave could present arbitrage opportunities, though this is less common for direct stablecoin transfers. Risk Diversification: Spreading assets across different platforms, both centralized and decentralized, is a common risk management strategy for large holders. This particular USDT transfer could be part of a larger, multi-step strategy that will unfold over time. What’s Next? Monitoring the Impact of the USDT Transfer The crypto market thrives on data and sentiment. This significant USDT transfer will be closely watched by analysts and investors alike. While immediate price impacts on major cryptocurrencies might not be evident, the implications for DeFi liquidity are clear. As the funds settle into Aave, we might observe: Increased liquidity in Aave’s USDT pools, potentially lowering borrowing costs or adjusting lending rates. A signal that large investors are increasingly comfortable with and actively using decentralized finance protocols. Potential follow-up transactions, such as the deployment of these funds into other DeFi protocols or even a return to centralized exchanges if market conditions change. Ultimately, this massive USDT transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the continuous evolution and strategic depth within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores the growing importance of DeFi and the sophisticated strategies employed by large capital holders. Keeping an eye on these whale movements provides valuable insights into the pulse of the market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A1: A ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency, significant enough to potentially influence market prices or trends with their transactions. Q2: Why use USDT instead of other cryptocurrencies for such a large transfer? A2: USDT is a stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged to the US dollar. This makes it ideal for large transfers where stability is desired, avoiding the volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Q3: Is this USDT transfer a bullish or bearish sign for the market? A3: A large USDT transfer into a DeFi protocol like Aave is often considered a neutral to slightly bullish sign. It indicates that a whale is positioning capital for potential yield generation or future investments within the crypto ecosystem, rather than cashing out. Q4: How can I track similar large transactions? A4: Services like Whale Alert, which reported this transaction, specialize in tracking significant movements of cryptocurrency across various blockchains and exchanges. Many crypto analytics platforms also offer similar features. Q5: What are the risks of moving such a large amount of USDT to Aave? A5: While Aave is a robust protocol, risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss (if the funds are then used in liquidity pools with volatile assets), and general market risks if the borrowed assets decline in value. Q6: Does this transfer affect HTX’s operations? A6: While $410 million is a large sum, HTX processes billions in volume daily. This outflow is unlikely to significantly impact HTX’s overall operations or liquidity, but it does highlight the ongoing shift of capital between CEX and DeFi platforms.

The recent revelations surrounding Amazon AGI Labs and its chief, David Luan, offer a fascinating glimpse into the high-stakes pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the innovative strategies employed to get there. For those monitoring the intersection of big tech and decentralized innovation, understanding these foundational shifts in AI development is crucial. How will Amazon’s approach to talent acquisition and groundbreaking research impact the broader digital economy and potentially even future blockchain applications? Amazon AGI Labs: A New Frontier in AI Development Amazon’s venture into the realm of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) marks a significant chapter in the ongoing AI revolution. With the establishment of Amazon AGI Labs , the tech behemoth signals its serious commitment to pushing the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve. At the helm of this ambitious undertaking is David Luan, a figure well-known in the AI community for his work as co-founder and former CEO of the AI startup Adept. His leadership at Amazon’s dedicated AGI division underscores the company’s intent to consolidate top-tier talent and resources for this monumental challenge. The creation of a specialized lab for AGI highlights a growing trend among leading technology companies: the recognition that achieving human-level or superhuman AI requires not just incremental improvements, but a concerted, focused effort backed by immense capital and intellectual power. Amazon’s strategic move places it firmly in the race to develop the next generation of intelligent systems, promising advancements that could redefine industries from logistics and healthcare to finance and entertainment. Decoding the Reverse Acquihires Phenomenon One of the most intriguing aspects of Amazon’s strategy for its AGI Labs is its reliance on what has become known as a ‘reverse acquihire.’ This unconventional deal structure differs significantly from traditional mergers and acquisitions. Instead of acquiring an entire startup outright, a large company like Amazon hires key team members – often the founders and core engineers – and simultaneously licenses the startup’s existing technology. This approach offers distinct advantages for both parties involved. For the acquiring company, a reverse acquihire can be a more agile and cost-effective way to integrate specialized talent and intellectual property without the complexities, liabilities, and cultural integration challenges associated with a full acquisition. It allows for a surgical strike to gain specific expertise and technology. For the startup founders and team, it provides access to unparalleled resources, computational power, and a vast infrastructure that might be impossible to build independently. It also often comes with a significant financial incentive and the opportunity to work on projects at a scale previously unimaginable. Traditional Acquisition vs. Reverse Acquihires: A Comparison To better understand the implications, let’s look at how these two approaches stack up: Feature Traditional Acquisition Reverse Acquihires Primary Goal Full ownership of company, assets, and team Acquisition of key talent and technology license Complexity High (legal, financial, cultural integration) Lower (focus on talent contracts, tech licensing) Cost Typically higher (full company valuation) Potentially lower (talent salaries, licensing fees) Risk Higher (integration failures, cultural clashes) Lower (more focused integration of specific talent) Startup’s Fate Absorbed or shut down Often continues independently or winds down operations Talent Focus All employees integrated Specific, critical team members recruited David Luan’s Vision for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) David Luan , the new head of Amazon AGI Labs, has been candid about his motivations for embracing this strategic shift. In a recent interview, he expressed a desire to be remembered as an ‘AI research innovator’ rather than a ‘deal structure innovator.’ This statement provides insight into his profound commitment to advancing the core science of AI. His decision to leave Adept, a promising startup, for Amazon was driven by a clear understanding of the resources required to tackle the most challenging problems in AI. Luan articulated that his previous venture, Adept, was on a path to becoming ‘an enterprise company that only sells small models.’ While commercially viable, this trajectory did not align with his ultimate ambition: to solve ‘the four crucial remaining research problems left to AGI.’ This highlights a critical distinction between developing specialized AI applications for specific business needs and pursuing the foundational research necessary for true general intelligence. For Luan, the opportunity at Amazon represents a unique platform to dedicate himself to these grand challenges, unencumbered by the typical pressures of a startup’s commercialization path. The Evolving Landscape for AI Startups The rise of the reverse acquihire model and the immense resource requirements for AGI research present both challenges and opportunities for the broader ecosystem of AI startups . On one hand, it underscores the difficulty for smaller entities to compete with tech giants in areas requiring massive computational power and extensive research teams. Startups aiming for foundational AGI research might find themselves at a disadvantage, as the ‘two-digit billion-dollar clusters’ needed are simply beyond their reach. On the other hand, this trend could lead to a more specialized startup landscape. Startups might focus on developing niche AI applications, innovative algorithms that are less compute-intensive, or specific components that can be licensed or integrated into larger platforms. It could also encourage a greater emphasis on novel intellectual property and efficient model architectures. Venture capitalists might adjust their investment strategies, favoring startups with clear paths to profitability through specialized products or those that could become attractive reverse acquihire targets for larger players. Why Scale Matters: The Billion-Dollar Compute Challenge Luan’s assertion that solving the remaining AGI problems will ‘require two-digit billion-dollar clusters to go run it’ is a stark reminder of the unprecedented scale of resources needed for this frontier research. This isn’t just about powerful servers; it encompasses massive data centers, specialized AI accelerators (like GPUs and custom ASICs), sophisticated cooling systems, and an enormous energy footprint. Such infrastructure costs are prohibitive for all but the wealthiest corporations and national initiatives. The sheer computational demands for training and running advanced AGI models mean that the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence is inherently centralized. This concentration of power raises questions about access, control, and the potential for a few entities to shape the future of AI. It also emphasizes why a strategic partnership like a reverse acquihire, which grants immediate access to such infrastructure, becomes ‘perfectly rational’ from the perspective of a researcher like David Luan. Beyond the Deal: Measuring True Innovation While the ‘reverse acquihire’ strategy is a fascinating business innovation, David Luan’s ultimate aspiration remains firmly rooted in scientific advancement. His desire to be remembered as an AI research innovator rather than a deal structure innovator speaks volumes about the ethos driving this monumental effort. The success of Amazon AGI Labs will ultimately be measured not by the cleverness of its talent acquisition methods, but by its tangible contributions to the understanding and development of Artificial General Intelligence. The journey towards AGI is fraught with technical, ethical, and philosophical challenges. It demands not only immense computational resources but also a deep commitment to fundamental research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and responsible development. As Amazon, under Luan’s leadership, dedicates itself to these profound questions, the entire tech world will be watching to see how this strategic consolidation of talent and compute power translates into breakthroughs that benefit humanity. Compelling Summary Amazon’s strategic embrace of the ‘reverse acquihire’ model, spearheaded by David Luan at Amazon AGI Labs , represents a bold and pragmatic approach to accelerating the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence. This innovative strategy allows tech giants to rapidly acquire critical talent and technology, while offering top AI researchers like Luan the unprecedented resources required to tackle the most complex problems in AI. As the landscape for AI startups continues to evolve, the need for ‘two-digit billion-dollar clusters’ underscores the increasing centralization of foundational AI research. Ultimately, the success of this endeavor will hinge on groundbreaking innovation, not just clever deal-making, promising a future where advanced AI could redefine our world. This strategic move highlights the intense competition and significant investments being made to unlock the next era of intelligent systems, impacting everything from enterprise solutions to the underlying technologies that power decentralized networks.

50559254,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/big-banks-about-to-move-on-crypto-here-is-why-ripple-is-the-big-winner/,1755981000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50559254.jpeg,Big Banks About to Move on crypto – Here is Why Ripple is The Big Winner,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/big-banks-about-to-move-on-crypto-here-is-why-ripple-is-the-big-winner/,"Ripple is no longer just a blockchain experiment; it is quickly becoming a cornerstone of modern banking infrastructure. Over 300 banks now use RippleNet to send money across borders, and it handles billions of dollars in deals very quickly. Reports say that big buyers from around the world spent more than 7.1 billion dollars buying XRP in the second quarter of 2025. This shows that banks and other payment facilities are becoming more interested in it. However, with institutional capital settling on big fish like XRP, retail investors and liquid funds tend to feed into less competitive and high-potential projects. That dynamic has recently brought MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight, as conversations among analysts highlight it as a next-generation contender positioned at the opposite end of the spectrum—small enough to multiply rapidly, yet structured enough to capture long-term narratives. Why banks are betting on Ripple Global institutions such as Santander, SBI Holdings, and PNC Bank have already deployed Ripple-powered platforms. Santander’s “One Pay FX” app allows near-instant global transfers, while SBI Remit leverages XRP’s On-Demand Liquidity for Asian remittances. These real-world use cases are no longer theoretical—they are live, regulated banking solutions used by millions of customers. This momentum has been strengthened by regulator certainty. The record-breaking settlement with the SEC had formally declared that XRP was not a security in secondary markets. That law change has already prompted the re-listing of XRP on U.S. exchanges and an uptick in the hopes about spot XRP ETFs . The removal of regulatory roadblocks has provided banks and asset managers with a clear runway on which to integrate the solutions that Ripple offers at scale. Ripple is growing in the U.S. as well. Ripple is seeking a bank charter and enrollment in a Federal Reserve system of master accounts, institutionalizing itself, in other words, as a part of the existing financial system. This desire explains why banks are finding their way to Ripple: they desire cryptocurrency tech that can scale within compliance. Banks care more about understanding Ripple utility and compliance, but on the retail investor side there is interest around the next big story. In that regard, MAGACOIN FINANCE is outstanding. It is marketed as culturally relevant, combining scarcity mechanisms with an audited and capped supply model, which attracts traders seeking asymmetric payoffs. Analysts suggest MAGACOIN’s trajectory mirrors that of early-stage meme tokens that later gained mainstream traction. However, unlike many short-lived experiments, MAGACOIN comes with strategic expansion plans, audited credibility, and a rapidly growing early community.This mixture has attracted interests in its presale stages, with the entry costs compounded to be low as compared to the futuristic estimates. Since institutions might lose a lot of money if they miss out on XRP, MAGACOIN is a very different but hopefully just as profitable way to get involved in the changing crypto world of 2025. Even models that try to predict the future show that a huge 25x growth may be possible as adoption and liquidity grow. XRP sets the rails, MAGACOIN rides the narrative The fact that banks are using XRP gives crypto legitimacy and makes sure that regulatory systems include digital assets instead of leaving them out. In the long run, this has effects: when institutions approve crypto, investors often want smaller tokens more. MAGACOIN Finance could benefit from that renewed appetite. In the past, altcoins that are culturally relevant have gained retail traction as soon as the market atmosphere gets positive. XRP could end up being the foundation of institutional settlement, but it is tokens like MAGACOIN that get the trader attention and the liquidity they seek to have explosive upside. The timing is opportune; as Ripple establishes itself in the banking space, MAGACOIN establishes itself as the retail breakout in 2025. Conclusion: Banks fuel XRP, culture fuels MAGACOIN FINANCE XRP is the obvious choice of any institution, as it enjoys clarified regulation, financial incorporation, and global realization. Whereas XRP can be seen as a safe bet with modest returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the more adventurous project that can generate rocket-like levels of growth. Investors have known that the two are a fit pairing, as Ripple sets the tracks, and MAGACOIN steers the story. As forecasts predict up to 25x growth , MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking its place in the hall of fame of imperative altcoins to look out for in 2025. Banks are swiftly venturing into XRP, so retail players have their focus set on MAGACOIN as the ambitious representative whose currency is changing the culture.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has projected that Ethereum could surge to $20,000, citing strengthening market dynamics and favorable macro conditions. The bold forecast comes just as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell adopts a more dovish tone, indicating a possibility of future rate cuts. Ethereum Price Projected To Hit Five Figures Hayes has issued a bold Ethereum price forecast, predicting that the second-largest cryptocurrency could soar as high as $10,000 or even $20,000 before the end of the cycle. In a recent interview, the BitMEX co-founder dismissed the notion that Ethereum would need to retest the $3,000 level before making a move toward new highs, pointing instead to its previous rally above $4,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop For 2025? $175,000, According To SOL Strategies Boss Notably, Ethereum successfully confirmed support at $4,109 after a sharp surge earlier this month. As a result, crypto analysts like Donald Dean project that ETH could climb to $4,867—or even set a new all-time high near $5,706. As for Hayes, he revealed that he has already re-entered the market, buying back Ethereum after previously taking profits when the asset broke above $4,000. The BitMEX founder emphasized that once Ethereum clears its prior peak, the path upward would resemble “a gap of air,” with limited resistance until significantly higher valuations. This conviction, he argued, is reinforced by the fact that crypto-native firms are actively raising capital to allocate into ETH. According to Hayes, the ability of these firms to secure funding will only increase if Ethereum breaks into uncharted price territory. His projection of a $10,000 to $20,000 price point is also tied to the political and economic backdrop in the US. The BitMEX co-founder suggested that any digital asset supported by US President Donald Trump would likely benefit from massive speculative inflows, thereby boosting the broader market. When asked which cryptocurrency he would primarily invest in between Ethereum and Solana, Hayes responded that both digital assets would appreciate during the bull run. However, he revealed that he was more partial to Ethereum, highlighting that the scale of capital chasing ETH made it a more attractive bet. Powell Speech Signals Softer Fed Policy Shift While speculations about Ethereum’s next price target, US monetary policy appears to be entering a pivotal phase. Recent reports following the Fed Chair’s speech at Jackson Hole indicate that Powell may be hinting at the possibility of a rate cut. During his speech, Powell highlighted the shifting balance of risks, acknowledging that while inflationary pressures persist, the slowdown in employment growth requires careful consideration. He further pointed to the effects of higher tariffs, which are beginning to show up in consumer prices, with core PCE inflation rising to 2.9% in July—a 10% increase from the previous month. Related Reading: Crypto Strategist Sounds The Alarm: Bitcoin Surge Could Clash With Fed Reserve Goals The Fed chair also reiterated that with policy already in restrictive territory, the central bank can “proceed carefully.” Nevertheless, his comments left the door open for an adjustment in stance, with markets widely interpreting them as laying the groundwork for a rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting.

While Bitcoin is expected to slow down in August, smart traders are turning to Ethereum and its Layer 2 newcomers. Leading this charge is Layer Brett, whose presale is gaining serious traction . Close to $1 million has already been accumulated in a matter of weeks. With a unique blend of meme coin energy and real blockchain utility, analysts say LBRETT could outperform Bitcoin and the general market this month. The staking APY once soared above 25,000 percent and, as more investors join, it’s dropping fast—fueling a frenzy to lock in gains before the presale closes. Tokens are priced at a mere $0.0047, at the time of writing. Layer Brett leverages Ethereum Layer 2 technology, delivering DeFi capabilities, lightning-fast transactions, and ultra-low gas fees. Experts predict this is why Layer Brett stands out, with growth potential that could see it rise 200x, drawing the attention of both DeFi and altcoin enthusiasts. Bitcoin price: Why August could bring a pause before the next run Bitcoin (BTC) remains the benchmark for the entire crypto market, but technicals suggest a cooling-off period is imminent. After hitting a new all-time high of $124,128, the Bitcoin price now sits below $113,000. Technical indicators back the flat forecast: the Bitcoin 50 EMA is flattening, MACD shows declining momentum, and the RSI hovers at 53, signaling neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Analysts agree that without a major catalyst, BTC may consolidate through August, leaving room for Ethereum and Layer 2 crypto projects to capture the spotlight. While competitor coins continue to jostle for dominance. Their recent price action suggests volatility without clear upward momentum, making innovative projects like Layer Brett even more appealing. Ethereum’s surge powers Layer 2 and Layer Brett demand Ethereum (ETH) is on a tear, recently trading over $4,200. The buzz around spot Ethereum ETFs, network upgrades, and institutional adoption all drive this momentum. As ETH strengthens, so do its Layer 2 ecosystems—especially the likes of Layer Brett. The ability to buy and stake LBRETT from its official website using ETH among other coins via MetaMask or Trust Wallet, has made Layer Brett the talk of the crypto bull run of 2025. Why could Layer Brett outpace the OG crypto, Bitcoin? Layer Brett (LBRETT) is showing exponential potential as its presale draws record interest. Traders are flocking to this next-gen ERC-20 token for several reasons. LBRETT is built on Layer 2 Ethereum for high-speed, low-cost transactions, secured by the most trusted smart contract blockchain.

Unlike BTC, LBRETT has real utility, offering genuine value in DeFi and Web3. Participation requires no KYC and gives full decentralization and self-custody. Plus, a $1 million giveaway and active community campaigns add to the excitement of the presale. The race to join has caused the presale stages to advance faster than the project team expected. While Bitcoin struggles, the smart money is moving to LBRETT As BTC trades sideways and ETH continues its climb, Layer Brett is emerging as the next big crypto. Its presale is filling up fast, its APY is still massive, and its Ethereum Layer 2 tech sets it apart from other coins. With its blend of meme power and real-world utility, LBRETT could be the top gainer crypto of 2025. Don’t wait—this crypto presale won’t last forever.

Monero price has support and resistance at $260 and $280, respectively. The Monero price analysis for August 23 shows further decline as XMR decays further towards the $230 support. Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR falls to $265 The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicates a mixed market sentiment as the altcoin observes a decrease of more than 18% of its value in the last 30 days as XMR fell from the $340 price level to the $230 mark. However, after reaching the $230 mark, the price rose sharply to the $280 level where it hovered for a while before ultimately crashing to $265 where it trades at press time. XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView The indicators reflect the increasing bearish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show rising selling pressure. The MACD is bullish at 2.7 units and shows rising bearish pressure at the current price level. The RSI also shares this sentiment as it declined to 45.04 level suggesting room for movement in either direction. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest higher volatility, indicating that the $260 support may hold for the week. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero was in a steady decline until finding strong bullish support at $230 that enabled a recovery to $265. Currently, the bulls seek to defend the $260 support but with rising bearish pressure price may continue to decline. XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView The RSI is at 50.26, suggesting neutral sentiment as the price falls back towards the $260 mark. The MACD, at -0.19, shows rising bearish momentum on the 4-hour charts.

XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a great start to this month as the price rose to the $360. However, the sharp crash to the $320 mark suggests strong bearish pressure. As such, the price fell below $300 as the bulls were unable to hold the level. Now the $260 acts as short-term support. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to fall towards the $260 mark after a breakdown from the current level. However, the bulls need to protect the $230 level and establish a foothold above the $280 level to initiate a recovery. On the other hand, a bearish breakout would mean a drop below the $200 level. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice . Why is XMR down today? The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero was in a steady decline until finding strong bullish support at $230 that enabled a recovery to $280 before crashing back towards the $265 mark. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current Monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

For those accustomed to the volatile yet potentially lucrative cryptocurrency markets, the idea of getting ‘in early’ on a groundbreaking company like OpenAI might sound like a dream come true. However, a recent and critical announcement from OpenAI itself serves as a stark SPV warning , cautioning against certain avenues for acquiring exposure to its equity. This isn’t just a corporate formality; it’s a vital heads-up for anyone considering high-stakes OpenAI investments through unofficial channels, particularly Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). Understanding the Rise of AI Startup Funding and SPVs The artificial intelligence sector has exploded, attracting billions in capital and creating a fervent demand for opportunities to invest in its leading players. Companies like OpenAI are at the forefront, driving advancements that promise to reshape industries globally. This immense interest has naturally led to a surge in AI startup funding , with venture capitalists and sophisticated investors clamoring for a piece of the pie. But what happens when direct investment channels are limited or restricted? Enter the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). An SPV is essentially a legal entity, often a limited partnership or LLC, created for a specific, often temporary, objective. In the context of venture capital, SPVs are frequently used to pool money from multiple investors to make a single, concentrated investment in a private company. They allow smaller investors to gain exposure to otherwise inaccessible deals, or for large investors to manage their stakes more efficiently. While SPVs have legitimate uses, their increasing deployment in the red-hot AI market has raised eyebrows and, more recently, prompted serious warnings from the very companies they aim to invest in. Why the Urgent OpenAI Warning? OpenAI’s recent blog post explicitly cautions against ‘unauthorized opportunities to gain exposure to OpenAI through a variety of means,’ with a particular focus on SPVs. The core of their concern lies in firms attempting to ‘circumvent our transfer restrictions.’ These restrictions are put in place for various reasons, including maintaining control over the shareholder base, ensuring compliance, and managing the company’s long-term strategic direction. When an SPV is formed to aggregate investor capital and then purchase shares from an existing shareholder without the company’s explicit approval or in violation of pre-agreed transfer clauses, it creates a significant problem. OpenAI is unambiguous in its stance: ‘If so, the sale will not be recognized and carry no economic value to you.’ This is a critical detail that potential investors must grasp. An investment that isn’t recognized by the company whose equity you supposedly own is, in essence, worthless from a legal and economic standpoint vis-à-vis the company itself. You might have a contract with the SPV, but if that SPV’s underlying claim to OpenAI equity is invalid, your investment is built on shaky ground. This highlights the inherent dangers of engaging in transactions involving unauthorized equity . Key Reasons Behind OpenAI’s Stance: Circumvention of Transfer Restrictions: OpenAI, like many private companies, has strict rules governing who can own its shares and how those shares can be transferred. SPVs can be used to bypass these rules, leading to an opaque and potentially undesirable shareholder structure. Lack of Recognition: If a sale is unauthorized, OpenAI will not recognize the SPV or its investors as legitimate shareholders. This means no voting rights, no access to company information, and no economic benefit from future company events like dividends or IPOs. Investor Protection: The warning also serves to protect unsuspecting investors who might be lured by the promise of high returns without understanding the underlying risks and legal invalidity of their ‘investment.’ Maintaining Control: By controlling its shareholder base, OpenAI can better manage its governance, strategic partnerships, and future funding rounds without interference from unrecognized parties. The Broader Impact on Venture Capital AI and Investor Sentiment OpenAI’s warning is not an isolated incident. The article notes that other major AI companies, such as Anthropic, are also cracking down on SPVs. Anthropic reportedly told Menlo Ventures to use its own capital, not an SPV, for an upcoming investment round. This signals a growing trend among prominent AI innovators to exert tighter control over their investor base and capital structure. What Does This Mean for Venture Capital AI ? This development could significantly reshape how private investments in leading AI companies are conducted. For traditional venture capital firms, it reinforces the importance of direct relationships and adherence to company policies. For individual investors, it underscores the need for extreme caution and thorough due diligence. The term ‘tourist chumps’ used by some VCs to describe investors using SPVs highlights a perception that these vehicles are sometimes utilized by less sophisticated investors seeking to jump on a hot trend without fully understanding the nuances of private equity markets. While harsh, the sentiment reflects a concern within the industry about the integrity and transparency of investment processes, especially when it comes to highly sought-after assets like stakes in OpenAI. Authorized vs. Unauthorized OpenAI Investment Paths Feature Authorized Investment (e.g., Direct VC, Approved Secondary) Unauthorized Investment (e.g., Unapproved SPV) Company Recognition Yes, recognized as a legitimate shareholder. No, the company will not recognize the investor or the SPV. Economic Value Carries economic value, potential for returns. Carries no economic value from the company’s perspective. Access to Information Potential for investor updates and reports. None, completely cut off from company communications. Voting Rights Typically, yes, as per share class. None. Legal Standing Strong legal standing as a shareholder. Weak to non-existent legal standing with the company. Actionable Insights for Navigating AI Investments Given OpenAI’s clear directive, what should potential investors, especially those new to private equity or tempted by ‘exclusive’ opportunities, do? 1. Due Diligence is Paramount: Always, always verify the legitimacy of any investment opportunity. If a firm purports to have access to OpenAI investments , ask for direct proof of authorization from OpenAI. Do not rely solely on the word of the firm or the SPV organizer. 2. Understand Transfer Restrictions: Private companies almost always have transfer restrictions on their shares. These are legally binding agreements. Any offer that seems to bypass these without explicit company approval should be a major red flag for unauthorized equity schemes. 3. Question the SPV Structure: While SPVs are not inherently bad, their use for circumventing company policies is. Inquire about the specific agreement between the SPV and the company, or the original shareholder. A legitimate SPV would likely have company approval or be structured in a way that respects existing transfer restrictions. 4. Consult Legal and Financial Advisors: Before committing significant capital, especially into private markets, seek advice from independent legal and financial professionals who specialize in venture capital and private equity. They can help you understand the risks and verify the legitimacy of the offer. 5. Be Wary of ‘Too Good to Be True’ Offers: The promise of easy access to highly coveted shares in a company like OpenAI should trigger skepticism. If an opportunity seems unusually simple or exclusive, it’s often for a reason that benefits the seller more than the buyer. The Future Landscape of AI Startup Funding This SPV warning from OpenAI and similar moves by other AI giants could lead to a more regulated and transparent secondary market for private company shares. It reinforces the power of the issuing company to dictate who can own its equity and under what terms. For the broader AI startup funding ecosystem, this might mean a renewed focus on traditional venture capital channels, direct investments, and officially sanctioned secondary market transactions. The message is clear: while the desire to participate in the growth of AI is understandable, the path to legitimate investment must adhere to the rules set by the companies themselves. Bypassing these rules not only puts your capital at risk but also undermines the integrity of the private investment landscape. Conclusion: Navigating the Complexities of OpenAI Investments OpenAI’s explicit warning against unauthorized investments, particularly through certain SPV structures, is a crucial development for anyone looking to gain exposure to the burgeoning AI sector. It serves as a powerful reminder that not all opportunities are created equal, and some can carry significant, unstated risks. For investors, the key takeaway is the absolute necessity of due diligence, understanding the legal frameworks governing private equity, and ensuring that any investment in a company like OpenAI is fully recognized and sanctioned by the company itself. Failing to heed this warning could lead to substantial financial losses and a frustrating realization that your ‘investment’ holds no real economic value. In the exciting but complex world of AI, vigilance remains your most valuable asset.

The search for the “next Ripple” is a constant theme in the crypto market, and analysts are now pointing to a new contender: Ruvi AI (RUVI). Following a strategic CoinMarketCap listing that sparked million-dollar daily sales, this audited AI token is showing the same early signs of institutional appeal and explosive growth that defined XRP’s rise. CMC Listing Unlocks Institutional-Level Demand The partnership with CoinMarketCap was the pivotal event that put Ruvi AI on the radar of serious capital. By featuring RUVI prominently, CMC gave the project direct exposure to the institutional investors and trading firms that fueled Ripple’s initial ascent. The response was immediate and overwhelming, with daily sales volumes surging into the millions. This explosive demand is reflected in the presale’s key milestones: $3.1M raised with remarkable speed. 240M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global community. Holder base now exceeds 3,000 members . Phase 2 is over 90% complete , signaling an imminent price increase. This isn’t just retail hype; it’s the kind of strategic, high-volume participation that indicates smart money is taking a serious position, much like they did with XRP in its early days. A Super App Powering a Multi-Billion Dollar Industry Like Ripple, which solved problems in the financial sector, Ruvi AI is built on a foundation of real-world utility. Its focus is the booming creator economy, and its core offering is a powerful super app that streamlines the entire content creation workflow. The ecosystem includes: Advanced Trend Research: Analytics tools that identify high-demand topics, helping creators produce content that connects with massive audiences. AI-Powered Script Generation: An AI engine that crafts channel-ready scripts optimized for platforms like YouTube and TikTok. Native Media Creation: Integrated image and video generators that remove the need for costly third-party software. Streamlined Workflows: Centralized tools for planning, editing, and scheduling that dramatically boost production efficiency. This powerful utility attracts a vast user base of YouTubers, marketers, and brands, creating sustainable, organic demand for the RUVI token. A Clear and Urgent Path to Growth Ruvi AI offers complete transparency in its presale pricing, creating a clear and urgent path for early investors: Current Price: $0.015 (Phase 2 is over 90% full) Phase 3 Launch: $0.020 (A programmed 33% price surge) Final Presale Price: $0.070 This transparent structure builds investor confidence and creates natural FOMO. The 33% price jump is guaranteed once the final tokens in Phase 2 are sold, rewarding those who act quickly. VIP Tiers: Your Fast Track to Substantial Gains RUVI’s VIP program is structured to reward significant early investments with massive token bonuses, offering a clear path to exceptional returns as the project gains traction: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, for a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, for a 13,233% ROI. An active leaderboard giveaway adds another competitive layer, further incentivizing participation before the next price increase. Infrastructure Built for Smart Money Ruvi AI provides the security and market access that institutional investors require: CyberScope Audit: A successful third-party audit verifies the security of the smart contracts, removing a major barrier for risk-averse investors. WEEX Exchange Partnership: A strategic alliance with a major exchange ensures deep liquidity and easy trading access for all token holders after the presale. The Window Is Closing With Phase 2 now over 90% complete, the opportunity to invest at the current price of $0.015 is disappearing quickly. The imminent 33% price surge is just the first step. The combination of institutional attention, a successful audit, a top-tier exchange partnership, and undeniable utility gives Ruvi AI a credible shot at becoming the next Ripple. For those who missed XRP’s historic run, this is a second chance.

Nearly three months have passed since the last Starship test. However, the achievement did not last. The upper part of the rocket broke apart as it came back through the atmosphere, and the booster blew up over the Gulf of Mexico during the landing. A few weeks on, the troubles didn’t let up. During a static-fire test, the vehicle slated for Flight 10 erupted in an explosion that wrecked its test stand and left SpaceX scrambling to slot in a replacement upper stage for the mission. The FAA has wrapped up its probe into the Flight 9 mishap, clearing a major obstacle and giving the company the green light to press forward with its next launch. SpaceX’s back-to-back losses have lifted the stakes. SpaceX often describes its playbook as “build-fly-fix-repeat.” Each Starship launch produces data that engineers feed back into design and operations. Still, the repeated loss of the Ship in flight has sharpened questions about when the massive rocket will carry payloads for paying customers and for NASA. The company’s pace has been striking since the first Starship flight in April 2023. In May, SpaceX made history by reflighting a booster, showing that rapid reuse is within reach. Bringing the upper stage home, then landing it for reuse, the end goal, remains unfinished work. In a filing submitted to Texas regulators this January, SpaceX disclosed that it has poured over $7.5 billion worth of investment in Starbase and the broader Starship program. The spending is not limited to Texas. The company recently informed Florida’s governor that it intends to invest an additional $1.8 billion to develop Starship launch facilities. NASA is counting on Starship to deliver for its own timelines SpaceX holds 2 contracts valued at $4 billion for the development of a Starship variant called the ‘Human Landing System’, which is intended to return astronauts to the moon as part of Artemis. The mission targeted for that capability, Artemis III, is scheduled for 2027. Hitting that date will require more than successful launches and reentries. SpaceX still has to validate the Ship’s reusable heat shield, carry out cryogenic propellant transfers in low Earth orbit, and ultimately land Starship on the lunar surface. Any one of those steps would be a first, but SpaceX needs to complete them all. Bloomberg reported that the company reassigned a large number of engineers from the Falcon 9 project to Starship to push through the heavy-lift rocket’s open issues. Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built. The stacked vehicle stands nearly 400 feet tall. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Ruvi AI (RUVI) Needs Only $2,000 as CMC Partnership Fuels One of the Fastest Paced Presales",https://timestabloid.com/want-6-figures-fast-ruvi-ai-ruvi-needs-only-2000-as-cmc/,"The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with a rare opportunity that has analysts and investors taking notice. Ruvi AI (RUVI), an audited AI token, is demonstrating explosive growth, fueling speculation that a modest $2,000 investment could rapidly grow into a six-figure portfolio. This surge is powered by a strategic CoinMarketCap partnership that has turned its presale into one of the fastest-paced events of the year, creating a perfect storm for potentially life-changing returns. CoinMarketCap Partnership Ignites Unprecedented Momentum The collaboration with CoinMarketCap has propelled Ruvi AI from a promising project into a top-trending phenomenon. This premium listing has unlocked access to institutional capital, resulting in a presale velocity that has captured the market’s attention. The results of this strategic move are clear: $3.1M raised with remarkable speed across all presale phases. 240M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global community. A holder base exceeding 3,000 members and growing exponentially. Phase 2 is now over 90% complete , signaling an imminent and guaranteed price increase. This is not just retail excitement; it is the kind of strategic accumulation from informed investors that often precedes a major market rally. The high demand indicates strong confidence in RUVI’s potential to deliver returns that far outpace the broader market. The Path from $2,000 to Six Figures Ruvi AI’s presale structure provides a clear and transparent path for substantial growth. A $2,000 investment at the current Phase 2 price of $0.015 would secure approximately 133,333 RUVI tokens. If RUVI reaches the $1 valuation that many analysts believe is possible, that initial investment would be worth over $133,000, representing a remarkable 6,566% ROI . This journey is supported by a pre-defined price progression that rewards early participants: Current Price: $0.015 (with Phase 2 over 90% sold). Phase 3 Launch Price: $0.020 (a guaranteed 33% surge ). Final Presale Price: $0.070. The impending 33% price jump is a certainty once the final tokens in Phase 2 are claimed, offering immediate gains and building momentum for future growth. Credibility and Utility: The Foundation for Growth Predictions of such high returns are backed by a solid foundation of security and real-world application. Ruvi AI has successfully completed a comprehensive third-party audit by CyberScope, confirming its smart contracts meet institutional-grade security standards. This audit provides the credibility needed for sustained investor confidence. Furthermore, RUVI is positioned within the massive $104 billion creator economy . Its core offering is a powerful super app designed to provide content creators with professional tools, including: Advanced Trend Research: AI-powered analytics to identify viral topics. AI Script Generation: A tool to create compelling, platform-optimized scripts. Native Media Creation: Integrated image and video generators to reduce costs. Streamlined Workflows: Centralized tools for planning and scheduling content. This tangible utility creates organic, sustainable demand for the RUVI token, providing a strong value proposition that supports its ambitious growth targets. VIP Tiers: An Accelerated Route to Wealth For those looking to maximize their potential returns, RUVI’s VIP program offers substantial token bonuses on larger investments: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI. A competitive leaderboard giveaway also provides an added layer of incentive for top contributors. Seizing a Rare Opportunity To ensure a smooth transition to public trading, Ruvi AI has also secured a strategic partnership with WEEX, a major cryptocurrency exchange. This alliance guarantees deep liquidity and simplified trading for all token holders. With Phase 2 over 90% complete, the window to invest at the current price of $0.015 is closing fast. The combination of a fast-paced presale, a strategic CMC partnership, and strong fundamentals suggests that Ruvi AI presents a rare opportunity to turn a small investment into a six-figure return.

According to its latest X post, six asset managers have filed amendments to their XRP ETF proposals, while Grayscale has submitted a fresh application for the Grayscale XRP Trust. With the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) set to deliver key rulings in October 2025, the filings mark a pivotal moment for XRP’s path toward mainstream adoption. Six Asset Managers Targeting Spot XRP ETFs The six firms amending their applications are Bitwise, Canary Capital, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and WisdomTree. Each is already active in the digital asset investment space, and their coordinated filings highlight growing institutional interest in bringing a regulated XRP ETF to U.S. markets. LATEST: Six asset managers just filed amendments for their XRP ETFs, while Grayscale submitted a fresh application. The SEC decides in October on XRP’s first ETF approval. pic.twitter.com/KQ0hVKO1p7 — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) August 23, 2025 The timing is significant. These updates, filed in late August 2025, reflect strategic alignment with SEC expectations, showing that issuers are refining their proposals in anticipation of the SEC XRP decision in October. What Changed in the Filings? The amended S-1 registration statements include important structural changes that mirror the design of already approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Updates include: Provisions for both in-kind and cash creations and redemptions. Reinforced custody arrangements for secure XRP storage. Enhanced market surveillance and governance mechanisms. By addressing these elements, asset managers are directly responding to SEC concerns that have historically delayed crypto ETF approvals. These refinements position the funds as more compliant with regulatory standards, increasing the likelihood of approval. Grayscale Enters with a Fresh XRP Trust Application Adding weight to the momentum, Grayscale Investments filed a new Form S-1 for its Grayscale XRP Trust . Grayscale, the largest digital asset manager in the world, has already led the charge in transforming its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF and is now seeking to replicate that success with XRP. This move underscores Grayscale’s confidence in the SEC’s eventual approval of an XRP spot ETF and signals that institutional demand for regulated XRP exposure is accelerating. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 October 2025: The Crucial Decision Window The SEC has extended review periods on these proposals, setting final deadlines between October 18 and October 23, 2025. These decision dates are critical for the crypto industry, as approval would mean the first-ever regulated XRP ETF in the U.S. Such approval would grant institutional and retail investors a secure, regulated pathway to invest in XRP without directly holding the token. Analysts suggest this could trigger substantial inflows into the asset, potentially reshaping XRP’s market trajectory. What This Means for XRP Investors The clustered filings and Grayscale’s entry reflect a turning point in XRP’s regulatory journey. Optimism is building in markets, with analysts noting that the SEC XRP ETF decision in October 2025 could unlock new levels of liquidity and mainstream adoption. Still, caution remains. While filings demonstrate significant progress, the SEC’s ultimate stance will hinge on the adequacy of custody safeguards, liquidity mechanisms, and market surveillance. Coin Bureau’s report highlights just how high the stakes are: six asset managers and one industry giant are betting that XRP’s time on Wall Street has come. The coming October decision will determine whether that bet pays off. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Dogecoin, PEPE, and Shiba Inu remain strong names, but a new project is gaining more attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become the meme coin people are talking about due to its audits, community backing, and fast-growing presale. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin rebounded this week following a weak start. The coin decreased to $0.21, but whales took advantage, taking hold of approximately 680 million DOGE in August. Trade volume skyrocketed towards the end and resulted in the price climbing back up towards the end of the week to around $0.22. Technical traders are now closely watching —if DOGE can flip $0.22 into support, a move toward $0.23–$0.24 looks possible. The bigger question is whether the recovery will be sustainable since the issue of Qubic being potentially under a 51% attack remains concerning. Whales are currently betting on DOGE to keep the mantle of being the largest meme coin in market size. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE remains among the most notable meme tokens. Constructed around nostalgia and internet culture, it had found its niche in the market and still managed to garner interest. The coin has been falling along with the rest of the market but has managed to stay afloat in regard to liquidity and market cap. It is viewed as a more stable meme coin by many traders. Should meme coin hype re-emerge later in 2025, PEPE will be capable of moving to new heights. This is the reason why many long-term investors are currently hoarding more PEPE. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu has been experiencing pressure, as it dropped by 9% in the last week. It has a market capitalization of $7.3 billion, well below its December high of $20 billion. Nevertheless, there are also some indications that a recovery might be near. Netflows through exchanges were also negative, indicating that investors are shifting out of centralized platforms and holding SHIB in their own wallets. That move reduces the immediate selling risk. At the beginning of 2025, there were 140.7 trillion SHIB on exchanges, but at the time of this writing, the number has dropped to approximately 85.2 trillion. Shibarium is also picking up again. Daily transactions hit 4.8 million on August 20—the highest since February. Because each transaction burns tokens, increased activity could give SHIB a lift if adoption continues. MAGACOIN FINANCE—The Best Meme Coin Presale to Watch MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called the meme coin to watch in 2025. The project has undergone a thorough and comprehensive audit process as part of its efforts to build credibility and transparency. It successfully passed a full smart contract audit by HashEx—a respected blockchain security firm known for vetting DeFi projects. This reaffirmed the security of its code, validated tokenomics, and revealed no undisclosed backdoors. In addition, MAGACOIN FINANCE has also passed a second audit with CertiK, further demonstrating its dedication to investor security. Having already secured $12.8 million , and just shy of the $13 million capital target, analysts are projecting a future exchange listing and a 60x growth estimate . Such a combination makes people refer to it as the best crypto presale to buy now. Final Thoughts Dogecoin, PEPE, and Shiba Inu still hold strong places in the meme coin market. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is building something different with its completed audits, growing community, and strong presale traction. If the market continues heating up in 2025, MAGA could be the meme coin that actually delivers on the hype.

This technological edge positions ETH not just as a competitor to BTC, but as the platform that could lead the next phase of the crypto revolution. Many Developers Choose Ethereum Over Bitcoin Bitcoin is powerful as a store of value, but Ethereum is where real technological innovation resides. According to BitDigital_BTBT’s post on X, Bitcoin can’t tokenize equities, issue stablecoins, or host complex decentralized applications , which is why companies like Robinhood are leaning on ETH to tokenize stocks. This is not a matter of preference, but because BTC simply lacks the capability. The more developer activity that flows into ETH, the stronger and more resilient its network becomes. It is worth noting that this compounding effect is making waves, as some of the brightest engineers, builders, and innovators in crypto are zeroing in on ETH. Presently, institutions are following suit, and Blue-chip players from asset managers to fintech leaders are going all in on ETH because they recognize that it represents an infrastructure layer for the future of finance. As companies are turning to ETH to tokenize stocks, crypto analyst BOB has revealed that liquid staking has hit a record of $86 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) last week, a milestone that underscores the market’s growing interest in yield maximization. This shows only a tiny fraction of the contribution by BTC LSTs. Currently, only 0.3% of the BTC supply is being used in DeFi, compared to Ethereum, where nearly 30% of its supply is staked and actively generating yield. This disparity represents an over 100x gap. At today’s prices, the analyst highlighted that this gap is equivalent to $750 billion opportunity for BTC. The infrastructure is only just emerging, and the new $86 million is just the warm-up. Why Ethereum Matters Beyond Bitcoin Ethereum just hit a new all-time high, its first in nearly four years, underscoring a renewed wave of momentum in the crypto markets. While being the second-largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, analyst Holger Zschaepitz has noted that the growing adoption of stablecoins is fueling the ongoing ETH rally, the majority of which run on the Ethereum blockchain. This development is driving demand for network capacity and transaction fees. Beyond its price action, Ethereum is now being considered as the backbone of the decentralized economy.

Recent wallet tracking has spotlighted significant interest in Layer 2 and memecoin innovations, especially with the presale buzz around Layer Brett. As analysts predict $LBRETT could 100x from its presale price—currently just $0.0047—this project is capturing attention for scalability, low gas fees, and explosive staking. The combination of Ethereum Layer 2 speed with meme energy places Layer Brett at the center of crypto opportunities. Cardano: Institutional interest and governance upgrades Cardano remains a top-15 altcoin, holding strong with a current price near $0.86 and a market cap of $31.29 billion. Despite its all-time high of $3.10 in 2021, recent whale wallet tracking shows that large holders are still accumulating. Cardano’s push toward decentralized governance and institutional adoption, including possible ETF inclusion and partnerships in Brazil, keeps it relevant among top altcoins. Neutral RSI signal a market needing new momentum, leaving many investors considering trending cryptocurrencies such as Layer Brett and Solana. Solana: Ecosystem growth but Layer Brett draws FOMO Solana continues to impress with lightning-fast performance and a robust DeFi and NFT ecosystem. Its current price of $193.16 and a market cap exceeding $100 billion show strong institutional and developer interest. Major partnerships are also making Solana a favorite among whales tracking the next big crypto. Still, the hype around Layer Brett is intensifying, as investors note that Solana’s mature market cap may limit its potential for rapid 100x growth compared to low cap crypto gems like $LBRETT. With Layer Brett’s presale and staking APYs reaching staggering levels, it stands out as a best crypto to buy now in a market searching for the next meme-fueled breakout. Chainlink: Leading oracles, but Layer Brett’s staking rewards shine Chainlink, trading at $24.76 with a $16.79 billion market cap, remains the dominant decentralized oracle provider. Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and integrations with DeFi protocols keep it in the spotlight as a top DeFi token and a cornerstone for smart contracts. Whale wallet data shows ongoing accumulation, especially with Chainlink’s 27.71% monthly growth and expanding partnerships. Yet, when compared to Layer Brett, Chainlink’s growth appears steady rather than explosive. The prospect of staking rewards over 12,000% on Layer Brett, combined with its meme token energy and Layer 2 utility, has many calling it the best crypto to buy now. Layer Brett: The Ethereum Layer 2 meme project redefining presale opportunity Layer Brett is more than just a meme token; it is a full-fledged Ethereum Layer 2 solution engineered for speed, scalability, and community engagement. With a presale price of $0.0047, and staking APYs that have reached over 12,000%, early investors are positioned for huge gains. Layer Brett leverages low gas fees and off-chain processing to deliver near-instant transactions. The platform’s transparent tokenomics, no KYC, and $1 million giveaway add to its appeal in a landscape eager for the next 100x altcoin. Why Layer Brett could be the best crypto to buy now As whales pivot toward innovative Layer 2 projects, Layer Brett is quickly emerging as the best crypto to buy now for those seeking both community-driven fun and real blockchain utility. With its presale live, a max supply of 10 billion tokens, and staking rewards that dwarf returns from Cardano, Solana, and Chainlink, the window for early entry is closing fast. Don’t miss your chance to join the most scalable meme project on Ethereum before it launches—secure your $LBRETT today, stake for explosive rewards, and ride the next crypto bull run to new heights. Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

Yet, a growing number see Remittix as a more compelling play given its infrastructure and real-world utility, offering projections of 30× upside. Both tokens are on many watchlists, but for different types of investors. Dogecoin Could Rally to $1 on ETF Buzz Dogecoin is trading near $0.22, and renewed ETF filings like Grayscale’s DOGE Trust are driving speculation that Dogecoin could jump toward $1, marking over 300% gains. Chart patterns point to resistance clusters around $0.24 to $0.25, with a clean break potentially opening a path to $0.70 or even higher. ETF approval could deliver fresh institutional capital and rocket Dogecoin into the spotlight again. Remittix Poised for Far Bigger Gains Against that backdrop, Remittix offers an alternative driven by product and traction, not meme appeal. Over 614 million tokens have been sold at $0.0969, raising more than $20.7 million, and its BitMart CEX listing is complete. Once Remittix hits $22 million, a second listing is expected, which many see as the next catalyst. Analysts estimate Remittix could deliver 30× returns in the near term, with longer-term forecasts suggesting 35× to 100× potential by 2026. Pairing infrastructure, a Q3 wallet beta launch, and a $250,000 community giveaway, the project offers tangible reasons for the hype. Here is what makes Remittix resonate in conversation more than Dogecoin right now: Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Built for adoption, not speculation Wallet beta launches this quarter (Q3 2025) Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency These elements give Remittix structural advantages that meme-driven momentum tokens like Dogecoin lack. Utility vs Hype Dogecoin remains a cultural anchor with potential for quick gains if ETF confirmation triggers fresh buying. That said, its future beyond meme cycles remains uncertain. Remittix , by contrast, is gaining traction as a payments utility token with delivery-focused progress. For those balancing chart momentum with execution, Remittix represents a rare blend: functional innovation paired with high upside potential. If your goal is short-term speculative gains, Dogecoin may deliver. For asymmetrical returns tied to substance and roadmap, Remittix appears to offer a more compelling path forward.

That’s what Morgan Stanley is warning this week in a new report led by strategist Ariana Salvatore, as stocks continue to rise even while key economic signals weaken. As of press time, the S&P 500 has climbed nearly 10% since January, the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 11%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is ahead by over 7%. But under the surface, things aren’t looking so great. The report points to Donald Trump’s return to the White House and a wave of new policies; some rushed, some recycled. He’s extended tax cuts from his first term, added new tariffs, and placed tighter limits on immigration. The changes have brought concern across Wall Street, especially around how they’ll impact consumer spending. At the same time, job growth is slowing and inflation is still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Trump’s policies hit sectors unevenly Ariana’s team at Morgan Stanley believes the gap between economic health and market strength comes down to how different industries are affected by Trump’s actions. Some are hurting, but others are thriving, and the ones doing well have more weight in the index. That’s what’s keeping the broader market up. “Tariffs are a clear headwind to margins for certain industries,” Ariana explained, “but the overall market cap weight of these groups is limited.” The negative impacts, tariffs, and immigration rules, are mostly falling on smaller sectors that don’t drive much of the S&P 500’s value. At the same time, sectors benefiting from tax breaks and deregulation, like tech and industrials, are spread more widely across the index. “In short,” Ariana added , “the negative impacts are concentrated in sectors that do not represent a significant portion of S&P market cap, while the tailwinds are more dispersed among a broader cohort that drives index-level performance.” This uneven outcome means Wall Street is looking at things on a sector-by-sector and even company-by-company basis. They’re not treating the economy like one big picture. That’s why the market is moving up even as hiring slows and inflation holds firm. Ariana explained that the macro backdrop is getting weaker, but not enough to drag everything down or cause a recession. Stocks, in that setup, can still perform. One sector under pressure is consumer discretionary. These companies are getting hit hardest by Trump’s tariffs and immigration rules. They rely on cheaper goods and labor, both of which are becoming harder to find or more expensive. Meanwhile, industrials and semiconductors are still holding strong. Artificial intelligence is playing a big role here, pushing up demand and keeping those sectors steady. Even with volatility in Trump’s trade policies, fundamentals in those industries remain intact. Healthcare falters, Fed hints rate cuts coming But healthcare? That’s where things look ugly. Eric Teal, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management, said the sector is facing more than just a bad quarter. “Although the on-again-off-again tariff policies on the surface appear volatile,” Eric said, “the economy is in the middle of an expansion and company fundamentals are solid with one notable exception, health care,” calling it an “existential threat to profit margins.” Healthcare firms are getting squeezed on costs, regulations, and pricing pressure, and investors are pulling back. Even big names are stumbling. Microsoft, Netflix, Walmart, and Apple all fell this past week, and the S&P 500 just clocked five straight days of losses through Thursday. It’s the longest losing streak in months. But Friday brought some relief. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole event and opened the door to potential interest rate cuts as soon as September. Still, some analysts think the pullback is just part of the cycle. Let’s see what time will prove.

With LINKBTC rebounding from an extreme oversold zone, LINK could be gearing up for its next move upwards. Bullish Daily Close For Chainlink And LINKBTC CryptoWzrd, expanding on his latest analysis, explained that both Chainlink and LINKBTC closed the day with bullish daily candles, a sign that momentum could be building in favor of buyers. This positive structure on higher time frames indicates that sentiment may be shifting after recent corrective moves. Related Reading: Chainlink Eyes Crucial Resistance After $25 Reclaim – Breakout Or Breakdown Next? According to the analyst, LINKBTC in particular needs to sustain this trend by printing additional bullish daily candles from its current position. Given that it has already bounced from an extreme oversold condition, the probability of follow-through strength remains elevated. A continued push from this zone could lay the foundation for further upside in LINK. With momentum gradually returning, CryptoWzrd suggested that Chainlink has the potential to challenge the $40 resistance in the coming days. On the way up, the analyst highlighted $30 as the next immediate resistance level. Based on current momentum, he believes this zone could be broken without much difficulty, provided bulls maintain their control. Meanwhile, on the downside, he pointed out $20 as the main daily support, a level that would need to hold to protect LINK’s broader bullish outlook. CryptoWzrd went on to note that his attention will remain on lower time frame chart setups tomorrow. By closely tracking intraday formations, he aims to identify quick scalp opportunities, while also keeping the broader daily structure in mind as Chainlink attempts to strengthen its bullish case. Jackson Hole Sparks Heavy Volatility On LINK Charts Giving his final verdict, CryptoWzrd highlighted that the intraday chart displayed extreme volatility, largely influenced by market reactions during the Jackson Hole Symposium. The sudden swings highlighted how sensitive the market has become to macroeconomic cues, leaving traders on high alert for short-term opportunities. According to his analysis, a potential pullback below $26.50 followed by a bullish reversal would provide a strong long setup, with targets extending toward $31 and possibly higher. Related Reading: Chainlink Tipped To Outshine XRP In Global Banking Links: Analyst However, CryptoWzrd cautioned that if Chainlink holds below the $26.50 mark without showing signs of recovery, the market could slip into more sideways volatility. Such conditions often frustrate traders, as momentum fades and clear directional setups become harder to identify. With the weekend approaching, the analyst’s expectations remain balanced and rational, acknowledging that lower liquidity conditions could also impact price movements.

Polygon, Aptos, and Dogecoin are experiencing new volumes, whereas Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche remain resilient. However, one name drawing smart money attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could deliver one of the biggest returns in this cycle . Polygon (MATIC) Polygon is a scaling solution on Ethereum, aimed at reducing Ethereum gas fees and the Ethereum block time. Its ecosystem is growing, and the migration of tokens of MATIC to POL will strengthen the standing. Technicals suggest potential upside—RSI is oversold near 38, and MACD shows bearish momentum slowing. Resistance is at around $0.58, and support levels are at around $0.33. Analysts predict a price range of between $3.84 and $6.25 by 2025, powered by an Ethereum upgrade and Bitcoin halving. In the long term, Polygon may go as high as $8.55 to $10.40 by 2030 should it continue to gain adoption. Aptos (APT) Aptos is a new Layer-1 blockchain focused on high throughput and speed. It has gained traction with developers. However, the adoption of the coin is still in the early phase. Depending on the development of its ecosystem, analysts project that Aptos may trade between $25 and $35 by 2025. Some investors view APT as a potential high-growth bet in the event that network usage swells. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains the biggest meme coin, supported by its community and regular bursts of hype. It doesn’t have strong utility compared to other networks, but liquidity and recognition keep it relevant. The price often finds support between $0.05 and $0.07 and often rallies when sentiment improves. For 2025, analysts see it trading between $0.08 and $0.15, though much depends on social media buzz and endorsements. DOGE remains a speculative pick, but its track record of sudden rallies keeps it on whale watchlists. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is the foundation for the decentralized applications, DeFi, and NFTs. Its increasing upgrades make it more scalable with low energy consumption, which maintains its appeal among developers and institutions. In the past, Ethereum has been quite successful in bull markets, and experts believe that it will be trading between 4,000 and 6,000 by the year 2025. The long-term need in enterprise scenarios and the increasing DeFi community provide ETH with a solid foundation. It is an essential part of the portfolios of many investors who are constructing long-term cryptocurrency investments. Solana (SOL) Solana has also been widely celebrated as a platform that offers quick transactions and minimal fees, making it a popular platform among DeFi and NFTs. Past outages in the network have been a cause of concern, but stability has been improved, and investors are more confident. It has a support level of between $20 and $30 and a resistance level of up to $90. Depending on network reliability and macro market trends, analysts estimate SOL will range between $60 and $90 in 2025. Its developing community indicates Solana can be a strong altcoin moving forward Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche is creating traction in DeFi and enterprise blockchain. Its scalability and its fast finality make it appealing to developers. Support is at about $20 to $30, and resistance is at about $75. Analysts predict between $50 and $75 by 2025 in case the adoption grows higher. With the increasing popularity of DeFi, Avalanche will emerge as a favorable option when other projects seek faster and scalable solutions. MAGACOIN FINANCE—Whale Activity Signals Smart Money Confidence in 45x Outlook Whale activity is starting to build around MAGACOIN FINANCE, indicating an increasing level of confidence in its long-term potential by intelligent money. Analysts have predicted up to 45x growth, making MAGA one of the most discussed altcoins in this dip. Unlike meme coins that solely rely on hype, MAGA has undergone audit processes , which further increase the credibility of the project among skeptical investors. It’s drawing attention not only from retail buyers but also from larger wallets that are typically more selective. That combination has created a wave of curiosity around whether MAGA could be the next breakout coin of this market cycle. Final Outlook The market dip is giving investors a chance to pick up strong altcoins at lower levels. Polygon, Aptos, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche all have growth potential, but whale activity is pointing strongly toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. With forecasts of 45x growth and rising confidence from large investors, MAGA is quickly becoming the altcoin many are watching as the top play of this cycle .

Bitcoin is still king, Stellar is growing, and a new contender, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is quickly gaining traction among investors. According to analysts, these projects, as well as a few other altcoins, could produce some of the most extraordinary gains in the next cycle. Bitcoin (BTC): The Foundation of Every Cycle Bitcoin is undergoing a correction phase following its peak recent price of approximately $124,474. Subsequently, it has traded within the range of $113,000 and $115,000, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite worry of falling lower, past halvings show this drawdown might just be one of many. Support at $114,000 is critical, with potential downside protection at $108,000. Bitcoin will be back above $130,000 as soon as macroeconomic trends shift, as institutional accumulation remains strong. For those watching presales, Bitcoin is still the asset they trust most and keeps the rest on track. Stellar (XLM): Steady Adoption and Institutional Confidence Stellar is getting renewed momentum after being priced at $0.40 recently. Analysts think its use in decentralized finance, remittances and enterprise blockchain adoption makes it more valuable over time. Technical indicators show bullish potential with forecasts suggesting $0.48 by September if momentum continues. As Stellar continues to build the ecosystem and garner increasing investor attention, the project is recognized as one of the best altcoin plays in 2023. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Presale Pick Retail investors have already joined the wave into MAGACOIN FINANCE, with analysts forecasting a staggering 28x ROI in the next bull run. Ranked among the best crypto presales to buy right now , momentum is accelerating quickly. Momentum is already evident. Trading activity from early buyers has surged, and social engagement continues to accelerate faster than rival launches. Investors note that this isn’t just speculative noise — it reflects sustained conviction from both smaller investors and large holders positioning ahead of exchange listings. Analysts highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE capped supply, verified audits, and whale-backed inflows give it the kind of fundamentals that fueled the earliest breakouts of Solana and Ethereum. Early entrants are using the unique code PATRIOT50X to unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but supply is running out fast. If momentum continues at its current pace, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Institutional Flows Remain Strong Ethereum still remains the leader of DeFi & Web3. ETH is holding steady around $4200 despite temporarily dropping under $4150, thanks to an unprecedented $1 billion in ETH spot ETF inflows. If the long-term bullish trend continues, ETH is likely to retest $4700 to $5000 by early September, analysts expect. Due to its utility, this cryptocurrency has become one of the most important ones. Binance Coin (BNB): Ecosystem Expansion Drives Demand BNB is trading close to yearly highs of $829 – $869, underpinned by steady investor activity and growth in the Binance ecosystem. It is well positioned for use with continued adoption thanks to its DeFi staking and exchange utility. Experts say that if the price breaks $900–$1,000, it will trigger the next leg higher and confirm the well-established BNB as one of the safe high upside altcoin plays. Conclusion Presales are increasingly seen as a gateway to outsized returns ahead of the next bull cycle. Bitcoin’s resilience, Stellar’s adoption story, Ethereum’s institutional flows, and BNB’s ecosystem expansion all highlight strong cases for 2025 growth. Yet, analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout opportunity , with forecasts of 28x upside, whale-backed demand, and a fast-vanishing presale bonus. For investors seeking both stability and high-growth potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE may prove to be the most compelling choice of the year.

While many investors search for the next project to replicate XRP’s success, analysts are now pointing to an AI token they believe could outperform it. Ruvi AI (RUVI) has seen its daily sales surge into the millions following a strategic CoinMarketCap partnership, bringing its once-distant $1 price forecast firmly within reach. CoinMarketCap Listing Ignites Million-Dollar Daily Sales The partnership with CoinMarketCap was the pivotal moment that transformed Ruvi AI into the crypto market’s most watched presale. This strategic move provided direct exposure to the institutional investors and high-conviction retail traders who powered Ripple’s early growth. The market’s response has been overwhelming, with daily sales volumes now consistently hitting seven figures. This explosive demand is reflected in the presale’s impressive milestones: $3.1M raised with unprecedented velocity. 240M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global community. Holder base now exceeds 3,000 members and is growing daily. Phase 2 is over 90% complete , signaling an imminent and programmed price increase. This isn’t speculative hype; it’s the kind of high-volume, strategic investment that indicates smart money is taking a serious position, mirroring the early investment patterns of projects like XRP. Real-World Utility in the Creator Economy Just as Ripple solved critical problems in the financial sector, Ruvi AI is built on a foundation of tangible utility for the booming $104 billion creator economy . Its core offering is a powerful super app that streamlines the entire content creation workflow, providing a clear value proposition. The ecosystem includes: Advanced Trend Research: Analytics tools that identify high-demand topics, helping creators produce content that resonates with massive audiences. AI-Powered Script Generation: An AI engine that crafts channel-ready scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok, saving creators valuable time. Native Media Creation: Integrated image and video generators that eliminate the need for expensive third-party software subscriptions. Streamlined Workflows: Centralized tools for planning, editing, and scheduling that dramatically boost production efficiency. This comprehensive utility attracts a broad user base of YouTubers, marketers, and brands, creating sustainable, organic demand for the RUVI token. A Clear Path to the $1 Target Ruvi AI offers complete transparency in its presale pricing, creating a clear and urgent path for early investors: Current Price: $0.015 (Phase 2 is over 90% sold out). Phase 3 Launch Price: $0.020 (A programmed 33% price surge ). Final Presale Price: $0.070. This transparent structure builds investor confidence and creates natural FOMO. The 33% price jump is guaranteed once the final tokens in Phase 2 are sold, rewarding those who act quickly and fueling momentum toward the $1 target. VIP Tiers: The Fast Track to Exceptional Returns RUVI’s VIP program is structured to reward significant early investments with massive token bonuses, offering a clear path to exceptional returns as the project gains traction: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, for a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, for a 13,233% ROI. An active leaderboard giveaway adds another competitive layer, further incentivizing participation before the next price increase. Infrastructure Built for Smart Money Ruvi AI provides the security and market access that institutional investors require: CyberScope Audit: A successful third-party audit verifies the security of the smart contracts, removing a major barrier for risk-averse capital. WEEX Exchange Partnership: A strategic alliance with a major exchange ensures deep liquidity and easy trading access for all token holders after the presale concludes. The Window to Outperform XRP Is Closing With Phase 2 now over 90% complete, the opportunity to invest at the current price of $0.015 is disappearing fast. The imminent 33% price surge is just the beginning. The combination of institutional attention, a successful audit, a top-tier exchange partnership, and undeniable utility gives Ruvi AI a credible shot at outperforming even legendary projects like Ripple. The journey to $1 is well underway.

In the latest development, a victim lost 783 Bitcoin, worth approximately $91 million, in such an attack. Hackers Impersonate Wallet Support Prominent on-chain investigator ZachXBT reported that the attackers impersonated both exchange and hardware wallet customer support. Blockchain data shows the thief has already laundered the stolen funds through the privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Wasabi. The incident coincidentally occurred on the one-year anniversary of the $243 million Genesis Creditor theft. ZachXBT explained that large-scale breaches have left massive amounts of personal information exposed online, which makes it easier for threat actors to exploit victims. By leveraging these data leaks, attackers can convincingly impersonate exchange or wallet support, gain trust, and ultimately carry out such scams. When asked by a community member how one can avoid falling victim to social engineering, ZachXBT offered a blunt but practical piece of advice: treat every call or email as a potential scam by default. Social Engineering: A Dominant Attack Vector TRM Labs recently highlighted the growing dominance of social engineering in crypto-related thefts. The firm found that the first half of 2025 witnessed a record $2.1 billion stolen through hacks and exploits. Over 80% of losses were tied to infrastructure intrusions such as compromised private keys and seed phrases, which were often made possible through social engineering tactics or insider threats. The average hack size also doubled compared to 2024, as it hit $30 million during the same period. TRM noted that the Bybit incident in February, attributed to North Korean state-sponsored actors, was the largest crypto hack in history, as it accounted for nearly 70% of total losses. Beyond that mega theft, dozens of other attacks occurred in January, April, and May, with several exceeding $100 million each.
