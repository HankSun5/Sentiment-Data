After years of uncertainty around liability for coders and software developers, officials are now drawing a clear line between creating technology and committing a crime. The US Justice Department has announced it will no longer target software developers who build Defi platforms without proof of criminal intent. Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti made the remarks Thursday during a digital assets summit in Wyoming. He said that writing code alone does not constitute a crime. This signals a significant change from earlier enforcement strategies where prosecutors charged developers for operating unlicensed money transmission businesses. Debate Over Money Transmission Rules Regulators have long applied stringent rules to companies in the money remittance business, but the rise of Defi systems is putting those standards to the test. Traditional payment platforms face clear obligations, while DeFi projects say those same rules don’t make sense in a code-driven environment. Money transmitters such as PayPal and Cash App must secure licenses and comply with anti-money laundering obligations. They also have to verify customers and report suspicious transactions. But decentralized exchanges argue these rules don’t fit their model since they have no control over user activity on their platforms. NEW: US DOJ’S ACTING AAG MATTHEW GALEOTTI SAYS “OUR VIEW IS THAT MERELY WRITING CODE, WITHOUT ILL INTENT, IS NOT A CRIME. INNOVATING NEW WAYS FOR THE ECONOMY TO STORE AND TRANSMIT VALUE AND CREATE WEALTH, WITHOUT ILL INTENT, IS NOT A CRIME” https://t.co/iyGVBr0BCZ — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) August 21, 2025 On Defi, Hiding Money & Ill Intent The issue came under the spotlight after a New York jury recently convicted Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash, on conspiracy charges linked to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Tornado Cash is a privacy service specifically designed to make Defi and cryptocurrency transactions more difficult to trace. Jurors could not reach a decision on whether Storm committed money laundering or violated sanctions. Prosecutors said the service allowed illicit finance, while critics of the case argued Storm had only written code. Prosecutors Will Prioritize Evidence Of Intent According to Galeotti, future cases in the Defi and crypto space will require proof that a developer knowingly aided fraud, sanctions evasion, or laundering. “Innovating new ways for the economy to store and transmit value and create wealth, without ill-intent, is not a crime,” he said. He added that laws banning unlicensed money transmission will not apply to developers unless there is evidence of deliberate wrongdoing. The focus of the US justices will remain on fraud, Ponzi schemes , and global laundering networks, including those based in China and other countries suspected of carrying out illicit transactions.

With several months to go in 2025, analysts are highlighting a number of projects as the best altcoin to buy now. While analysts’ watchlists would often feature established tokens such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink, a newcomer, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has made its way into the list, indicating its potential to deliver massive returns to investors. XRP and ADA Outlook XRP is trading around $2.89, but recent pullbacks haven’t scared off long-term holders. Ripple’s slowed token release schedule and its position in cross-border payments suggest room for growth, with some predictions calling for $4.78 or more in the next cycle. Cardano is sitting close to $1.00 and has whales quietly buying up nearly $100 million in ADA this summer. That kind of confidence, paired with upgrades like Hydra that improve speed and scalability, makes ADA a strong contender on lists of the best altcoins for 2025. LINK’s Continues to Gather Strength Meanwhile, Chainlink recently climbed above $26 after a series of buybacks and high-profile partnerships with names like ICE and Google Cloud. With nearly 40% of its supply staked, LINK continues to look like a long-term infrastructure play. Analysts following the token highlighted its potential to deliver gains but noted such gains may be incomparable to that of newer and emerging altcoin contenders. Analysts Predict Up to 5000% ROI For MAGACOIN FINANCE Holders XRP, ADA, LINK—and now MAGACOIN FINANCE —are topping analyst lists of best altcoins to buy for 2025. However, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only project that could deliver up to 5,000% ROI for investors. The reasons are clear. The slowdown in the market appears to have no effect on the project as momentum is building. Traders following the token say its trajectory mirrors life-changing rallies from previous bull cycles. That sounds bold, but experts argue it’s not out of the question. Why? Because MAGACOIN FINANCE combines a rare mix of utility, hype, and community backing, and these are factors investors look for when markets heat up. Bottom Line If 2025 plays out like past bull runs, the winners may not only be Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP, ADA, LINK, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are on track to deliver strong narratives and, potentially, explosive gains. However, for investors hoping to make massive returns on their investment, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned the pick as the best altcoin to buy in 2025.

Based on reports, Bitcoin was trading at about $113,240, down 3.4%, on August 22, 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop For 2025? $175,000, According To SOL Strategies Boss Crypto Analyst Flags Inflation Risk According to Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone, the simultaneous rise in equities, Treasury yields, gold and Bitcoin looks unstable and could push inflation higher if it continues. He warned that stronger risk-asset gains might nudge the Federal Reserve toward tighter policy, not easing, which would be the opposite of calls from US President Donald Trump to loosen policy this year. Reports have noted that Bitcoin fell from a local high of $120,050 to roughly $112,990, a decline of about 6% since last Friday, and that the crypto lost just over $1,000 in a few hours during the move. A Lot May Be Riding on Bitcoin/Gold Going Up – The simultaneous rise in equities, Treasury bond yields, Bitcoin and gold appears unsustainable, and at a minimum due for some volatility post-summer doldrums. A scenario my graphic highlights is that if risk assets keep rising,… pic.twitter.com/7xCLbw7DXy — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) August 22, 2025 Price Action And Market Moves Markets reacted quickly. Some traders booked profits after the spike, and others trimmed positions ahead of key Fed commentary at Jackson Hole. The pullback was not extreme by historical standards, but it shows how quickly sentiment can change. Markets have been watching Treasury yields and Powell’s comments closely, since those signals help decide whether risk assets will keep drawing fresh money. What The Numbers Mean For Investors Based on reports, the recent fall understates how much volatility persists in crypto. A 6% move in a few days is normal for Bitcoin’s history, yet it still matters for big holders and funds that move money in and out quickly. Some support levels around $112,000 were being watched by crypto tacticians, while traders said downside protection would likely be tested if yields continue higher. Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ Analysts’ Price Targets Analysts are split on where Bitcoin goes from here. Bernstein strategists, for example, have floated a scenario where Bitcoin could climb as high as $200,000 within months if certain on-chain flows and institutional demand persist. Other market players see a more modest path, with some guessing at a peak near $140,000 to $150,000 as the most realistic upside in the near term. At the same time, veteran voices like McGlone warn that downside scenarios remain possible if the Fed tightens.

Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, has officially submitted an S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed XRP ETF . This significant development, first reported by Watcher Guru on X, marks a crucial step toward potentially bringing XRP, the digital asset powering Ripple’s payment network, into a more mainstream investment vehicle. For many, this filing signals a growing institutional interest in diversifying crypto investment options beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Does Grayscale’s XRP ETF Filing Mean? When Grayscale files an S-1, it is essentially a registration statement required by the SEC for new securities offerings. It provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed fund, including its structure, investment objectives, and risks. This move indicates Grayscale’s serious intent to launch an XRP ETF , making it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the digital asset. The SEC’s review process for such filings can be lengthy and involves thorough scrutiny. An S-1 filing is a necessary prerequisite before any ETF can be considered for approval. It is a formal declaration of intent and a detailed blueprint for how the fund would operate. Why is an XRP ETF a Game Changer for Investors? The potential approval of an XRP ETF offers several compelling benefits. First, it simplifies access. Investors can buy shares of the ETF through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the complexities of crypto wallets, exchanges, and private key management. This ease of access significantly lowers the barrier to entry for many. Increased Liquidity: An ETF often brings greater liquidity to the underlying asset, making it easier to buy and sell. Regulatory Clarity: SEC oversight provides a layer of trust and regulatory clarity, appealing to institutional investors and those hesitant about the unregulated nature of some crypto markets. Diversification: It allows investors to diversify their crypto holdings beyond the dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This development could unlock substantial capital from institutional funds and retail investors who prefer regulated products. It truly represents a new era for digital asset investment. Navigating the Path: Challenges and Regulatory Hurdles for the XRP ETF While the prospect of an XRP ETF is thrilling, the path to approval is not without its challenges. The SEC has historically been cautious with crypto-related products, especially those involving assets that have faced regulatory scrutiny. XRP’s legal status in the U.S. has been a point of contention, with the SEC previously suing Ripple, alleging XRP is an unregistered security. However, recent court rulings have provided some clarity, distinguishing between institutional sales and programmatic sales on exchanges. This legal progress might pave a smoother way for an XRP ETF , but the SEC’s final decision remains uncertain. Grayscale must convince regulators that the fund meets all investor protection requirements, a task that demands meticulous detail and compliance. Looking Ahead: The Potential Impact of an Approved XRP ETF Should the SEC grant approval for an XRP ETF , the implications for the broader cryptocurrency market could be profound. Such an approval would not only legitimize XRP further as an investable asset but also set a precedent for other altcoins to follow suit. It would signal a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly integrated into traditional finance. We could see a surge in demand for XRP, potentially impacting its price and market capitalization. More importantly, it would represent a significant win for crypto advocates pushing for broader institutional adoption and regulated investment products. The market will be watching closely as this unfolds, eager to witness the next chapter in crypto investment. Grayscale’s S-1 filing for an XRP ETF is undeniably a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores the relentless drive towards integrating digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. While the journey to approval may be complex, the potential benefits for investors and the broader market are immense. This move highlights a future where accessing innovative digital assets like XRP becomes as straightforward as investing in traditional stocks. The crypto world holds its breath, anticipating the SEC’s next steps with great anticipation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an S-1 filing? An S-1 filing is a registration statement required by the U.S. SEC for new securities offerings. It provides detailed information about a company or fund looking to go public or offer new investment products, like an ETF. Why is an XRP ETF significant? An XRP ETF is significant because it would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP through a regulated and easily accessible investment vehicle, potentially boosting liquidity and institutional adoption for the asset. What are the main benefits of an XRP ETF? Key benefits include simplified access for investors, increased liquidity for XRP, and enhanced regulatory clarity and oversight, which can attract more institutional capital. What challenges does an XRP ETF face? The primary challenges include obtaining SEC approval, which has historically been cautious with crypto products, and navigating the ongoing regulatory discussions surrounding XRP’s legal classification. How does this impact XRP’s legal status? While an S-1 filing does not change XRP’s legal status directly, an SEC approval of an XRP ETF would implicitly acknowledge XRP as a legitimate asset for a regulated investment product, building on recent positive court rulings.

The complaint, submitted Thursday in federal court in San Jose, says sensor systems architect Chen Shi covertly drew on Apple’s health-sensing work to support his new role at the Chinese company. The filing states that Shi accessed restricted materials tied to Apple’s wearable program before leaving the company in June. Apple says those actions were taken for Oppo’s benefit while a rival product was being prepared. “Concealing his impending employment with a direct competitor, Dr. Shi set up and attended dozens of one-on-one meetings with Apple Watch technical team members to learn about their ongoing research,” the complaint states. Apple contends the activity intensified in the days immediately before his departure. The suit says that “late at night just three days before leaving Apple, Dr. Shi downloaded 63 documents from a protected Box folder.” It adds “He then transferred them to a USB drive one day before his departure.” as mentioned in a Bloomberg’s report . Apple alleges Shi lied about Departure, shared secrets with Oppo Apple says it often goes to court when others misuse its intellectual property. The complaint says that in recent years at least three former engineers from Apple’s now-ended self-driving car project were charged with crimes for taking secrets to China. The company has also been litigating with Irvine, California based Masimo Corp. over smartwatch technology since 2020 . Apple says Shi concealed his move to Guangdong Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp. by telling colleagues in Cupertino that he was returning to China to care for his aging parents. Apple says Shi violated his confidentiality and IP obligations, and that Oppo was aware of and encouraged his actions. In one alleged message sent in Chinese to Oppo’s vice president of health before he quit, Shi wrote that he had been “reviewing various internal materials and doing a lot of 1:1 meetings in an effort to collect as much information as possible — will share with you all later.” The Oppo executive replied “alright” and sent an “OK” emoji, according to the complaint. Apple warns of damage to innovation and fair Play Apple argues that letting the conduct by Shi and Oppo “to go unpunished would undermine Apple’s commitment to innovation and its substantial investments in pioneering technologies like Apple Watch.” The complaint continues stating “It would also risk destroying the value of Apple’s trade secrets and provide a competitor with an unfair advantage.” After his departure, Shi joined Oppo’s Silicon Valley research arm, which operates under the Oppo and InnoPeak names, the complaint says. The lawsuit is titled Apple Inc. v. Chen Shi, Guangdong Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp Ltd., and InnoPeak Technology Inc., No. 5:25-cv-7105, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division. The venue places the dispute in federal court in San Jose. The complaint details the alleged conduct in that filing. Get seen where it counts.

Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, recently achieved a remarkable milestone, hitting an Ethereum all-time high . After nearly four years, ETH surged past the $4,868 mark on major exchanges like Binance. This incredible rally signals renewed confidence in the network’s potential and its pivotal role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. Currently, CoinMarketCap reports ETH trading around $4,805.9, reflecting a significant 13.02% increase in just 24 hours. What Propelled This Ethereum All-Time High? Several key factors have converged to fuel Ethereum’s impressive ascent. Understanding these drivers helps paint a clearer picture of the network’s growing strength and market position. The journey to this Ethereum all-time high wasn’t a single event but a culmination of sustained development and increasing adoption. Explosive DeFi Growth: The decentralized finance sector, largely built on Ethereum, has seen unprecedented expansion. Billions of dollars are locked in various DeFi protocols, driving demand for ETH as the primary gas fee and collateral. NFT Boom: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the digital world by storm. The vast majority of high-value NFTs are minted and traded on the Ethereum blockchain, significantly increasing network activity and ETH utility. Anticipation of “The Merge”: The upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0, often referred to as “The Merge,” promises enhanced scalability, security, and energy efficiency through a proof-of-stake consensus. Investors eagerly await this major upgrade. EIP-1559 Implementation: The London hard fork introduced EIP-1559, changing Ethereum’s fee structure by burning a portion of transaction fees. This deflationary mechanism reduces the supply of ETH over time, making it scarcer. Institutional Interest: Major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly exploring and investing in Ethereum-based solutions and ETH itself, adding significant capital and legitimacy. Why is This ETH All-Time High So Significant for the Market? Reaching a new peak after such a long period is more than just a price number; it’s a powerful statement about Ethereum’s resilience and future prospects. This ETH all-time high reinforces its position as a dominant force in the crypto space, beyond just being a speculative asset. This milestone indicates robust investor confidence, suggesting market participants believe in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition and long-term viability. Moreover, it can trigger a positive feedback loop, attracting more developers, users, and capital into the ecosystem. The sustained growth of the Ethereum network is a testament to its innovative spirit and the dedication of its global community. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Ethereum’s Continued Growth? While the mood is certainly optimistic, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges Ethereum faces, even after reaching an Ethereum all-time high . No rapidly evolving technology is without its hurdles, and ETH is no exception. Addressing these issues will be vital for sustained growth. Scalability: Despite “The Merge” being on the horizon, current network congestion and high gas fees remain a concern for everyday users. Layer 2 solutions are helping, but a full solution is still under development. Regulatory Scrutiny: As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream adoption, regulatory bodies worldwide are increasing their focus. Potential regulations could impact how Ethereum operates or is traded. Competition: Other smart contract platforms, often dubbed “Ethereum killers,” are emerging with promises of faster transactions and lower fees. While Ethereum holds a significant first-mover advantage, competition is always a factor. Investors must remain informed about these aspects to make well-rounded decisions. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and understanding both opportunities and risks is paramount. How Can Investors Navigate This Exciting Ethereum Landscape? For those interested in the Ethereum ecosystem, the current market dynamics present both opportunities and considerations. It’s essential to approach the market with a clear strategy, especially after an Ethereum all-time high . Always conduct thorough research and consider your personal financial situation. Actionable Insights: Long-Term Perspective: Many experts view Ethereum as a long-term investment due to its foundational role in Web3. Consider a long-term holding strategy if you believe in its future. Diversification: While ETH is strong, diversifying your crypto portfolio can mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of network developments, such as “The Merge” updates, and broader market trends. Reliable news sources are key. Understand Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for rapid price swings. Be prepared for potential corrections even after significant gains. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Always consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The recent achievement of an Ethereum all-time high is a powerful testament to the network’s enduring innovation and its critical role in shaping the future of decentralized technology. This remarkable surge, after nearly four years, marks not just a price point but a significant vote of confidence from the global market. As Ethereum continues its evolution with upcoming upgrades and expanding use cases, its journey remains one of the most compelling narratives in the digital asset space. The future looks incredibly bright for this pioneering blockchain.

This scenario highlights the effectiveness of dollar-cost averaging (DCA), a strategy that involves buying fixed amounts of an asset at regular intervals regardless of short-term price movements. The DCA Approach Applied to XRP Dollar-cost averaging is often used to reduce the impact of volatility and avoid the risks of investing large sums at once. To assess how this strategy would have performed with XRP, we examined a case in which an investor allocated $10 per day to the token from July 2015 through July 2025. In mid-2015, XRP was priced around one cent and later dropped even further before beginning its climb. The asset remained below $1 until the end of 2017, when it briefly surged past that milestone before retreating again in 2018. Since then, XRP has experienced repeated attempts to reclaim higher price levels, including moves above $2 and $3, but has historically spent much of its existence trading under $1. Total Investment and Accumulated Tokens Over the ten years, an investor following this plan would have contributed $36,540 in total. The relatively low price of XRP during much of this period meant that each purchase secured a significant amount of tokens. According to calculations provided by Uphold’s DCA tool, the strategy would have resulted in ownership of approximately 1,066,678 XRP. When compared to everyday spending habits, this figure is notable. Research from Ramsey Solutions shows that the average American spends about $3,768 annually on impulse purchases, or $37,680 across ten years, slightly higher than the total $36,540 that would have been allocated to XRP in this investment scenario. Unlike discretionary spending, however, the steady commitment to XRP would have produced remarkable long-term value. At present market conditions, the 1.066 million XRP accumulated through this strategy would be valued at more than $3.04 million, given XRP’s trading price of roughly $2.85. Uphold’s calculator provides a slightly lower estimate of $2.35 million, but both figures underscore the scale of returns possible from disciplined long-term investing in the cryptocurrency market.

Market commentators continue to encourage similar approaches for the future. For example, Coach JV recently emphasised that investors who adopt a dollar-cost averaging strategy with assets such as XRP over the next decade may still achieve transformative results. Analysts have suggested that XRP could significantly surpass its current valuation, with some projecting potential long-term price targets of $50 or higher . If such forecasts materialise, initiating a DCA plan today could still yield notable returns. This case study demonstrates how consistent buying during both highs and lows can accumulate large holdings over time. While this example highlights exceptional historical performance, it is important to acknowledge that cryptocurrency markets remain unpredictable. Nonetheless, the data reinforces why many investors continue to view dollar-cost averaging as a disciplined and effective long-term strategy.

HBAR, LINK, and SUI are already catching attention for their strong setups, but there’s also growing buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE as analysts point to it as the best altcoin to buy right now . Here’s a closer look at 10 altcoins worth watching. 1. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera uses its unique hashgraph technology to run fast, cheap, and secure transactions. With over 10,000 transactions per second and backing from companies like IBM and LG, it’s carving a place in real-world use cases like supply chain, payments, and DeFi. For 2025, prices are expected to range from $0.18 to $0.54, with possible spikes reaching $0.75. According to long-term predictions, it will be more than $1 by 2030. 2. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink powers smart contracts with real-world data feeds—making it essential for DeFi and cross-chain applications. Many blockchain communities depend on it because it is so reliable. The price will range between $7 and $14 in 2025, and the long-term goal is for it to be over $20 in price. 3. Sui Network (SUI) Sui focuses on scalability and simple user experiences for Web3. It’s building around gaming, dApps, and fast transactions at low cost, giving it a growing role in the space. Price outlook: $0.50–$2.00 in 2025, with long-term growth possibly above $5. 4. Polygon (MATIC) Polygon makes Ethereum faster and cheaper through its Layer 2 scaling solutions. It’s widely used for DeFi and NFTs, helping reduce congestion while keeping fees low. Price outlook: $0.50–$1.50 in 2025 and $3+ by 2030. 5. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche is built for speed and scalability, giving developers a cheaper alternative to Ethereum. It’s well-suited for dApps and enterprise use cases. Price outlook: $15–$40 in 2025, with a possible climb past $60 by 2030. 6. Algorand (ALGO) Algorand delivers fast, low-cost transactions with its pure proof-of-stake system. It’s active in enterprise adoption, payments, and DeFi. Price outlook: $0.20–$0.70 in 2025, with longer-term potential of $2 by 2030. 7. Tezos (XTZ) Tezos stands out for its self-amending blockchain, avoiding hard forks by upgrading through on-chain governance. It’s well-known in NFTs and smart contracts. Price outlook: $1.50–$3.50 in 2025, with targets above $5 by 2030. 8. Cosmos (ATOM) Cosmos lets blockchains communicate and share data securely. With interoperability becoming more important, it’s one of the main projects pushing cross-chain growth. Price outlook: $10–$30 in 2025, with $50+ possible by 2030. 9. VeChain (VET) VeChain has a focus on supply chain and product tracking. Its blockchain is designed for business, making it suitable for anti-counterfeiting and supply chain. Price outlook: $0.03–$0.12 in 2025, and up to $0.30 by 2030. MAGACOIN FINANCE—Analysts See a 70x Surge Potential While HBAR, LINK, and SUI are looking strong, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as the hidden gem of this cycle. Forecasts indicate that it might jump 70x, and early adopters are already feeling the FOMO . Adding to this is a 50% extra bonus thanks to code PATRIOT50X—early investors get more upside before the market gets going. People don’t want to miss out on MAGA in 2025 because of its growing community and appeal. Final Outlook The pursuit of the hidden gems is gaining momentum as the next bull market approaches. HBAR, LINK, and SUI all stand on the verge of great breakouts, but the altcoin on everyone mind at the moment is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Investors are keen on this one while it is still young to get an edge.

50515066,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=790391,1755905706,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50515066.jpeg,Wall Street eyes strong August finish with Powell speech behind and Nvidia earnings ahead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-eyes-strong-august-finish/,"Wall Street closed out this week with a surge that wiped out most of August’s usual misery, after Jerome Powell dropped what may be his final comments from Jackson Hole, confirming the Federal Reserve is leaning toward cutting interest rates in mid-September. That speech, delivered Friday in Wyoming, sent stocks flying across every sector, including tech, semiconductors, small caps, and regional banks. It gave investors what they’ve been waiting on for weeks — a clear signal that monetary policy is about to loosen. “Powell delivered a final Jackson Hole speech to be remembered,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “He essentially gave investors what they had been hoping for, which was a dovish outlook on future Fed policy.” Sam added, “It has removed an important restraint that was tied to investor optimism. In that the Fed now seems fairly clear that they will, or are leaning toward, cutting rates in mid-September.” Markets react to Powell’s comments and Nvidia’s upcoming earnings On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 900 points, or about 2%, during intraday trading, enough to register a new all time high, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. The Russell 2000 surged by over 3%, and the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index broke past its previous high set in November 2023, according to data from CNBC. Semiconductors shot higher, regional banks moved; even large-cap tech saw a big snapback. The Magnificent Seven had their best session since May, with nearly $370 billion in market value added by the close, roughly the same size as Procter & Gamble. The next test for this rally hits next week when Nvidia releases earnings. Analysts expect the chipmaker to beat expectations again, as it has throughout the artificial intelligence boom. But these results are coming at a tense moment. The company’s exposure to China has become a problem, thanks to policy moves under President Donald Trump’s administration and regulatory pushback from Beijing. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed on Friday that he is now talking with the U.S. government about shipping a different version of its H20 chip to China, one that complies with updated export controls. Nvidia is also preparing to give 15% of its China chip revenue to the U.S. government in return for a license to keep selling there. Despite the geopolitical risk, analysts are still bullish. Harsh Kumar, semiconductor analyst at Piper Sandler, said, “We anticipate a meaningful uptick in estimates on the Street for Nvidia, when these earnings are done.” Harsh still maintains a buy rating on the stock. July inflation data could support September rate cut Also landing next week is the July Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which the Fed uses as its preferred measure of inflation. Economists expect core PCE to rise 2.9% year-over-year, just slightly above June’s 2.8% reading. This uptick is expected to reflect new costs coming from tariffs, but nothing that would derail the case for a rate cut. Even if inflation edges higher, Wall Street doesn’t seem too worried. Sam said, “Investors are well aware of short-term hurdles. So, next week, I think, should end up being a positive week.” With Powell’s tone already leaning dovish, and signs of cooling inflation, markets look ready to brush off minor bumps. As of Friday, the Dow is up over 3%, leading the major indexes. The S&P 500 has gained 2%, while the Nasdaq Composite, home to the big tech names, is lagging behind with a rise of just over 1%. Even that gain is notable, given the pressure tech stocks have faced all month. With Powell’s speech behind them, Nvidia’s report on deck, and inflation data coming soon, traders are betting August could close out a winner for once.

The document in question was originally filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and registered in December 2013. It covered the brand name XRP for use in financial services, such as “providing secure payment options to members of an online community via a global computer network through the use of traditional currency and virtual currency.” BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! An unknown document has been revealed, showing that the United States of America has already patented #XRP and has classified it as a payment method for financial services! 💥🔥 pic.twitter.com/dfxKgAHzA4 — JackTheRippler ©️ (@RippleXrpie) August 20, 2025 The resurfacing of the old document, however, came with misinterpretations that the application was filed by the U.S. government, which means an endorsement of Ripple or XRP. Does the U.S. government own the XRP patent? While the document is legit, it wasn’t filed by the federal government, nor is it a patent application. It’s nothing more than a trademark registration filed by OpenCoin, Inc., which is now known as Ripple. OpenCoin was founded in September 2012 by Chris Larsen and McCaleb. It rebranded to Ripple Labs in 2013 and was shortened to Ripple in 2015. Trademark registrations are not a vote of approval. It’s something a company does to seek protection for its brand names and stop everyone else from using them. In this case, Ripple filed to protect the “XRP” word name, and it’s just one of the many applications initiated by the company. Earlier this year, Ripple filed a trademark application for “Ripple Custody,” raising speculations that the firm could launch a crypto wallet or custodial services. It had also filed for “Ripple Payments,” “RLUSD,” and “Ripple USD” trademarks in 2024, in anticipation of launching its stablecoin, RLUSD. According to the USPTO , Ripple Labs currently has 67 trademark applications. Elsewhere, a report shows Ripple Labs has issued a total of 39 patents globally, with only 18 having been granted. Of all the 39 patents, more than 62% patents are active. XRP becomes the third-largest crypto XRP, meanwhile, has reclaimed the third spot in the crypto market. At the time of writing, it was trading at $3.08 on Coingecko, with a $183 billion market cap. The price has been soaring so far this year, as investors began to see an end to the years-long legal tussle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP/USDT ID price chart Cryptopolitan reported Friday that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has approved an agreement for both sides to drop their appeals.

Her exit leaves the IRS crypto office without a clear leader as major tax changes near. Turner’s move follows the IRS putting new rules and forms in place to guide tax duties for individual crypto investors and for their brokers. The departure follows exits by two other crypto leads, Seth Wilks and Raj Mukherjee, who left earlier this year amid the Trump administration’s budget cuts. It is not yet clear who will serve as interim leader of the digital assets unit. The tax arm of the Treasury Department is bracing for a flood of crypto-sector filings while also dealing with deep budget and staffing cuts in excess of 20,000 employees. The agency’s workforce, often criticized by Republican lawmakers, has shrunk from roughly 113,000 about 30 years ago to around 76,000 in the latest count. New 1099-DA forms signal bigger filing demands One of the biggest changes is the new 1099-DA form that millions of investors will get from their crypto brokers. Roughly 3 million filers have reported making crypto trades, a figure widely seen as low, suggesting many more people will newly disclose crypto activity as the rules take effect. The IRS did not respond to questions about Turner’s exit or who will lead the unit next. “Digital assets have shifted from a niche issue to a core focus for global regulators, and I am proud to have helped lay the foundation for oversight in this fast-changing space,” Turner said in a statement to CoinDesk . “Now, I’m excited to be moving to the other side of the table to help taxpayers, businesses, and institutions understand their obligations and navigate those same rules with confidence.” Turner said she will take private-sector roles that include serving as tax director at CryptoTaxGirl, a tax firm that specializes in crypto transactions, and doing work with the U.K. firm Asset Reality. Laura Walter, CTG’s founder, said in a statement that Turner’s arrival will help “ensure our clients receive the highest level of guidance, protection, and confidence in their filings.” Crypto tax compliance still clouded For years, crypto investors and businesses have faced U.S. tax uncertainty, with no third-party documentation that clearly spelled out what they needed to file. Many digital-asset holders did not compute or report their crypto taxes in prior years, adding to the IRS’s challenges. Because the new 1099-DA forms will start flowing from accounts at firms such as Coinbase and Kraken early next year, those recipients will be under more pressure to calculate and disclose their tax positions. However, in April Cryptopolitan reported that Congress overturned an IRS measure that would have classified some DeFi platforms as brokers, leaving tax treatment for that part of the market unclear.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $106.33 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $319.75 by 2031. The Ethereum Name Service is a network that enables crypto enthusiasts to rename their cryptocurrency addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031.

The RSI at 53.24 suggests neutral momentum, leaving room for further upside if buyers sustain pressure. Price is approaching the mid-Bollinger Band at $26.95, and a break above could open a path toward $30.32 resistance. However, the MACD remains negative, signaling that bearish forces are not fully exhausted. Holding above $26.50 is key for a continuation, while a rejection could trigger a pullback toward $24. Short-term sentiment leans cautiously bullish with overhead resistance to test. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENSUSD chart by TradingView Ethereum Name Service (ENS) on the 4-hour chart shows a sharp bullish breakout, surging to $27.82 with strong buying momentum. Price has pierced the upper Bollinger Band at $27.08, suggesting temporary overextension but also confirming bullish strength. The MACD is strongly positive at 0.43, reflecting accelerating upward momentum, while the Balance of Power at 1.00 indicates complete dominance by buyers. If the momentum holds, ENS could attempt a push toward $29–$30 in the near term. However, if profit-taking occurs, support lies at $25.01, where consolidation may stabilize price before the next leg. Short-term sentiment remains strongly bullish. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $22.26 BUY SMA 5 $23.95 BUY SMA 10 $26.21 BUY SMA 21 $ 27.43 SELL SMA 50 $23.30 BUY SMA 100 $ 22.40 BUY SMA 200 $19.47 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 25.66 BUY EMA 5 $24.30 BUY EMA 10 $ 22.15 BUY EMA 21 $20.02 BUY EMA 50 $19.98 BUY EMA 100 $ 22.22 BUY EMA 200 $23.51 BUY What to expect from ENS? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows mixed signals across the 1-day and 4-hour charts. On the daily timeframe, ENS has rebounded strongly from support near $23.58, climbing above $27.42 and breaking through its mid-Bollinger Band at $26.95, which signals renewed bullish momentum. RSI at 53 suggests room for growth before overbought levels. On the 4-hour chart, ENS surged aggressively to $27.82, closing above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating strong but potentially overheated buying pressure. MACD remains highly bullish, while the Balance of Power at 1.00 shows buyers in full control. Short-term volatility is expected, but overall bias leans bullish. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $130.79 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $319.75 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest.

This DeFi project, which has garnered attention due to its reported links to the Trump family, is set to make its token tradable. The crucial WLFI token unlock event is scheduled for September 1, marking a new chapter for the platform. For those tracking new digital assets, understanding these developments is key. What Does the WLFI Token Unlock Entail? World Liberty Financial recently confirmed via an announcement on X that its native token is now live on the Ethereum mainnet. This means that starting September 1 at 12:00 UTC, the WLFI token will become fully tradable and transferable. Upon launch, 20% of the total WLFI tokens will be claimable by eligible participants. This initial distribution is a significant step towards decentralization. The remaining 80% of tokens will not be immediately available; instead, their release will be determined by a community governance vote at a later date. This approach emphasizes community involvement in the project’s future. It is also important to note that tokens allocated to founders, team members, advisors, and partners will remain locked, preventing immediate sell-offs and promoting long-term commitment.

In a notice dated August 22, the intergovernmental organization stated that it will join forces with Angolan officials to close down 25 crypto mining operations illegally operated by 60 Chinese citizens. Following the Angola crypto crime, equipment worth over $37 million was seized. The relevant authorities in the country highlighted that this equipment will be distributed as financial support to vulnerable areas. The measures taken against mining in Angola are part of a big cybercrime operation conducted across several African countries. So far,1,209 individuals have been arrested, and around $97 million has been recovered under this operation. Apart from Angola, Zambia has also been exposed to a fraud scheme . This was revealed after officials in the country identified a scenario whereby 65,000 individuals experienced significant financial losses amounting to $300 million following fake promises of higher returns upon making crypto investments. Authorities implement mining regulations to address power supply issues The population of Angola is estimated to be roughly 39 million. Power supply and distribution are the country’s primary problems in these regions. The government has predominantly pointed the accusing finger at crypto miners for this scenario, resulting in a crackdown on their operations. This led to a ban on mining in April 2024 amid concerns about energy use . That said, digital assets are not entirely prohibited in Angola. Following the ban implemented on mining, a translated notice was released from the Chinese embassy in Angola stating that cryptocurrency mining under this law was considered illegal. It also warned that individuals possessing any equipment or infrastructure used for virtual currency ‘mining’ could be imprisoned for about one to five years, and the equipment might be taken away. This law illustrates a growing trend among countries globally, aiming to limit or completely ban crypto mining to address how power is shared among citizens. A good example is the Republic of Buryatia, which is part of Russia, that recently applied these measures, and authorities discovered the existence of around 95 mining rigs and a mobile transformer hidden inside a truck that was unlawfully using electricity. In the US, laws governing the mining sector differ from state to state. That has pumped “friendly” locations like Texas, where businesses like MARA Holdings, Riot Platforms, and CleanSpark do business. As of 2022, New York’s state government prohibited proof-of-work mining in the state for two years. Electricity theft related to crypto mining intensifies as power shortage increases During a regular power line inspection in Pribaikalsky District, officials in Russia’s Republic of Buryatia discovered the existence of a cryptocurrency mining operation that operated illegally, which was concealed in a KamAZ truck. The operation was to acquire an unauthorized electricity supply from a nearby village. According to the Russian state news agency TASS, this setup acquired electricity from a 10-kilovolt line to provide power to a small village. After being recognized, two people familiar with the situation revealed that the operation escaped in an SUV before police officers arrived. This scenario is the sixth case of electricity theft related to crypto mining in Buryatia this year, Rosseti Siberia’s Buryatenergo unit said. Get seen where it counts.

CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that the company has had to adapt its policies significantly to counteract these threats from North Korea. Coinbase CEO Warns Of North Korean IT Workers Armstrong highlighted the alarming trend of North Korean information technology (IT) workers attempting to exploit Coinbase’s remote work policy to gain employment and access sensitive systems within the exchange. He noted that the threat posed by these hackers is escalating, reflecting a continuous influx of new talent emerging from North Korea. “It feels like there’s 500 new people graduating every quarter from some kind of school they have,” Armstrong remarked. In response to these security concerns , Coinbase has mandated that all employees travel to the United States for in-person orientation. Additionally, anyone with access to sensitive information must be a US citizen and undergo fingerprinting. The FBI recently issued an updated warning regarding North Korean IT workers who engage with private companies to generate illicit revenue for the regime. These workers reportedly collaborate with both “witting and unwitting” accomplices in the US, facilitating their activities by reshipping company laptops, attending virtual interviews on behalf of North Korean candidates, and even setting up front businesses. New Facility In Charlotte And Stricter Employee Controls To further secure its hiring processes, the crypto exchange has implemented measures such as requiring prospective employees to activate their cameras during interviews. This step is intended to ensure that candidates are genuine and not being coached or manipulated by external forces. Armstrong emphasized that the need for rigorous security protocols has led Coinbase to enhance its customer support operations, particularly with the establishment of a new facility in Charlotte, North Carolina. Armstrong also pointed out the increasing importance of verifying physical presence in an era characterized by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deepfake technology. He noted that as the stakes in cybersecurity rise, certain aspects of remote work may need to be reevaluated. In addition to external threats, Coinbase is actively working to mitigate internal risks. Armstrong mentioned that malicious actors have offered significant bribes to customer service agents in exchange for sensitive information. To combat this, Coinbase has implemented strict controls over the information its employees can access and has made it clear that any violations will have serious consequences. Armstrong stated, “When we catch people, we don’t walk them out the door; they go to jail.” He reiterated that no amount of money is worth the risk of losing one’s freedom.

50515364,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79770,1755907207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Predicts XRP Could Exceed Expectations. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-predicts-xrp-could-exceed-expectations-heres-why/,"A recent policy change in the United States could reshape the cryptocurrency market, particularly for XRP. Following an executive order from President Donald Trump that permits the inclusion of alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans, market commentators believe XRP may be positioned to gain significantly through the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Potential Impact of 401(k) Policy Reform The adjustment to retirement account rules could allow everyday investors to gain exposure to digital assets earlier than before. Analyst Paul Barron emphasized that the flow of retirement capital into crypto is most likely to occur through structured investment vehicles like ETFs. With proposals for XRP ETFs under review and potential approval expected in the coming months, Barron argued that XRP stands to benefit directly from this regulatory shift. He raised the question of whether including XRP in ETFs and retirement accounts could elevate Ripple into the category of leading next-generation financial firms while providing substantial value to long-term holders. Trillions in Retirement Assets Could Enter the Market Rupert, a commentator from AllinCrypto, expanded on this argument by noting that U.S. 401(k) plans currently hold between $7 trillion and $9 trillion. He explained that the introduction of crypto ETFs into these accounts would unlock vast pools of liquidity, much of which has traditionally remained limited to equities and bonds. According to Rupert, this development has the potential to transform the trajectory of XRP. He emphasized that while not all of the retirement capital would move into XRP specifically, even a fraction could have a major impact on price and liquidity. Why XRP May Outperform Expectations Rupert also compared XRP’s potential to the success of existing crypto ETFs . The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF quickly became the most successful ETF launch in history, while Ethereum ETFs reached $10 billion in record time. In his view, XRP could outperform these benchmarks because of the way institutional players already perceive its long-term utility as a global payments solution. He further revealed that conversations with exchange-traded product providers suggest approval for an XRP ETF could arrive as soon as September. Such an outcome, he argued, could spark significant growth in the second half of 2025 and potentially disrupt the typical four-year market cycle by creating a more sustained growth phase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 To reinforce his perspective, Rupert pointed to historical examples, such as Microsoft’s rise from a $39 billion valuation in the 1980s to its current value of nearly $4 trillion, demonstrating that market caps do not necessarily limit growth potential. In addition to Rupert’s commentary, Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, outlined how ETFs could directly influence XRP’s market performance. He explained that XRP would not need a substantial price increase to qualify for an ETF. Instead, the listing itself could create a supply squeeze, leading to upward price pressure once the funds are live. Claver added that other catalysts, such as treasury allocations, exchange liquidity shortages, or potential instability in stablecoins like Tether, might trigger market movements earlier. However, he stressed that the introduction of XRP ETFs would act as a significant accelerant for future price growth. The alignment of new retirement fund policies, anticipated ETF approvals, and institutional recognition has led analysts to believe that XRP could play a central role in the next phase of cryptocurrency adoption. While the scale of investment inflows will depend on investor behavior, the possibility of tapping into trillions of dollars in retirement assets underscores the importance of upcoming decisions around XRP ETFs . If approved, these funds may establish XRP as one of the most strategically positioned assets in the digital economy.

If you’re searching for the best cryptos to buy that combine upside potential with real-world engagement, this list is a solid place to start. These four picks aren’t just climbing charts, they’re driving user growth and transforming how people interact with digital finance. BlockDAG (BDAG): Mobile Mining for Millions BlockDAG is topping investor watchlists for good reason. It’s not just another token trying to get listed; it’s building an entirely new model of how crypto works from the ground up. At the center of its growth story is the X1 mobile miner app, which already has over 2.5 million users. This app lets anyone earn BDAG coins by simply tapping a button once a day. No mining rigs. No energy costs. No complexity. Just pure accessibility. BlockDAG is onboarding everyday users from around the world, especially in regions where traditional mining or buying crypto isn’t feasible. And this isn’t just early hype. The project has already raised $380 million in its presale, with over 25 billion coins sold and 29 batches completed. Each batch increases the price, with the current one sitting at $0.0276, up 2,660% from batch 1. With a listing price set at $0.05, early buyers are still in strong profit territory with plenty of room to grow. The simplicity of the X1 app is redefining what it means to mine. It’s no longer limited to those with expensive ASIC hardware. Now, anyone with a smartphone can join the network, making BlockDAG not just a crypto investment, but a daily habit. For anyone looking for the best cryptos to buy right now with strong user metrics, BlockDAG’s combination of low entry cost and massive adoption gives it clear frontrunner status. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still the People’s Coin Dogecoin is a classic that refuses to be forgotten. While it started as a meme, it has become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. It’s widely accepted for tipping, small transactions, and even retail purchases thanks to integrations with platforms like BitPay. Its loyal community and frequent social media momentum make it hard to ignore. Despite its joke origins, Dogecoin has stuck around longer than many high-profile projects. That’s because people actually use it. With low fees and fast transactions, it remains one of the easiest cryptos to send and receive. Investors continue to keep a close eye on DOGE for its sudden spikes, driven by both community enthusiasm and celebrity mentions. If you’re building a list of the best cryptos to buy for consistent relevance and real-world use, DOGE still deserves a place. Stellar (XLM): Speed Meets Simplicity Stellar has carved out its place in the payments space with one of the fastest and cheapest transaction systems available today. Its primary goal is to simplify cross-border payments, especially for unbanked populations. This focus has attracted partnerships with major financial players, including MoneyGram and Circle, giving it a real foothold in global finance. The native token, XLM, powers the network and acts as a bridge currency for fast asset swaps. It also plays a vital role in Stellar’s growing number of remittance and micropayment solutions. XLM has remained a steady performer in the mid-cap range and continues to be a strong option for those who want exposure to crypto that solves real-world problems. For buyers interested in utility over hype, Stellar stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy this year. Tron (TRX): The Content Economy’s Power Token Tron is focused on decentralizing the web by allowing users to create, share, and monetize content without middlemen. The network is optimized for high-throughput and low-fee transactions, making it ideal for powering entertainment platforms, gaming apps, and decentralized file storage systems. The TRX token is central to this entire ecosystem. It fuels everything from staking and governance to in-app purchases and reward mechanisms. Tron’s strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region and its ability to onboard millions of users through platforms like BitTorrent and SunSwap have made it one of the more robust ecosystems in the space. What makes Tron compelling is how deeply it’s integrated into real user applications. It’s not just sitting in wallets; it’s flowing through platforms that people use daily. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy with long-term infrastructure backing and a growing decentralized web presence, TRX is a smart bet. Final Thoughts All four of these projects stand out for more than just hype. BlockDAG is building a daily crypto habit through mobile mining. Dogecoin continues to thrive through community power. Stellar delivers on cross-border efficiency. Tron powers an active, content-driven ecosystem. If your goal is to invest in projects that people are actually using, and that still have room to grow, then these are the best cryptos to buy right now. BlockDAG especially stands out for combining early-stage entry with real traction. With the presale nearing its cap, the clock is ticking for buyers who want in before listing day.

For the first time ever, the token has soared past the $900 mark, marking a truly remarkable moment for its holders and the broader Binance ecosystem. This impressive surge reflects strong market confidence and growing utility. What’s Fueling This Remarkable BNB All-Time High? Several key factors are contributing to BNB’s incredible ascent. The robust growth of the Binance ecosystem, including the BNB Chain, plays a crucial role. This network supports a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps), attracting more users and developers to its platform. As activity on the BNB Chain expands, demand for the native token naturally increases. Moreover, Binance’s strategic token burn programs consistently reduce the total supply of BNB. This deflationary mechanism creates scarcity, which can drive up the token’s value over time. Increased utility across various Binance services, from trading fee discounts to participation in launchpad projects, also makes BNB an attractive asset for many crypto enthusiasts. Ecosystem Expansion: Growth of BNB Chain and its dApps. Strategic Token Burns: Reduction in total BNB supply. Increased Utility: Wider adoption for various Binance services. Market Sentiment: Overall bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. The Journey to a New BNB All-Time High: A Closer Look The recent price action saw BNB trading at $900.12, representing a substantial 7.05% increase over the past day, according to CoinMarketCap. This rapid climb showcases the dynamic nature of the crypto market. Historically, BNB has demonstrated resilience and consistent growth, building a strong foundation for its current success. This new BNB all-time high is not an isolated event but rather a culmination of years of development and strategic positioning. Investors are keenly watching how this momentum will sustain. The market’s reaction to this milestone is overwhelmingly positive, with many seeing it as a validation of Binance’s long-term vision. However, it is always wise to remember that cryptocurrency markets can be volatile, and price movements can change quickly. What Does This BNB All-Time High Mean for Holders? For existing BNB holders, this BNB all-time high translates into significant gains in their portfolios.

After reaching multi-year highs, XRP now faces selling pressure from some of its largest holders. On-chain data shows that wallets with millions of tokens are unloading their positions, a move that often signals an upcoming downturn. For traders, this wave of whale sell-offs raises concerns that XRP’s latest rally could be losing steam. Many of these large holders are also exploring new opportunities, with some looking at emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for diversification and stronger upside potential. Whale Activity Signals Trouble Ahead Whale activity has always been a critical factor in XRP’s market behavior. In the past, accumulation during dips supported rallies, but now the trend has flipped toward distribution. This reversal suggests that whales may believe XRP’s latest run has reached its peak, at least in the short term. Their actions often set the tone for retail traders, and the current selling wave could amplify downward pressure if demand fails to absorb the supply hitting the market. Market and Regulatory Pressures Weighing on XRP At the same time, broader market conditions are not helping. Bitcoin and Ethereum are under pressure, dragging altcoins lower, while uncertainty in global markets has made investors more cautious. Regulatory clouds are also hanging over XRP, with delays on spot ETF approvals and continued scrutiny from regulators dampening institutional demand. Why Whales Are Exploring Alternatives Amid this uncertain backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the projects catching investor attention. Early participants are already seeing strong momentum, with demand far outpacing supply. What makes it stand out is its rapid community growth and potential to deliver life-changing gains – a $2,500 position could turn into more than $50,000 for early entrants if growth continues at its current pace. With whales diversifying into such opportunities, smaller investors are watching closely to secure their own spot before wider adoption. Will XRP Crash or Recover? Looking ahead, the critical question is whether XRP can hold its current levels or if selling will accelerate. While a sharp crash is not guaranteed, the combination of whale sell-offs, weak technicals, and regulatory uncertainty is keeping sentiment fragile. A sudden positive catalyst could still reverse the trend, but for now, traders are bracing for more downside. In short, XRP faces a crucial test in the coming weeks, while investors are increasingly looking to diversify into fast-growing alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE that promise bigger upside potential in the next market cycle.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared his insightful thoughts on safeguarding Ethereum base layer neutrality . He warned against the dangers of excessive centralization in block production, a topic crucial for the network’s future. Buterin’s vision emphasizes a robust defense strategy to keep Ethereum’s foundation fair and open for everyone. This isn’t just about preventing bad actors; it’s about building a system that can withstand future challenges and ensure true decentralization. Why is Ethereum Base Layer Neutrality So Important? The base layer of any blockchain is its fundamental infrastructure. If this layer becomes centralized, even slightly, it opens the door to potential censorship, manipulation, and a loss of the very trustless nature that cryptocurrencies promise. Buterin understands this deeply, and his recent post on X (formerly Twitter) outlined three key defenses to protect this crucial aspect: Strengthening the Public Mempool: Imagine a public waiting room for all transactions. Buterin advocates for making this mempool so strong that blocks can be built without relying on any single, centralized entity. This ensures that everyone’s transactions have a fair chance of being included. Developing Distributed Block-Building Technology: Instead of a few large players building most blocks, this approach aims to spread the block-building process across many participants. This makes it much harder for any single group to gain too much control. Introducing Additional Inclusion Channels: Even if a small number of professional builders dominate block production, there should be alternative ways to guarantee your transaction gets included. This acts as a safety net against potential censorship. These strategies collectively aim to make the network more resilient and ensure that Ethereum base layer neutrality remains a cornerstone of its design. How Will Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) Help? One of the innovative proposals Buterin highlighted is Fork-Choice enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL). This mechanism is designed to actively promote transaction inclusion and combat the risk of an ‘oligopoly’ – where a few powerful block builders could veto transactions they don’t like. Here’s how it works: FOCIL proposes selecting 17 proposers per slot. One proposer has the final say on transaction ordering. The other 16 are ‘auxiliary proposers’ whose transactions must also be included in the block. This design significantly reduces the workload for auxiliary proposers while still ensuring a broader range of transactions are processed. It’s a clever way to distribute power and enforce fair play, directly supporting Ethereum base layer neutrality . Extending Censorship Resistance with Account Abstraction The conversation around FOCIL doesn’t stop at just block builders. Buterin also touched upon how account abstraction upgrades, such as EIP-7701, could further enhance censorship resistance. Account abstraction aims to make smart contract wallets as powerful and flexible as regular accounts, opening up new possibilities. With these upgrades, the benefits of FOCIL and other neutrality measures could extend to a wider array of users and applications. This includes smart contract wallets and even privacy protocols, making the entire Ethereum ecosystem more robust against unwanted interference. The ultimate goal, as Buterin stated, is to prevent any block builder oligopoly from having the power to veto legitimate transactions. The Future of Ethereum’s Decentralized Core Buterin’s proactive approach to discussing and proposing solutions for Ethereum base layer neutrality demonstrates a strong commitment to the network’s foundational values. By continuously exploring and implementing mechanisms like FOCIL and leveraging upgrades like EIP-7701, the Ethereum community aims to build a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant platform. This ongoing effort ensures that Ethereum remains a public good, accessible and fair for all participants, rather than falling prey to the pitfalls of centralization that plague traditional systems. It’s a complex challenge, but one that the community is actively working to overcome, securing a vibrant future for the network. FAQs: Q1: What does “Ethereum base layer neutrality” mean? A1: It refers to the principle that Ethereum’s core infrastructure should not favor or discriminate against any specific transactions, users, or applications. It must remain unbiased and open to all. Q2: Why is centralization a threat to Ethereum’s base layer? A2: If block production becomes too centralized, a small group of entities could potentially censor transactions, manipulate the network, or extract unfair value, undermining Ethereum’s decentralized ethos. Q3: How does a public mempool help maintain neutrality? A3: A strong public mempool ensures that all pending transactions are visible and accessible to anyone building a block, reducing reliance on private transaction channels and promoting fair inclusion. Q4: What is FOCIL and how does it support neutrality? A4: FOCIL (Fork-Choice enforced Inclusion Lists) is a proposed mechanism that requires block proposers to include transactions from auxiliary proposers. This distributes transaction inclusion power and prevents a single entity from vetoing transactions, thereby enhancing Ethereum base layer neutrality . Q5: How do account abstraction upgrades relate to censorship resistance? A5: Account abstraction, through upgrades like EIP-7701, makes smart contract wallets more capable. This allows for more sophisticated and flexible methods of ensuring transaction inclusion and privacy, extending censorship resistance to a broader range of users and protocols. Q6: What is Vitalik Buterin’s overall goal with these defenses? A6: Vitalik’s main goal is to prevent the formation of a ‘block builder oligopoly’ – a small group of powerful entities that could control transaction inclusion. He aims to ensure Ethereum remains a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant platform. Did you find this article insightful?

According to the report , Apple recently approached Google to build a custom AI model to power its refurbished Siri next year. This comes as the iPhone maker has delayed release of the revamped Siri voice assistant. Alphabet shares rise on Apple’s Siri collaboration In response to the news, Google’s parent company Alphabet’s shares went up 3.7% while Apple’s stock rose by 1.6%, both tech giants extending gains in afternoon trading. According to the reports, Apple is yet to decide if it should stick to its in-house Siri models or switch to an external partner. The company has not yet chosen that external partner. The search engine giant said that it did not have a comment over the report while Apple also remained muted about the matter. Apple is trying to play catch up with peers in the AI race. The report further shows that Apple has lagged smartphone makers like Google and Samsung in deploying generative AI features which have rapidly integrated advanced assistants and advanced models across products. This comes after delays to a long promised overhaul of the Siri voice assistant designed to execute tasks using personal context and enable full voice-based control. Reports indicate that the upgrade, which was initially slated for this last spring was pushed back by a year as a result of engineering setbacks. As a result of the failure, Apple sidelined AI chief John Giannandrea from Siri development. The project, according to Seeking Alpha , is now being handled by software head Craig Federighi and Vision Pro headset creator Mike Rockwell. These are considering using external help as a possible way forwards. The update was reportedly developed around technology developed by the Apple Foundation Models team, the same group that also developed the on-device large language model that supports the Apple Intelligence features like summarizing text and creating custom emoji. Apple is also said to be simultaneously developing two versions of Siri. One of the model is known as Linwood, that is powered by its models and another one known as Glenwood, which runs on outside technology. Management favored Anthropic as their preferred option for collaboration but the startup set financial terms that forced Apple to broaden its search and bring others to the table, while it has also not ruled out sticking to its own models. According to Seeking Alpha, these discussions are separate from other previous agreements to integrate chatbots into Apple Intelligence. In 2024, the company added ChatGPT as a Siri fallback for general knowledge questions. Apple and Google have both publicly revealed plans for a similar Gemini integration. Apple lags behind peers in AI race According to Reuters , Siri has historically lagged behind and less capable than Alexa and Google Assistant at handling complex, multi-step requests and integrating with third party apps. Apple also explored potential partnerships with Anthropic and OpenAI earlier this year, considering whether Claude of ChatGPT could power a revamped Siri, as per earlier reports. As for the Siri partnerships, third-party models would run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers that use Mac chips for remote AI processing, which means the external Siri models would not run on devices themselves, according to reports. CEO Tim Cook declined to comment on the use of third-party models during the company’s quarterly earnings call, saying that any discussions would reveal the tech firm’s plans. The iPhone maker has already begun enlisting partners for some consumer features and its internal operations. The company is offering ChatGPT option for generating images in the iOS 26 operating system. It also ended a publicly announced project to develop its own generative AI-based coding system, and the company is reportedly using ChatGPT and Claude.

More than $350 million in short positions were liquidated in a single day, according to reports from Zerohedge on X. This massive financial upheaval occurred precisely as Ethereum (ETH) surged to an astonishing new all-time high, catching many traders off guard. It highlights the inherent volatility and rapid shifts that define the digital asset landscape, reminding us that in crypto, fortunes can change in an instant. What Exactly Happened to Ethereum Shorts? For those new to the trading lexicon, “shorting” an asset like Ethereum means betting its price will fall. Traders essentially borrow ETH from an exchange, sell it at the current market price, and hope to buy it back at a lower price later. They then return the borrowed ETH, profiting from the price difference. However, this strategy carries significant risk, especially in a market known for its sudden surges. When the price moves dramatically against a short position, substantial losses can occur, leading to what’s known as liquidation. What is Liquidation? Liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. It’s triggered when the market moves unfavorably, and the trader’s margin (collateral) can no longer cover potential losses. This mechanism prevents traders from incurring debts beyond their means. The $350 Million Event: As ETH’s price soared to its new peak, the value of countless short positions plummeted. Exchanges automatically closed these losing bets, effectively buying back the ETH to cover borrowed amounts. This cascade of forced buying further intensified the upward price pressure, contributing to the staggering $350 million figure. This day truly became one of the worst on record for Ethereum shorts , illustrating the brutal power of a market rally. Impact on Market Dynamics: Such large-scale liquidations can create a “short squeeze.” The forced buying by liquidations pushes the price even higher, trapping more short sellers and perpetuating the cycle. This dynamic can lead to rapid and explosive price movements, making the market even more unpredictable. This dramatic event serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks associated with highly leveraged trading in volatile markets. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for any serious participant. Why Did ETH Price Skyrocket? While the pain for Ethereum shorts was palpable, the underlying reason was ETH’s impressive ascent. Several factors likely contributed to Ethereum’s surge to a new all-time high, painting a picture of robust fundamental strength and growing investor confidence: Broader Market Optimism: A general bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market, often led by Bitcoin’s performance, tends to lift major alternative assets like ETH. Anticipation of Network Upgrades: Ethereum is constantly evolving. Ongoing developments and upcoming network upgrades, such as the transition to Proof-of-Stake (Ethereum 2.0 or “The Merge” and subsequent upgrades), aim to improve scalability, security, and efficiency. These advancements generate significant positive investor sentiment. Growing Institutional Interest: Increasingly, institutional investors, hedge funds, and traditional financial institutions are exploring and investing in Ethereum. Their entry brings substantial capital and lends legitimacy to the asset, driving demand and price appreciation. Dominance in DeFi and NFTs: Ethereum remains the foundational blockchain for a vast and expanding ecosystem of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Continued innovation and growth in these sectors naturally increases the utility and demand for ETH. This powerful combination of technological progress, market dynamics, and growing utility created a perfect storm for price appreciation, turning bearish bets into costly lessons. Navigating Volatility: Essential Lessons for Crypto Traders The recent liquidation event offers crucial insights and actionable advice for anyone involved in cryptocurrency trading, especially those considering leveraged positions. It’s a stark reminder that while potential rewards are high, so are the risks. Understand Leverage Thoroughly: While leverage can significantly amplify gains, it equally increases risk. Even small price movements against your position can lead to substantial losses or full liquidation. Always start with a clear understanding of how leverage works. Risk Management is Paramount: Never enter a trade without a clear risk management strategy. Always utilize stop-loss orders to automatically limit potential losses. Furthermore, never invest more capital than you can comfortably afford to lose. Diversification across different assets can also help mitigate overall portfolio risk. Market Sentiment and Analysis: Keep a close eye on overall market trends, fundamental news, and technical analysis indicators. A strong bullish trend, driven by positive news or major upgrades, can quickly overwhelm short positions, as vividly demonstrated with the recent Ethereum shorts event. Understanding the prevailing sentiment is key. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before entering any trade, thoroughly research the asset, its underlying technology, market fundamentals, and prevailing economic conditions. Avoid making decisions based solely on social media hype or unverified tips. Informed decisions lead to better outcomes. Adhering to these principles is vital for long-term success and protecting your capital in the fast-paced, often exhilarating, and sometimes brutal world of cryptocurrency trading. Conclusion: The Unpredictable Dance of Crypto Markets The spectacular liquidation of $350 million in Ethereum shorts serves as a vivid illustration of the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic and often unpredictable nature. While ETH’s surge to a new all-time high brought jubilation to many long-term holders and bullish traders, it simultaneously delivered a harsh and expensive lesson to those betting against its rise. This event underscores the critical importance of prudent risk management, a deep understanding of market mechanics, and the continuous need for adaptability among traders. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, staying informed, exercising caution, and embracing a disciplined approach remains paramount for navigating its exhilarating highs and challenging lows. Always remember that the market rewards patience and informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Ethereum shorts? Ethereum shorts refer to trading positions where an investor bets on the price of Ethereum (ETH) falling. They borrow ETH, sell it, and aim to buy it back at a lower price to profit from the difference. What does it mean for a position to be liquidated? Liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against their bet, and their margin (collateral) is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. It prevents further debt accumulation. Why did Ethereum’s price increase so dramatically? Ethereum’s price surge was likely driven by a combination of factors, including broader crypto market optimism, anticipation of significant network upgrades (like the transition to Proof-of-Stake), increasing institutional interest, and the continued growth of its DeFi and NFT ecosystems. What lessons can traders learn from this event? Traders can learn the critical importance of risk management, understanding leverage, using stop-loss orders, conducting thorough research (DYOR), and staying informed about market sentiment. Over-leveraging in volatile markets carries extreme risks. Is shorting cryptocurrencies always risky? Yes, shorting cryptocurrencies is inherently risky, especially due to their high volatility. While it offers profit potential in bearish markets, the possibility of rapid price increases (like the one that impacted Ethereum shorts ) can lead to significant and swift losses, including liquidation.

You are not alone! The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index recently surged to a score of 60, officially moving out of the ‘Neutral’ zone and firmly into ‘Greed.’ This shift signals a significant change in investor sentiment across the digital asset landscape. But what does this really mean for your crypto investments and how should you interpret this exciting development? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index acts as a crucial barometer for market sentiment. It provides a daily snapshot of how emotional crypto investors currently feel. Ranging from 0 to 100, the index gives us a clear picture: 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’: This often indicates that investors are overly worried, potentially leading to panic selling and undervalued assets. 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed’: This suggests investors are getting too excited, possibly leading to ‘FOMO’ (Fear Of Missing Out) and overvalued assets. The index helps you gauge whether the market is behaving rationally or is driven by strong emotions. What Factors Drive the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index compiles data from several key sources to calculate its daily score. It offers a holistic view of market dynamics. These factors include: Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin price volatility and drawdown compared to average values. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with historical averages. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment and engagement from various social media platforms regarding crypto. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) Previously gathered investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market cap share can indicate fear of altcoins or a flight to safety. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to spot interest trends. Each factor contributes to the overall score, providing a comprehensive assessment of market psychology. Decoding the Shift: From Neutral to Greed The recent jump of 10 points, moving the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from ‘Neutral’ to ‘Greed’ at 60, reflects a notable improvement in market confidence. This shift suggests that more investors are feeling optimistic and are willing to take on more risk. Historically, periods of ‘Greed’ often coincide with rising prices and increased buying activity. However, it is vital to approach such sentiment with caution. While ‘Greed’ can fuel further upward movement, it also often precedes market corrections. When everyone feels confident, it might be a sign that the market is becoming overheated. Therefore, understanding this sentiment is key to making informed decisions. Navigating the Greed Zone: Opportunities and Risks Entering the ‘Greed’ zone presents both exciting opportunities and potential pitfalls for investors. It is crucial to balance enthusiasm with a strategic approach. Here’s what you should consider: Opportunities: Positive Momentum: Increased investor confidence can lead to sustained price rallies for various cryptocurrencies. Broader Market Participation: A greedy market often attracts new capital, expanding the overall crypto ecosystem. Potential for Gains: Those holding assets may see their portfolios grow as buying pressure increases. Risks: Market Overextension: Extreme greed can lead to irrational exuberance, pushing asset prices beyond their fundamental value. Increased Volatility: While positive, rapid price increases can also lead to sharp pullbacks or corrections. FOMO-Driven Decisions: The fear of missing out can cause investors to make impulsive, high-risk purchases at market peaks. Smart investors use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a guide, not a definitive trading signal. They avoid getting swept away by emotion. How Savvy Investors Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index For experienced crypto participants, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as an excellent sentiment indicator rather than a direct buy or sell signal. They often use it in conjunction with other analytical tools: Contrarian Strategy: Some investors believe that when the index shows ‘Extreme Fear,’ it might be a good time to consider buying, and when it shows ‘Extreme Greed,’ it might be a good time to consider selling or taking profits. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ score can prompt investors to tighten stop-losses or reduce exposure to highly speculative assets. Emotional Discipline: The index reminds investors to check their own emotions and not let fear or greed dictate their decisions. By understanding the underlying sentiment, you empower yourself to make more rational and disciplined investment choices. Conclusion: A Powerful Gauge for Crypto Sentiment The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 60, signaling a move into the ‘Greed’ zone, is undoubtedly a positive indicator of current market sentiment. It reflects increased optimism and buying interest among investors. However, this powerful tool also serves as a crucial reminder to exercise caution and maintain a balanced perspective. While positive sentiment can drive growth, extreme greed often precedes market adjustments. By understanding what drives the index and how to interpret its signals, you can navigate the volatile crypto market with greater insight and make more informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a ‘Greed’ score of 60 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A score of 60 means the market has moved into the ‘Greed’ zone. This indicates that investors are feeling optimistic, confident, and are generally willing to take on more risk, often leading to increased buying activity and rising prices. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily, providing a fresh perspective on market sentiment each day. Q3: Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows ‘Greed’? The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. While ‘Greed’ can accompany rising prices, it can also signal an an overheated market ripe for a correction. It is wise to combine this insight with your own research and strategy, rather than making decisions based solely on the index. Q4: What factors contribute to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six main factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. Q5: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s data significantly influences the index due to its market dominance, the index is generally seen as a reflection of overall sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market.

Solana continues to impress with record-setting speeds and growing institutional backing. Cardano is gaining momentum with whale activity and long-term adoption narratives. Yet, a new name — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is drawing attention, with early entry seen as one of the rare crypto presale opportunities before the market surges. Solana: Setting Records and Eyeing $482 in Forecasts Solana has become a standout candidate when searching for the best crypto to buy before bull run . The blockchain smashed a technical barrier with 107,664 transactions per second, a milestone that few rivals can touch. The Alpenglow Upgrade aims to cut finality to 150 milliseconds, which could cement Solana’s role in high-frequency trading and institutional DeFi. SOL 7D price Institutional demand is growing too. Upexi’s acquisition of 1.9 million SOL, valued at more than $320 million, shows growing corporate appetite. Gov Capital projects a Solana price prediction 2025 at $364.24, while DigitalCoinPrice forecasts an average of $482.56. For many traders, these forecasts place Solana among the top altcoins for 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Star in Early Market Entry While Solana and Cardano dominate headlines, the hype around MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is building rapidly . This project is turning heads because early investors see it as one of the best presales to buy before the market’s next major surge. The entry point is still favorable, but with growing chatter in investor circles, momentum could pick up fast. Solana and Cardano may already be recognized giants, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rising star. For traders seeking crypto presale opportunities ahead of Q4, this project could be the rare window to secure gains before prices shift upward. Many already consider it among the best crypto to buy before bull run, adding fresh diversity to portfolios built on established names. Cardano: Whale Moves and Long-Term Expansion Cardano has always drawn attention from patient investors, but 2025 has brought an added spark. More than $73 million flowed into ADA through institutional channels, bringing total holdings above $900 million. The surge highlights growing confidence in ADA’s long-term role. ADA price chart 7D The global Cardano Summit tour is another boost, alongside Hydra’s mainnet launch set for Q4. Hydra’s scaling potential could power real-time gaming and micropayments, making ADA one of the top altcoins for 2025 . Analysts suggest ADA could average $1.36, with price bands stretching between $2.46 and $3.17 in the medium term — giving the project strong Cardano upside potential if adoption keeps pace. Final Word: Where the Next Big Moves May Come From The market is filled with speculation, but three names stand out when weighing the best crypto to buy before bull run . Solana continues to lead with speed and Cardano is carving its own path. Then comes MAGACOIN FINANCE presale , the surprise factor attracting attention as investors seek fresh crypto presale opportunities. With the potential to become one of 2025’s most talked-about tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something Solana and Cardano no longer do — a rare entry point at ground level.

As Bitcoin hit $20,000 for the first time in 2017, retail investors rushed into Ethereum and Ripple. In 2021, meme tokens like Dogecoin and SHIBA INU reached crazy high prices, not because of their fundamentals but because of the excitement of the community and viral stories. By the middle of 2025, early evidence point to the FOMO wave coming back. Bitcoin has already reached new highs, institutional demand through ETFs is steady, and retail interest is slowly coming back into search trends, forums, and trading volumes. But as we’ve seen in the past, the real fun doesn’t start until FOMO spreads to other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. That’s when altcoins take center stage and initiatives with compelling stories and community support start to grow. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names that has already caught the attention of several analysts. It is being called one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 , with ROI predictions of over 45x. Understanding the Power of FOMO People frequently say that FOMO is just emotional trading, but it has caused some of the biggest crypto rallies in history. When investors think they’re going to miss out on “the next big thing,” money flows in at an alarming rate. It was Ethereum’s ecosystem in 2017. It was meme coins and NFTs in 2021. Analysts say that by 2025, FOMO may be further spread out, with real-world asset tokenization, smart contract platforms, and new ventures with cultural branding all playing a role. The main point is that the same assets don’t usually lead cycles twice. New leaders come to power when stories that captivate people’s imaginations at the perfect time come out. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Anchors of the Market Bitcoin is what starts the FOMO wave. Its dominance is still the guide for the rotation of liquidity. When Bitcoin reaches a new high and then settles down, traders start looking for chances in altcoins. Ethereum is the first to benefit since it keeps getting better with updates that make staking more efficient, wallets easier to use, and the network bigger. Every cycle is built on these two stable assets. But because their market caps are so big, the kind of spectacular growth that retail investors look for is less likely. Historically, smaller-cap altcoins that have a lot of hype about them, are hard to find, and have novel stories are what really drive FOMO. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity Meets Narrative MAGACOIN FINANCE has made a name for itself here. Analysts and trading models are already saying that it is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy before the next bull run. It’s easy to see why. There aren’t many presale slots available, and rounds have sold out rapidly, which shows that people are really interested. The project’s branding, which is politically relevant and community-driven, offers it cultural staying power that most new tokens can’t match. Most crucially, ROI predictions are now over 45x , thanks to the presale momentum, whale accumulation, and the structural rotation that should happen when Bitcoin’s supremacy starts to fade. This mix of scarcity and story is similar to what happened in the beginning that made Dogecoin and SHIBA INU famous. Solana and Ethereum may be the most talked about cryptocurrencies in technical circles, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting a lot of attention in the areas where retail enthusiasm really thrives: stories and identity. Timing the Wave: Why Preparation Matters One thing is evident from history: if you wait for mainstream FOMO headlines, you will likely be too late. The people that got in before the hoopla started were the ones who made the most money in each round. By 2021, meme tokens were all over the news, and early adopters had already made their positions bigger. That involves keeping a tight eye on Bitcoin’s dominance in 2025. Once it settles down, liquidity usually moves into Ethereum, then Solana, and finally into other altcoins. This is when presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE frequently make their big break. People who plan ahead might take advantage of the market’s natural rhythm instead of reacting to it after the fact. Global Ripple Effects of Crypto FOMO Crypto FOMO isn’t just a problem in crypto markets anymore; it affects the whole world. In 2021, more money flowed into meme tokens from U.S. retail investors than into traditional stock funds. By 2025, when institutional adoption is the norm and governments are trying out digital asset reserves, the effects could be substantially worse. As liquidity cycles move across asset classes, a fresh spike driven by FOMO could affect everything from the prices of tech stocks to commodities hedging. This interconnectedness makes it necessary for investors all across the world to grasp crypto, not only as a hobby. Conclusion: Preparing for What’s Ahead As 2025 goes on, the question isn’t if bitcoin will have another FOMO wave, but which assets will do the best on it. Bitcoin and Ethereum will always be important, but history shows that the biggest stories emerge from other places. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of those rare candidates that has a forecasted ROI of more than 45x and a presale scarcity that makes people want to buy it right away. It can grow like crazy at the core of altseason by using cultural branding, community enthusiasm, and intelligent timing. Established giants couldn’t do that. The message is clear for investors who are getting ready now: expect the FOMO before it happens and get in where the momentum is growing.

For some, this downturn sparks fear of further losses. For others, it represents a golden opportunity. Savvy investors know that volatility has always been part of the game – and those who buy during the dips are often the ones who end up with the biggest gains. While established assets like BTC and ETH continue to show resilience, new projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching attention as rare early-entry opportunities during this waiting period before the next altcoin boom. Why Buying the Dip Still Works The idea of “ buying the dip ” is simple but powerful: accumulate assets when prices fall, and profit when they rebound. In crypto, this strategy has proven successful across multiple cycles. Each major crash has historically been followed by fresh all-time highs as adoption grows and new narratives take over. With Bitcoin ETFs now approved and Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades strengthening its fundamentals, the long-term trend remains bullish – even if short-term moves spark fear. Smart Strategies for Investors Jumping into the market without preparation can be risky. That’s why seasoned investors stick to strategies such as: Doing solid research (DYOR): Strong fundamentals and real-world use cases separate lasting projects from short-lived hype. Using dollar-cost averaging (DCA): Spreading investments over time helps smooth out volatility. Following sentiment indexes: Extreme Fear has historically been a strong buy signal, while Extreme Greed often signals overheated conditions. Exploring altcoins cautiously: While Bitcoin and Ethereum form the backbone of most portfolios, carefully selected altcoins often outperform in bull runs. How This New Altcoin Takes the Market by Storm While investors are patiently waiting for the altcoin boom, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a rare opportunity for those who get in early. The project has already raised millions , drawn a fast-growing community, and completed audits, making it one of the few newcomers that is consistently compared to some of the top tokens . Early adopters have seen major returns, and many believe this could just be the beginning as future exchange listings unlock wider access. In a market where timing is everything, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a name that forward-thinking investors don’t want to overlook. The Bigger Picture Despite the short-term volatility, institutional interest in crypto continues to grow, and blockchain technology is embedding itself deeper into global finance. If history is any guide, today’s dip will one day look like a massive discount. The key is patience, strategy, and the courage to act when others hesitate.

This Could Be The Signal To Watch,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bottom-could-be-the-signal-to-watch/,"On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed how the Bitcoin price often forms local bottoms when this holder group shows capitulation. Bitcoin STHs Are Currently Participating In Mild Loss Realization In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about how short-term price action is often dictated by the top buyers’ reaction to post-ATH drawdowns. As the price slides down, these holders quickly get into losses and can become prone to making panic moves. Related Reading: Altseason Things: Ethereum Perps Volume Sets New Record Against Bitcoin Bitcoin is currently in such a phase, with a notable amount of supply having a cost basis in the zone between the latest spot price and $120,000, as the below chart shows. The indicator in the graph is the Cost Basis Distribution, which tells us, as its name suggests, how much of the BTC supply last changed hands at the various price levels. From the metric’s data, it’s apparent that investors have slowly been building up a dense supply cluster below $120,000 as the asset has been trading inside the range since early July. The recent Bitcoin price plunge naturally put these investors underwater, so the question is: how have these holders been reacting? An indicator that can help shed light on the matter is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). This metric compares the amount of profit and loss that the investors as a whole are realizing on the network. When the value of the SOPR is greater than 1, it means the average holder is selling their coins at a profit. On the other hand, it being below the threshold suggests loss-taking is dominant on the network. In the current discussion, the SOPR of the entire market isn’t of interest, but rather that of a specific part of it: the top buyers. These would be the investors who got into the cryptocurrency over the last three months. Here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR for the investor cohorts falling in this age range: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR has dropped for all three of 1 day to 1 week, 1 week to 1 month, and 1 month to 3 months groups following the price decline. The indicator is now floating between 0.96 to 1.01 across these cohorts, indicating these investors have started selling at a mild loss. “If pressure builds, local bottoms often form when this group capitulates, typically when SOPR drops below ~0.9,” notes Glassnode.

Four Major South Korean Financial Groups Looking Into Stablecoins As reported by YonHap , major South Korean financial groups will see their top executives meeting with Tether and Circle this week. Tether and Circle are the issuers of the two largest stablecoins : USDT and USDC, respectively. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that have their price pegged to a fiat currency. This means that unlike assets such as Bitcoin, these tokens normally don’t face any major fluctuations, hence the “stable” in their name. South Korea has been making a push toward digital assets and stablecoins under the leadership of pro-crypto President Lee Jae Myung. One of the promises made by the President was to establish a market for Korean won-based stablecoins. The country’s financial regulator is expected to release its stablecoin framework in October, as Bitcoinist reported earlier in the week. Now, it seems major players in the country are also laying the groundwork for diving into the space. As per the report, Shinhan Financial Group CEO Jin Ok-dong and Hana Financial Group CEO Ham Young-joo are set to have separate meetings with Heath Tarbert, the president of Circle, on Friday. The latter is also expected to meet with a Tether official. Two other big financial groups, KB Financial Group and Woori Bank, will also see executives meeting with Tarbert, but the details of their talks aren’t yet known to the public. YonHap notes, The banking heads are expected to discuss areas of partnership, including the distribution and transactions of dollar-pegged stablecoins in South Korea, as well as the issuance of won-backed stablecoins. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong launched its legislation on stables at the start of this month. Big names like Standard Chartered in its joint-venture have lined up to obtain an issuer license in the city. Speaking of stablecoins, on-chain data shows the Tron network has observed huge shifts from USDT mega wallets in the past day, as explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post . As the above chart displays, 57% of the latest USDT transactions on the blockchain involved a size greater than $100 million, indicating elevated activity from institutional-grade entities. In total, the largest of USDT wallets on Tron have seen a balance change of a whopping $6.95 billion alongside these transactions. BTC Price Bitcoin fell under $112,000 earlier in the day, but it appears the cryptocurrency has found a slight rebound as its price is back at $113,700.",Stablecoin|Circle|South Korea|South korea stablecoins|Stablecoins|Stables|Tether,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|ASIA|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 01:00:53

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic place, constantly shifting between periods where Bitcoin leads the charge and times when altcoins shine. Understanding these cycles is crucial for any investor. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index, a key metric, stands at 49, indicating we are firmly in a ‘Bitcoin Season’. This means the market’s momentum is heavily favoring Bitcoin over other digital assets. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap. It helps investors gauge the overall sentiment and performance across the broader crypto market. Essentially, it tells us whether Bitcoin or altcoins are currently outperforming. The index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing purely on the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization over the past 90 days. For the market to be in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day period. Conversely, if 25% or fewer altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is considered to be in ‘Bitcoin Season’. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. The current reading of 49, as reported on August 23rd at 00:30 UTC, signifies that less than 75% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin recently. This clearly places us in a Bitcoin-dominated phase. Why Are We Currently in Bitcoin Season? The Altcoin Season Index registered 49, up seven points from the previous day’s figure. Despite this slight increase, the number remains below the critical 75 threshold required for a true Altcoin Season . This suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance is currently robust, influencing the entire market. Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin Season: Market Uncertainty: During periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer, more established asset compared to the higher-risk altcoins. Bitcoin Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin tends to lead market rallies, especially around its halving events, before capital eventually flows into altcoins. Institutional Adoption: Increased institutional interest, such as Bitcoin ETF approvals, often bolsters Bitcoin’s price and market share first. Consequently, many altcoins might experience sideways movement or even declines while Bitcoin consolidates its gains or continues its upward trajectory. Understanding this dynamic is vital for making informed investment decisions. Navigating the Current Market: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? Being in a Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean altcoins are without potential, but it does suggest a different strategy might be necessary. It’s a time for careful consideration and perhaps a shift in focus. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Holdings: Consider if your portfolio is overly exposed to altcoins that are underperforming. Diversification remains key, but a temporary tilt towards Bitcoin might be prudent. Research Projects: Use this period to research promising altcoin projects with strong fundamentals, solid roadmaps, and innovative technology. These could be the first to rebound when Altcoin Season eventually returns. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market fluctuations. This strategy can help mitigate risk and build positions in quality assets over time. Monitor Key Metrics: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index, Bitcoin dominance charts, and overall market sentiment for signs of a shift. Remember, market cycles are a natural part of the cryptocurrency landscape. Patience and strategic planning are your best allies. When Will Altcoin Season Return? Predicting the exact return of Altcoin Season is challenging, but historical patterns offer some clues. Typically, after a strong Bitcoin run, capital tends to ‘rotate’ from Bitcoin into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. This rotation often begins once Bitcoin’s dominance peaks or shows signs of consolidation. Key indicators to watch for a potential shift: Bitcoin Dominance Chart: A sustained decline in Bitcoin dominance (the percentage of the total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin) often signals the start of altcoin outperformance. Increased Trading Volume in Altcoins: A significant surge in trading volume for a wide range of altcoins, especially those outside the top 10, can be an early sign. Breakout in Major Altcoins: When Ethereum (ETH) and other large-cap altcoins begin to make significant gains against Bitcoin, it often precedes a broader altcoin rally. While the Altcoin Season Index at 49 suggests we are not there yet, the crypto market is always evolving. Staying informed and prepared will allow you to capitalize on future opportunities. The Altcoin Season Index provides a clear snapshot of the current crypto market dynamics. With the index at 49, it’s evident that Bitcoin currently holds the reins, leading the market. However, this period offers a valuable opportunity for investors to refine their strategies, research emerging projects, and prepare for the inevitable return of Altcoin Season . Understanding these cycles is not just about knowing where we are, but also about anticipating where we might be headed next. Stay informed, stay strategic, and be ready for the next wave of innovation and growth in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does the Altcoin Season Index measure? A1: The Altcoin Season Index measures the percentage of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps indicate whether the market is in a Bitcoin-led or altcoin-led phase. Q2: What index score indicates a true Altcoin Season? A2: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season, the index needs to register 75 or higher. This means 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Q3: How does Bitcoin Season differ from Altcoin Season? A3: Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. In contrast, Altcoin Season means 75% or more altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Q4: What should investors do during Bitcoin Season? A4: During Bitcoin Season, investors often consider re-evaluating their altcoin exposure, researching promising projects, practicing dollar-cost averaging, and monitoring key market indicators for signs of a shift back to Altcoin Season. Q5: Can the Altcoin Season Index change quickly? A5: Yes, while the index considers a 90-day period, market sentiment and performance can shift relatively quickly. Daily updates help track these movements, though a sustained trend is needed for a full season change. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

Their rise is no accident. Community-driven hype, viral trends, and explosive tokenomics have transformed meme coins from internet novelties into high-potential assets. Investors are now flocking to presales, where early access often results in exponential returns. Among this surge of contenders, one whitelist is stealing the spotlight. MoonBull, Mog Coin, Neiro, and Notcoin are drawing sharp attention as the top cryptos to join in 2025. With whitelist activity heating up, the opportunity to get in early could be the game-changing move that separates MoonBull ($MOBU) from other projects. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull ($MOBU) is an Ethereum meme coin engineered for those who thrive on volatility, culture, and high-stakes returns. Crafted for meme coin enthusiasts and degen traders, MoonBull taps into the viral energy of crypto while offering a deeply rewarding ecosystem. The real headline? The MoonBull whitelist is officially live, creating a rare gateway to a presale that feels more like early access to a digital gold rush. This isn’t just a signup – it’s an opportunity vault. Whitelist members gain exclusive early entry to Stage One at the lowest available price point, long before the public gets a glimpse. But that’s only the beginning. Benefits of joining the MoonBull whitelist include: Secret staking rewards with high-yield potential Bonus token allocations are available only to whitelisted wallets Private hints and previews of upcoming roadmap milestones Advanced notice of the exact Stage One launch date Priority access before the general public The clock is ticking. This is a first-come, first-served opportunity with limited spots available. Once the whitelist closes, this window shuts permanently – those left out may end up watching from the sidelines as MoonBull takes off. Reality Check: What If You Miss the Whitelist? Picture a trader watching SHIB skyrocket in 2021 after skipping its presale. Regret lingers. Now imagine a similar story unfolding – but this time, it’s MoonBull. Ignoring the whitelist could mean missing out on the year’s most talked-about launch. MoonBull’s ecosystem is structured to reward early movers. Staking incentives and secret drops are strictly reserved for whitelist users. Unlike traditional presales, MoonBull isn’t broadcasting details to the public. Everything remains under wraps until it’s too late. This creates an environment of high value and limited access. It’s engineered for rapid sell-outs. This exclusive system explains why MoonBull is dominating the conversation about the top cryptos to join in 2025. It combines the cultural firepower of meme coins with DeFi-grade infrastructure. Ethereum’s smart contract reliability meets a token built for virality and value. Why MoonBull made this list: It provides the earliest access, highest rewards, and most private launch insights in the meme coin sector. Few tokens offer this level of exclusivity and upside potential. 2. Mog Coin ($MOG) Mog Coin ($MOG) was created with one simple idea: let memes rule the markets. Born on Ethereum, MOG is built for fast-moving traders and community-driven energy. What makes Mog stand out is its organic virality. Without the need for centralized endorsements or elaborate tokenomics, it gained traction purely through meme culture. Its liquidity is strong, thanks to a dedicated base of holders and near-constant social media buzz. This has created a positive feedback loop – more hype drives volume, and more volume keeps MOG trending. What really sets MOG apart is its simplicity. The tokenomics don’t promise the world. Instead, they ensure accessibility and reward community loyalty. That authenticity is rare in a sea of overengineered coins. Why Mog Coin made this list: Its unmatched community energy and proven viral mechanics make MOG one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. 3. Neiro ($NEIRO) Neiro ($NEIRO) is carving out a niche few meme coins dare to approach: AI-powered engagement fused with meme culture. Neiro introduces an ecosystem where users interact with AI-generated companions, earning tokens and upgrades through conversations, games, and missions. Neiro’s tokenomics are also worth noting. The supply curve is designed to reward early adopters with increased yields and access to premium AI features. Strategic partnerships with NFT platforms and gaming protocols add another layer of utility, something many meme coins lack. Its upcoming roadmap includes metaverse integrations and custom AI personality upgrades. This innovation, coupled with meme coin aesthetics, creates a hybrid model that feels both fun and functional. Why Neiro made this list: It combines meme coin appeal with next-gen AI engagement, making it a standout among the top cryptos to join in 2025. 4. Notcoin ($NOT) Notcoin ($NOT) plays with crypto’s sense of irony. It markets itself as the “coin that does nothing,” yet in doing so, it’s become one of the most interesting meme coins of the year. Built on the Telegram Open Network (TON), Notcoin leverages gamified mining and viral campaigns to engage users directly through Telegram bots. Notcoin’s campaign mechanics include time-based mining, team competitions, and loyalty rewards. This dynamic has converted casual users into long-term holders. Behind the scenes, the TON blockchain provides scalability and low fees, making mass participation sustainable. Its roadmap hints at monetizing attention with ad-based models and micro-tipping features – putting user activity at the center of token value. Why Notcoin made this list: It turns simplicity into strength and has onboarded millions into crypto with a meme-first, user-centric model. Clearly, one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. Final Words Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to join in 2025 include MoonBull, Mog Coin, Neiro, and Notcoin. Each token brings something unique to the table – Mog’s meme momentum, Neiro’s AI innovation, Notcoin’s Telegram simplicity – but MoonBull stands above the rest with its first-come, first-served whitelist model. Early adopters are lining up to grab a spot before the details go public. Presales provide access to high-ROI entry points, and MoonBull’s whitelist is opening the door for serious traders and curious newcomers alike. Those who miss it might be watching from the sidelines as Moon Bull hits the next level. For those who act now, it could be the most strategic entry of the year. For More Information: Website: https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram: https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter: https://x.com/MoonBullX Frequently Asked Questions for Next-Level Moves, Next-Level Gains What makes MoonBull’s whitelist unique compared to other presales? MoonBull’s whitelist offers the lowest entry price, exclusive staking rewards, bonus allocations, and private roadmap hints, creating a distinct advantage for early supporters. Why are meme coins still relevant in 2025? Meme coins remain relevant due to their cultural resonance, community engagement, and potential for rapid value appreciation in both retail and speculative markets. How can new investors manage risk in meme coin investments? By diversifying holdings, entering projects with strong communities and utility, and securing early-stage positions such as presales or whitelists. Which meme coin is best to buy now? MoonBull stands out for its whitelist access, lowest entry price, and exclusive rewards, making it a strong contender for early-stage gains. How to pick a good meme coin? Look for strong community engagement, transparent tokenomics, and unique utility that can sustain value beyond initial hype.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, MATIC, Arbitrum, and Aave are being ranked among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. Here’s why traders are watching them closely. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Community-Driven Altcoin With Security at Its Core MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining traction as one of the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. Built on a zero-tax and transparent framework, the project has attracted wide interest for its community-first approach and verified smart contract audits. With early metrics already surpassing other meme-inspired assets, MAGACOIN combines cultural appeal with real DeFi use cases. Analysts argue that the blend of meme culture and serious utility gives it staying power in a crowded market. Traders looking for early-stage altcoins are paying close attention to MAGACOIN as listings approach. Cardano Sentiment Amid Market Moves Cardano is also ranked among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. The token surged over 130% since July before cooling off near $0.85. While some see this as a healthy pause, others worry the uptrend may be losing steam. At the same time, debates inside the Cardano community around treasury allocation and governance have created a split in sentiment. With a pending audit report due to address older financial concerns, ADA’s next move could be shaped by both price action and community confidence. Polygon (MATIC/POL): Strength in DeFi and Enterprise Adoption Polygon remains in focus as one of the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook, driven by fresh growth in DeFi and corporate adoption. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) hit $1.23 billion in 2025, fueled by activity on QuickSwap, Polymarket, and record stablecoin settlements. Polygon Labs is also pushing for enterprise use cases, framing the network as a reliable backbone for tokenized assets and on-chain finance. With more than 97% of holders upgrading from MATIC to POL, the project continues to solidify its place in the market. Arbitrum (ARB): Expanding Into Public Finance and GameFi Arbitrum is earning its place among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook thanks to new partnerships and ecosystem growth. The state of Wyoming selected Arbitrum to help launch its stablecoin FRNT, a U.S. Treasury-backed digital asset — a first for blockchain-based public finance. Beyond this, a proposal to integrate Ronin, the network behind Axie Infinity, into Arbitrum Orbit could introduce over 1 million new users. These developments highlight the network’s growing relevance in both institutional finance and gaming. Aave (AAVE): Growing Through Institutional Collaboration Aave is also ranked among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. The DAO recently partnered with Kraken’s Ink Foundation, enabling its V3 protocol to power lending on Kraken’s new Layer 2 network. This deal includes a revenue-sharing model, marking a fresh pathway for predictable returns. At the same time, integration with Pendle Finance has fueled billions in fixed-income exposure, boosting Aave’s role as a key DeFi infrastructure. Its mix of enterprise adoption and yield-driven strategies continues to draw interest from traders. What Traders Should Do Next For traders seeking exposure to the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook, diversification across proven ecosystems and community-driven projects is key. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as an early-stage opportunity with momentum building quickly. With listings expected soon, timing could be critical.

This is the incredible story of an anonymous ETH whale , a colossal holder of Ethereum, who recently saw their dormant holdings swell by an astonishing $120 million in unrealized profits. This significant event, brought to light by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X , highlights the immense potential of long-term cryptocurrency investment and the power of patience in the digital asset space. How Did One ETH Whale Achieve Such Astonishing Profits? This particular ETH whale address, after lying dormant for an incredible seven years, has suddenly shown signs of life, revealing its massive gains. Over just the past four days, the unrealized profits surged by a staggering $120 million. This monumental jump in value is directly tied to the address’s substantial holdings. The whale currently holds 105,599 ETH in spot holdings. The average cost basis for this impressive stash is reported at $4,284 per ETH. Considering current market movements, the address now boasts an unrealized profit of $50.03 million on these specific holdings alone. Such figures are not just numbers; they represent a dramatic shift in wealth for a single, patient entity. What Impact Could This ETH Whale Have on the Market? When an ETH whale stirs, the crypto market often pays close attention. These large holders possess enough capital to significantly influence price action, whether through buying pressure or selling pressure. However, it’s crucial to remember that this whale’s profits are currently ‘unrealized,’ meaning the ETH has not yet been sold. This dormancy, followed by such immense gains, sparks curiosity among investors. Will this whale decide to take profits, potentially introducing a large sell-off into the market? Or will they continue to hold, signaling strong confidence in Ethereum’s future trajectory? Potential Market Ripple: A large sell-off could create downward pressure. Investor Sentiment: Continued holding might boost confidence. Liquidity Implications: Any movement impacts the overall market liquidity. The actions of such a large holder can send ripples across the entire ecosystem, affecting investor sentiment and overall market stability. Monitoring these movements provides valuable insights into potential market shifts. Is This ETH Whale a Blueprint for Long-Term Crypto Success? The story of this ETH whale serves as a powerful testament to the ‘HODL’ philosophy in cryptocurrency investing. Holding assets for extended periods, even through volatile market cycles, can lead to truly remarkable returns. Seven years is a lifetime in the fast-paced crypto world, yet this whale’s patience has paid off handsomely. This case study exemplifies how long-term conviction, combined with an early entry point, can transform an initial investment into a fortune. It encourages investors to consider the potential benefits of looking beyond short-term fluctuations and focusing on the foundational strength and adoption of assets like Ethereum. Key takeaways from this strategy include: Patience is Paramount: Avoid panic selling during dips. Conviction in Assets: Believe in the long-term potential of your chosen cryptocurrencies. Early Entry Advantage: While not always possible, early investment can yield significant returns. How Do Analysts Track an ETH Whale ‘s Dormant Fortune? The transparency of blockchain technology makes stories like this ETH whale ‘s journey discoverable. On-chain analysts, like @ai_9684xtpa , continuously monitor public blockchain data to identify significant movements and patterns. Every transaction, every holding, is recorded on the distributed ledger, albeit anonymously. This level of transparency, while preserving the privacy of the individual, allows for deep insights into market dynamics and investor behavior. It underscores the power of data analytics in understanding the often-complex world of decentralized finance, providing a clear window into even the most dormant of crypto fortunes. The saga of the dormant ETH whale and its stunning $120 million in unrealized profits is more than just a headline; it’s a vivid illustration of the transformative power of long-term crypto investment. It highlights the potential for immense wealth creation, the strategic importance of patient holding, and the invaluable insights provided by on-chain analysis. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, these whale movements remain a fascinating barometer of market sentiment and future possibilities, offering both lessons and inspiration for investors worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions About ETH Whale Profits Q1: What is an ETH whale? A: An ETH whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). Their significant holdings can potentially influence market prices and trends due to their buying or selling power. Q2: What does “unrealized profits” mean? A: Unrealized profits are gains that an investor has on paper from an asset that has increased in value, but which they have not yet “realized” or converted into cash by selling the asset. The profit only becomes realized once the asset is sold. Q3: How can an address remain dormant for seven years? A: An address can remain dormant if the owner chooses not to move or interact with their funds for an extended period. This often indicates a long-term investment strategy, where the investor holds their assets with the expectation of significant future appreciation. Q4: How do analysts track these large holdings? A: Analysts use blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics tools to monitor public blockchain data. Since all transactions and holdings are transparently recorded on the blockchain, they can track the movement and balances of large addresses, even if the identity of the owner remains anonymous. Q5: Does an ETH whale’s activity directly impact the market? A: Yes, the activity of an ETH whale can significantly impact the market. Large purchases can drive prices up, while large sales (taking profits) can cause prices to drop. However, if profits are unrealized and the whale remains dormant, the direct market impact is limited to sentiment rather than immediate price action. Q6: Is it common for crypto investments to yield such high profits? A: While not guaranteed for everyone, early investments in rapidly growing cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, held over long periods, have historically yielded substantial profits for many investors. This particular case highlights an extreme example of such success. Did this incredible story of the ETH whale captivate your interest?

Ondo Finance (ONDO), a prominent blockchain technology firm, is making waves with its recent announcement. They are set to launch tokenized stocks on the Ethereum network, marking a significant milestone for decentralized finance (DeFi). This exciting development, shared via an update on X, confirms the launch date for these innovative assets as September 3. At the time of this publication, ONDO’s native token is trading at approximately $0.9954, showing an impressive 8.49% increase in just the past day, according to CoinMarketCap. This surge highlights the market’s positive anticipation for Ondo Finance’s move into tokenized stocks . What Exactly Are Tokenized Stocks, Anyway? You might be wondering, what are tokenized stocks ? Simply put, they are digital representations of traditional company shares, existing on a blockchain like Ethereum. Think of them as blockchain-based derivatives that mirror the value and performance of real-world equities. When you own tokenized stocks , you effectively hold a token that represents a share in a company. This allows for fractional ownership, meaning you could potentially own a small piece of a high-value stock, something often difficult in traditional markets. This innovative approach blends the best of both traditional finance and the decentralized world. The Compelling Benefits of Tokenized Stocks The introduction of tokenized stocks brings several exciting advantages to the table, transforming how investors can interact with the stock market: Increased Accessibility: These digital assets can lower barriers to entry for global investors. People from various regions might access markets previously unavailable due to geographical restrictions or high minimum investment requirements. Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy fractions of expensive stocks, making high-value assets more affordable and diversified portfolios easier to build. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional exchanges with fixed hours, blockchain-based assets can potentially be traded around the clock, offering greater flexibility. Enhanced Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, providing a transparent and immutable record of ownership. Faster Settlement: Blockchain technology can significantly reduce settlement times from days to mere minutes or even seconds, improving capital efficiency. Ondo Finance’s Vision: Bridging TradFi and DeFi with Tokenized Stocks Ondo Finance has established itself as a key player in bringing real-world assets (RWAs) onto the blockchain. Their decision to launch tokenized stocks on Ethereum aligns perfectly with their mission. Ethereum, being the leading smart contract platform, offers robust security and a vast ecosystem, making it an ideal choice for such an endeavor. This move signifies a deeper integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Ondo Finance aims to unlock liquidity and create new investment opportunities by making traditional equities available in a programmable, permissionless environment. This could attract a new wave of investors who are comfortable with digital assets but also seek exposure to established companies. What Challenges Might Tokenized Stocks Face? While the prospects are bright, the path for tokenized stocks is not without its hurdles. Key challenges include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized securities is still evolving globally. Different jurisdictions may have varying rules, creating complexities for issuance and trading. Liquidity: Initial liquidity for these new assets might be a concern. Building sufficient trading volume will be crucial for their widespread adoption and efficient price discovery. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of these digital assets and protecting against cyber threats remains paramount for investor confidence. Integration with Existing Systems: Seamless integration with traditional financial systems and data providers is essential for broader acceptance. Despite these challenges, the innovation driving tokenized stocks suggests a future where financial markets are more inclusive and efficient. A Glimpse into the Future: The Impact of Tokenized Stocks The launch of tokenized stocks by Ondo Finance could set a precedent for other financial institutions. As blockchain technology matures and regulatory frameworks adapt, we might see a surge in the tokenization of various assets, from real estate to commodities. This shift has the potential to democratize investment, offering unprecedented access and flexibility to a global audience. Ondo Finance is not just launching a product; they are contributing to a paradigm shift in how we perceive and interact with financial assets. This initiative underscores the power of blockchain to innovate beyond cryptocurrencies, bringing tangible value to traditional markets. In conclusion, Ondo Finance’s upcoming launch of tokenized stocks on the Ethereum network on September 3 represents a significant step forward for the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. This development promises increased accessibility, fractional ownership, and 24/7 trading, while also navigating important regulatory and liquidity considerations. As the market eagerly awaits this launch, it is clear that the future of finance is becoming increasingly digital and decentralized, offering exciting new avenues for investors worldwide.

As of today, the cryptocurrency is priced around $115,347, reflecting a 7.7% drop from its peak and a 3% decline over the past week. The downturn highlights a loss of momentum, with market data suggesting reduced demand from buyers on major exchanges. According to recent analysis shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, the decline is closely tied to shifting activity on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume. The analyst, known by the pseudonym Arab Chain, explained that Bitcoin’s downward trajectory this month corresponds with fading buying pressure on Binance. The pattern indicates that sellers have been able to exert more control in recent sessions, with spot market data showing a liquidity exit from buyers. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Volume Signal Nailed The Top & Bottom: Analytics Firm Bitcoin Exchange Data Highlights Reduced Demand Arab Chain’s analysis noted that between early August and August 22, Bitcoin slipped from levels above $123,000 to near $113,000. During the first half of the month, strong waves of buyer activity supported upward price moves. However, as the month progressed, indicators such as Binance’s Volume Delta shifted negative, reflecting a reversal in the balance between buyers and sellers. At one point, net outflows from buyers reached levels close to -$600 million, suggesting that sellers were absorbing liquidity without enough counter-pressure. The analyst emphasized that Binance data carries weight given the platform’s depth and liquidity. A decline in buying activity despite stable overall volume points to a cautious stance from large traders and institutions. Some of the selling may be linked to profit-taking at resistance zones near $120,000, while the lack of strong follow-through buying reduced the likelihood of sustaining higher prices. This pattern reflects how spot market demand remains critical for price stability at elevated levels. Miner Behavior Points to Accumulation Shift In addition to exchange data, unusual activity between miners and Binance has drawn attention. Arab Chain also highlighted an increase in transfers from Binance to miner-linked wallets, a reversal of the more common pattern of miners sending Bitcoin to exchanges for sale. Past episodes of such flows, averaging more than 10 BTC per transaction, preceded rebounds in the market earlier this year. This may suggest that miners are holding back supply or preparing reserves in anticipation of future price strength. The implications of these transfers depend on interpretation. If miners are moving Bitcoin to cold storage, it indicates reduced short-term selling pressure and could support the market by lowering available supply. Related Reading: Why August Could Be Remembered As A Major Trap For Bitcoin And Crypto Market On the other hand, if the transfers represent profit redistribution or eventual liquidation through other channels, the effect may be neutral or even negative. Still, the data points to a strategic shift in miner behavior, adding another layer of complexity to the current correction phase.

The asset has faced repeated resistance levels, slow growth periods, and regulatory uncertainty. Despite these obstacles, some analysts argue that XRP is poised for another significant upward move. Among them is Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-known commentator on X, who recently described the current cycle as “the hardest XRP bull market ever.” Steph congratulated the community, predicting that the faithful XRP holders will soon become rich. XRP Historical Breakout Patterns Steph’s chart highlights a recurring pattern of consolidation below descending trendlines followed by strong breakouts across several years. In 2022, XRP broke out from a prolonged downtrend, initiating a short-lived rally. A similar occurrence followed in 2023, when the pivotal ruling that determined XRP is not a security caused a notable breakout above another descending trendline. While 2023 only saw a brief upward push, the pattern repeated in late 2024 with a stronger move, carrying XRP above the $3 level before entering another consolidation phase . Each breakout has been followed by price surges, although their duration and scale have varied. According to Steph, XRP may now be positioned for a larger move in 2025, potentially mirroring or exceeding past performances. This is the hardest #XRP bull market ever.

XRP remains a divisive asset in the crypto space. While it has many supporters, it has vocal detractors in the form of Bitcoin maximalists, who refuse to acknowledge XRP’s value and other altcoins. However, XRP’s growing community and increasing adoption worldwide have proven its detractors wrong. Other cryptocurrency experts have also weighed in on the asset’s future, with one recent projection suggesting it could reach $60 within a year . XRP has shown notable strength in 2025. The consensus among many top analysts and experts is that it could soon reach double-digit prices. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The market may have hit a slowdown, but investors and traders have continued their never-ending search for the next opportunities. With altcoin and Bitcoin dragging, attention has moved to presale opportunities, especially the best crypto presale to buy now, as the 2025 bull cycle takes shape. Expectedly, established names continue to dominate, but newer entrants with strong narratives are taking over. Three projects in particular—XRP, HBAR, and MAGACOIN FINANCE—are being watched closely for their ability to deliver explosive upside. XRP brings regulatory clarity and institutional support, while HBAR rides on enterprise innovation. A newer player, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is surging on presale momentum to form a trio of the most talked-about lineups for investors this year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rises on 12,500% Opportunity Presale hype is returning to the crypto market, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is the project getting all the attention. Granted, XRP and HBAR are established tokens, but analysts are picking MAGACOIN FINANCE over the two in their list of breakout tokens in 2025. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its community-driven branding and institutional-grade ecosystem. Renowned experts who track early-stage projects say everything about MAGACOIN FINANCE is different when compared with other meme tokens now. Analysts predict investors who get in early could see an incredible 12,500% return on their investments. That explains why crypto market attention is turning to the project by the minute. Even whale investors have picked up, indicating that the price of MAGACOIN FINANCE may explode anytime now. In a market that rewards only those who act fast and smart, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the token everyone is looking at as the best crypto presale to buy in 2025. The window of opportunity to act is fast closing. XRP Holds Investor Attention Meanwhile, XRP is once again in the spotlight, even after recent price declines. While some see the weakness as a buying opportunity, all eyes are on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC recently delayed its decision on multiple XRP ETF applications until October 2025 — a date that could prove decisive for Ripple’s future in U.S. markets. If approved, ETFs would signal major institutional support, potentially lifting XRP back above $3. HBAR Expands Enterprise Reach Hedera (HBAR) is building momentum through enterprise-focused partnerships and ecosystem growth. Despite showing volatility in August, HBAR’s July rally of 85% reminded investors of its upside potential. Analysts warn August has historically been weak for HBAR but highlights bullish catalysts ahead, including speculation around potential BlackRock-linked ETF activity and new tokenized stock launches via Swarm. With steady trading volumes and strong corporate ties, Hedera remains one of the best altcoins to invest in 2025 for those seeking long-term enterprise plays. Conclusion For investors scanning the market for the best crypto presale to buy now, XRP, HBAR, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out for very different reasons. XRP offers regulatory-driven upside, and HBAR brings enterprise adoption. However, crypto traders said MAGACOIN FINANCE’s potential to deliver massive returns to investors makes it a clear winner among the three.

Pennsylvania Lawmakers Push New Ban,https://bitcoinist.com/no-crypto-in-office-pennsylvania-lawmakers-push-new-ban/,"According to reports, a Pennsylvania Democratic lawmaker on Aug. 20 filed a bill that would tighten rules around elected officials and cryptocurrency. Rep. Ben Waxman of District 182 introduced House Bill 1812 with eight Democratic co-sponsors. The measure would bar public officials from profiting from crypto while they hold office, and it carries clear penalties for violations. Who The Bill Would Cover If enacted, HB1812 would change Title 65 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes . It would forbid public officials and their families from making crypto-related transactions over $1,000 while in office and for one year after leaving. Officials who already hold crypto would have to divest within 90 days of the law taking effect. Penalties include fines up to $50,000 and, in serious cases, prison terms of up to five years. The bill now sits in the Pennsylvania House and must clear committee review before a full floor vote. JUST IN: Pennsylvania to ban public officials from owning Bitcoin or crypto if new bill passes. Violations would result in fines or jail time. pic.twitter.com/EUUp7GuqaL — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) August 21, 2025 The Move Ties To High-Profile Crypto Activity Based on reports, Waxman framed the bill as a response to high-profile crypto ties at the federal level. He singled out US President Donald Trump, saying the president’s growing crypto ventures — from memecoins tied to his name to projects under World Liberty Financial — raise ethical concerns. Critics in Waxman’s camp argue these ventures can blur the line between public duty and private gain. Allegations have circulated that the Official Trump token and related projects cost investors large sums, and those claims have helped fuel calls for tighter rules. Federal Proposals Mirror State Effort Democratic lawmakers in Congress have floated similar ideas, including the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act and the COIN Act. Those bills would bar the president, vice president, members of Congress, and their families from issuing or promoting tokens while in office. Reports disclose that figures like Rep. Maxine Waters have warned that tokens tied to political figures could be used by foreign actors to influence or exploit markets. That warning has been part of the broader push to add guardrails around digital currency and public office. What Supporters And Critics Say Supporters of HB1812 say the measure is a straightforward ethics rule: no public servant should enrich themselves through crypto schemes while in office. They argue the sector’s volatility and light regulation make it especially prone to abuse. Opponents are likely to call the bill overly broad or say it could chill private investment by public servants, though formal Republican responses to the bill were not detailed in the initial filing.

Still, he believes recent movements in the market signal a change for digital asset treasury (DAT) firms determined on stockpiling. “Bitcoin treasury companies have been an incredible innovation for the space. What may be fading is the ability to get a 3x return,” Reeds told The Block on Friday. “MicroStrategy in the last five years did 24X versus Bitcoin, which did 10X. I can’t see that happening again.” Bitcoin Treasury boom cools as market cap slides below $4 trillion Signs that the once red-hot Bitcoin treasury boom is cooling have been visible for over a week. Inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy playbook, many firms have rushed to load up on BTC, but some are now trimming their holdings or even buying back stock. After crypto’s total market capitalization recently peaked at nearly $4.3 trillion, it slid below $4 trillion, with the combined market cap of DATs dropping under $150 billion. The aggregate value of Bitcoin treasuries also slipped from $165 billion a month ago to $134 billion, despite BTC’s price remaining relatively stable. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Bitcoin dropped 2.2% to about $115,000, while Ether slid 4% to below $4,300. Bitcoin had set a new all-time high of $125,514 just days earlier, and Ethereum came within $100 of its November 2021 peak. The surge was fueled by strong institutional demand, led by crypto treasury firms. Strategy remains the most aggressive player, holding nearly $73 billion of Bitcoin. Strategy’s stock price, which reached a July high of about $455, has since fallen to around $359 as of Friday, while Tokyo-listed Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has seen its shares plunge over 30% in the past month. Saylor has never sold a token since his company began buying in 2020, making it the largest Bitcoin holder in the world. Others quickly copied his strategy, like Metaplanet, a Japanese hotel firm that shifted into Bitcoin and accumulated $2.2 billion, now down 50% since mid-June. “What’s fading is the ability to create unique propositions,” Reeds said. “Most CEOs of digital asset companies claim their mission is to generate more Bitcoin per share than the market — but do they really have the management teams or capital connections to outperform the underlying asset?” Still, broader market sentiment improved on Friday as the total crypto market cap rebounded above $4.1 trillion. Ethereum (+13.33%), Solana, and Dogecoin all rallied following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s strongest signal yet of an upcoming interest rate cut. Ledn expands with private wealth program amid growing demand for BTC-backed loans Ledn, the Bitcoin-focused lending platform co-founded by Reeds, recently announced that it has processed more than $10 billion in loans to date. The firm also launched a Private Wealth program designed for high-net-worth individuals and institutions seeking to unlock liquidity from long-term BTC holdings without selling. According to a press release, the program caters to clients with at least $250,000 in active loans. It offers benefits such as faster processing, personalized service, and access to dedicated account managers. “Bitcoin-backed loans are going mainstream. Our most sophisticated clients are using them to fund everything from real estate to new businesses, while keeping upside exposure,” said Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Ledn. “The Private Wealth program gives them the tools, speed, and trust to operate at scale.” The launch arrives when Bitcoin-collateralized lending is gaining increasing interest from traditional finance companies. JPMorgan recently showed an interest in crypto-backed loans, underscoring the sector’s trend toward mainstream finance. Ledn says it has already established the infrastructure for custody, risk management, and loan liquidation to ramp up. The program offering includes preferential rates for loans $1m+, automatic loan rebalancing for loans when the collateral value increases relative to the loan for all clients , and private wealth clients receive an additional complimentary rebalance once per month, in addition to the standard feature. Ledn clients are also given access to the company leadership team and exclusive events. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

While the Solana price (SOL price) hovers near $182, attracting attention with bullish chart setups, a new challenger named A rctic Pablo Coin (APC) is racing through its presale stages with unprecedented excitement. Stage 37, dubbed Ice Ice Baby, is already over 98% filled, making this a make-or-break moment for investors who want in before the listing climbs to $0.008. Even more enticing, APC is offering a limited 100% bonus with the code BONUS100, doubling tokens instantly for early entrants. Meanwhile, other meme-driven projects are stirring the waters. Bonk (BONK), once the Solana ecosystem’s breakout meme coin, is wrestling with sell pressure and Fibonacci retracement levels. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) recently saw whales scoop up and dump massive positions after a sharp rally to $1.10, raising eyebrows across the crypto crowd. But it’s the Arctic Pablo Coin presale that’s creating genuine frenzy, combining mythical storytelling with eye-watering ROI projections. This article takes readers through the latest journeys of Arctic Pablo Coin, Bonk, and Fartcoin, while weaving in updates about the Solana price momentum that links them all together. Arctic Pablo Coin’s 100% Bonus Presale and the Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential Could Arctic Pablo Coin be the breakout story the market has been waiting for? At its heart lies a mythical narrative: the adventurer Arctic Pablo uncovers shimmering APC tokens in icy worlds, offering gateways to prosperity unlike anything the crypto market has seen. Beyond the imaginative tale, the presale economics are engineered to excite even the most cautious investors. Stage 37 is now nearly complete, with APC priced at just $0.00088. Over $3.55 million has already been raised, and whales have started buying heavily, signaling momentum that smaller investors rarely ignore. At launch, APC will be listed at $0.008, locking in an immediate 809% ROI for today’s buyers. Analysts, however, are pushing the narrative further, eyeing an 11,263.63% ROI if APC climbs to the projected $0.1 target. To sweeten the deal, investors who enter now can use BONUS100 to double their holdings. That means a $5,000 investment today at $0.00088 buys 5.68 million APC, instantly doubled to 11.36 million APC with the bonus. At listing ($0.008), this stash is worth around $90,880. If the analyst’s forecast of $0.1 holds, the same tokens could balloon into $1.13 million, turning modest investments into millionaire-level outcomes. Time to Charge Ahead With Arctic Pablo Coin or Regret it Later Every presale has a hook, but Arctic Pablo delivers a cocktail of fantasy, tokenomics, and sustainability. The 66% APY staking program adds passive income after launch, while its deflationary burn mechanism permanently eliminates unsold tokens each week. This keeps the circulating supply scarce and enhances long-term value for holders. APC accepts multiple currencies, including BTC, ETH, SOLANA, and XRP, making it accessible to a broad investor base. What makes APC stand out is not just the math of gains but the urgency. With Stage 37 at 98% complete and the limited-time 100% bonus hanging in the balance, investors are sensing that this meme coin presale is nearing its inflection point. Once the presale closes, APC jumps to $0.008 at listing, and the easy multipliers vanish. That’s why the buzz around APC feels electric—it’s a chance to enter a presale where whales and retail buyers are aligned, and the rewards are too big to ignore. BONK at Critical Support While Solana Price Shapes Its Next Move While Arctic Pablo Coin prepares for liftoff, Bonk (BONK) is trying to hold the line. Currently priced near $0.0000214, BONK has dipped 13% in the past week and sits at a critical support level around $0.000025. Technical charts show a potential “cup-and-handle” setup, meaning BONK could rebound if bulls return. However, the heavy supply of tokens continues to weigh it down, making the dream of $1 valuations mathematically impossible given its trillion-level supply. Still, BONK maintains deep liquidity on the Solana ecosystem, with strong integration into Solana DeFi apps like Jupiter and NFT platforms like Magic Eden. Institutional moves, including a $25 million injection from Safety Shot Inc., show there’s still faith in BONK’s narrative. But for now, BONK’s trajectory will likely mirror the Solana price momentum, making its short-term fate tied to how SOL handles support and resistance. Fartcoin Volatility as Whales Dominate Price Action Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) has epitomized meme coin volatility. Priced around $0.88–$0.89, it has seen 14–21% weekly declines after peaking near $1.10 in mid-August. That rally was fueled by nearly $650 million in volume and a wave of whale inflows. Yet, within days, whales unloaded 32.75 million coins, stripping away some of the momentum and leaving smaller holders nervous. Despite this, analysts are eyeing another run. Some suggest FARTCOIN could test the $3–$5 range, potentially offering 2–5x returns from its current level. With a near $890 million market cap, FARTCOIN is still one of the bigger meme coins in play, but its swings show how fragile meme-driven projects can be once large holders dominate. Like BONK, its movements often rhyme with wider market signals, particularly Solana price trends that drive liquidity. Solana Price Momentum Signals New Highs Ahead The Solana price (SOL price) is currently hovering near $182.75, after dipping slightly in the past week, but traders are closely watching its next move. Despite short-term pullbacks, Solana remains one of the year’s strongest performers, still up more than 27% since January. Technical charts are hinting at a potential breakout, with a bull-flag pattern forming and support levels holding steady in the $175–$180 range. If SOL can clear resistance between $190 and $205, analysts believe it could run toward $225 to $260—levels not seen since its earlier peak cycle. Momentum indicators like RSI and moving averages also suggest strength is returning to the asset, adding to the optimism. However, weaker trading volumes and drying liquidity leave some investors cautious, with bears arguing that a drop to $160 is still on the cards if key supports fail. Beyond technicals, Solana continues to attract attention from U.S. investors eyeing possible altcoin ETFs, as well as retail users exploring its DeFi and NFT platforms. For meme coins like BONK that are tightly connected to the Solana ecosystem, every movement in the SOL price can alter liquidity flows. That’s why SOL’s momentum is more than just a headline—it’s a barometer for risk appetite across the meme coin sector. Wrapping Up: Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential Is Here for the Grabs Every bull run needs its defining story. BONK is wrestling with support, FARTCOIN is proving just how wild meme coins can get, and Solana is trading at $182, eyeing a potential run toward $260 if bullish momentum continues. Yet, the most compelling narrative belongs to Arctic Pablo Coin, with its presale frenzy, deflationary burns, and irresistible BONUS100 offer. Based on investor activity and analysts’ targets, APC is shaping up to be the best crypto coin with 100x potential for this cycle. The presale is closing in on its final bonus stage, and those who wait could miss out on gains that transform a modest $5,000 into six or seven figures. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a story of mythical adventure, wealth creation, and urgency rolled into one. For those ready to act, the presale door is still open—but not for long. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions for the Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential Which meme coin to buy right now? Among trending coins, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out due to its presale ROI potential of 11,263.63% and a 100% bonus offer for early buyers. How does the Solana price affect meme coins like BONK and Fartcoin? BONK is directly tied to the Solana ecosystem, while Fartcoin often mirrors broader market liquidity. When SOL price rallies, these meme coins tend to gain strength. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin unique? Its 66% APY staking, deflationary burns, and bonus stage presale structure set it apart, blending mythical storytelling with practical tokenomics. Is Fartcoin still a risky investment? Yes, Fartcoin’s whale-driven sell-offs show it can surge quickly but also collapse just as fast, making it speculative for most investors. What is the biggest crypto presale in 2025? Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as one of the biggest presales of 2025, raising millions in stage 37 and offering a limited bonus for early entrants. Summary Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is storming through its presale, offering investors massive ROI potential of 11,263.63% and a 100% bonus with code BONUS100. While Solana price momentum influences market trends, BONK and Fartcoin face mixed fortunes. BONK is stuck at critical support, and Fartcoin is swinging wildly on whale trades. The clear front-runner for those seeking the best crypto coin with 100x potential is Arctic Pablo Coin, with its storytelling, staking, token burns, and presale bonus making it an unmissable opportunity.

While BNB and Ethereum continue to dominate market capitalization and adoption, analysts are now spotlighting MAGACOIN Finance as the standout candidate for exponential gains. With institutional players and whale wallets steadily accumulating, forecasts are stretching as high as 55x returns, making MAGACOIN one of the most closely watched tokens heading into the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Whales Drive Rotation Into High-Upside Presales As price predictions tighten, large investors are increasingly positioning into MAGACOIN Finance. Analysts say this rotation reflects a calculated bid to capture early-stage multiples that majors like Ethereum and BNB can no longer deliver. Whale wallet accumulation has been a consistent theme, and retail inflows are following suit, creating steady demand pressure in the presale phase. Market sentiment has shifted as projections have grown more ambitious. Some forecasts place MAGACOIN Finance within the 33x to 35x range, while others stretch to 50x and even 55x returns if adoption catalysts align. For many analysts, the conviction behind these projections is not simply about hype. MAGACOIN Finance benefits from presale structures designed to attract both retail and institutional participation, and the combination of whale inflows with grassroots momentum is seen as a critical driver of potential exponential growth. Compared to the majors, the smaller cap and earlier positioning of MAGACOIN Finance offer the kind of upside that has historically fueled some of crypto’s biggest stories. BNB — Blue-Chip Stability, But Limited Multiples BNB remains a cornerstone asset for many investors, backed by the Binance exchange ecosystem and a track record of sustained adoption. It continues to serve as a utility token for trading discounts, launchpad allocations, and ecosystem governance. However, analysts are quick to note that BNB’s large-cap status limits its upside in percentage terms. While BNB has the infrastructure and liquidity to remain relevant through 2025, the likelihood of it delivering more than 5x to 7x returns is considered low compared with emerging presale opportunities. This has prompted institutions and high-net-worth investors to diversify into projects like MAGACOIN Finance, where potential multiples are significantly higher. Ethereum — Institutional Favorite With Predictable Growth Ethereum still serves as the foundation of decentralized finance and smart contracts, and its role is unlikely to be displaced in the near term. The network’s recent upgrades have improved scalability and reduced costs, while spot ETH ETFs have attracted billions in institutional inflows. Analysts continue to forecast price targets in the $5,000–$7,000 range for 2025. Yet, for many investors, Ethereum’s predictability is also its limitation. With a market cap firmly in blue-chip territory, Ethereum is less likely to deliver the kind of exponential multiples that smaller, early-stage tokens can. This reality has further fueled the rotation toward MAGACOIN Finance, which is positioned as a high-risk, high-reward alternative. Why Analysts See MAGACOIN as the Smartest Play in 2025 The case for MAGACOIN Finance rests on timing, positioning, and momentum. Institutional players are treating it as a speculative hedge against the limited upside of majors, while retail communities are rallying around its presale structure and narrative. Analysts underline that if upcoming exchange listings and DeFi integrations are executed on schedule, MAGACOIN could enter 2025’s bull market with a unique mix of liquidity, hype, and adoption. This alignment of institutional conviction and community energy is what drives projections as high as 55x ROI. The gap between MAGACOIN and the majors may be wide in scale, but in terms of percentage growth, the presale coin is increasingly seen as the smarter play for investors willing to accept higher volatility in exchange for the possibility of life-changing returns.

While the anticipation is building, smart investors are already positioning themselves in projects primed to lead the charge. As in all crypto cycles, large-cap tokens are getting the most attention. However, on-chain data reveals a segment of the market is quietly building up their position in MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts are placing on top of their list of the best altcoins to buy now before the market heats up. 1. Solana: Scaling and Adoption Solana’s reputation as one of the fastest blockchains remains intact. Recent network stress tests showed it can handle over 100,000 transactions per second, far ahead of rivals. With a thriving DeFi ecosystem valued above $12 billion and strong developer interest, Solana is positioned to recover quickly from short-term pullbacks. Institutional exposure through futures and ETFs adds another layer of strength for the upcoming bull run. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Spotlight Presale Analysts have placed Solana, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE among the 5 Best Altcoins to Buy before the bull run starts — but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the token stealing the spotlight. So far, the project’s presale has attracted thousands of investors, cementing it as one of the most popular new crypto launches this year. While the momentum is still brewing, early movers can take advantage of a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the exclusive code PATRIOT50X. The window is open, but not for long. Those who remember the early days of Solana and Ethereum will see the similarities between MAGACOIN FINANCE and these established tokens. For those who missed out on previous breakout opportunities, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the next token to shock the market. 3. Ethereum: Institutional Favorite Ethereum continues to prove its staying power as more than just a cryptocurrency. With over $13 billion in spot ETF inflows and corporate treasuries holding billions in ETH, institutional adoption is stronger than ever. Large wallets are steadily moving ETH off exchanges, hinting at long-term accumulation. Despite recent volatility, Ethereum’s role in DeFi and smart contracts makes it a consistent answer for anyone asking what’s the Best Altcoin to Buy Now. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Utility at Scale BNB powers the world’s largest crypto exchange ecosystem and consistently ranks in daily transaction volume. Priced just below $830, it has shown resilience during volatile market weeks. With new projects launching on the BNB Chain and analysts predicting a push toward $1,000, it remains a core altcoin for diversified portfolios. 5. Hyperliquid (HYPE): DeFi Innovator Hyperliquid is gaining traction as one of the most innovative decentralized exchanges. Its multi-quote spot trading upgrade and permissionless liquidity pools have pushed its total value locked close to $3 billion. Whale interest is increasing, and analysts see potential for HYPE to rally toward $60–$70 if momentum continues. For investors willing to take on a newer, higher-risk project, Hyperliquid offers exposure to the next wave of DeFi growth. Conclusion The market is already shaping up and smart investors are racking up their positions in the altcoins highlighted as breakout contenders. Established leaders like Ethereum and Solana will no doubt attract the most excitement, but the strongest excitement is around MAGACOIN FINANCE. For those asking what the best altcoin to buy now is, the answer may lie in balancing proven giants with emerging contenders such as MAGACOIN FINANCE ready to surprise the market.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency has notably fallen below the critical $116,000 mark. This recent movement sees BTC trading at approximately $115,934.27 on the Binance USDT market, a figure that has sparked considerable discussion among traders and investors alike. What does this mean for the market, and how should you navigate these turbulent waters? Understanding the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop This latest Bitcoin price drop isn’t just a number; it reflects broader market dynamics at play. When BTC dips below a psychological or technical support level like $116,000, it often triggers a chain reaction. Investors frequently monitor these key levels, and a breach can signal a shift in market sentiment from bullish to more cautious or even bearish. This particular dip follows a period of heightened volatility, a common characteristic of the crypto landscape. Market Sentiment: A drop often signals a shift in investor confidence. Technical Levels: Breaching key support levels can accelerate downward trends. Liquidation Events: Significant drops can trigger automatic sell-offs for leveraged positions. What Factors Are Driving This BTC Price Decline? Several factors could contribute to such a swift Bitcoin price drop . While no single cause is usually responsible, a combination of macroeconomic trends, whale activity, and technical indicators often plays a role. For instance, global economic uncertainties can push investors towards safer assets, reducing appetite for riskier ones like cryptocurrencies. Similarly, large institutional players, often called “whales,” executing significant sell orders can create considerable market pressure. Moreover, the crypto market is highly reactive to news and regulatory developments. Any hint of stricter regulations or negative sentiment from influential figures can lead to immediate price corrections. Technical analysis also plays a part; if key resistance levels are not breached, or if bearish patterns emerge on price charts, traders might opt to take profits, further contributing to a decline. Impact of the Bitcoin Price Drop on the Broader Crypto Market Bitcoin’s dominance means that its price movements often ripple across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. When there’s a significant Bitcoin price drop , altcoins frequently follow suit, albeit sometimes with greater volatility. This phenomenon is often referred to as “Bitcoin’s gravity.” Investors holding diversified portfolios might see declines across their holdings, prompting a re-evaluation of their strategies. However, it’s not always doom and gloom. Some analysts view these dips as potential buying opportunities, especially for long-term investors looking to accumulate assets at lower prices. The market’s resilience has been tested many times, and historically, corrections are often followed by periods of recovery. Therefore, understanding the broader market context is crucial. Altcoin Correlation: Most altcoins tend to mirror BTC’s movements. Investor Psychology: Fear can lead to panic selling, while others see opportunities. Long-Term Perspective: Historically, market corrections are part of the crypto cycle. Navigating the Volatility: Your Strategy During a Bitcoin Price Drop For many, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling. However, having a clear strategy can help mitigate risks and even uncover opportunities. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any decisions, understand the underlying reasons for the dip. Is it fundamental or purely speculative? Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions often lead to losses. Consider your long-term investment goals. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. Dips can be good entry points for DCA. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For traders, setting stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the price continues to fall. Diversify Your Portfolio: While BTC influences altcoins, a diversified portfolio can spread risk. Remember, the cryptocurrency market is known for its extreme price swings. Maintaining a calm and analytical approach is key to navigating these periods successfully. Look for credible sources and expert opinions to inform your decisions, rather than reacting solely to short-term fluctuations. The recent dip below $116,000 for BTC serves as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility within the crypto market. While a Bitcoin price drop can be concerning, it also underscores the importance of informed decision-making and a well-thought-out investment strategy. The market is constantly evolving, and staying updated with reliable information is paramount. Whether you see this as a challenge or an opportunity, understanding the dynamics behind such movements empowers you to act wisely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the recent Bitcoin price drop below $116,000? Several factors can contribute to a Bitcoin price drop, including macroeconomic trends, significant sell-offs by large holders (whales), negative regulatory news, and technical indicators signaling bearish sentiment. 2. How does a BTC price drop affect other cryptocurrencies? Due to Bitcoin’s market dominance, a significant BTC price drop often leads to corresponding declines in altcoin prices, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “Bitcoin’s gravity.” 3. Is this Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy BTC? For long-term investors, market dips can present buying opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices. However, it’s crucial to conduct your own research and consider your personal financial situation and risk tolerance before making investment decisions. 4. What strategies can investors use during a volatile Bitcoin price drop? Effective strategies include avoiding panic selling, implementing dollar-cost averaging (DCA), setting stop-loss orders for traders, and diversifying your investment portfolio to manage risk. 5.

The , which accused the popular crypto exchange of violating Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), is now on hold. This pause raises compelling questions about user data, privacy, and the future of Know Your Customer (KYC) processes in the digital asset space. What’s Happening with the Coinbase Privacy Lawsuit? The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division recently issued an order to temporarily halt the lawsuit against Coinbase. This case centers on allegations that the exchange improperly collected and shared biometric data. According to a report by Cointelegraph , the court explained its decision by stating that a stay would: Simplify the issues at hand. Streamline the trial process. Reduce the burden of litigation on both the court and the parties involved. Not unduly prejudice or tactically disadvantage the plaintiffs. This decision means that while the lawsuit isn’t dismissed, its progress is paused for the time being. Understanding the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) To truly grasp the gravity of the , it’s essential to understand BIPA. The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act is a pioneering state law enacted in 2008. It is considered one of the strictest biometric privacy laws in the United States. Essentially, BIPA mandates that companies must: Obtain informed consent before collecting, storing, or sharing biometric data (like face scans, fingerprints, or voiceprints). Provide a publicly available retention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric data. Not profit from a person’s biometric data. This law gives individuals the right to sue companies that violate its provisions, leading to potentially substantial damages. Allegations Against Coinbase: Why the Lawsuit? The lawsuit against Coinbase was initially filed in May. It brought forth serious accusations concerning the exchange’s handling of user data. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase engaged in the “wholesale collection” of faceprints. This collection allegedly occurred during its mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Moreover, the lawsuit asserted that Coinbase shared these sensitive biometric data points with third-party authentication companies. Crucially, these actions were allegedly carried out without obtaining the explicit consent of its users, a direct violation of BIPA’s core requirements. The outcome of this could set a significant precedent for how crypto platforms manage user identity verification. What Does This Suspension Mean for Crypto Users? The temporary halt in the doesn’t diminish the underlying concerns about digital privacy and data security. For Coinbase users, it means the legal battle regarding their biometric data is in a state of limbo. However, it also highlights the increasing scrutiny crypto exchanges face concerning their data handling practices. This case serves as a powerful reminder for all users to carefully review the privacy policies of platforms they use. It emphasizes the importance of understanding what data is collected, how it is used, and with whom it might be shared. The crypto industry, known for its focus on decentralization and privacy, must navigate these legal challenges carefully to maintain user trust. Looking Ahead: The Path Forward While the proceedings are suspended, the is far from over. The court’s decision for a stay suggests a desire to streamline complex legal arguments, perhaps awaiting clarity on related legal matters or allowing parties to explore settlement options. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, so too will the legal frameworks governing it. The resolution of this case will undoubtedly influence how other crypto exchanges approach biometric data collection and privacy compliance moving forward. Summary: A Pause, Not an End, for Coinbase’s Privacy Battle The U.S. court’s decision to temporarily suspend the marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing discussion about digital privacy within the crypto sector. While the immediate legal pressure on Coinbase might be eased, the core issues of biometric data collection and user consent remain paramount. This case underscores the growing importance of robust privacy practices and transparency for all companies operating in the digital realm, especially those handling sensitive user information. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Coinbase privacy lawsuit about? The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase violated Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting users’ faceprints for its KYC process and sharing them with third-party companies without explicit consent. 2. Why did the U.S. court suspend the proceedings? The court suspended the proceedings to simplify issues, streamline the trial, reduce litigation burden, and avoid prejudicing or tactically disadvantaging the plaintiffs. 3. What is the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)? BIPA is an Illinois state law requiring companies to obtain informed consent before collecting, storing, or sharing biometric data, and to have clear data retention and destruction policies. 4. How does this suspension affect Coinbase users? For now, the legal battle regarding user biometric data is on hold. It highlights the importance for users to review privacy policies and understand how their data is handled by crypto platforms. 5. What happens next in this Coinbase privacy lawsuit case? The lawsuit is temporarily paused, but not dismissed. The court may lift the stay at a later date, or the parties might explore settlement options. The case’s eventual resolution will likely set precedents for the crypto industry’s privacy practices.

Among the notable developments, the market’s leading altcoin skyrocketed above the $4,700 mark while recording double-digit gains and edging closer to the $4,878 record highs it reached during the last crypto bull cycle four years ago. After enduring a prolonged phase of consolidation and breakdown, ETH’s recent gains reflect renewed optimism in the market, particularly following comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell. Ethereum, XRP, And BNB Surge Powell’s remarks during his speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium suggested that rate cuts could be on the horizon, a sentiment that tends to favor assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Lower interest rates make investments in stocks and digital currencies more attractive compared to traditional interest-yielding options, such as bonds. Additionally, a reduction in rates typically weakens the dollar, further enhancing the appeal of cryptocurrencies.

XRP rose by 5%, Solana (SOL) saw a 4% gain, and Binance Coin (BNB) surged by 8%, reaching a new record price beyond the $882 mark, which now serves as a resistance level for the token. Manuel Villegas, an analyst at Julius Baer, noted in a research report that the correlation between cryptocurrencies and equities is currently strong. He emphasized that the market mood is likely to be highly responsive to comments from the Jackson Hole meeting of monetary authorities and any subsequent reactions from fiscal authorities. ¿A Bullish Q4 Ahead? On social media platform X (formerly Twitter), market experts weighed in on the implications of Powell’s statements highlighting what could come next for the broader cryptocurrency market. Doctor Profit remarked that Powell’s announcement was the most anticipated event for both the stock and crypto markets, suggesting that the market had already priced in the likelihood of upcoming rate cuts. He cautioned that a “sell the news” reaction could soon occur, as traders might capitalize on the gains made in anticipation of these developments. Related Reading: Dogecoin About To Explode?

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is still far from the record $124,000 level reached last week, despite its 4% surge in the last 24 hours. Trading at $116,000, Bitcoin is still 6% below its all-time high.

Together, they represent meme coin virality, institutional adoption, payments innovation, and early-stage presale hype. But while all four are attracting strong investor interest, MAGACOIN Finance has become the standout, with forecasts pointing to potential substantial gains and presale incentives that are still live for early buyers. XRP (Ripple) — Institutional Tailwinds and Utility Growth Ripple’s XRP remains firmly on analysts’ lists thanks to a wave of institutional momentum. Large investors are leaning into XRP as regulatory clarity improves across multiple regions, and speculation over an eventual ETF approval continues to swirl. These factors have given XRP a renewed position as a lower-risk, utility-driven altcoin for 2025 portfolios. At the same time, XRP maintains its leadership in cross-border transactions, where its fast settlement and low fees make it one of the most efficient blockchain solutions for payments. The token is also pushing further into DeFi, with integrations designed to expand its use beyond simple remittances. Analysts see this mix of regulatory progress and technological expansion as the key to unlocking higher price targets, with many forecasting between $6 and $10 by the end of 2025. SHIB (Shiba Inu) — Community Power and Shibarium Expansion Shiba Inu remains a top-tier meme coin, supported by one of the most active communities in crypto. Shibarium, SHIB’s Layer-2 network, continues to add real utility through DeFi protocols, gaming projects, and an aggressive burn mechanism designed to reduce circulating supply. These developments have kept SHIB relevant long after many meme tokens faded. Analysts suggest that if positive momentum continues, SHIB could approach the $0.00010 mark this cycle. Still, SHIB is considered a high-risk, high-reward play. Some whales have already begun rotating profits from SHIB into emerging presales like MAGACOIN Finance, highlighting a shift from mature meme coins to earlier-stage projects with greater upside potential. DOGE (Dogecoin) — Brand Recognition and Payment Potential Dogecoin remains the cultural giant of meme coins, benefiting from unmatched brand recognition and one of the largest global followings in crypto. DOGE’s value often reacts to social media sentiment and broader meme coin rallies, creating periodic surges that traders continue to capitalize on. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s biggest advantage may come from payment adoption. If mainstream applications or large e-commerce platforms expand crypto payment options, DOGE is likely to be among the first tokens supported. Analysts still classify DOGE as a strong liquidity play, capable of delivering bursts of performance when sentiment aligns. MAGACOIN Finance — The Standout Presale of 2025 Among the four, MAGACOIN Finance is being ranked as the standout pick for September 2025. Analysts project gains as high as 9000%, positioning it well above DOGE, XRP, and SHIB in terms of potential upside. Momentum is accelerating quickly, with early investors already rotating profits from established coins into MAGACOIN’s presale, signaling confidence in its early-stage trajectory. Part of the appeal lies in its presale status, which offers the largest asymmetrical return potential compared with more mature assets. MAGACOIN Finance has captured attention through viral marketing and a unique political meme narrative that sets it apart from standard meme tokens. As capital shifts into the project, whales and retail investors alike are treating it as the year’s most explosive presale opportunity. Investors are also responding to the limited-time entry incentives. A 50% EXTRA bonus is still available through the PATRIOT50X code, but analysts caution that the window is narrowing as allocations sell out. For those willing to accept the risks of presale investing, MAGACOIN Finance represents the clearest chance at parabolic returns in 2025. Key Takeaways from Analysts’ Rankings Across the four leaders, analysts see distinct narratives shaping September 2025. XRP is gaining institutional trust through regulatory clarity and payment integrations, while SHIB continues to demonstrate the power of community and ecosystem expansion. DOGE holds its position as the cultural face of meme coins, offering bursts of liquidity and attention-driven rallies.

CFTC Launches New “Crypto Sprint” Phase On Thursday, CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham announced that the agency would begin the next phase of its initiative to advance President Donald Trump’s vision and is seeking the public’s feedback on the recommendations in the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets report. Pham highlighted that the Trump administration has “made it clear that enabling immediate trading of digital assets at the Federal level is a top priority,” adding, “The Trump Administration has ushered in a new dawn for crypto, and it’s up to market participants to seize this opportunity to be a part of the Golden Age of innovation.” The agency has initiated stakeholder engagement and invited all interested parties to submit feedback and suggestions on all recommendations for the CFTC in the White House’s recent digital assets report by October 20, 2025. “The public feedback will assist the CFTC in carefully considering relevant issues for leveraged, margined or financed retail trading on a CFTC-registered exchange as we implement the President’s directive,” Pham stated. As reported by Bitcoinist , the CFTC unveiled its “Crypto Sprint” on August 1, which started with a spot crypto trading initiative. Following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) launch of its “Project Crypto,” Pham revealed that the agency would work closely with SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce to provide regulatory clarity and foster innovation in the digital assets market. “I am pleased with the many thoughtful letters from stakeholders in support of the CFTC’s listed spot crypto trading initiative, which, in coordination with the SEC’s Project Crypto, answers President Trump’s call to action for American leadership,” said the CFTC acting chair on Thursday. Chaos In The Regulatory Agency? The CFTC’s initiative comes amid rumors of chaos in the regulatory agency. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, affirmed that “turmoil continues as the agency’s responsibilities, and the potential market risks, are multiplying.” According to the report, enforcement has significantly slowed, and the commissioner’s shortage has allegedly made it difficult to carry out critical agency business. “The CFTC’s curtailment coincides with a looming expansion of the agency’s responsibilities,” Bloomberg noted, as the highly anticipated market structure bill is expected to shift most of the crypto market oversight to the CFTC. A White House spokesperson denied that the agency is in disarray, telling the news media outlet that “President Trump has made it a priority to make America the crypto capital of the world, and in doing so has called for the revitalization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to play a larger role in securing this promise. Acting Chairman Caroline Pham has done a good job beginning this effort, and the Trump Administration is thankful for her leadership and dedicated public service.” Meanwhile, the agency also remains in a leadership limbo after the US Senate Agriculture Committee delayed the vote on President Trump’s nominee for CFTC chairman, Brian Quintenz, days before the August recess. The committee reportedly delayed the vote following a request from the White House. Notably, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini exchange co-founders, allegedly pressed President Trump in July to reconsider his CFTC nominee, arguing that Quintenz wouldn’t “shake up the CFTC enough” and is not “aligned with Trump’s agenda.” Earlier this week, a group of crypto organizations sent a letter to the US President in support of Quintenz, arguing that installing a permanent chairman is “absolutely critical” to realize the agency’s goals. “Mr. Quintenz possesses a singular capacity to advance sound and clear regulation that will foster responsible growth and innovation. He is, quite simply, the right person at the right time to lead the CFTC,” the letter concluded.","Crypto News|""Project Crypto""|bitcoin|Brian Quintenz|btc|BTCUSDT|Caroline Pham|CFTC|CFTC acting chair|crypto market structure bill|crypto regulation|Crypto Sprint|Crypto Sprint initiative|Donald Trump|President Donald Trump|US SEC",EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 03:00:55

The move follows multiple infiltration attempts by North Korean IT workers trying to access the exchange's critical systems. “It feels like they have 500 new people graduating from some school every quarter, and that’s their only job,” Armstrong told Stripe co-founder John Collison on the Cheeky Pint podcast. Now, all new hires must complete an in-person orientation in the U.S. Those who require access to sensitive infrastructure must be U.S. citizens and undergo fingerprinting. The stricter measures aim to block deepfake interviews, fake identities, and bribery attempts—all of which have reportedly been used to gain insider access at crypto firms. FBI Warnings, Real Arrests & $900K Heists: The Bigger Picture The FBI has repeatedly warned that North Korean operatives are posing as freelance developers and engineers to infiltrate U.S. companies, including those in the crypto space. In July, the agency revealed that these actors were working with both knowing and unknowing Americans, using fake businesses, company laptops, and even attending online interviews on behalf of others. In one high-profile case, a District of Columbia court sentenced an American woman to 8.5 years in prison for helping North Korean nationals secure tech jobs under fake identities. Meanwhile, Armstrong disclosed a separate but growing problem: bribery. “The attackers offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to our support agents to photograph sensitive information,” he said.“When we catch people, we don’t just walk them out the door — they go to jail.” This crackdown has also led to Coinbase expanding domestically, including the launch of a new customer service hub in Charlotte, North Carolina. Deepfakes, Coaching & Coercion: How Hackers Game the System To combat AI-powered fraud and impersonation, Coinbase now requires all interviewees to keep cameras on during calls. The goal? To detect if a candidate is being coached, assisted offscreen, or even replaced by a deepfake or AI bot. “It’s not worth going to prison,” Armstrong warns, emphasizing that even high bribes aren’t worth the risk. The company has become hyper-aware of these tactics after hackers reportedly used scripted coaching and real-time assistance during interviews to fool HR teams.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-23 03:02:48

Reports from PR Newswire confirm that AMTD Group is set to integrate AMTD Group cryptocurrencies into its substantial $240 million liquid asset portfolio. This strategic decision signals a growing acceptance of digital currencies within traditional finance, and it’s a development that cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are watching closely. What is Driving AMTD Group’s Cryptocurrencies Adoption? AMTD Group’s decision to add digital assets is a clear indicator of the evolving financial landscape. The conglomerate will prioritize the addition of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) to its crypto portfolio. This move isn’t just about diversification; it represents a forward-thinking approach to asset management. By including these specific cryptocurrencies, AMTD Group is tapping into established and liquid digital assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum are market leaders, known for their strong communities and significant market capitalization. Tether, as a stablecoin, offers a bridge between traditional fiat and volatile crypto markets, potentially providing stability within the digital asset allocation. The Strategic Advantages of Embracing Digital Assets Why would a major financial player like AMTD Group venture into the often-volatile world of cryptocurrencies? The reasons are compelling and rooted in strategic foresight: Portfolio Diversification: Cryptocurrencies offer a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, potentially enhancing portfolio resilience. Growth Potential: Despite volatility, digital assets have shown remarkable growth over the long term, presenting opportunities for significant returns. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Engaging with crypto positions AMTD Group at the forefront of financial innovation, preparing for a future where digital assets play a larger role. Liquidity: With a $240 million liquid asset portfolio, AMTD Group can leverage the high liquidity of major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH for flexible asset management. This proactive step by AMTD Group highlights a growing trend among institutional investors to explore and integrate digital assets, moving beyond initial skepticism. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Considerations for AMTD Group Cryptocurrencies While the benefits are clear, investing in AMTD Group cryptocurrencies also comes with its share of challenges. The digital asset market is dynamic and requires careful navigation: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price fluctuations, which can impact portfolio value significantly. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving across different jurisdictions, posing compliance challenges. Security Risks: Protecting digital assets from hacks and cyber threats requires robust security infrastructure and protocols. Custody Solutions: Securely holding and managing large quantities of cryptocurrencies necessitates specialized custody solutions. AMTD Group, with its extensive financial expertise, is likely to have considered these factors thoroughly, implementing strategies to mitigate potential risks. This measured approach is crucial for successful institutional entry into the crypto space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Investment? AMTD Group’s move sends a powerful signal to the broader financial industry. When a NYSE-listed conglomerate, managing substantial liquid assets, allocates a portion to digital currencies, it validates the asset class. This could inspire other traditional financial institutions to seriously consider or accelerate their own crypto adoption strategies. Moreover, increased institutional participation, such as this embrace of AMTD Group cryptocurrencies , often brings greater stability, liquidity, and legitimacy to the crypto market. It could also pave the way for more sophisticated financial products and services built around digital assets. This is not just an investment; it’s a testament to the maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In conclusion, AMTD Group’s strategic decision to add cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether to its $240 million liquid asset portfolio marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the undeniable shift towards digital assets in mainstream finance and positions the group as an early adopter among traditional conglomerates. This move reflects confidence in the long-term value and utility of cryptocurrencies, paving the way for further institutional integration into the exciting world of digital finance.

The surge captured global attention, but the momentum quickly unraveled as reports of insider trading and highly concentrated token ownership surfaced. Within hours, the token’s value collapsed to around $1.05 billion, reinforcing concerns about sustainability and investor trust. Investigations into YZY Coin’s launch revealed that insiders controlled over 94% of the supply. This raised questions about whether the rally was fueled more by manipulation than by organic demand. The fallout left many retail investors wary, with some calling YZY one of the most volatile celebrity-backed launches to date. However, that shifted attention to the token with the best upside this year: MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Analysts’ Top Crypto Presale Pick While YZY Coin captured headlines with its explosive but unstable debut, analysts say the real momentum is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE. Thousands of investors are shifting into the best crypto presale , drawn by forecasts of massive ROI potential that could make it one of the best-performing altcoins in the next bull cycle. Experts consistently rank it among the strongest presales of 2025, citing both its early traction and its structured rollout. The presale has already raised more than $12.5 million, underscoring the demand from retail and whale investors alike. Beyond its presale growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining credibility with audited contracts and a transparent supply model that sets it apart from tokens plagued by insider distribution issues. Early adopters are also responding to unique presale incentives. The PATRIOT50X code, which unlocks a 50% extra allocation, has accelerated inflows as investors look to secure positions before allocations close. Analysts warn that time is limited, and momentum is only likely to intensify as the broader market turns bullish. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just a speculative play but a strategic positioning move for 2025. It offers exposure to meme-driven enthusiasm without sacrificing transparency and sustainability — a balance that makes it stand out against high-profile but unstable launches like YZY Coin. Conclusion — Two Very Different Stories Kanye West’s YZY Coin may have captured attention with its celebrity-driven hype and explosive launch, but its volatility and insider concentration have cast a shadow over its long-term potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, is emerging as the consensus choice for investors seeking both high upside and structural credibility. As the second hald of the year unfolds, analysts are clear: YZY Coin might have been the loudest debut, but MAGACOIN FINANCE looks set to be the most sustainable winner.

OpenAI has subpoenaed Meta as part of Elon Musk’s ongoing lawsuit over a potential $97 billion deal to acquire the ChatGPT developer. According to OpenAI (and Sam Altman), Meta, or even CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally may have had backchannel communications with Elon Musk and his AI startup xAI about acquiring or investing in OpenAI. The subpoena aims to uncover documents or messages showing any involvement, direct or indirect, from Meta in the transaction. This comes after Musk allegedly promoted the deal publicly in February 2025. A $97B Power Play, Legal Tensions, and the Future of AI OpenAI’s legal team revealed they first requested documents from Meta in June 2025, but it remains unclear whether any evidence has been submitted. The defense argues Musk discussed xAI’s offer directly with Zuckerberg, including possible financial terms. Meta has officially denied involvement, stating it neither took part in such communications nor signed any letter of intent regarding a deal with Musk or xAI. This legal wrangling is closely tied to OpenAI’s transformation from a for-profit to a public corporation, a change Musk says goes against its original mission. Behind the Scenes: Why Meta Is Still a Key Player in This AI War OpenAI is now requesting broader documentation, including anything related to restructuring, recapitalization, or strategic changes at Meta. The court battle is as much about corporate control of AI as it is about transparency and competition. Meta previously pushed back, arguing its internal talks were irrelevant and that Musk and xAI could supply the needed details themselves. Meanwhile, analysts point to Meta’s aggressive push into AI—developing its own models and allegedly recruiting OpenAI engineers, including some who worked on ChatGPT—as proof of a deeper rivalry forming between tech giants.",News|Ai,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-23 03:31:55

This follows Gemini’s previous approval under MiFID II, which enabled the exchange to trade derivatives in the same jurisdiction. With both licenses, Gemini can now operate more broadly in over 30 European countries, solidifying its place among the most compliant and expansion-ready crypto platforms. Why MiCA Licensing Is a Game Changer for Gemini and the Crypto Industry In a statement, Gemini emphasized that this milestone reflects its long-term commitment to regulatory compliance and sustainable growth in Europe. “We believe clear regulation is the foundation for global crypto adoption, and Europe’s MiCA framework is a major step forward in providing clarity and investor protection.” The exchange also highlighted its June launch of tokenized stocks on the Arbitrum blockchain for European users. These blockchain-based tokens mirror real-world equities and are available for 24/7 trading, offering flexibility far beyond traditional markets. Gemini Isn’t Alone: Other Crypto Giants Now Licensed Under MiCA Gemini joins a growing list of crypto platforms that have already obtained MiCA approval, including Kraken, Bitvavo, Bybit, and Coinbase.

50523925,563662,1755921600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50523925.jpeg,$41M Crypto Scam Exposed: Taiwan Indicts 14 in BitShine Fraud Case,https://bitcoinist.com/41m-crypto-taiwan-indicts-14-in-bitshine-fraud-case/,"Taiwanese authorities have wrapped up a major investigation into one of the country’s most high-profile crypto-related fraud cases, filing charges against 14 individuals linked to the BitShine exchange. Prosecutors allege the group conspired with criminal networks to siphon NT$1.27 billion (approximately $41 million) from more than 1,500 victims through a scheme that combined fraudulent investment pitches with unlicensed cryptocurrency operations. According to Taiwan’s Central News Agency, BitShine operated under the cover of legitimacy, having reportedly passed financial compliance checks , while using its brand to conceal the activities of another firm, Biying Technology, which had not been approved by regulators. Investigators allege that the two entities worked in tandem to funnel customer deposits into crypto purchases, particularly USDT, before moving the funds overseas through a series of complex transfers designed to obscure their origins. Structure of the Fraud Network Prosecutors identified a man surnamed Shih as the head of the operation in Taiwan, with his wife serving as Asia-Pacific director and another suspect, surnamed Yang, responsible for business management. Working with organized crime affiliates, the group allegedly instructed victims to transfer funds into wallets controlled by the network. The tokens were then routed through multiple layers of transactions in what officials described as deliberate efforts to launder the money and evade detection. Between January 2024 and April 2025, investigators estimate the operation laundered more than NT$2.3 billion ($75 million). Of that, NT$1.27 billion was directly tied to 1,539 identified victims. Law enforcement seized NT$60.49 million in cash, 640,000 USDT, additional digital assets, and luxury items including cars during raids earlier this year. Authorities stated that the group misled investors by claiming to be the only exchange authorized by Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), a tactic that helped attract significant deposits. They also reportedly established more than 40 franchise-style storefronts across Taiwan under the names CoinW and BiXiang Technology Co., Ltd., collecting over one million yuan in fees and deploying “deposit machines” to process victims’ cash. Indictments and Sentencing Requests The Shilin District Prosecutor’s Office indicted Shih and 13 others on charges of fraud, money laundering, providing unregistered virtual asset services, and organizing a criminal enterprise under Taiwan’s Organized Crime Prevention Act. Prosecutors are seeking a 25-year sentence for Shih, citing his refusal to plead guilty and lack of remorse. Other defendants who confessed or pledged to return illicit gains may face reduced penalties. In addition to confiscating the seized digital assets and cash, prosecutors have asked the court to order the forfeiture of NT$1.275 billion in criminal proceeds. The case was overseen by Chief Prosecutor Luo Weiyuan, who emphasized that the suspects had conducted unlicensed financial operations in violation of Taiwan’s anti-money laundering laws. The investigation also uncovered a separate fraud targeting the BitShine operators themselves. Prosecutors said a man surnamed Gu defrauded Shih and his associates of NT$3 million by falsely promising he could secure anti-money laundering registration approvals. Gu has also been indicted.

Bitcoin dominance holds, altcoin rotations are getting stronger and institutions are sustaining the flow in the direction of mainstream adoption. As far as many investors are concerned, it is no longer a question of whether it is going to occur at all in 2025, but how to position themselves to reap the most benefits when the bull run takes place. In the dynamic environment, along with reputable projects such as Ethereum and Solana, new presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction as prospective early-cycle beneficiaries. Lessons from Past Bull Runs Looking back provides clear guidance. The 2017 rally resulted in Ethereum increasing in value by over 1,000% after liquidity ran out of Bitcoin. In 2021, meme tokens such as Dogecoin and SHIBA INU surprised markets by generating some of the most considerable returns of the cycle. The unifying factor was timing, investors that got in before mainstream awareness bottoms had a huge winning capture as momentum investors ride the exponential wave. This pattern is why analysts are emphasizing preparing early. Anticipating the headlines to signal a bull run is likely to mean a missed opportunity. In 2025, the strategy will focus on the assortment between mature players, cross-checking Bitcoin dominance as an indicator of rotation, and investing in good presale propositions. The Role of Presales in Bull Markets Presales have historically offered unique opportunities. They enable investors to invest before exchange listing and at reduced valuations, as projects gain traction and community support. When the larger altcoin season hits, these presales will have the ability to provide multiples that other larger-cap tokens will not be able to match. The risks of presales are, of course, present, but teams have to come through with what they promise, communities have to remain engaged, and further utility has to develop. Of the bull runs, though, at least a few tokens in the presale phase have become household names, minting fortunes to early adopters. That is why presales are being treated more and more as the high-reward element of gearing up for the next bull run. In this presale story, one of the most talked-about opportunities is MAGACOIN FINANCE. What is special about it is the scarcity of supply, branding, and timing. Allocation rounds are limited and they sell out fast, making the need to be positioned early especially important to investors. It has cultural currency, with a politically motivated brand that makes it stand out even outside tech and crypto communities. Analysts note that forecasts predict a 55x–65x ROI as presale momentum accelerates with early buyers securing bonuses. This projection is made together along the aspect of scarcity and increase in whale-interest in proportion to the privacy of long holders who build up in anticipation of the availability of an exchange. The ecosystem that is growing around the project is supportive of the sentiment that MAGACOIN FINANCE is more than just the hype- it is a narrative-driven project that follows structural market trends. Timing the Market: Why Preparation Matters Markets rarely reward hesitation. By the time it is in full retail swing, much of the upside may already be reflected in the price. Getting ready for 2025 suggests paying attention to rotation signs, Bitcoin consolidating after new peaks, Ethereum getting stronger with institutional flows, and liquidity starting to overspill to altcoins. This is the time when presale initiatives such as MAGACOIN FINANCE find the project stories catch fire. The advantage of having a position secured in advance is that the investor is not anxious to get green candles but is in a position to ride out this natural cycle. Practical Steps for Investors Not just token selection can get people ready to experience a bull run. Risk management remains vital. Limits of setting allocations, balancing between previous and emergent assets, and the use of secure wallets are available in constructing a sustainable plan. Investors should also monitor any regulatory solutions: welcomed explicitness could quicken the take-up. Findings narratives are equally important to metrics at the same time. In 2017, DeFi was barely on the radar. By 2021, it was central to the cycle. The process of tokenization of real-life assets, meme culture, and politically appealing branding could be such factors in 2025. A project such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, compatible with these stories, can be one of the largest beneficiaries. Conclusion: Positioning Ahead of the Curve The bull run of 2025 is on the horizon, and being prepared will mean average good gains or big ones. It is shown time and again that the first mover, the one who understands how to diversify, and those who align themselves with breakout narratives in the market tap into the greatest riches. As the forecasts indicate, its ROI is expected to be 55x65x, and each of the presale rounds is selling out especially fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates the philosophy of being ahead of the curve. For investors seeking to reposition themselves for the next cycle strategically, it presents one of the most interesting opportunities in an already competitive market.

Analyst Spot Bullish Trends in Netflow Data,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/could-ethereum-be-eyeing-new-highs-analyst-spot-bullish-trends-in-netflow-data/,"Ethereum’s price has maintained notable strength in recent weeks, giving many investors reason for cautious optimism. The asset briefly traded near $4,700 last week, close to its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021, before correcting to its current level around $4,633. Despite this pullback, Ethereum is still up nearly 30% over the past month, according to CoinGecko data, putting a majority of holders back into profit. Alongside these price developments, analysts continue to monitor exchange data for signs of broader market sentiment. One such analysis comes from PelinayPA, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, who examined Ethereum’s netflow patterns on exchanges. This indicator measures whether more ETH is moving onto exchanges (inflows) or off of them (outflows), providing insight into potential selling pressure or long-term accumulation behavior. Related Reading: Altseason Things: Ethereum Perps Volume Sets New Record Against Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Data Points to Reduced Selling Pressure According to PelinayPA, the current netflow picture suggests that Ethereum investors are largely removing coins from exchanges. Historical data indicate that significant inflows, accompanied by substantial amounts of ETH being transferred to trading platforms, often precede price corrections as investors prepare to sell. Conversely, notable outflows have historically appeared before bull market surges, reflecting confidence in holding or long-term storage. “In past cycles, strong exchange outflows occurred just before major uptrends in 2017, 2021, and again in 2024,” PelinayPA explained, adding: What we’re seeing now is consistent negative netflow, meaning ETH is leaving exchanges. This generally reduces immediate selling pressure and supports the case for ongoing bullish momentum. The analyst noted that while inflows can still trigger short-term pullbacks, the current outflow-dominant environment suggests that Ethereum retains significant upside potential in the medium to long term. The price action aligning with these signals reflects a market where participants are more inclined toward accumulation than distribution. Ethereum Institutional Demand and Technical Outlook Ethereum’s strong performance is also being interpreted through a technical lens. Several traders have pointed out that ETH has broken out against Bitcoin after years of relative underperformance. A crypto analyst known as CryptoBatman on X highlighted the significance of this trend, arguing that Ethereum’s rally could be entering a new phase of market recognition.

Investment funds and exchange-traded products tied to Ethereum have seen steady growth in holdings, with large investors maintaining exposure even during periods of volatility.

Ethereum continues to dominate as the institutional favorite, Shiba Inu maintains its cultural footprint in the meme sector, but a new name—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is capturing the sharpest attention. With ROI projections climbing as high as 20,000%, it has become the token analysts are calling the most ambitious presale of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Forecasted 20,000% ROI As Ethereum attracts institutional inflows and Shiba Inu works to reignite its community base, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out its own spotlight in 2025. Its capped crypto presale is rapidly shrinking in availability, and the combination of scarcity and early demand has fueled forecasts that now stretch as high as 20,000% ROI for early entrants . This surge of attention reflects more than meme-driven speculation. Analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the cycle’s clearest asymmetric bet, drawing both whales and retail investors eager to capture the type of exponential gains that defined earlier meme phenomena. The project’s rise is increasingly being compared to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, when hype and timing created generational returns for early adopters. In the same way, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is being framed as a rare window where risk and reward align for those willing to step in early. While the volatility and liquidity risks are undeniable, the growing consensus is that MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the boldest speculative opportunity heading into 2025 — one that could either fizzle quickly or rewrite the meme coin leaderboard. Ethereum (ETH) — Blue-Chip Altcoin Growth Ethereum is unlikely to deliver 20,000% gains, but it continues to anchor portfolios as the dominant smart contract platform. Spot ETH ETFs have driven billions in institutional inflows this year, helping ETH surge past $4,475 and cementing its reputation as a long-term hold. Its appeal lies in predictability. With strong developer activity, billions in DeFi liquidity, and expanding real-world adoption through tokenization and NFTs, Ethereum remains the safest high-cap altcoin play for 2025. Analysts forecast steady price targets in the $5,000 to $7,000 range, making ETH a core choice for investors seeking stability. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — Community Power, Limited Upside Shiba Inu retains one of the largest meme coin communities and continues to build around its ecosystem through Shibarium and DeFi integration. However, analysts are clear that SHIB’s days of exponential growth are behind it. The token’s enormous supply makes another 20,000% rally virtually impossible, and whale activity has cooled compared to its early surge years. That said, SHIB remains relevant as a lower-risk meme option, backed by a strong base of holders and ongoing development. For new capital, though, much of the speculative momentum is rotating into emerging plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion — Speculation Meets Stability Choosing the best crypto to buy in 2025 comes down to strategy. Ethereum offers security and steady growth, Shiba Inu delivers community power with limited upside, and MAGACOIN FINANCE presents the riskiest but potentially most rewarding opportunity. Its presale buzz, whale participation, and 20,000% ROI projections have made it the center of market speculation heading into the next cycle. For risk-tolerant investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the token that could define 2025.

Ethereum, the asset of choice, has meanwhile been garnering considerable attention from institutions and retail investors alike. Change of Heart A dormant BTC whale has resurfaced today, as reported by the Lookonchain market watcher page. The team traced the original purchase from seven years ago, when the wallet received 100,784 BTC (~$642M), which was sold for Ethereum (ETH) today. At the start of 2018, the leading cryptocurrency was trading at roughly one-tenth of its current price (approximately $113,000 now, compared to around $13,000). If we assume that they bought in at that price, this has netted them a tremendous 1,613% return on the investment. The trader purchased 62,914 ETH (~$267 million) from the spot market using their substantial earnings and opened a long position of 135,265 Ether, worth approximately $577M. The blockchain trackers noted another holder from 2018 who sold their Bitcoin on Hyperliquid to buy ETH. The data shows that the wallet originally received 85,947 bitcoins at that time, worth approximately $547 million, and they believe it’s the same entity. A total of 6 BTC-containing wallets were identified, which hold the impressive 83,585 units, valued at around $9.42 billion, considering the prices at the time of printing. ETH in The Spotlight The top altcoin has been receiving significant attention in 2025, currently up over 60% from the same time last year and trading at around $4,300. This is a modest 8.5% decrease from the recent local peak of over $4,700 it achieved last week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Source: CoinMarketCap Institutions are pouring capital into the recently emerged trend of ETH treasury companies, along with exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Notably, Tom Lee’s BitMine leads treasuries, while BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF has the lion’s share among the funds . The entities hold 1.5 million ETH and 3.54 million ETH, respectively, in their coffers, and current data from StrategicEthReserve indicates that over $44 billion in Ether is split between treasuries and ETFs, representing almost 9% of the total supply.

According to Degen, Mastercard, XRP, and WebBank have converged in a partnership that will introduce a mainstream credit card product running on XRP rails. He stated that the official launch is scheduled for August 25, 2025, a date he framed as the beginning of a new era for cryptocurrency integration into daily finance. Ahead of the launch, a billboard at 29th and Broadway in New York City unveiled the campaign, promoting what he described as the first true credit card using XRP and signaling the entry of digital asset payments into everyday financial life. MasterCard x XRP⁰MASS ADOPTION IN 3 DAYS Millions will use crypto every day without even knowing it. Here’s how $XRP kills the “crypto is hard” narrative pic.twitter.com/akPh38hRt6 — Smart Degen (@smartsdegen) August 21, 2025 Details of the Mastercard and XRP Integration In his tweet, Smart Degen clarified that this product is not a crypto debit card with conversion fees nor a DeFi-based solution requiring seed phrases and manual wallet setup. Instead, it is positioned as a standard Mastercard credit card, issued by WebBank, that uses XRP as the settlement layer. He emphasized that this distinction makes it easier for everyday consumers to participate in crypto without needing to understand the technical processes behind blockchain. Degen pointed out that users of this card would interact with it just as they do with any traditional credit card, requiring only a swipe to complete transactions. The Significance of WebBank’s Role The tweet highlighted the role of WebBank, a recognized institution that already issues cards for PayPal Credit, Apple Card, and Google Pay Card. Smart Degen framed this association as crucial for establishing legitimacy, contrasting it with what he called crypto experiments of the past. He presented this as evidence that XRP is now positioned as part of established financial infrastructure rather than a niche or experimental tool. Timelines and Adoption Phases Smart Degen linked this development to a broader timeline of cryptocurrency adoption. He described 2009 to 2017 as the time when crypto was primarily used by enthusiasts, 2017 to 2021 as the early adopter stage, 2021 to 2024 as the period of institutional entry, and 2025 as the year of mainstream integration. He identified the XRP Mastercard as the bridge into what he called the “everyone” phase of adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Elimination of the “Crypto is Hard” Narrative In his explanation, Smart Degen compared the traditional crypto experience with the new model. He listed tasks such as downloading wallets, securing seed phrases, managing gas fees, and bridging assets as barriers that have historically deterred mass participation. By contrast, he summarized the new Mastercard experience as a three-step process of swiping, purchasing, and completing the transaction. He concluded that this shift removes the complexity associated with using digital assets and makes them accessible to a broader audience. Broader Implications for Financial Infrastructure The tweet also projected the long-term effects of this partnership. Smart Degen outlined what he described as an upcoming network effect, beginning with the launch of the XRP Mastercard, followed by millions of daily users, and eventually leading to other banks adopting XRP infrastructure . He envisioned a progression in which XRP becomes a standard component of global banking systems and ultimately underpins a majority of payment flows. According to Smart Degen, August 25, 2025, represents a milestone for crypto adoption. With Mastercard , XRP, and WebBank involved in delivering a product that resembles traditional credit cards, he suggested that this move could finally make cryptocurrency usage seamless for the general population.

Among the 10 best cryptos to buy now, Ethereum, XRP, and Avalanche are standing out — but a hidden gem presale is capturing even more attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the conversation, with analysts forecasting staggering returns that rival the early days of major altcoin breakouts. Ethereum: The Market’s Anchor Ethereum remains the top altcoin in crypto markets. Even though its price is down to $4,150 with recent volatility, Ethereum remains the backbone of the entire DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 adoption. With ETH ETFs gaining over $1 billion in inflows and strong institutional confidence, analysts expect ETH to rally toward $5,000 in the months ahead. Long-term investors see Ethereum as essential for any portfolio because of its developing dominance and network effect. XRP: Legal Clarity and Institutional Traction XRP has achieved regulatory clarity after years of uncertainty as confirmed not to be a security in secondary sales. Mature whales residing on exchanges have increased their accumulated funds to around $2.90, adding strong support for XRP. Even though there is perpetual volatility, analysts are expecting a surge in price towards $3.39 in September as ETF speculation builds and retail interest strengthens. Avalanche: DeFi and Real-World Assets Growth Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining a lot of popularity among retail and institutional investors. There are presently $300 million in tokenized hedge funds and $188 million in tokenized real-world assets on the blockchain. Currently trading close to the $23 mark, AVAX is showing strong support. If it manages to hold its momentum, we could see higher levels in the $32–$37 range. Avalanche is a strong buy for investors positioning themselves for the next cycle amid rising developer activity and the network’s scalability. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem Thousands of investors have already joined the wave into MAGACOIN FINANCE, with analysts forecasting a staggering 20,000% ROI in the next bull run. Ranked among the best altcoins to buy right now , momentum is accelerating quickly. Early buyers using PATRIOT50X unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are running out fast. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its capped supply, transparent audits, and heavy whale-backed demand. Analysts believe that these fundamentals position it not only as a meme-driven play but also as one of the most strategic accumulation opportunities heading into 2025. TRON and Chainlink: Driving Real-World Connectivity TRON (TRX) has become a strong backbone for stablecoin transaction volume, surpassing $668 billion. TRX is trading at about $0.35 but long-term holders are taking profits. As DeFi activity grows, TRON may look to hit $0.38 in the near-term as yields near 10%. Chainlink (LINK), which has been on the rise since mid-April, recently surged to yearly highs near $25.60. Specifically, the price was up 8% in a span of just one day. A collaboration of wallet businesses and oracle technology has contributed to the rise of the Chainlink coin. If momentum continues, analysts see long-term upside by 2025 to $50-55. Hedera, SUI, and BNB: Scaling Adoption Hedera (HBAR) is maintaining long-term stability in the $0.23–$0.26 range thanks to new partnerships and app launches. SUI is trading today at $3.48 and could test its yearly high of $5.37 on-chain engagement. At the same time, Binance Coin (BNB) attains strength at the level of $829. The coin is still near yearly highs and has witnessed some solid buying. Litecoin and Polkadot: Recovery and Value Plays Litecoin (LTC) has shown a recovery and now trades beyond $112. Over the last year, Litecoine (LTC) has increased by almost 70%. Analysts consider it a strong mid-cap buy, with the target set at $138. Polkadot (DOT), currently valued at about $3.89, might indicate a potential rally in the months ahead as prices are hovering above lows with increasing volumes. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and Avalanche are likely to be the clear leaders in the next bull cycle. Meanwhile, tried and tested TRON, LINK, and BNB also have their share of strong fundamentals. However, analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is the real breakout candidate, with predictions of a staggering 20,000% ROI prompting unmatched presale demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving to be impossible to ignore for investors who want stability with high upside.

The asset’s price has also staged a remarkable recovery following the recent local bottom, especially after yesterday’s update on the legal case against the securities regulator. ETF Updates Recall that just earlier this week, the SEC delayed making a decision on several XRP ETF applications filed by companies such as Bitwise, Canary, Coinshares, and Grayscale. These entities were quick to respond, according to Bloomberg’s ETF expert James Seyffart, as they have already updated their respective filings. He believes this is “almost certainly” due to the feedback received by the Commission. The cryptocurrency community is familiar with this process, as the BTC and ETH ETF issuers had to endure essentially the same procedures before their respective funds saw the light of day. Consequently, Seyffart categorized these updates as a “good sign, but also mostly expected.” Bunch of XRP ETF filings being updated by issuers today. Almost certainly due to feedback from SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected pic.twitter.com/GiSL1kc6lt — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 22, 2025 Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett shared Seyffart’s post, adding that these updates “make sense” to be done now, as the new deadline for the SEC is set for October, and it is approaching fast. SEC Legal Case and XRP Moves Ripple and the SEC had another interaction yesterday. As reported, the Second Circuit finally approved the two parties’ joint stipulation of dismissal, which was filed earlier in August. According to experts, this is most likely the final step needed before the official conclusion of the case. The duo had filed such dismissals in the past as well, but Judge Torres denied them at first. XRP’s price reacted immediately to the news yesterday. The asset had tumbled to a multi-week low of under $2.80 but skyrocketed to $3.10 within minutes. It’s worth noting that it also benefited from the overall market revival following the Jackson Hole speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Despite retracing slightly since that local peak, XRP still trades above $3.00, which is a crucial support-turned-resistance-turned-support level.

50526231,563720,1755925209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50526231.jpeg,Australia Cracks Down On Binance: Orders External Audit Over Money Laundering Concerns,https://bitcoinist.com/australia-cracks-down-on-binance/,"After navigating significant challenges in the United States regarding money laundering allegations that led to the resignation of its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), cryptocurrency exchange Binance finds itself under scrutiny once again, this time in Australia. Binance’s AML And CTF Controls Under Fire The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the nation’s financial intelligence agency, has mandated that Binance’s local arm appoint an external auditor due to “serious concerns” about its anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls. AUSTRAC’s concerns emerged following a recent independent review of Binance Australia’s operations, which the agency described as “limited in scope relative to its size, business offerings, and risks.” The agency highlighted alleged issues from the exchange such as high staff turnover, inadequate local resources, and insufficient oversight from senior management. In a statement, AUSTRAC emphasized the need for robust systems that align with local regulatory requirements , particularly given the global nature of the exchange’s operations. Brendan Thomas, AUSTRAC’s chief executive, stressed the importance of effective customer identification, due diligence, and transaction monitoring in a high-risk environment. Thomas stated: This is a global company operating across borders in a high-risk environment. We expect robust customer identification, due diligence and effective transaction monitoring. Global Regulatory Challenges Binance has been given a 28-day window to nominate external auditors to address these concerns. In response to the situation, Matt Poblocki, the general manager of Binance Australia and New Zealand, stated that the exchange has been engaging openly and transparently with AUSTRAC throughout recent months. The exchange’s executives reassured stakeholders and users in the country about the company’s commitment to maintaining high compliance standards and improving its capabilities. Founded in 2017, Binance has rapidly ascended to become the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. However, its journey has not been without difficulties. After initially operating in China, Zhao moved the company’s operations internationally due to a crackdown on the crypto sector by Chinese authorities. Despite its growth, Binance has faced accusations in multiple countries of facilitating the laundering of funds for criminal organizations. Zhao pleaded guilty to violating US anti-money laundering laws in late 2023, resulting in a four-month prison sentence in 2024. However, Bitcoinist has reported that despite being banned from taking charge of the exchange, Zhao might be seeking a pardon from pro-crypto President Donald Trump. These legal challenges have compounded the scrutiny on Binance with the exchange taking a new direction with its new CEO Richard Teng as regulators worldwide increasingly focus on ensuring compliance. Despite recent scrutiny from Australia’s Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, Binance’s native token, BNB, reached an all-time high of $882 on Friday. The cryptocurrency has consistently surged over the past month, even as the broader market struggled.

Moreover, they have identified altcoins with institutional support that are likely to break out. This year’s best altcoins to buy already have some clear front-runners. Among them are Binance Coin (BNB), XRP, SEI, and fast-rising MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is a presale project. BNB Maintains Strength Near Yearly Highs BNB remained resilient today, presently trading at around $829 with a market cap of more than 120 billion dollars. Price action has been constant, where it hovers around its yearly high at $869. According to analysts, Binance is performing strongly because its exchange is dominant and continues to burn tokens while BNB is involved in DeFi and staking. Several investors think of BNB as a safe bet due in 2025 despite the volatility. XRP Consolidates With ETF Speculation XRP has stabilized around the $3 mark after weeks of regulatory delays over ETF approvals. The asset has proven resilient despite uncertainty, as over 93% of the circulating supply remains in profit. According to analysts, an XRP ETF approval could send prices back to its all-time high of $3.84. If institutional flows accelerate, it could also be $4.50. Traders looking for exposure to a primary settlement asset will find XRP a compelling option. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned as the Breakout Play BNB and XRP are established leaders, while SEI is gaining traction — but analysts say the real breakout lies in MAGACOIN FINANCE, still trading under $1. With forecasts of 55x upside and as much as 10,000% ROI potential, it’s being ranked among the best altcoins to buy in 2025. Early buyers are rushing to accumulate the token at the cheapest price, though supply is running out quickly. Analysts highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE capped supply, verified audits, and whale-backed inflows give it the kind of fundamentals that fueled the earliest breakouts of BNB and XRP. If momentum continues at its current pace, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025. SEI Gains Momentum With Adoption SEI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 blockchains, recently surpassing 1 million daily active wallets and leading EVM-compatible chains in weekly activity. With strong traction in both DeFi and gaming sectors, analysts highlight SEI’s scalability and adoption curve as signals of long-term growth. Near-term volatility from token unlocks has not stopped whale accumulation, keeping SEI firmly on analyst watchlists for 2025. Conclusion: The 2025 Bull Market Leaders Institutional players are piling BNB and XRP in their wallets while SEI is fast catching on as a future blockchain leader. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, has the greatest speculative upside according to analysts who predict exponential returns if momentum continues. For investors looking for stable yet high-growth opportunity, these four altcoins could be the best plays going into the 2025 bull market.

XRP has clung tightly to its $3 support level despite inflation-driven volatility. Tron’s on-chain and futures metrics are signaling more room to climb, and BlockDAG has become the project many are watching for very different reasons. With $380 million raised in presale, a Batch 29 price of $0.0276, and a set of high-profile updates, BlockDAG is turning into a headline driver. Its Dashboard V4 is giving participants a live trading experience before official listings, sports partnerships are pushing the brand into global audiences, and the Ambassador Program is building grassroots momentum. Together, these moves make BlockDAG more than a presale story, it’s shaping into an ecosystem with both presence and engagement. XRP Holds Firm at $3 Support XRP has managed to keep its footing at the $3 support line despite broader market turbulence. Inflation data from the U.S. came in hotter than expected, with the Producer Price Index up 0.9% in July and 3.3% year-over-year, raising concerns that the Federal Reserve could delay expected rate cuts. This pressure rippled across markets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum slipping, and XRP sliding nearly 5% to $3.12. Around $62 million in long positions were liquidated during the move. Yet, volumes jumped 30% to $12 billion as participants defended the $3 mark. Analysts are now looking at $3.40 as a key resistance that, if broken, could unlock moves toward $4. The fundamentals are also supportive, with Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD expected to enhance settlement demand. With regulatory uncertainty mostly cleared, long-term forecasts still point toward $4.50–$6 by 2025, with potential upside beyond the decade. Tron Metrics Show Upward Pressure Tron (TRX) is holding steady momentum, trading around $0.357 after notching a 5.48% gain over the week and nearly 19% over the month. While it saw a slight daily pullback, the Futures Volume Bubble Map suggests there’s still upside available, as activity is far from overheated. Analysts note that the last time metrics were in a similar position, TRX jumped from $0.26 to $0.45. Open Interest has eased from $340 million to $313 million, indicating weaker positions are closing out. However, the Funding Rate has been positive for four straight days, pointing to stronger longs holding steady. Spot demand also looks healthy, with the Spot vs Perp Premium climbing to 0.0014 and the RSI at 74, both signals of buying pressure. If demand continues, TRX could retest $0.37 and possibly hit $0.40. A failure to hold momentum could bring it back toward $0.33, but for now, the bias leans upward. BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4, Sports Deals, and Ambassador Push BlockDAG is standing out not through speculation but by delivering tools and building visibility. With over $380 million raised in presale and a Batch 29 price set at $0.0276, its progress is already impressive. But what’s truly setting it apart is Dashboard V4. This interface replicates the look and feel of a live crypto exchange, offering real-time BDAG charts, order book data, wallet balances, and referral tracking before any listings go live. This transparency is rare in presale projects and has helped build confidence in the ecosystem. Global exposure is also expanding through sports. Partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves in rugby and the Seattle Orcas in cricket have added visibility on the international stage. These collaborations come with NFTs, collectibles, fan coins, and interactive content, bridging crypto with entertainment and culture in ways that resonate with broad audiences. Alongside these moves, the BlockDAG Ambassador Program has gone live, mobilizing community leaders worldwide. Ambassadors are rewarded with incentives, access, and recognition for driving awareness and engagement. It’s a grassroots effort designed to amplify BlockDAG’s reach and strengthen community ties. Together, Dashboard V4, sports partnerships, and the Ambassador Program create a framework of delivery, credibility, and visibility. With presale progress already strong, these additions give BlockDAG the depth and traction to stand apart. Wrapping Up XRP is holding critical support while aiming for higher resistance, Tron is building momentum on strong trading metrics, and BlockDAG is rewriting what a presale can offer by delivering tools and building community ahead of launch. The combination of $380 million raised, Dashboard V4’s transparent trading environment, international sports alliances, and an engaged Ambassador Program signals more than hype; it signals progress backed by proof. XRP and Tron are showing their technical strength, but BlockDAG is showing what structured delivery looks like before day one on exchanges.

As the cryptocurrency is attempting to reclaim this crucial area, some analysts suggest that a new all-time high (ATH) is imminent. Related Reading: Another Celebrity Scam? Kanye West Memecoin Launch Leaves 60% Of Investors In The Red Ethereum Hits New Multi-Year High On Friday, Ethereum broke above the $4,800 resistance for the first time since 2021, hitting a multi-year high of $4,834. The cryptocurrency has rallied over 14% over the past 24 hours, driven by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s annual address at Jackson Hole. In his speech, Powell signaled the possibility of an interest rate cut, affirming that “with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” Following Powell’s remarks, the market soared, with Bitcoin (BTC) jumping from its local range low to the $117,000 area. Meanwhile, Ethereum initially climbed from the $4,200 support to reclaim the crucial $4,700 barrier. In a statement to CNBC, Jordi Alexander, CEO of crypto trading firm Selini Capital, suggested that crypto traders were caught completely offside by Powell’s dovish comments. “The market positioning in recent sessions has seen clear risk-off moves in assets like crypto and tech, and today’s setting up of a September rate cut is causing a panicked repositioning, which could continue through the illiquid weekend as shorts get squeezed,” he affirmed. Meanwhile, Joseph Chalom, Co-CEO of SharpLink Gaming, asserted that “the markets are loving Powell’s dovish speech. September rate cuts seem imminent. We’re at a pivotal moment in the market cycle.” ETH Ready For More? Notably, ETH has been consolidating between $3,762 support and $4,631 resistance since the early August breakout, retesting the $4,000-$4,100 mid-zone of this week’s pullback. On Friday afternoon, Ethereum continued its climb above the $4,800 resistance. This level was unsuccessfully tested last week, when the King of Altcoins hit a local high of $4,788 before being rejected. Analyst Crypto Jelle highlighted a one-week falling wedge pattern on ETH’s chart, which targeted a breakout to the $4,600-$4,800 area. Following today’s price jump, the analyst suggested that Ethereum is ready to target its all-time high of $4,878 after the breakout. Additionally, he noted that ETH already broke out of an 18-month bullish megaphone this month, which targets the $10,000 level. He explained that the cryptocurrency has successfully retested the key resistance level, around $4,000, during this week’s pullback and has “hardly any resistance left.” Related Reading: Chainlink Eyes Crucial Resistance After $25 Reclaim – Breakout Or Breakdown Next? Nonetheless, he warned that a pullback is likely to come following the massive pump but added that “the intent is clear. This market wants higher.” Similarly, Ted Pillows affirmed that volatility was expected after Powell’s speech, noting that it had happened in previous years. However, he suggested that a big ETH rally will follow, “just like the last time.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,799, a 32.6% increase in the monthly timeframe.

This change enables funds to exchange underlying assets directly with authorized participants, improving efficiency and helping ETFs more closely track their spot markets. In parallel, the SEC granted and then stayed accelerated approval for a Bitwise multi-asset conversion. This brings more uncertainty and breaks its cautious approach to broader crypto exposure. The Future of Spot XRP ETFs The SEC recently extended review periods for multiple crypto ETF filings, pushing decisions into October . This included XRP products such as the 21Shares Core XRP Trust, which has to wait till the October 19 deadline. Other pending XRP proposals share similar dates, meaning the Commission could address several digital asset filings within the same month. These delays do not signal outcomes but give regulators more time to review disclosures, surveillance arrangements, and the operational details required under the new framework. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of Approval If the SEC approves Grayscale’s XRP Trust or another spot XRP ETF, it would expand access to XRP across regulated markets. Approval would enable investors to gain exposure through brokerage platforms and retirement accounts, thereby opening the asset to institutional investors . The ETF format provides standardized structures, audited reporting, and clear custody arrangements. The adoption of in-kind creation and redemption further supports liquidity and enhances the correlation between fund shares and the spot market. Together, these features could encourage broader participation while integrating XRP more firmly into traditional investment channels. Grayscale’s filing has furthered the race for a U.S.-based spot XRP ETF, and with October quickly approaching, we might see these products launch soon.

That has prompted asset managers to call for new all-time highs for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and select altcoins. What Powell said? In one of his most important speeches, Powell suggested that the labor market could benefit from lower borrowing costs, having held the benchmark interest rate steady at 4.25% for eight months. “Downside risks to employment are rising,” Powell said in prepared remarks for his keynote speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium, adding that the possibility of President Donald Trump’s tariffs having only a short-lived effect on inflation is “reasonable.” “With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he noted. Cryptocurrencies and stocks soared, and the probability of the September Fed rate cut jumped to 90% following the speech. Most analysts expect the momentum to continue in the days ahead. Analysts see new highs for BTC and ETH above $5K Analysts at Monarq Asset Management anticipate that ether's price will rise above $5,000 in the coming days. ""We maintain our overall bullish stance. Market internals remain constructive, with few signs of overheating and, as you point out, a clear path to new all-time highs in both BTC and ETH,"" Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, told CoinDesk. ""Our house view is that Powell’s dovish pivot has cleared the way for $5,000+ in the near term (also not the hardest call to make). Demand from treasury vehicles should increase into the fall as many of the deals announced this summer close or de-SPAC, in addition to ongoing institutional and retail inflows,"" Gaer added. Ethereum's native token ether has already gained nearly 10% in 24 hours, hitting record highs above $4,800. As of writing, it changed hands at $4,700, according to CoinDesk data . Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin traded near $115,600, slightly down from the overnight high of $117,400. Data from Deribit-listed options shows that ether's rally has sparked renewed demand for upside bets, or call options. At press time, risk reversals were positive across all tenors, implying relative richness of calls. The sentiment wasn't so bullish in BTC options. Gaer stated that over-the-counter desks and market makers are experiencing stronger demand for ETH compared to BTC, suggesting that ether may outperform ahead. That said, BTC looked strong on its own too. ""The BTC pullback from ATH was ~9.6%—far less than earlier drawdowns this year—indicating strong demand, as evidenced by whale wallet accumulation around the $113k level,"" Gaer said. Spencer Yang, managing partner at BlockSpaceForce, a crypto treasury advisory firm, said more rate cuts could happen after September, ensuring the momentum extends well into the year-end. ""We’re now fully expecting rate cuts to happen in September. It will be the first cut since Trump became President this year. This is significant, and many more will come,"" Yang said, calling new highs in the crypto market. ""The major 5 that we pay attention to: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, LINK. These will do well given the various parts of the crypto industry they impact,"" Yang added. Focus on ETF flows Steve Lee, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital and investor in BlockTower Capital, called Powell's dovish turn a short-term constructive development for cryptocurrencies while stressing the importance of continued inflows into bitcoin and ether spot ETFs. ""I see this as constructive in the short term, and it may help reverse this week’s sell-off. The key question is whether this momentum holds beyond the low-liquidity weekend. Since BTC and ETH price action is increasingly institutionally driven, spot ETF flows today and Monday will be a strong indicator of whether we are set for another leg higher,"" Lee told CoinDesk. Lee highlighted Base, Monad, Story, and SUI as key projects of interest that he is closely monitoring in his capacity as an early-stage venture capitalist. Gaer, meanwhile, favored Solana and the SOL ecosystem, including high-beta SOL tokens such as JITO and JUP. Raydium and PUMP on both a ""fundamental and forward-demand basis."" Potential headwinds While Powell’s dovish stance has set the stage for a rally, traders should remain cautious about potential pitfalls from corporate treasury cryptocurrency adoption and volatility in equity markets. ""Digital asset treasuries (DAT) are an innovative vehicle for public market investors to gain exposure to the digital asset space. However, we have started to see the quality of DAT deals – from banking relationships, compliance, management team, and deal structure perspectives — dropping, which shows early signs of a 'bubble,"" Lee said. Naqsdaq-listed Strategy started this trend of corporate BTC adoption in 2020. Since then, more than 100 publicly-listed firms have accumulated a total of 984,971 BTC, according to data source Bitcoin Treasuries. ""The trend may continue, but it is obvious that the risks associated with this are not ignorable,"" Lee added. Gaer called for closely tracking risks from an overheated equity market and ""potential for macro or geopolitical shocks.""",Markets|Bitcoin ETF|Ether|Markets|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-23 05:15:06

With inflation eating into purchasing power, it is important to examine assets that can not only defend savings but also have upside potential. The emergence of cryptocurrency means hedging your bets is more important than ever. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most talked-about projects in 2025 among them. The Inflation Challenge: Safeguarding Wealth Inflation is a tax that eats away at savings every time something’s price rises. In order to combat this, investors are turning towards assets that have historically remained the same or increased in value in inflationary scenarios. Real estate and commodities are often strong hedges. For instance, property tends to generate rental income while the latter benefits from improving global demand. Gold, along with other precious metals, still appears in the top tier of asset classes, but this has become less frequent and much less certain to occur as the market cycle evolves. Companies able to increase prices without losing many customers, known for pricing power, also provide protection. Stocks that pays dividend offers value share and many more equity strategies for protection. For direct hedges, government-issued inflation-linked bonds, such as TIPS, remain one of the safest options. These adjust payments based on actual inflation rates to maintain real returns. The Crypto Opportunity: A Path to Riches While traditional hedges help in lost value, crypto expands your opportunity for upside. Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” and it’s the benchmark. Meanwhile, Ethereum powers the smart contracts and DeFi applications. There are thousands of altcoins, many of which have their own risks and opportunities. Strategies in crypto vary. HODLers can look forward to any major cycle rallies, while the staking and yield farming opportunities offer passive income. More active investors explore day trading and arbitrage. It has become easier for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the asset thanks to Bitcoin ETFs. The Rising Crypto Star of 2025 Out of the various options available, analysts and investors believe MAGACOIN FINANCE will grab most opportunities to grow. With predictions of 12,000% or more gains, it’s quickly becoming one of the leading crypto presales of 2025. Presale rounds are moving quickly due to the project fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s verified audits, secure smart contracts, capped supply, and whale-backed inflows are certainly differentiating factors. The speculation regarding Tier-1 exchange listings seems to be a result of fundamentals. This has resulted in a rush to invest. Those who position themselves now could be among the first beneficiaries before mass adoption drives broad-based demand. Navigating the Risks Risk management is important for all investment portfolios. Enhancing traditional hedges with cryptocurrency plays of high potential value. Investors typically allocate 1-5% of their capital to cryptocurrency in order to gain exposure. Patience is equally important. Chasing the spikes or selling in panic in declines usually costs losses. Building positions in a systematic manner and sticking to the fundamentals in the longer term suggests more wisdom. Conclusion The financial landscape of 2025 requires adaptability. Real estate, commodities, and inflation-linked bonds provide a robust defensive cushion and with cryptocurrencies unlike other asset classes, the greatest possible upside. In this situation, early adopters are looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE as a once-in-a-cycle opportunity, which seems likely to provide the returns for the next bull run. Combining hedging strategies with exposure to new digital assets can help investors construct portfolios that thrive amid inflationary pressure and market growth.

Both ecosystems occupy central roles in the crypto landscape. Ethereum stands as the pioneer of smart contracts and decentralized finance. Solana positions itself as the challenger with superior speed, scalability, and minimal transaction costs. Every network has its own strengths and disadvantages that stand out. Both platforms have their own groups of developers and investors. Ethereum benefits from its history, clearer rules, and more institutions using it. Solana has a lot of momentum, is very flexible with technology, and is quickly adding new integrations in the gaming, DeFi, and NFT industries. For investors who are trying to choose which platform to back, the choice is still not easy. At the same time, as money changes hands and altseason stories grow, new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are joining the discourse in unforeseen ways. Ethereum’s Case: Security and Institutional Depth Ethereum remains the most recognized smart contract platform globally. Its massive developer base provides continuous innovation and maintenance. Deep liquidity pools ensure stable trading environments for large transactions. The network’s unmatched DeFi footprint makes it the default choice for institutions and startups alike. Layer-2 solutions effectively reduce transaction costs and network congestion. Upcoming upgrades aim to make staking more efficient and wallets more user-friendly. For investors, Ethereum represents security and credibility through its proven track record. The network has weathered multiple market cycles and adapted through consistent innovation. Each adaptation has strengthened its position in the global marketplace. The ecosystem prioritizes resilience over raw speed. These qualities matter significantly to institutional players building products intended to last for decades. Solana’s Case: Speed, Costs, and Growing Adoption To fix Ethereum’s biggest problems with transaction speed and cost, Solana was built from the ground up. The network can handle traffic that is lightning fast. Its transaction fees stay very low, at just a few cents. Because of these things, it is the best chain for uses where size is important. Major NFT platforms have moved to take advantage of its features. It works very well, which helps on-chain game projects. On its network, high-frequency DeFi techniques work better. The chain has come back from technical problems and market downturns in a big way. This comeback has earned the trust of developers and sparked new energy in the community. Partnerships with both standard banks and tech companies have made it even more credible as an alternative. For many people, Solana is more than just faster internet. It looks like this is the chain that could make blockchain more widely used by making it easy for regular people to use. Developers and Security: Two Philosophies It’s hard to understand Ethereum, which is both good and bad. Because it has a very large smart contract infrastructure, it can make things that are quite sophisticated. This level of complexity also makes projects that use shared code or centralized deployers fragile. People think the network is powerful since it has been assaulted a lot in the past. Speed and ease are the most important things to Solana’s design philosophy. The software tools it makes are getting better and easier to use. With these technologies, producers may create swiftly without having to worry about Ethereum’s problems with scale. Like any other blockchain, there are good reasons to worry about security. The network has proved that it can change by adding frameworks that make it harder to hack. In the end, Ethereum is more stable than Solana, which is more adaptable. These are two quite distinct ways of thinking that investors and producers should think about. The New Challenger: MAGACOIN FINANCE While the spotlight remains on Ethereum and Solana, the market’s most interesting opportunities often come from outside the top ten. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the scene with notable momentum. Some analysts compare its early movement to the early days of SHIBA INU and Dogecoin. Unlike the established giants with large valuations, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains at the presale stage. This early stage magnifies its potential growth significantly. Market models currently project possible rallies of up to 12,000% during intensified altseason rotations. Scarcity mechanisms form the heart of this optimistic outlook. Token allocations remain intentionally limited across all distribution rounds. These limited rounds have been selling out rapidly since launch. Early whale accumulation has added credibility to the project’s narrative. This activity signals that sophisticated players are positioning themselves ahead of exchange listings. The project’s unique branding makes it particularly compelling. Its connection to political and cultural currents captures attention beyond crypto’s usual circles. This combination of scarcity, branding, and early adoption mirrors historical traits that fuel breakout altcoin stories . Investors watching for the next cycle’s cultural driver see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a unique opportunity. The established networks cannot replicate this opportunity due to their maturity. Timing the Rotation Altcoin seasons follow a familiar and predictable rhythm across market cycles. Bitcoin rallies typically occur first and strongest. Ethereum then consolidates gains and establishes support levels. Liquidity eventually flows into smaller tokens after these initial movements. During these capital transfers, both Solana and Ethereum will gain. When people are most excited about shopping, newer projects often see the most rapid growth. Outperforming assets have clear trends that can be seen in past cycles. Tokens with new designs and features for scarcity did much better than well-known brands. This trend from history fits nicely with MAGACOIN FINANCE. Since Bitcoin’s popularity is staying the same and capital is getting ready to move, now seems like a good time for MAGACOIN FINANCE to gain huge traction. Which Ecosystem Should Investors Choose? How much risk an investor is willing to take will have a big impact on whether they choose Solana versus Ethereum. Ethereum’s established system and well-aligned rules make it stable. These qualities make it more probable that institutions will do well over time. Solana is quick and works well for apps that need to handle a lot of traffic. This makes it attractive to both developers and customers who demand good performance. If investors are willing to go beyond the main networks, they might uncover other options. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not like any other sites that are already out there. It’s an early-stage chance centered on a story and the premise that things are hard to find. Even if Ethereum and Solana will still get most of the attention, purchasers often find the inconsistent returns they’re searching for during altcoin season in new coins. Conclusion: Giants and Newcomers Together Shape the Future There won’t be a clear winner in the fight between Solana and Ethereum. It’s conceivable that both ecosystems will do well by using different methods and areas of expertise. Ethereum will keep expanding as it becomes more mature and trustworthy. Solana will grow by becoming faster and cheaper. The market might not remember 2025 only for this competition, though. This year could be known for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that made history. Market models that predict big rises make for interesting stories. Limited amounts make potential investors feel like they need to act quickly. Branding that appeals to people outside of the crypto community gives it cultural importance. This mix shows a different type of business idea based on timing and cultural momentum. This mix could really change things for early participants in a year when altseason rotations are supposed to get stronger.

The nation recently made headlines by adding another eight Bitcoin (BTC) to its reserves over the past week. This consistent accumulation underscores El Salvador’s unwavering commitment to its innovative El Salvador Bitcoin strategy, a move that has captured the attention of financial markets worldwide. El Salvador Bitcoin: A Pioneering Path to Digital Wealth The latest acquisition brings El Salvador’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 6,227.18 BTC. This significant digital asset portfolio is currently valued at approximately $727 million, according to data from the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC). This consistent growth is not by chance; it is a result of a deliberate and long-term investment strategy. Since November 18, 2022, El Salvador has maintained a unique approach: purchasing one Bitcoin every single day. This dollar-cost averaging strategy helps mitigate the impact of market volatility, allowing the nation to build its reserves steadily over time. Moreover, this disciplined accumulation reflects a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its potential to reshape national economies. What Drives El Salvador’s Bitcoin Accumulation? El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. This bold decision was not merely about embracing a new technology; it was a strategic move aimed at fostering economic independence and financial inclusion for its citizens. The ongoing accumulation of El Salvador Bitcoin is a direct extension of this vision. The government believes that Bitcoin can offer a pathway to: Greater Financial Inclusion: Providing access to banking services for the unbanked population. Reduced Remittance Fees: Lowering costs for Salvadorans living abroad to send money home. Economic Sovereignty: Diversifying national reserves away from traditional fiat currencies. Attracting Foreign Investment: Positioning El Salvador as a hub for crypto innovation. Therefore, each daily purchase contributes to strengthening these core objectives. Benefits and Global Impact of El Salvador Bitcoin Strategy The world watches closely as El Salvador navigates its pioneering path. The benefits of its Bitcoin strategy extend beyond just accumulating digital assets. For instance, the country has seen a boost in tourism, with many crypto enthusiasts eager to experience a nation where Bitcoin is everyday currency. Furthermore, the increased liquidity and acceptance of Bitcoin within the country facilitate smoother cross-border transactions and stimulate local businesses. The National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) plays a crucial role in managing these holdings and promoting the broader adoption of Bitcoin within the nation. They ensure transparency and provide updates on the country’s Bitcoin reserves, building trust and showcasing the potential of digital assets on a national scale. This proactive stance solidifies El Salvador’s reputation as a trailblazer in the digital economy, influencing discussions about crypto adoption globally. What Challenges Lie Ahead for El Salvador Bitcoin? While the journey has been largely positive, challenges remain. Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility can impact the value of the national holdings. Critics often point to these fluctuations as a risk factor. However, El Salvador’s long-term approach, exemplified by its consistent daily purchases, aims to weather these market swings. International bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have also expressed concerns regarding financial stability and regulatory frameworks, urging caution. Despite these challenges, El Salvador continues to push forward with ambitious plans. Projects like Bitcoin City, powered by geothermal energy, and the issuance of “Volcano Bonds” demonstrate a vision for a future deeply integrated with decentralized finance. The consistent growth in El Salvador Bitcoin reserves is a testament to this enduring commitment and strategic foresight. In conclusion, El Salvador’s steady accumulation of Bitcoin, including the recent addition of eight BTC, highlights its unwavering dedication to its groundbreaking economic model. By consistently investing in Bitcoin, the nation not only strengthens its digital reserves but also reinforces its position as a global pioneer in the cryptocurrency space. This ongoing journey provides valuable insights into the potential for national-level crypto adoption and economic transformation.

XRP, Stellar, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are consistently ranked among the top seven assets expected to post strong ROI, joined by Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, and Dogecoin. Each plays a distinct role in the broader market picture — from payments infrastructure to retail-driven speculation. While XRP and Stellar bring proven adoption and Solana anchors institutional growth, it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that has quickly become the wildcard. Rising from a presale narrative into the mainstream, its projected upside is what ties the list together, giving the “top seven” both stability and breakout potential heading into 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGACOIN) — Breakout Presale Momentum Analysts now place MAGACOIN FINANCE in the same top-seven rankings that feature long-standing players like XRP and Stellar, citing its ability to draw both institutional attention and retail enthusiasm. The crypto presale project has rapidly shifted from a niche meme-fueled presale to a candidate for wider adoption, with momentum building ahead of anticipated listings. Investor sentiment is strong because MAGACOIN FINANCE straddles two narratives at once — the viral energy of meme coins and the structured rollout of more established tokens. That mix has allowed it to capture early inflows from whales while maintaining grassroots appeal. Comparisons to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are common, but analysts argue MAGACOIN’s trajectory looks more deliberate. Its placement alongside established payment networks shows how far it has climbed in market perception, moving from outsider status to one of the most closely watched crypto presales of 2025. For risk-tolerant investors, the token’s rise signals not just speculative hype but a strategic chance to secure exposure to what could become one of the cycle’s breakout performers. XRP — Post-Clarity Resurgence XRP enters 2025 with a tailwind after finally clearing regulatory hurdles with the SEC. That clarity has reignited institutional interest, making XRP one of the few established assets analysts see as capable of a major re-rating. The network’s fast, low-cost transactions and deep global partnerships remain its backbone, but what excites markets now is the potential for ETFs and broader adoption in cross-border finance. XRP is no longer treated as a “maybe” asset; it has moved back into the core discussion of blockchain-based finance, with analysts framing it as a mature play with room for sharp upside. Stellar (XLM) — Parallel Payments Growth Stellar doesn’t command the headlines XRP does, but it often moves in tandem with the Ripple-linked digital asset. Analysts routinely place it in the “next seven” for ROI growth because of its role in remittances and NGO-driven adoption. Its steady partnerships with financial institutions give it a more understated but resilient profile. For investors, Stellar is seen as a hedge within the payments narrative: less speculative than MAGACOIN FINANCE, less institutionally dominant than XRP, but positioned to rise if adoption accelerates across the sector. The Wider Top Seven The 2025 analyst shortlists don’t stop at MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Stellar. Four other altcoins — Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, and Dogecoin — are consistently highlighted as part of the group expected to drive ROI growth next year. Together, they provide balance to the list, covering infrastructure, cross-chain connectivity, and retail-driven demand. Solana continues to dominate discussions of scalability. The network’s low fees and institutional traction — amplified by the approval of a Solana ETF — make it the growth pick for investors looking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum . Cardano , while slower to develop in past cycles, is regaining attention thanks to ecosystem upgrades and its expanding footprint in DeFi. Chainlink is being recognized as a utility cornerstone. With its oracle services underpinning cross-chain liquidity and DeFi protocols, analysts see it as indispensable infrastructure that should benefit directly from broader blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin retains a place on the list as the retail favorite. Despite lacking the technical depth of the others, its cultural staying power and recurring waves of speculation continue to make it a candidate for outsized returns in bullish markets. Final takeaway By combining these four with the breakout narrative of MAGACOIN FINANCE and the payment-focused growth of XRP and Stellar, analysts argue the “top seven” represents the full spectrum of ROI opportunities — from speculative bets to institutional-grade platforms. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale once dismissed as speculative, presence among these established names in top-seven lists of ROI growth candidates, showing how investor attention is shifting toward projects that blend viral momentum with breakout potential.

On August 22, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively experienced a net outflow of $23.2 million. This marks the sixth consecutive trading day where these investment vehicles have seen more money leaving than entering. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone tracking the digital asset landscape. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Outflows Data from Farside Investors reveals that the combined net outflow for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $23.2 million on August 22. This trend of negative flows has persisted for nearly a week, prompting discussions among market observers. However, a closer look at individual fund performances offers a more nuanced picture of these Bitcoin ETF outflows . Delving into the specifics, individual ETF performances varied: BlackRock’s IBIT recorded the largest outflow, seeing $198.8 million depart. Conversely, ARK Invest’s ARKB attracted the highest net inflow at $65.7 million. Fidelity’s FBTC also saw positive movement, bringing in $50.9 million. Valkyrie’s HODL added $26.4 million. Franklin’s EZBC received $13.5 million. Bitwise’s BITB gained $12.7 million. Other ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day. These figures highlight a dynamic environment where investor sentiment can shift quickly, influencing the flow of capital in and out of these popular Bitcoin investment products. What Do These Bitcoin ETF Outflows Signify? While a $23.2 million net outflow might seem significant, it is important to place these Bitcoin ETF outflows in a broader context. Such movements are a normal part of market cycles, especially in a volatile asset class like cryptocurrency. Investors often engage in profit-taking after periods of growth or rebalance their portfolios based on wider economic indicators. For instance, the substantial outflow from BlackRock’s IBIT could be attributed to various factors, including large institutional investors adjusting their positions. However, the simultaneous inflows into other major ETFs like ARKB and FBTC suggest that capital is not necessarily leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem entirely, but rather reallocating among different providers or strategies. This indicates a nuanced market rather than a wholesale rejection of Bitcoin as an asset. Navigating Bitcoin ETF Outflows: An Investor’s Perspective For investors, understanding these daily fluctuations is key, but maintaining a long-term perspective is even more critical. Short-term Bitcoin ETF outflows can create temporary price pressures, yet the fundamental adoption and technological advancements of Bitcoin continue to evolve. Therefore, hasty reactions based on daily figures might overlook the bigger picture. Here are some actionable insights for navigating the current market: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on broader market trends, macroeconomic data, and regulatory news that could influence ETF flows. Diversify: Consider a diversified portfolio that isn’t solely reliant on a single asset or investment vehicle. Long-Term Vision: Focus on Bitcoin’s long-term potential and use short-term dips as potential entry points, rather than reacting impulsively to daily figures. Consult Experts: Before making significant investment decisions, consider seeking advice from financial professionals. Ultimately, these daily net flows are snapshots of a constantly moving market. They provide valuable data points but should be interpreted as part of a larger, ongoing narrative of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. In conclusion, the recent $23.2 million in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 22 represents a temporary dip in investor capital for some funds, while others saw robust inflows. This dynamic reflects the natural ebb and flow of market sentiment and portfolio adjustments. Rather than signaling a fundamental shift, these movements underscore the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investments and the importance of a balanced, informed approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency itself. They trade on traditional stock exchanges. 2. What caused the $23.2 million in Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 22? The outflows on August 22 were a net figure, meaning total withdrawals exceeded total deposits across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. While specific reasons vary, common factors include profit-taking by investors, portfolio rebalancing, or broader market sentiment shifts. 3. Is this a negative sign for Bitcoin’s future? Not necessarily. Daily or short-term outflows are a normal part of market dynamics, especially in volatile assets like Bitcoin. The overall trend and long-term adoption are more critical indicators than single-day figures. Inflows into other ETFs on the same day suggest reallocation rather than a complete exit. 4. How do individual ETF performances affect the overall market? Individual ETF performances contribute to the overall net flow. Large outflows from one fund, like BlackRock’s IBIT in this case, can significantly impact the aggregate figure. Conversely, strong inflows into other funds, such as ARK Invest’s ARKB and Fidelity’s FBTC, can offset some of these negative movements, indicating varied investor strategies. 5. What should investors do during periods of Bitcoin ETF outflows? Investors should prioritize staying informed, maintaining a diversified portfolio, and focusing on a long-term investment strategy. Avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations is crucial. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide valuable guidance.

Searching for Next Big Winner While Cardano & XRP Slips Lower,https://nulltx.com/ethereum-whales-next-bets-searching-for-next-big-winner-while-cardano-xrp-slips-lower/,"Large holders of Ethereum are moving their funds as popular coins like Cardano and XRP trend downward. The search for a promising new project is underway, sparking speculation across the market. Attention is turning to where these influential players might invest next, as recent shifts hint at a possible shake-up among top digital assets. Cardano (ADA) Source: TradingView ADA sits between $0.81 and $1.07 after a choppy week. The coin slid 7.55% in 7 days and 5.20% in a month but is still up 10.72% over 6 months. Buyers point to that long-term climb, while sellers highlight the fresh dip. The 10-day average at $0.86 hugs the 100-day at $0.88, showing a flat trend. RSI at 46.13 and Stochastic at 38.29 lean slightly oversold. MACD is a touch below zero, hinting that downward drive is weak and could flip fast. A break over $1.17 would mark a 15% pop and could push ADA toward $1.42, roughly 35% higher. Staying above $0.86 keeps that path open. Dropping under $0.81 risks a slide to $0.66, about 20% down, and in a hard sell-off $0.41, nearly 50% lower. For now the mixed signals suggest sideways action, yet the 6-month rise gives bulls a slight edge for an upward move in the next few weeks. XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP trades between $2.95 and $3.29 after a rough stretch. The token slid 6.96% in 1 week and 19.35% in 1 month, erasing most spring gains. Even so, it still shows an 11.27% rise over 6 months, proving buyers did not flee for good. Momentum hints at a pause. Price sits a shade above the 10-day average of $2.86 and almost level with the 100-day line at $2.94. RSI at 44.3 is neutral, while a 27.99 stochastic leans oversold. The MACD is a hair below zero, echoing the recent dip but not flashing panic. Traders now watch $3.49. A clean break could lift XRP by roughly 8% toward $3.84, the next ceiling, and that would leave the monthly chart looking steadier. Failure to clear $3.49 opens room for a drop to $2.80, about 5% lower, and a deeper slide to $2.46 would shave nearly 16% off today’s level. Until either line cracks, expect tight, choppy moves.

This significant event marks the second consecutive day of positive flows, signaling robust investor interest in Ethereum-backed exchange-traded funds. According to data from Farside Investors, this impressive performance underscores a growing trend in institutional adoption of digital assets. Which Spot Ethereum ETFs Led the Charge? On August 22, several key players in the ETF space saw substantial capital inflows, demonstrating strong market confidence. These figures highlight the immediate impact of these new investment vehicles, making it easier for investors to access Ethereum. Fidelity’s FETH: Led the pack with a substantial $117.9 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA: Followed closely, attracting an impressive $109.4 million . Grayscale’s ETHE: Saw significant interest with $45.9 million in inflows. Bitwise’s ETHW: Recorded strong participation, bringing in $36.3 million . Grayscale’s ETH: Added another $22.7 million to the total. Franklin Templeton’s EZET: Contributed $5.5 million , rounding out the top performers. The remaining spot Ethereum ETFs reported no change in their holdings. This concentration suggests investors are actively choosing established providers for their Ethereum exposure, highlighting trust in these specific funds. What Drives the Momentum Behind Spot Ethereum ETFs? The consistent positive inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs are not random; they reflect several underlying factors shaping the cryptocurrency market. Investors are increasingly seeking regulated and accessible ways to gain exposure to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Moreover, the approval of these ETFs provides a new layer of legitimacy and accessibility. These vehicles simplify the investment process, removing complexities like setting up wallets. Therefore, the convenience and regulatory oversight offered by these ETFs are powerful attractants for a broader investor base. The Broader Impact of Growing Spot Ethereum ETF Adoption The rising popularity of spot Ethereum ETFs carries significant implications for both the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader financial landscape. Increased inflows translate into greater liquidity for the underlying asset, potentially stabilizing its price and reducing volatility in the long term. Furthermore, the success of these ETFs can pave the way for more innovative crypto-backed financial products. This trend signifies a maturation of the digital asset market, moving from speculative trading to more structured investment opportunities. However, market volatility remains a factor, and investors should always conduct thorough due diligence. What’s Next for Spot Ethereum ETFs and the Crypto Market? The impressive inflows on August 22 suggest a strong appetite for regulated Ethereum investment products. This positive momentum could lead to further capital allocation into these funds, potentially driving up demand for Ethereum itself. Market observers will closely watch for continued trends and regulatory developments. As institutional interest deepens, we might see even greater integration of digital assets into traditional financial portfolios. The success of spot Ethereum ETFs serves as a powerful indicator of this evolving financial landscape, highlighting Ethereum’s growing importance as a mainstream asset class. Concluding Thoughts: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The substantial $337.7 million net inflow into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 22 marks a pivotal moment. It showcases strong investor confidence and the increasing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as a viable investment. This positive trend not only benefits the ETF providers but also solidifies Ethereum’s position in the global financial ecosystem. These products offer a simplified and secure gateway for investors to participate in the exciting world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs?

Cardano, Avalanche, and presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing growing attention, with analysts pointing to major upside potential in the months ahead. Cardano Shows Signs of Long-Term Recovery Cardano (ADA) has been strongly rebounding this year after spending most of 2024 consolidating under $0.70. Cardano is trading around $0.88, an upward trend driven by rising developer activity and institutional inflows. The blockchain is now among the largest Layer 1 networks by active wallets and is gaining new partners across DeFi, identity management and enterprise solutions. According to analysts, Cardano (ADA) price may rally towards $1.50 by late 2025 on the back of surging institution demand. Resistance levels sit at $0.97 and $1.03. According to experts, breaking above those zones could see ADA price heading towards $1.50 by late 2025. With the forthcoming ETF cycle likely to spur institutional demand for proof-of-stake assets, Cardano is firmly situated amongst the best cryptos to accumulate before the next rally. Avalanche Benefits From Growing Institutional Adoption Investors are looking for ETF-associated catalysts for Avalanche(AVAX). Currently priced at $23, AVAX offers technical support and is gaining acceptance in real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation, making it mainstream. On Avalanche, the tokenized hedge funds’ institutional product has surpassed $300 million. Moreover, RWAs are $188 million. Google Trends data shows that retail searches for AVAX have surged, indicating that instituational and retail demand could be converging for a breakout. The level of resistance is at $27, with bullish setups starting to point to a move towards $32 or even $37. ETF narratives could also help bitcoin rally, with the expectation of crypto-friendly candidates. According to a report, analysts consider Avalanche one of the most strategic assets to hold due to its speed, scalability, and widespread adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned as the Breakout Play While Cardano and Avalanche are clear beneficiaries of the ETF buzz, analysts say the real early adopter opportunity lies with MAGACOIN FINANCE. Backed by whale inflows and forecasts of 40x upside, it’s being ranked as one of the 5 best cryptos to buy now . Early buyers using PATRIOT50X unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are disappearing quickly. The project has been gaining momentum not just for its capped tokenomics and verified audits but also for its unique positioning as a politically charged, community-owned ecosystem. Whale-backed demand has already created scarcity in the presale, with analysts suggesting this could mirror the early growth phases of meme coins that later achieved multi-billion-dollar valuations. With attention shifting toward 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a strategic presale bet with asymmetric upside. Conclusion: Accumulation Before the Next Wave Cardano and Avalanche are both decent Layer 1 options. They boast growing adoption and institutional interest. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE can provide a much bigger opportunity. Analysts are predicting a 40x return as whales are also coming in for it. For this reason, many experts are recommending it as one of the best cryptos to buy before the bull run of 2025.

Ethereum (ETH) has once again captured the crypto world’s attention. For the first time ever, the total ETH futures open interest across major global crypto exchanges soared past an astonishing $70 billion on August 23rd, according to CoinGlass data. This monumental achievement signals a significant milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency, reflecting growing confidence and market participation. What’s Driving This Unprecedented ETH Futures Open Interest? The surge in ETH futures open interest isn’t just a random event; it’s a clear indicator of heightened market activity and strategic positioning by major players. Binance, a leading global exchange, accounted for a substantial $14.15 billion of this total, demonstrating its dominant role in the derivatives market. Close behind was CME, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, contributing an impressive $10.27 billion. This leadership from both a crypto-native giant and a traditional financial powerhouse underscores a broad-based interest. Moreover, this record-breaking futures activity coincided perfectly with ETH reaching an all-time high earlier on the same day. It also followed continued institutional inflows into U.S. spot ETH ETFs on August 22nd. These factors collectively fueled the surge, painting a picture of a robust and maturing market. The Significance of $70 Billion: Why Does It Matter for Ethereum? Reaching $70 billion in ETH futures open interest is more than just a large number; it signifies several critical aspects for Ethereum. Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts that have not yet been settled. A high open interest often indicates: Strong Market Confidence: Traders and institutions are actively taking positions, suggesting conviction in Ethereum’s future price trajectory. Increased Liquidity: More contracts mean a more liquid market, making it easier for large players to enter and exit positions without significant price impact. Growing Institutional Adoption: The substantial contribution from CME, a regulated traditional finance exchange, highlights increasing institutional engagement with Ethereum. This level of activity suggests that sophisticated investors are increasingly viewing Ethereum as a serious asset class, worthy of significant capital allocation. Institutional Powerhouses: Binance, CME, and Spot ETH ETFs The roles of Binance and CME cannot be overstated in this narrative. Binance’s significant share reflects the vast retail and crypto-native institutional participation. Meanwhile, CME’s strong showing underscores the expanding bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. The timing of this surge, immediately after continued inflows into U.S. spot ETH ETFs, is particularly telling. Spot ETFs provide a regulated and accessible avenue for institutional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset. As more institutions commit capital to these ETFs, it often creates a ripple effect, increasing demand and activity in related derivatives markets like futures. This symbiotic relationship between spot and futures markets is a key driver for Ethereum’s current momentum. Navigating the Future: What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Price? At the time of publication, ETH was trading at $4,752.82, showing a remarkable 10.81% increase in the past day. This price action, alongside the soaring ETH futures open interest , points towards strong bullish sentiment. Potential for Continued Growth: High open interest can precede significant price movements. If sentiment remains positive, further upward pressure on ETH’s price is possible. Increased Volatility: While bullish, a highly active futures market can also lead to increased volatility. Traders should remain cautious. Long-Term Validation: The sustained interest from institutional players, as evidenced by both futures and ETF inflows, provides long-term validation for Ethereum’s ecosystem and its role in the decentralized economy. Investors and enthusiasts are closely watching to see how this unprecedented level of interest translates into Ethereum’s broader market performance. The historic climb of ETH futures open interest past the $70 billion mark is a powerful testament to Ethereum’s growing prominence and the increasing maturity of the crypto derivatives market. Driven by key exchanges like Binance and CME, alongside robust institutional engagement through spot ETFs, Ethereum is clearly charting a course towards new heights. This milestone not only reflects current market enthusiasm but also sets a compelling precedent for future institutional adoption and sustained growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ETH futures open interest? A: ETH futures open interest refers to the total number of outstanding Ethereum futures contracts that have not yet been settled or closed. It’s a key indicator of market sentiment and liquidity. Q2: Why is $70 billion a significant milestone for Ethereum? A: Reaching $70 billion signifies unprecedented market confidence, increased liquidity, and growing institutional adoption for Ethereum, indicating its maturing status as a serious asset class. Q3: Which exchanges are leading the surge in ETH futures open interest? A: Binance and CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) are the primary exchanges leading this surge, accounting for the largest portions of the $70 billion total. Q4: How do institutional inflows into spot ETH ETFs relate to futures open interest? A: Institutional inflows into spot ETH ETFs provide regulated exposure to Ethereum, often creating a ripple effect that increases demand and activity in related derivatives markets like futures, as institutions seek to hedge or amplify positions. Q5: What could this mean for Ethereum’s price in the short term? A: High open interest, especially when coupled with strong price performance, often indicates bullish sentiment and potential for continued growth. However, it can also lead to increased market volatility. Did you find this analysis of the surging ETH futures open interest insightful?

This surprising departure, closely following other senior officials, raises important questions about the future of crypto tax enforcement and regulation in the United States. Why is the IRS Crypto Chief’s Departure So Crucial? Trish Turner’s swift exit from her role as the head of the IRS cryptocurrency division is more than just a personnel change; it signals potential shifts in how the agency approaches digital asset taxation. Her resignation, reported by CoinDesk, comes amidst a period of increasing scrutiny on cryptocurrency holdings and transactions. This development is particularly notable because it follows the departure of two other senior officials from the same division, creating a leadership void at a critical time for crypto tax policy. These exits are reportedly linked to budget cuts under the previous U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Such financial constraints can severely impact an agency’s ability to effectively staff and execute its mandate. Especially in complex and rapidly evolving areas like cryptocurrency, the challenges faced by the IRS in retaining top talent could have ripple effects on its capacity to manage the growing volume of crypto-related inquiries and filings. Understanding the Impact on Crypto Tax Compliance The IRS anticipates a significant rise in cryptocurrency-related inquiries and filings. This trend underscores the increasing mainstream adoption of digital assets and the corresponding need for clear guidance on crypto tax obligations. When key personnel, especially those leading specialized divisions, depart, it can create uncertainty. For taxpayers, this might mean a slower response to questions or less consistent enforcement as the agency navigates these internal changes. Moreover, the experience and expertise of officials like Turner are invaluable in developing robust tax frameworks for a nascent industry. Her departure could potentially delay the implementation of new policies or the clarification of existing ones. This leaves both individuals and businesses in a state of ambiguity regarding their compliance requirements. It highlights the ongoing struggle for traditional regulatory bodies to keep pace with technological innovation. Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto Tax Regulation The challenges facing the IRS in regulating cryptocurrency are multifaceted. On one hand, the decentralized nature of digital assets and the global reach of the crypto market make traditional enforcement difficult. On the other hand, the sheer volume of transactions and the variety of crypto assets demand a sophisticated and well-resourced approach. The recent departures, particularly that of the IRS crypto chief , underscore these internal pressures. However, every challenge presents an opportunity. The evolving landscape might encourage the IRS to explore new technologies or partnerships to enhance its enforcement capabilities. Furthermore, the increased public awareness surrounding crypto taxation could lead to greater calls for clearer, more streamlined regulations. This could ultimately benefit taxpayers by reducing complexity and improving compliance rates. What This Means for Your Crypto Tax Obligations For individual crypto holders and businesses, the underlying obligation to report cryptocurrency gains and losses remains unchanged. Regardless of leadership changes at the IRS, the agency continues to view virtual currency as property for tax purposes. Therefore, it is absolutely essential to maintain meticulous records of all your crypto transactions, including purchases, sales, trades, and any income received from staking or mining. Trish Turner’s next steps offer an interesting insight into the private sector’s role in this space. She is expected to join private crypto tax firms, specifically serving as tax director at CryptoTaxGirl and working with U.K.-based Asset Reality. This move suggests a growing demand for specialized crypto tax expertise outside of government, providing new resources for individuals and companies seeking professional guidance. It also shows the fluidity of talent between public service and the private sector in this niche area. The resignation of the IRS crypto chief, Trish Turner, marks a significant moment for cryptocurrency taxation. While it highlights internal challenges and budget constraints within the IRS, it also underscores the growing importance of the private sector in providing expert crypto tax guidance. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, staying informed and compliant with your tax obligations remains paramount. The need for clear, actionable advice on digital asset taxation is more critical than ever. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Tax Who is Trish Turner and why did she resign from the IRS?

The departure of key personnel like Trish Turner could create uncertainty and potentially slow down the IRS’s ability to develop and enforce clear crypto tax policies.

A bold Ethereum price prediction from Monarq Asset Management’s CIO, Sam Gaer, suggests that ETH is on the verge of an incredible breakthrough. He anticipates Ethereum could soon soar past the $5,000 mark. This optimistic outlook comes as a direct response to recent economic shifts and growing market confidence. Ethereum Price Prediction: The $5K Target in Sight Monarq CIO Sam Gaer’s analysis points to a significant rally for Ethereum (ETH). His confidence stems from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium. Powell’s comments have significantly bolstered expectations for a September interest rate cut. A rate cut typically makes traditional investments less attractive, prompting investors to seek higher returns in assets like cryptocurrencies. This shift in monetary policy acts as a powerful tailwind for the crypto market. It suggests a more accommodating economic environment. Consequently, investors are now more willing to allocate capital into riskier, yet potentially more rewarding, assets. Gaer believes this environment is perfect for a substantial Ethereum price prediction to materialize. What’s Fueling This Ethereum Price Prediction Surge? Beyond the macroeconomic factors, several elements are contributing to ETH’s strong position. Sam Gaer highlights that both Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH are poised for new highs. Crucially, he sees no immediate signs of overheating in the market. This indicates sustainable growth rather than a speculative bubble. Here are the key drivers: Strong Institutional Inflows: Large financial institutions are increasingly investing in Ethereum. This signifies growing mainstream acceptance and provides significant capital backing. Options Market Signals: Data from the options market reveals a bullish sentiment specifically favoring ETH. Traders are betting on higher prices, indicating strong confidence in its future performance. Bitcoin’s Stability: Bitcoin’s robust performance often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. Its current strength provides a stable foundation for altcoins like Ethereum to thrive. These combined factors create a compelling case for Gaer’s ambitious Ethereum price prediction . Navigating the Crypto Rally: Insights and Opportunities As the crypto market gears up for what could be a historic rally, understanding the landscape is crucial. Investors and enthusiasts alike are looking for actionable insights. The potential for ETH to break $5,000 presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges typical of volatile markets. Consider these points as you navigate the current market: Potential for Significant Gains: If the Ethereum price prediction holds true, early investors could see substantial returns. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem and ongoing developments continue to attract innovation. Market Volatility: Despite bullish signals, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. Prices can fluctuate rapidly based on news, sentiment, and unexpected events. Risk Management: It is always wise to invest only what you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio and setting clear investment goals are essential strategies. Staying informed about economic indicators and crypto-specific news will empower you to make more informed decisions. The Road Ahead for Ethereum: A Compelling Outlook The outlook for Ethereum appears incredibly promising, with Monarq CIO Sam Gaer leading the charge with a bold Ethereum price prediction . The convergence of a dovish Federal Reserve, robust institutional interest, and positive options market signals paints a clear picture of potential upward momentum. While the path to $5,000 may encounter its usual market fluctuations, the underlying fundamentals and external catalysts suggest a strong trajectory. This potential breakthrough is not just about a price target; it reflects Ethereum’s growing importance in the digital economy. As its utility expands across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions, its value proposition strengthens. The coming months could indeed mark a pivotal period for ETH, solidifying its position as a leading digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “dovish shift” and how does it affect crypto? A dovish shift refers to a central bank’s policy stance favoring lower interest rates and economic stimulus. This typically makes traditional investments less appealing, encouraging investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, thus potentially boosting their prices. Q2: Who is Sam Gaer and what is his prediction for ETH? Sam Gaer is the CIO (Chief Investment Officer) of Monarq Asset Management. He predicts that Ethereum (ETH) is poised to surpass the $5,000 mark, driven by macroeconomic factors and strong market signals. Q3: What are the main factors supporting ETH’s potential rally to $5K? Key factors include U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks hinting at a September rate cut, strong institutional inflows into crypto, and bullish signals from the options market favoring Ethereum. Q4: Is it safe to invest in Ethereum now given this prediction? While the Ethereum price prediction is optimistic, all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks due to market volatility. It’s crucial to conduct your own research, invest only what you can afford to lose, and consider diversifying your portfolio. Q5: What is the significance of the $5,000 price target for ETH? Breaking the $5,000 mark would represent a significant psychological and technical milestone for Ethereum, potentially signaling strong bullish momentum and renewed investor confidence, possibly leading to further price discovery.

50529341,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79785,1755931396,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says XRP Price Breakout Incoming. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-price-breakout-incoming-heres-why/,"A recent chart shared by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) highlighted XRP’s price compressing into a well-defined structure on the daily timeframe. The post suggested that a massive breakout is coming, with XRP trading within a symmetrical triangle, and following a five-wave Elliott Wave pattern that could increase its momentum once it breaks out of the triangle. The Setup on the Chart The symmetrical triangle began forming in July after XRP reached a new all-time high . Within this symmetrical triangle, it followed a well-defined five-wave structure, with successive highs stepping lower while lows higher, which compresses the range as candles respect both boundaries. The starting point of wave E sits close to the apex in early September. This shows that the sequence has matured and that volatility may expand as the symmetrical triangle approaches resolution. #XRP BREAKOUT INCOMING !!! pic.twitter.com/NwcXoDfmHk — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 21, 2025 What the Projection Suggests From the area around E, a green arrow projects an upward resolution. The arrow rises from the triangle’s tip toward the upper portion of the price scale, settling around the $4.5 target. This visual conveys the analyst’s expectation for a decisive move after consolidation. The chart does not provide an explicit target or date beyond the scale, but the direction and placement of the arrow suggest a climb to a new all-time high for the digital asset. Why the Pattern Matters Triangles on the daily timeframe can help identify control areas between buyers and sellers. In this case, the combination of lower highs and higher lows defines a structured contraction that progressed over several weeks. The strong advance that led into the pattern supports the case for continuation, yet confirmation remains necessary. A firm break and daily close above the upper dotted boundary would validate the scenario shown in the post. While a decisive loss of the lower support boundary would negate the setup and reset expectations, it would extend the consolidation phase and potentially send the asset’s price down. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? Two practical points follow from the chart. First, the structure looks mature, as XRP is entering the final wave in the Elliott Wave sequence. Second, the post implies action on a breakout rather than within the range. XRP is currently trading at $2.83, showing similar bearish momentum to the broader market. However, this decline should be short-lived if the asset can follow the path outlined by Steph.

The wipeout was part of $769 million liquidated marketwide, with over 183,000 traders forced out of positions. The single biggest hit was a $10 million ETH swap order on OKX, an unusually high figure for the token, which is often second to bitcoin-based positions. Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets. A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher. The move came as ether surged almost 15% to a record $4,885 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested rate cuts could arrive in September. Bitcoin lagged with a 4% gain to $113,000, while the CoinDesk 20 Index climbed 9%. Analysts say the rally isn’t just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street’s preferred blockchain. “Ether’s new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,” said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk. “I would expect ETH to surpass $10k once we start to see stablecoin solutions being implemented for payments within the U.S.” That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts.

Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is on the verge of proposing a monumental Japan crypto tax overhaul. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine how cryptocurrency gains are treated, bringing significant relief and clarity to investors and fostering a new era for digital assets. What’s Sparking This Revolutionary Japan Crypto Tax Reform? The FSA is actively working to include comprehensive cryptocurrency tax reform in its 2026 tax revision proposal. This initiative, initially reported by BeInCrypto and local outlet Nikkei, aims to streamline the taxation process while introducing stricter regulations. The ultimate goal is to foster a more robust and secure environment for digital assets, potentially even paving the way for crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Currently, crypto gains in Japan face a steep hurdle. They are categorized as “miscellaneous income,” subjecting them to progressive tax rates that can soar above 50% once local taxes are factored in. Imagine earning substantial profits only to see more than half disappear into taxes! This punitive structure has often been cited as a significant disincentive for both individual and institutional investors, hindering the growth of the local crypto market. How Will the New Japan Crypto Tax Structure Work? The FSA’s proposal seeks to fundamentally shift this paradigm. They intend to recommend moving cryptocurrency from this “miscellaneous income” category to the same tax treatment as equities. This means a separate, flat tax rate of 20% would apply. This change offers a dramatic reduction in potential tax liabilities for many investors, making crypto investments significantly more attractive and predictable. This isn’t merely about tax rates; it’s about a fundamental reclassification. The agency also plans to reclassify crypto as a financial product. This seemingly technical change has profound implications: Enhanced Investor Protections: Treating crypto as a financial product brings it under the umbrella of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. This means stronger safeguards for investors, similar to those enjoyed by stock market participants, offering a much-needed layer of security. Clear Disclosure Requirements: Companies and platforms dealing with crypto would be subject to more stringent disclosure rules, increasing transparency and accountability across the industry. Level Playing Field: It aligns crypto with traditional financial assets, potentially reducing regulatory ambiguity and fostering greater trust among both seasoned and new investors. Unlocking Potential: Benefits of the Japan Crypto Tax Overhaul The proposed Japan crypto tax changes could unlock a wave of positive developments for the nation’s digital asset ecosystem. Lower and predictable tax rates are a powerful incentive for both retail and institutional capital. When investors know their potential returns won’t be eroded by exorbitant taxes, they are more likely to engage with the market, leading to increased liquidity and innovation. Moreover, the reclassification of crypto as a financial product could accelerate the approval of crypto ETFs. These investment vehicles allow traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding them, potentially bringing billions of dollars into the market. This institutional adoption could further legitimize the asset class and drive mainstream acceptance. The clarity provided by a flat tax rate also simplifies compliance for businesses operating in the crypto space, encouraging more innovation and entrepreneurship. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Japan Crypto Tax Reform? While the FSA’s intentions are clear and largely positive, this proposal is still in its early stages. It needs to navigate the complex legislative process, including gaining approval from the ruling party and passing through parliament. The target for implementation is the 2026 tax revision, meaning there’s still a journey ahead before these changes become law. Stakeholder consultations and potential amendments are also part of the process. However, the clear direction from a key financial regulator is a strong signal of Japan’s commitment to embracing the future of finance responsibly. This proactive approach by Japan could position it as a leader in creating a balanced and supportive environment for digital assets. For crypto enthusiasts and investors worldwide, Japan’s move is a beacon of hope, demonstrating how sensible regulation can foster innovation rather than stifle it. This bold step reflects a growing understanding among global regulators that a clear, fair, and predictable tax framework is essential for the healthy development of the cryptocurrency market. Japan’s leadership in this area could set a precedent for other nations grappling with similar challenges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Japan Crypto Tax What is the current crypto tax rate in Japan? Currently, crypto gains are taxed as “miscellaneous income,” subject to progressive rates that can exceed 50% when local taxes are included. What is the proposed new Japan crypto tax rate? The FSA proposes a flat 20% tax rate, aligning it with how equities are taxed. When is this crypto tax reform expected to take effect? The reform is part of the FSA’s 2026 tax revision proposal, meaning it could be implemented in 2026 if approved. How will reclassifying crypto as a financial product benefit investors? This reclassification will bring crypto under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, offering enhanced investor protections and clearer disclosure requirements, similar to traditional financial assets. Could this reform lead to crypto ETFs in Japan? Yes, reclassifying crypto as a financial product and establishing a clear tax framework could pave the way for the approval and launch of crypto-linked Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in Japan.

Speculation is rising about its potential to outshine its rivals and deliver extraordinary returns during this cycle. Early interest and market whispers hint that this could be the breakout project everyone is searching for. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView SHIB has slipped for three straight periods, down 3.72% over the past week, almost 20% in a month, and just over 20% in six months. Even with that grind lower, the token now trades between $0.00001229 and $0.00001398, almost level with both its 10-day and 100-day averages. This tight band shows traders are pausing after the sell-off. Momentum is mixed. The strength index sits near 49, a middle zone that signals neither clear buying nor selling force. A similar mid-40 reading on the stochastic line echoes that stalemate, while the main trend signal stays a shade negative. Put simply, SHIB lacks a spark, but it is also not collapsing. All eyes turn to $0.00001493, the closest ceiling, and $0.00001155, the floor that has cushioned recent dips. If bulls manage to punch through the first barrier, price could add roughly 15% and test the next ceiling near $0.00001662, taking the six-month slide back into single-digit territory. Failure to defend $0.00001155 would likely drag SHIB about 10% lower, with a deeper slip toward $0.00000986 adding up to a 25% retreat from current levels. Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView Pepe sits near 0.000011 inside a band from $0.0000102173 to $0.0000123633. The coin fell 5.82% in 7 days and 26.60% over a month, trimming the meme buzz. Yet it is still up 8.21% in 6 months, keeping hopes alive for patient holders. The 10-day and 100-day averages meet at about $0.00001045, almost level with the market. This flat line shows a standoff. A momentum reading close to 50 signals neither strong buying nor heavy selling. Shrinking volume hints that traders wait for a clear push. A close above $0.0000135936 could trigger fresh bids, opening the way to $0.0000157396, roughly 20% and 40% above today’s midpoint. Failure to clear that cap risks a slide to $0.0000093016, about 18% lower, with a deeper floor at $0.0000071556, nearly 37% down. Until a breakout, Pepe likely drifts sideways while bulls search for a spark. Current memecoins price prediction models reflect this cautious outlook amid broader market uncertainty. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Conclusion SHIB and PEPE remain solid memes. Yet XYZVerse (XYZ) merges sports passion with meme power, eyeing 20,000% gains as early entrants shape a community-driven GOAT for the 2025 surge.

News Background • The Federal Reserve signaled a softer stance on crypto banking rules, while Wyoming launched the first state-backed stablecoin. Both developments lifted sentiment around digital assets. • Trump-linked entity Thumzup completed a $50 million acquisition of Dogecoin mining firm Dogehash, forming what executives claim is the largest DOGE mining operation. • SoFi became the first U.S. banking institution to integrate Bitcoin’s Lightning Network for remittances, reinforcing broader institutional adoption of crypto infrastructure. • Whale wallets accumulated 680 million DOGE tokens through August, cementing rising institutional flows despite retail-driven volatility. Price Action Summary • DOGE rallied 8% in the Aug. 22–23 session, climbing from $0.22 to $0.24 in a $0.02 range. • The sharpest move came at 14:00 GMT on Aug. 22, when DOGE spiked from $0.21 to $0.23 on 4.27B volume, nearly quadruple the hourly average. • Support now holds at $0.21 after a successful retest, while resistance capped gains at the $0.24 psychological level. • A late-session surge added 1% from $0.23 to $0.24, with a volume peak of 28.1M at 04:52 GMT confirming accumulation. • Price action shows consecutive higher lows, suggesting sustained buying pressure and potential trend continuation. Market Analysis DOGE’s breakout aligns with a broader crypto rebound as risk appetite improved across equities and digital assets. The combination of Fed policy recalibration, state-level stablecoin adoption, and a high-profile mining acquisition amplified institutional participation in a token often viewed as purely retail-driven. The $0.24 level remains a critical inflection point. A sustained breakout could open momentum targets toward $0.26, while failure risks renewed retests of $0.21 support. Technical Indicators • 24-hour gain of 8% from $0.22 to $0.24 with $0.02 trading range. • Volume spiked 97% above 30-day average with 4.27B tokens traded. • Support confirmed at $0.21 following intraday retest. • Resistance hardened at $0.24 psychological threshold. • Consecutive higher lows point to bullish structure. • Volume surge of 28.1M at 04:52 GMT validates institutional flows. What Traders Are Watching • Whether DOGE can establish $0.24 as support for a clean breakout toward $0.26. • Ongoing whale accumulation trends versus potential retail profit-taking at resistance. • Impact of Wyoming’s state-backed stablecoin launch on memecoin liquidity flows. • Futures open interest reaction after heavy spot-driven rally.",Markets|Dogecoin|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-23 07:05:04

Recently, a story emerged that has captivated the crypto community, highlighting both the volatile nature of digital assets and the cunning of those who exploit vulnerabilities. We’re talking about the Radiant Capital hacker , whose audacious move not only siphoned millions but then reportedly doubled their illicit gains through strategic Ethereum (ETH) swing trading. Who is the Radiant Capital Hacker and What Did They Do? In October 2024, the DeFi protocol Radiant Capital (RDNT) suffered a significant blow. An unknown perpetrator executed an exploit, managing to steal a staggering $53 million. This incident sent ripples through the DeFi space, raising concerns about security and the integrity of smart contracts. However, the story didn’t end there. Following the initial breach, the Radiant Capital hacker converted the stolen assets into a substantial amount of Ethereum. On-chain analysis by experts like @EmberCN on X revealed that the hacker acquired approximately 21,900 ETH. They purchased these ETH tokens at an average price of $2,420, essentially parking their ill-gotten gains in one of the market’s most prominent cryptocurrencies. This initial acquisition phase was crucial. It demonstrated a calculated move to consolidate the stolen funds into a liquid and widely accepted asset. Many assumed the funds would simply sit, perhaps awaiting a complex laundering process. However, the hacker had other plans, showcasing a surprising level of market acumen. How Did the Radiant Capital Hacker Double Their Fortune? The plot thickened as the Radiant Capital hacker began to actively manage their stolen ETH holdings. Instead of remaining dormant, the hacker engaged in what appears to be sophisticated ETH swing trading. This strategy involves buying and selling an asset over short to medium timeframes, aiming to profit from price fluctuations. Here’s a breakdown of their reported trading activity, turning $53 million into over $100 million: Initial Acquisition: 21,900 ETH purchased at an average price of $2,420 after the exploit. Liquidation Begins: On August 14, the hacker started liquidating some of their ETH holdings, indicating active market participation. Strategic Buys: Recently, 4,914 ETH were acquired at a higher average price of $4,167, suggesting confidence in an upward trend. Profitable Sales: Just three days later, on August 23, 3,931 ETH were sold at an average price of $4,726. This move converted a significant portion into DAI stablecoins. These calculated moves allowed the Radiant Capital hacker to significantly increase the value of their portfolio. Their current holdings are estimated to be approximately $104 million. This includes a mix of 13,300 ETH and a substantial 42.03 million DAI. This diversification into stablecoins indicates a move to lock in profits and reduce exposure to further ETH price volatility. What Does This Mean for DeFi Security and On-Chain Analysis? This extraordinary case raises critical questions for the decentralized finance ecosystem. It highlights that while exploits are a significant concern, the subsequent actions of attackers can be equally, if not more, impactful. The ability of the Radiant Capital hacker to effectively trade and multiply their illicit gains showcases a new dimension of cybercrime in crypto. On-chain analysts, like @EmberCN, play a crucial role in tracking these movements. Their ability to follow the flow of funds provides invaluable insights into hacker behavior and market dynamics. However, the fact that a hacker can not only steal but also successfully trade stolen assets presents a complex challenge for law enforcement and recovery efforts. It emphasizes the need for continuous innovation in security protocols and forensic tools within the DeFi space. The story of the Radiant Capital hacker is an astonishing reminder of the wild west nature of the crypto world. It’s a tale of a massive exploit followed by an impressive display of trading prowess, turning a $53 million theft into a $104 million fortune. While such incidents are disheartening, they also push the industry to evolve, strengthen its defenses, and enhance its ability to track and potentially recover stolen assets. This event underscores the ongoing battle between security innovation and the relentless pursuit of illicit gains in the ever-expanding DeFi landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What happened to Radiant Capital in October 2024? Radiant Capital, a DeFi protocol, suffered an exploit in October 2024, resulting in the theft of $53 million in assets by a hacker. 2. How did the Radiant Capital hacker manage to double their stolen funds? After the initial theft, the Radiant Capital hacker engaged in strategic Ethereum (ETH) swing trading, buying and selling ETH at opportune times to profit from price fluctuations, effectively doubling their initial illicit gains. 3. What is ETH swing trading? ETH swing trading is a strategy where traders buy and sell Ethereum over short to medium timeframes, aiming to capture profits from price swings rather than long-term holding. 4. What are the current holdings of the Radiant Capital hacker? As of recent reports, the Radiant Capital hacker ‘s holdings are estimated to be approximately $104 million, comprising 13,300 ETH and 42.03 million DAI. 5. What does this incident mean for DeFi security? This incident highlights the dual challenge in DeFi: preventing initial exploits and then tracking/recovering funds from sophisticated attackers who can also trade. It emphasizes the need for stronger security protocols and advanced on-chain forensic tools. The unfolding saga of the Radiant Capital hacker is a compelling narrative that impacts the entire crypto community.

One such forecast comes from Tom Lee, a highly respected figure in finance. He sees a very high probability of ETH surpassing BTC in terms of market capitalization. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a profound insight from a seasoned expert with significant credibility in market analysis. Why Tom Lee Believes in ETH Surpassing BTC Tom Lee, founder of the U.S. research firm Fundstrat and chairman of Nasdaq-listed BitMiner (BMNR), recently shared his compelling perspective during an interview with The Compound, as reported by Benzinga. His vision for Ethereum’s potential dominance is rooted in historical parallels and current market dynamics. Historical Analogy: Lee drew a fascinating comparison to 1971, when the U.S. abandoned the gold standard. While many focused on gold, Wall Street ultimately emerged as the real winner by adapting to the new financial landscape. He suggests a similar shift could happen in crypto. Market Evolution: This analogy implies that while Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the ‘digital gold,’ the market’s focus could shift to assets offering more utility and growth potential, much like traditional finance pivoted from gold to more dynamic investment vehicles. This perspective provides a fresh lens through which to view the ongoing competition between the two largest cryptocurrencies. The Power of Institutional Inflows: Fueling Ethereum’s Rise A key driver behind Lee’s prediction for ETH surpassing BTC is the anticipated influx of institutional capital. He believes that significant investment from Wall Street could dramatically accelerate Ethereum’s growth. 100x Potential: Lee suggests that these institutional inflows could drive ETH to rise by up to 100 times its current value. Such a surge would undeniably position it to flip Bitcoin in market cap. BitMiner’s Strategy: As a testament to this institutional confidence, Lee’s own company, BitMiner, has formalized an ETH accumulation strategy. The firm reportedly holds approximately 1.52 million ETH, making it the largest Ethereum treasury globally. This demonstrates a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term value and its potential for substantial appreciation. The institutional embrace of Ethereum highlights its growing legitimacy and appeal beyond retail investors. This trend is pivotal for its future trajectory. Market Dynamics and Macroeconomic Influences on ETH Recent market events further underscore Ethereum’s momentum, aligning with Tom Lee’s optimistic outlook. The broader economic environment often plays a significant role in cryptocurrency performance. Recent Surge: Ethereum recently surged near all-time highs. This impressive rally followed dovish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell regarding potential September rate cuts. Investor Confidence: Such macroeconomic signals can boost investor confidence in risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Lower interest rates typically make growth-oriented assets more attractive, directly benefiting ETH. Understanding these interconnected factors is crucial for grasping the full scope of why ETH surpassing BTC is seen as a high probability by experts like Tom Lee. What Does an ETH Market Cap Flip Mean for the Crypto Landscape? If Ethereum were to truly surpass Bitcoin’s market capitalization, it would mark a transformative moment for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This scenario has profound implications for investors and the future of digital assets. Evolving Narratives: It would shift the narrative from Bitcoin as the sole ‘digital gold’ to Ethereum as a foundational layer for decentralized applications, NFTs, and a new internet economy. Investment Strategies: Investors might increasingly diversify their portfolios, recognizing Ethereum’s utility and growth potential alongside Bitcoin’s store-of-value proposition. Innovation Focus: A flip could also accelerate innovation on the Ethereum network, attracting even more developers and projects to its robust ecosystem. This potential shift underscores the dynamic and competitive nature of the crypto market, where utility and innovation are increasingly valued. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Ethereum While the prospect of ETH surpassing BTC is exciting, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The path to market dominance is rarely straightforward. Scalability: Ethereum continues to work on scalability solutions, though significant progress has been made with upgrades like the Merge. Further enhancements are vital for mass adoption. Regulatory Clarity: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally will also play a crucial role in Ethereum’s growth and institutional acceptance. Competition: Other smart contract platforms are constantly innovating, presenting competitive pressures that Ethereum must navigate. Despite these hurdles, the opportunities for Ethereum remain immense, especially with its strong community, established ecosystem, and ongoing development. Tom Lee’s prediction that ETH surpassing BTC is a very high probability event offers a compelling glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency. His insights, backed by historical analogies and an understanding of institutional finance, suggest a potential paradigm shift. As Wall Street increasingly embraces digital assets, Ethereum’s utility and robust ecosystem position it uniquely for significant growth. This isn’t just about market cap; it’s about the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape, potentially ushering in a new era where innovation and utility take center stage. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Tom Lee and why is his prediction significant? A1: Tom Lee is the founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a prominent Wall Street research firm, and chairman of BitMiner. His significance comes from his deep expertise in traditional finance and his early, often accurate, insights into the crypto market, lending credibility to his predictions. Q2: What does ‘ETH surpassing BTC’ mean? A2: It means Ethereum’s total market capitalization (price per coin multiplied by circulating supply) would exceed that of Bitcoin. This would signify a major shift in perceived value and dominance within the cryptocurrency market. Q3: How could institutional inflows drive Ethereum’s market cap? A3: Institutional investors manage vast amounts of capital. When they allocate even a small percentage to an asset like Ethereum, it can lead to massive demand, driving up its price and subsequently its market capitalization significantly. Q4: What is the significance of the 1971 gold standard analogy? A4: Lee uses this analogy to suggest a historical precedent where a dominant asset (gold) was eventually overshadowed by more dynamic financial instruments (Wall Street investments). He implies a similar shift could occur from Bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ status to Ethereum’s utility-driven ecosystem. Q5: What factors, besides institutional money, could contribute to ETH’s rise? A5: Beyond institutional inflows, factors include Ethereum’s continuous technological upgrades (like the Merge), its vibrant ecosystem of dApps and NFTs, increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), and favorable macroeconomic conditions such as potential interest rate cuts. Q6: Is BitMiner’s ETH accumulation strategy unique? A6: While other entities hold ETH, BitMiner’s reported 1.52 million ETH makes it the largest corporate Ethereum treasury globally. This significant holding demonstrates a strong, formalized institutional belief in Ethereum’s long-term value and potential for market leadership. Did you find this analysis insightful?

A Crypto Market Outlook for the Rest of 2025,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/are-we-in-a-bear-market-a-crypto-market-outlook-for-the-rest-of-2025/,"The crypto market is standing at the foot of a crossroads, as the lingering question is whether this market is still in the bear market or whether the current turmoil is just the beginning of a new bull market. Earlier in the year, Bitcoin and most other major indexes suffered a sharp decline. Yet that they rallied to new all-time highs shows the resiliency of the asset class. In this regard, one of the surveys carried out by the Investopedia indicates that nearly two-thirds of the retail investors can be deemed as optimistic . The said degree of confidence is anchored firmly on strong corporate portfolios and the capacity of the economy. Almost on par with consumer support is institutional backing of Bitcoin. The SEC move to legalize the spot bitcoin ETFs has catalyzed the rise in prices and liquidity in the international market. This does not only help Bitcoin but the crypto market at large. Given that crypto is now thoroughly integrated into mainstream finance—a fact demonstrated by a series of high-profile IPOs and the growing trend of companies establishing digital asset reserves—the overarching narrative continues to lean much more bullish than bearish. Market Signals & Interpretation Despite those shorter-lived downward infusions that, technically, qualified as being in bear territory, i.e., down sharply more than 20%, the overall situation has been quite murky. The strong economy and much cash to move into the ETFs have played a huge role in giving rise to Bitcoin. Money is pouring into the market, small cash is bullish, and the future is bright with the new guidelines of cryptos in the U.S. A lot of news about money talks about how popular initial coin offerings (ICOs) are and how many companies hold crypto. Plus, over 135 public companies now name Bitcoin as a backup asset on their balance sheets. This shows that Bitcoin is becoming more prominent. Also, good news like the proposed Genius Act and state rules that back it up is making people trust organizations even more. This makes people even more sure that crypto is a safe way to handle money. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an excellent opportunity that is becoming extremely relevant in this complex and dynamic world. Customers can already find Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP very expensive, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its infancy and this aspect aligns with the way organizations are evolving. The clever money is investing more of its money in MAGACOIN FINANCE now as money is on the move. The phases of this presale of the project were sold quickly since they were restricted in number. That indicates that demand was excessive long before any typical cyclical surges enjoyed their start. It is the politically charged branding and community that makes MAGACOIN stand out the most, as its history follows a similar pattern of powerful cultural trends of power. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an isolated case in the industry where the attitude towards promotion is rational, with the frequency of its usage sufficiently high to end up with development. Broader Market Context From a macro standpoint, even traditional markets are holding onto a fragile sort of optimism. Sure, U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies are climbing, but you can’t ignore the nagging worries about core producer prices and this stubborn inflation that just won’t quit—it’s all still very much on everyone’s radar. Taking a macro view, even ordinary markets are showing some sort of insecure faith. Despite the rising stocks and cryptocurrency, people remain worried about the core producer prices and inflation that is not declining. Simultaneously, an increasingly symbiotic relationship between crypto and traditional banking, such as with the emergence of new crypto-linked loans at JPMorgan or concurring changes regarding the government digital asset strategy, inevitably begs the question as to what may be systemic failure points, despite what may seem to be a robust performance in the market at this present time. Nonetheless, the majority of analysts are still saying that the bear market has not really started. An example for illustration is that PlanB and other popular predictive applications maintain to prophesy consistent tracking of Bitcoin strengthening through long-term period windows. Even business leaders are saying that the market is experiencing temporary and macro-caused corrections rather than long-term business-cycle decline. Conclusion: A Transitional Phase In a nutshell, although 2025 has already had periods of significant technical drawdown, all the prevailing indicators—healthy fund tracking products and fees, rapidly advancing institutional scaling, proactive regulation, and intense initial public offering activity are working in favor of this not being a traditional bear market. The current market situation can be characterized as one of transition, and there are indications that the market could harbor the entrance of so many people in the market and could also expand over the long term. The market stands at a crossroads, and it is a good time to make a purchase by buyers who love planning in advance. These developments are providing space to new ideas to emerge. Its concept of core scarcity, the entire politically motivated brand built around it, and the accumulation of major players before the era of mass usage of the given concept even commences is a definite strength of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Once the market turns again in the other direction, such pre-sale tokens with their appealing narrative and sound fundamentals may have a strong head start ahead of the older and already tired projects.

According to the filing filed today, the proposed VanEck JitoSOL ETF aims to track the price of the liquid staking token (LST) JitoSOL. JitoSOL is a tokenized version of staked SOL, allowing users to maintain the value of their staked assets while still earning on-chain rewards. This allows investors to generate returns and use their assets in DeFi applications without locking them up. The Jito Foundation announced in a statement that the fund will be “the first spot Solana ETF backed by 100% liquid staking tokens.” Unlike traditional staking, liquid staking provides a tradable token in exchange for the staked asset, offering investors both liquidity and returns. Related News: Ethereum Soars to New Heights: Historic Moments Unfold - ATH on the Horizon - Here's Why and the Current Situation Alongside the filing, the Jito Foundation announced that it has been in intensive discussions with the SEC and other authorities in recent months. Jito Labs CEO Lucas Bruder and Legal Director Rebecca Rettig previously met with the SEC's Crypto Task Force to discuss how staking and re-staking mechanisms could be implemented in ETFs. The SEC previously clarified that proof-of-stake-based staking activities would not be considered securities transactions and that certain liquid staking activities would not qualify as securities. The Jito Foundation stated that following this guidance, the “compliance process for LST-based ETFs and ETPs has become clear and applicable.” Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett commented on the development: “Look at how far we’ve come in just one year; Wall Street giants like VanEck and regulators like the SEC are now considering liquid staking token-backed ETFs.” *This is not investment advice.

One powerful metric that offers a direct glimpse into trader sentiment is the Bitcoin long-short ratio . This vital indicator helps us see whether more traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price going up or down. Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour data to decode what the market is truly thinking and how these ratios can empower your trading decisions. What Are Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios, Anyway? Before we dissect the numbers, let’s clarify what Bitcoin long-short ratios represent. Essentially, this ratio compares the number of ‘long’ positions (bets that the price will increase) to ‘short’ positions (bets that the price will decrease) on perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading. When the long percentage is higher, it suggests a more bullish sentiment among traders. Conversely, a higher short percentage points towards a bearish outlook. Monitoring these ratios across various exchanges provides a comprehensive view of overall market positioning and potential directional biases, offering a window into collective trader psychology. Unpacking the Latest 24-Hour Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios Over the past 24 hours, the collective sentiment across major cryptocurrency exchanges shows a finely balanced, almost neutral, positioning. Here’s a breakdown of the Bitcoin long-short ratios : Total Market Overview: Long 49.82%, Short 50.18% This overall figure indicates a slight lean towards short positions, suggesting a cautious or slightly bearish sentiment in the broader market. However, a closer look at individual exchanges reveals some interesting variations: Binance: Long 49.53%, Short 50.47% – Binance traders show a clear lean towards short positions, slightly more bearish than the overall market. Bybit: Long 50.19%, Short 49.81% – In contrast, Bybit users exhibit a slightly bullish bias, with long positions marginally outnumbering shorts. Gate.io: Long 49.68%, Short 50.32% – Similar to Binance, Gate.io traders are leaning bearish, though less pronounced than Binance. These disparities highlight how sentiment can vary even among leading platforms. Therefore, a holistic view of Bitcoin long-short ratios is essential for a complete picture of market dynamics. What Do These Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios Mean for Traders? Analyzing these ratios offers actionable insights for savvy traders. Understanding the prevailing sentiment can help you anticipate potential market movements. When the market is heavily skewed in one direction, it often sets the stage for a ‘squeeze’ – a rapid price movement in the opposite direction as traders are forced to cover their positions. Identifying Overextension: A significantly high long ratio might suggest an overextended bullish sentiment, potentially leading to a long squeeze if prices drop. Conversely, an extreme short ratio could precede a short squeeze. Confirming Trends: If the Bitcoin long-short ratio aligns with a current price trend, it can confirm the strength of that trend. For instance, an increasing long ratio during an uptrend suggests strong conviction among buyers. Spotting Divergences: Sometimes, the ratio might diverge from price action. If the price is rising but the long ratio is decreasing, it could signal weakening conviction among buyers, potentially indicating a trend reversal. It is important to remember that these ratios are just one piece of the puzzle. They work best when combined with other technical and fundamental analysis tools to form a comprehensive trading strategy. Navigating the Nuances of Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios While invaluable, Bitcoin long-short ratios are not without their complexities. Traders must consider several factors to interpret them effectively. For example, a slight majority of short positions, as seen in the total market, doesn’t automatically guarantee a price drop. It merely indicates the current positioning of leveraged traders. Moreover, the composition of traders on each exchange can influence its specific ratio. Different platforms attract different types of traders, which can lead to varying sentiment distributions. For instance, some exchanges might have a higher proportion of retail traders, while others might cater more to institutional players, whose strategies could differ significantly. Always consider the broader context and avoid making decisions based on a single indicator, ensuring a robust approach to market analysis. Conclusion: Staying Ahead with Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios The 24-hour Bitcoin long-short ratios provide a fascinating snapshot of market sentiment, revealing a slight bearish lean overall, with interesting variations across top exchanges. By understanding these dynamics, traders can gain a deeper appreciation of market positioning and potential future movements. While not a crystal ball, these ratios are a powerful tool for enhancing your trading strategy. Stay informed, stay analytical, and always trade with a comprehensive understanding of market indicators to navigate the volatile crypto landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are BTC perpetual futures? A1: BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they do not settle physically and are popular for continuous trading, offering leverage and enabling both long and short positions. Q2: How do Bitcoin long-short ratios indicate market sentiment? A2: These ratios compare the number of long (buy) positions to short (sell) positions on perpetual futures. A higher percentage of long positions suggests bullish sentiment, while a higher percentage of short positions indicates bearish sentiment among traders. Q3: Why do long-short ratios differ across exchanges? A3: Ratios can vary due to differences in trader demographics, liquidity, trading volumes, and specific market events on each platform. Different exchanges may attract distinct trader profiles, leading to varied collective sentiment. Q4: Can I use Bitcoin long-short ratios to predict price movements? A4: While powerful, Bitcoin long-short ratios are not a standalone predictive tool. They offer insights into market positioning and sentiment, which can precede price movements, but they should always be used in conjunction with other technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and risk management strategies. Q5: What is the difference between a ‘long’ and a ‘short’ position in futures trading? A5: A ‘long’ position is a bet that the asset’s price will increase, aiming to profit from a rise. A ‘short’ position is a bet that the asset’s price will decrease, aiming to profit from a fall. Both are common strategies in futures markets.

CryptoSensei shared a clip of Barron where he criticized these forecasts, as both suggested gradual and sustainable growth. Avoiding Unreasonable Predictions Barron stated that forecasts of XRP reaching $500 to $1,000 are implausible in the near term, calling such figures unrealistic. CryptoSensei amplified the concern, arguing that high-profile figures who project extreme outcomes carry responsibility because many followers act on public commentary. HONEST RIPPLE XRP PREDICTION!!! pic.twitter.com/CZuA8A6LUU — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) August 21, 2025 The core of CryptoSensei’s argument is that public figures shape expectations. He emphasized that when creators with substantial followings endorse speculative price targets, they risk exposing followers to financial harm if those projections fail. CryptoSensei noted that credibility and access within the industry do not justify presenting speculative scenarios as likely outcomes. He suggested that clearer communication about uncertainty is necessary to protect retail participants and to maintain trust in public discourse. Other experts have consistently warned against these unrealistic targets , and CryptoSensei warned that influencers with large audiences should prioritize accuracy and restraint when discussing potential returns. Assessing the Claims Evaluating multi-hundred-dollar price projections requires balancing theoretical scenarios against observable market fundamentals. CryptoSensei did not deny that dramatic outcomes are imaginable under extreme systemic changes. However, he questioned the assigned likelihood of those events occurring soon, mirroring beliefs shared by other analysts about the infeasibility of these targets . He highlights the need to separate long-term hypothetical narratives from near-term probability statements and avoid framing improbable outcomes as expectations. He urged commentators to support probabilistic claims with transparent evidence and to identify the key assumptions that drive any headline number.

All sources on predictions should be trustworthy, and everyone should treat bold price targets with skepticism. While he acknowledged that XRP has the potential to experience massive price surges , investors must consider the range of plausible outcomes and the specific assumptions behind any forecast. CryptoSensei’s comments also serve as a reminder to content creators and commentators. He argued for transparency about uncertainties and for explicitly distinguishing personal views from empirical analysis. He suggested that influential voices adopt a consistent standard for qualifying optimistic scenarios and avoid implying certainty to the community where none exists.

Hype has been driven by the much-awaited Remittix wallet launch and promised CEX listing, making RTX one of the most promising crypto presale projects for 2025. Priced at just $0.0969 per token, investors are taking note of its gaining traction and growing utility in the DeFi space. Solana Market Performance and Changing Focus Solana has nonetheless continued to trade aggressively, and its price is currently at $180.87, a 2.1% decrease. Its market capitalization is $97.71 billion, but trading volume has taken a dive down to $4.59 billion, a decrease of 30.96%. Although Solana remains one of the top performers in the blockchain ecosystem, some large holders are diversifying their bets into upcoming crypto ventures like Remittix. This shift reflects that investors are now focused on low gas fee crypto projects with good use cases, namely payments and real-world adoption. To many, early crypto investment in RTX offers exposure to a new altcoin with utility rather than speculation. Remittix Wallet Unveiling and Presale Momentum The spotlight is on Remittix now that it has announced its wallet unveiling, which will launch live with the beta version planned in Q3 2025. The mobile-first wallet will enable real-time FX conversion and cross-border transfers into traditional bank accounts in 30+ nations. The wallet provides utility adoption value, positioning RTX to be more than just another DeFi project. On the presale front, Remittix has already raised over $20.7 million with over 614 million tokens sold at the price of $0.0969 per token. The success was capped with the project’s maiden centralized exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart, which widened global access and liquidity. The momentum will continue as the team works towards its next fundraising goal of $22 million, with the announcement of a second CEX listing in the offing. Key Forces Accelerating Remittix’s Growth Cross-border capability: Crypto-to-bank transfers directly in 30+ countries Transparent FX conversion: Real-time rates via its wallet launch in Q3 Successful presale: Over $20.7Million raised, 613Million+ tokens sold Exchange listing: First CEX listing confirmed on BitMart Community rewards: $250,000 Remittix Giveaway ongoing The RTX buying up by large holders, combined with the strong but unpredictable Solana performance, underscores a trend towards crypto that has real utility. With the presale going strong and a wallet launch planned later in 2025, Remittix is still set to be one of the leading DeFi projects this year. For the investors looking to the next big altcoin, Remittix is the best bet to address real-world issues in the $19 trillion payments industry. That it enjoys presale momentum, upcoming CEX listings, and new wallet functionality makes it a project worth watching in the months ahead.

Suddenly, crypto market sentiment has swung dramatically, moving from a neutral or cautious stance straight into “Greed.” This rapid change wasn’t random; it followed pivotal comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, signaling a potentially softer approach to monetary policy. For many, this moment has reignited optimism, fueling discussions about what lies ahead for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. What Ignited the Shift in Crypto Market Sentiment? The catalyst for this sudden surge in positive crypto market sentiment was clear: Jerome Powell’s speech at the recent Jackson Hole symposium. Prior to his address, market participants were cautiously optimistic, with the probability of a September rate cut hovering around 75%. However, Powell’s carefully chosen words hinted at a more accommodative stance, suggesting the Fed might be less aggressive in its fight against inflation than previously anticipated. This dovish turn was a game-changer. Almost immediately, the market reacted. The likelihood of a September rate cut soared above 90%, reflecting a strong belief among investors that borrowing costs would soon decrease. Lower interest rates typically make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, more attractive. Therefore, this policy pivot directly contributed to the renewed investor confidence we are now witnessing. Understanding the Fed’s Dovish Turn and Its Impact A “dovish turn” essentially means the Federal Reserve is leaning towards policies that favor economic growth over strictly controlling inflation, often by keeping interest rates low or cutting them. This contrasts with a “hawkish” stance, which prioritizes inflation control, usually through higher rates. For the crypto market, a dovish Fed is generally bullish. Why? Because when traditional investments offer lower returns due to low interest rates, investors often seek higher-growth opportunities elsewhere. The implications of this shift are significant: Increased Liquidity: Lower rates can lead to more money flowing into the financial system. Reduced Opportunity Cost: Holding cryptocurrencies becomes more appealing compared to low-yield savings or bonds. Risk-On Appetite: Investors become more willing to take on risk in pursuit of higher returns. This environment naturally fosters a positive crypto market sentiment , pushing the Fear & Greed Index firmly into “Greed” territory. How Did the Crypto Market Respond to This Sentiment Shift? The response from the broader markets was immediate and enthusiastic. Cointelegraph reported that the cryptocurrency sector, in particular, saw a significant boost. Bitcoin, the flagship digital asset, quickly climbed by 5%. Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surged even more impressively, climbing 11% to reach new all-time highs. These gains were not just numerical; they reflected a palpable change in investor psychology. The “Greed” indicator, which measures market sentiment, jumped in a single day. This indicates that investors are now feeling more confident, perhaps even eager, to buy into the market, anticipating further price appreciation. Such rapid price movements often signal a strong underlying belief in the market’s upward trajectory, especially when driven by macroeconomic factors like central bank policy. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Phase: What’s Next for Crypto Investors? While a “Greed” phase can be exciting, it also requires a measured approach. It suggests that many investors are optimistic, but sometimes, excessive greed can lead to irrational exuberance and potential market corrections. Therefore, understanding the current crypto market sentiment is crucial for making informed decisions. For investors, this period offers both opportunities and challenges: Opportunities: Potential for continued gains in leading assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Emerging altcoins might also see significant upside. Challenges: Increased volatility and the risk of “FOMO” (Fear Of Missing Out) leading to impulsive decisions. Market corrections can occur swiftly. Actionable Insight: Always conduct thorough research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research) before investing. Consider diversifying your portfolio and never invest more than you can afford to lose. While the current outlook is positive, market dynamics can change rapidly. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s dovish pivot has undoubtedly injected a fresh wave of optimism into the cryptocurrency space. With the probability of a September rate cut now significantly higher, crypto market sentiment has decisively shifted to “Greed.” This shift has fueled impressive rallies in Bitcoin and Ethereum, pushing them to new all-time highs. While the excitement is palpable, prudent investors will continue to monitor global economic indicators and maintain a balanced perspective. The digital asset journey is always evolving, and staying informed is key to navigating its highs and lows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent shift in crypto market sentiment? A1: The primary cause was U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish comments at the Jackson Hole symposium, which significantly increased the probability of a September interest rate cut. Q2: What does a “dovish turn” by the U.S. Federal Reserve mean for cryptocurrencies? A2: A dovish turn indicates the Fed is leaning towards policies that favor economic growth, often through lower interest rates. This generally makes riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive as traditional investments offer lower returns. Q3: How did Bitcoin and Ethereum react to the Fed’s comments? A3: Bitcoin rose by 5%, and Ethereum surged by 11%, reaching new all-time highs, as reported by Cointelegraph. Q4: What is the “Greed” indicator in the crypto market? A4: The “Greed” indicator is part of the Fear & Greed Index, a tool that measures overall market sentiment. A shift to “Greed” suggests investors are feeling confident and eager to buy, anticipating further price increases. Q5: What should investors consider during a “Greed” phase in the crypto market? A5: While a greed phase offers opportunities for gains, investors should exercise caution. Increased volatility and the risk of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) are common. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research, diversify portfolios, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Did you find this analysis helpful?

50532156,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=790498,1755935832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50532156.jpeg,Germany pledges reforms as economy shrinks 0.3%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/germany-defends-economic-policy/,"Germany’s Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil told Funke Media Group this week that the coalition government will push through new reforms by the end of 2025. The pledge comes as Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s administration faces rising pressure to fix an economy that’s clearly out of breath. Klingbeil said the coalition still has what it takes to deliver actual change, promising “important decisions” in the coming months on key areas like health care and pensions. Those promises land just as fresh economic figures hit the public. Germany’s economy shrank by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, way worse than the early estimate of -0.1%, and far from what the government had hoped for. The Federal Statistical Office said the drop was mostly caused by weak manufacturing, which had boomed earlier in the year as companies rushed orders to the United States to avoid President Donald Trump’s tariffs. That artificial growth is gone now, and the bottom’s showing. GDP weakens as tariffs hit exports Germany’s fragile growth got knocked further by multiple hits: lower household spending, falling investment, and a declining construction sector. New data from the Statistical Office revised household consumption down to just 0.1%, citing poor performance in food, hotels, and accommodation. Meanwhile, government spending rose slightly by 0.8%, but it wasn’t nearly enough to stop the bleeding. Net exports also dropped, dragged down by weaker global demand and tariff pressure from across the Atlantic. Klingbeil said Germany needs to clean out its bureaucracy to get things moving again. “We must free life in this country from bureaucracy so that it is fun again to start a business, run an association or build a house,” he told Funke. But that message competes with the cold reality that Bundesbank already warned the country might not see any growth in the third quarter either. If that happens, it’ll be two quarters in a row of negative or zero growth, a textbook recession. A brief spark at the start of 2025 had raised hopes, mostly because German firms were front-loading trade with the U.S. to dodge Trump’s new import taxes. That rush pushed up GDP early in the year but left a vacuum behind it. Now, there’s no more buffer. The PMI data released Thursday by S&P Global gave a small sign of life, showing business activity grew in August for the third straight month, and at the fastest pace since March. But even S&P warned the improvement was modest. It’s not enough to offset what’s happening in the real economy. Tariffs, debt limits, and global drag intensify pressure Klingbeil and Merz’s government is trying to act. Earlier this year, it pushed through a constitutional change to the debt brake rule, allowing defense spending above 1% of GDP to escape borrowing restrictions. It also approved a €500 billion extra-budgetary fund to invest in infrastructure. Still, those moves haven’t stopped the decline. The impact of Trump’s 15% tariffs on most European products is already being felt. And the auto industry’s hanging in limbo, waiting to see if the U.S. will bring car tariffs back down from 27.5% to 15%. Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, said the tariffs and ongoing economic changes are already showing up in corporate reports. “Recent corporate results were already a painful reminder that US tariffs, but also structural transitions, were in full swing in the second quarter, weighing on company results,” Brzeski said. He added, “This is a trend that won’t change too much in the third quarter, with US tariffs of 15% on most European goods and uncertainty over whether (and when) the 27.5% tariffs on automotives will be brought back to 15%.” Germany sends about 10% of its exports to the United States. That’s a huge piece of the puzzle, and if that window keeps tightening, companies will feel it quarter after quarter. This all traces back to 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine helped derail global supply chains and shook energy markets across Europe. That shock hit Germany hard, and the effects are still here. Add that to an aging population, weak global growth, and too much red tape, and the picture gets darker. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Choosing the right token could make the wait worthwhile. One lesser-known altcoin stands out as a smart pick for times like these. Discover which coin is gaining attention for its potential to shine when the market turns around. Ethena (ENA) Source: TradingView ENA slipped nearly 10% this week, trading between $0.64 and $0.82. Even so, the token still sits just over its 10-day and 100-day averages, hinting at a steady base. A strength reading near 56 is neutral, while a fast oscillator at 81 leans hot, suggesting short-term selling fueled the dip. Zoom out and the mood brightens. ENA is up 27% in the past month and 44% over six months. Buyers have stepped in on every pullback, keeping the price well above the firm $0.57 floor. Momentum has cooled since last week, yet the slight positive trend gauge shows bulls still hold an edge. If demand revives, the first barrier rests at $0.92. A jump from the mid-range price of $0.73 to that mark would mean about 26% upside. Clearing it opens a path to $1.10, roughly 51% higher. Failure to defend $0.57 would expose $0.39, a slide of 47% from current levels. Given the longer-term climb and neutral momentum, odds favor a grind higher toward $0.92, but a quick drop to test $0.57 remains a real risk if sellers press again. Bonk (BONK) Source: TradingView Bonk lost 10.01% this week and 42.13% over the past month, yet it still clings to a 32.88% gain in six months. The price now drifts near $0.000022 after swinging between $0.00002151 and $0.00002736. The coin is glued to both its 10-day and 100-day averages, pointing to a stalemate. RSI at 45 and a Stochastic reading of 41 show mild selling, not panic. A small negative MACD level backs the idea of flat-to-soft momentum rather than a deep slide. A clear close above $0.00002736 could send BONK toward the first resistance at $0.00003089, about 30% higher. Breaking that opens room for $0.00003674, roughly 50% above current trade. On the flip side, slipping under $0.00002150 would expose the $0.00001920 support, near 20% lower, with $0.00001336 another 40% beneath. Traders are waiting for a breakout to decide whether the next leg is up or down. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto.

With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.005 Next Stage : $0.01 Final Presale Price : $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Raydium (RAY) Source: TradingView RAY slipped 14.29% this week, 5.32% over the month, and 24.54% in 6 months. The token now hovers between $2.99 and $4.12, just below both the 10-day SMA at $3.23 and the 100-day SMA at $3.28. Momentum signals look neutral: RSI sits at 49.56, Stochastic at 56.69, while MACD is slightly red at -0.0117. This mix hints at a pause rather than panic. Bulls must clear $4.68 to regain control. A close above that ceiling could open a sprint to $5.80, adding roughly 40-60% from today’s mid-range. Volume near the upper band would likely pull the 10-day SMA back above the 100-day line and flip MACD green, giving buyers a clear path. Failure to shake off the drag keeps eyes on $2.43 support. A dip under that floor risks a slide to $1.31, nearly another 45-55% down. The flat averages and mid-range RSI suggest more range trading first, but the longer downtrend still shadows the chart. Traders will watch $4.68 and $2.43 as the breakpoints that decide the next big move. Sei (SEI) Source: TradingView Sei trades between $0.31 and $0.37 after a sharp pullback. The coin is down 10.39% in 1 week and 17.03% in 1 month, yet it keeps a 4.49% gain over 6 months. Short-term sellers rule, long-term holders still see green. Price floats just above the 100-day average of $0.31. A momentum score of 41.69 hints at weak demand, but a fast oscillator reading of 15.99 shows the market is oversold. With trend power near zero, any fresh bid could lift the pair to the next ceiling at $0.40. Beating $0.40 could spark a sprint to $0.46, adding about 15% then 35% from today’s midpoint. Slip below $0.31 and eyes move to $0.27, roughly 13% lower, and then $0.20, almost 37% down. Given the oversold state and the modest 6-month rise, the chart leans toward a 10%-20% bounce, yet the key lies in defending $0.31.

50532038,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=809198,1755936048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50532038.jpeg,Ethereum Chain Dominates With $516M Net Inflows In 7 Days,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-chain-dominates-with-516m-net-inflows-in-7-days/,"Ethereum (ETH) just delivered one of its strongest moves in years, breaking its all-time high of around $4,860 after a bullish surge on Friday. The cryptocurrency soared by more than 13% in a single day, marking a pivotal moment for the market and confirming the strength of Ethereum’s ongoing rally. Related Reading: TRON Spot Market Signals Relief – Seller Dominance Weakens After Cycle High Momentum is firmly on the side of the bulls, as Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin. While BTC consolidates around the same price range it held a month ago, ETH has taken the lead, strengthening the case for an extended altcoin rally. The market is entering a phase where altcoins are beginning to show strength across the board, with Ethereum spearheading this trend. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ted Pillows shared fresh insights pointing to Ethereum’s continued dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi). He emphasized that Ethereum remains the number 1 chain in DeFi, reinforcing its position as the backbone of the sector. With institutional adoption rising, exchange supply shrinking, and derivatives activity heating up, many see Ethereum as primed for a sustained rally. Ethereum Netflows Surge Amid Fed Speculation Ethereum’s dominance in the crypto market has once again been reinforced by its recent on-chain activity. Over the last seven days, Ethereum recorded a netflow of +$516.4 million, significantly outpacing all other networks. To put this into perspective, the second-largest, Polygon, registered just $102.9 million over the same period. This vast difference highlights Ethereum’s position as the clear leader in attracting and holding liquidity. The timing of this surge is tied closely to macroeconomic developments. Markets began to heat up after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole, where he noted that “with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” This statement has fueled widespread speculation that the Fed could cut interest rates in September, sparking renewed optimism across both traditional and crypto markets. Ethereum’s strong netflows reflect both institutional and retail conviction. Investors are positioning for further upside in anticipation of improved liquidity conditions. The inflow surge signals not only buying pressure but also a growing shift toward Ethereum as the primary vehicle for DeFi, staking, and treasury strategies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Score Index Signals Fading Momentum: Room For Downside? Weekly Price Analysis: Reaching New ATH Ethereum (ETH) has officially broken into uncharted territory, setting fresh all-time highs on the weekly chart as shown. The breakout above the 2021 peak near $4,860 confirms a major bullish structure after months of consolidation and a sharp rally in recent weeks. ETH closed this candle strongly, near $4,876, representing an almost 9% surge within the week. The structure highlights sustained bullish momentum. With ETH trading well above its 50-week ($2,823), 100-week ($2,794), and 200-week ($2,446) moving averages. This alignment — with shorter-term moving averages trending above the longer-term ones — reinforces the bullish trend. Momentum indicators also suggest that buyers remain in control, supported by institutional flows and derivatives positioning.

In such phases, rallies often extend rapidly, especially when combined with rising open interest and strong on-chain accumulation trends. On the downside, immediate support rests around the $4,300–$4,200 zone, which coincides with the breakout region. Losing this area could invite deeper corrections, but bulls are currently defending it strongly.

Amid the chaos of its explosive debut and the subsequent controversy, Tate appears to have made a calculated move. A Rare Win? Lookonchain’s latest findings reveal that controversial social media personality Andrew Tate opened a 3x short position on Kanye West’s new meme coin, YZY, at $0.8524 and sat on a $16,000 profit at the time of the post. He should still be in the money, even though YZY rebounded slightly to $0.70 alongside the rest of the market. However, despite this winning move, his overall track record in perpetual trading remains questionable. Data shows that Tate has executed 80 trades on Hyperliquid, but only 29 have been profitable, which reflects a win rate of just 36.25%. In fact, his trading activities have resulted in staggering losses amounting to $699,000, in what appears to be a pattern of poor performance in the perps market. Lookonchain tweeted, “he doesn’t seem to be good at perps trading.” Tate’s History With Shady Meme Coin Projects Bubblemaps and Coffeezilla had previously called out Tate for his involvement with several dubious meme coins. Despite once claiming, “I will never endorse any crypto. Why would I damage my fans?” Tate reversed course on June 7, 2024, by diving headfirst into the Solana meme coin frenzy. Within just 24 hours, he had promoted over 10 different tokens, most of which eventually collapsed. One of the first was GER (Germany Token), which Tate agreed to buy if the creator called him “fuhrer.” A single cluster controlled 30% of the supply, and the token’s value plunged by 99% in just two months. He then promoted “Fuck Madonna,” even revealing his own wallet address. That token spiked to $2 million in volume almost instantly before crashing to zero in a single day. Next came FTRISTAN (Fuck Tristan), which he hyped on Twitter, driving $15 million in trading volume before the inevitable collapse to zero. Tate also heavily promoted TOPG and received 58% of the supply. His repeated tweets brought massive attention, which pushed the coin to over $300 million in trading volume. But despite the hype, it ended with the same result: zero. Other meme coins connected to him – ROOST, RNT, and DADDY – suffered similar fates.

According to the country’s anti-corruption agency, the deported criminals consisted of 102 foreign nationals, including 60 Chinese and 39 Filipinos. According to the announcement by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the deported foreign nationals were part of the criminals convicted by a federal high court in June. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the criminals were apprehended after the anti-graft agency dismantled their operational base in December 2024, capping off a successful investigation that had gone on for months. The agency mentioned that the criminals carried out their operations out of a building located at Oyin Jolayemi Street, Lagos. The EFCC also noted at the time that over 700 suspects tied to the illicit operations were apprehended, noting that they would undergo processing, serve their terms, and be deported to their countries of origin. Nigeria deports foreign nationals convicted in investment scams According to the Nigerian agency, the move to deport the criminals comes as efforts are being stepped up across the country to crack down on online scam operations, which have seen victims lose funds to fake cryptocurrency investments. According to reports, there has been an increase in crypto-related scams in Nigeria, with the scammers preying on the high illiteracy rate to carry out their activities. A typical example is the Crypto Bridge Exchange ( CBEX ) investment scheme, which promised users rewards for their investments. However, all hell broke loose earlier this year after it was discovered that the investment scheme was a scam, leaving users scrambling to save what was left of their funds to no avail. The revelation led to several damages, including financial and psychological, with most victims resorting to suicide after losing their entire savings to the scheme. Speaking to several news agencies, Dele Oyewale, the spokesman of the EFCC, mentioned that they had carried out a first deportation that had gone under the radar prior. He added that the deportation happened on August 15, involving a group of 39 Filipinos, 10 Chinese, and two people from Kazakhstan. Oyewale noted that this isn’t the last of the deportations, as more are expected to happen in the coming days.

The men, clearly Asian, wore surgical masks to protect their identities. EFCC steps up efforts to curb criminal activities Nigeria, which is currently the most populous country in Africa, has witnessed a rapid rise in internet fraud. The menace, known by its local slang as “Yahoo,” was named after yahoo.com, the early mail messaging platform. According to the EFCC, they have stepped up their efforts to ensure these activities are being curbed, busting several hideouts where the young populations are being taught these online scamming skills. According to the EFCC, foreign gangs often recruit young Nigerian accomplices, luring them with promises of big returns in exchange for helping them find their victims online via several phishing methods. The attackers usually try to deceive their victims into moving or transferring funds into accounts controlled by their bosses via several means, which include befriending them, sending them phishing links, or calling to act as their banks. Most of these scams target residents in America, Canada, Mexico, and other European countries, since most of these people are seen as better off than the average African. This doesn’t mean their activities are limited abroad, as they also try their hands on local victims that fall prey to their tactics. According to experts, cybercriminals are now using sophisticated technologies to carry out their acts, making it harder to apprehend them. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The world’s largest asset manager sold a total of $351.3 million worth of Ethereum ( ETH ), equivalent to about 84,000 ETH, across three sessions between August 18 and August 20, according to data from Coinglass . Ethereum ETF net inflow. Source: Coinglass The heaviest selling came on August 20, when BlackRock’s fund posted $257.8 million in redemptions, marking the single-largest daily outflow of the week. Earlier, on August 18, the ETF shed $87.2 million, followed by a smaller sell-off of $6.3 million on August 19. Despite the outsized outflows, momentum shifted later in the week. On August 21, BlackRock attracted $233.6 million in Ethereum inflows, followed by an additional $109.4 million on August 22. Across all issuers, Ethereum spot ETFs recorded net weekly outflows of $233.7 million. BlackRock’s activity dominated, with its $351 million in sales accounting for more than 85% of total redemptions during the sell-off days. Ethereum rallies to new highs Indeed, the renewed institutional interest contributed to Ethereum reaching new highs. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap notched another record, buoyed by optimism around ETF demand. The rally also gained support after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled the possibility of an interest rate cut, sparking a broad crypto market surge. Interestingly, over the past two months, Ethereum’s price has more than doubled, outpacing Bitcoin ( BTC ) as investors pour into exchange-traded funds. By press time, Ethereum was trading at $4,713, up 8.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 6% higher on the week. ETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, Ethereum remains well above both its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $3,674 and 200-day SMA of $2,679. The alignment of short- and long-term averages confirms sustained bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 66.66, edging closer to the overbought threshold of 70. This suggests that while buying pressure is dominant, the asset is nearing levels where a short-term pullback could emerge.

Hunting for Next Big Opportunity While Cardano & XRP Slips Lower,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/ethereum-whales-next-moves-hunting-for-next-big-opportunity-while-cardano-xrp-slips-lower,"Large holders of Ethereum are shifting attention as other leading coins face declines. With Cardano and XRP prices moving downward, the search for the next major gain is underway. Fresh strategies and reactions are taking shape among the biggest players. Which coins or projects will draw their focus next? New moves are coming soon. Cardano (ADA) Source: TradingView Cardano trades between $0.81 and $1.07 after a tough week. The token dropped 8.95% in 7 days and 6.64% in a month, trimming but not wiping out the 9.04% rise logged over 6 months. The cooling pace signals that traders wait for a clear break before placing fresh bets. The 10 day moving average sits at $0.85 while the 100 day line is $0.88, so short term bias tilts lower. Momentum tools echo this; RSI at 38.87 and stochastic at 28.72 show weak demand, and the MACD holds in negative ground. If sellers push, the nearest support at 0.66 may get tested, a slide of roughly 30% from the midpoint of today range. Bulls still have a path. A close above $1.17 would flip mood and put $1.42 in sight. That run would add about 25% then 50% from the $0.94 midpoint. The six month climb hints the network can draw money when the market warms. Watch volume near 1.17; a clean breakout could restart the rally and lift the moving averages. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP trades between $2.95 and $3.29 after a rough stretch. The coin slipped 7.54% in the past week and 19.85% in the past month, wiping out most short-term gains. Even so, the six-month score still shows a 10.57% rise. Price now sits a touch above both its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, hinting that selling may be cooling. If buyers regroup, the first target is the $3.49 ceiling. From the midpoint of the current range, that is about a 12% climb. A clean break could push toward the next barricade at $3.84, roughly 24% higher. On the other side, a slip under the $2.80 floor would invite pressure down to $2.46, close to an 18% drop. Volume remains muted, so any surge could move the chart quickly. The data paints a mixed picture. Short-term losses point to caution, but longer-term growth and steady support suggest upside potential. As long as the coin holds above $2.80, the path of least resistance leans upward. A bounce to $3.49 is within reach; failure to clear that level would likely keep XRP orbiting the $3 mark until a fresh catalyst appears. Conclusion ADA and XRP look sound for the long term. Yet Ethereum whale capital now eyes XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, targeting 20,000% upside in the 2025 bull run.

The forecast , released Friday, says the primary deficit will drop by $3.3 trillion between now and 2035 from duties already imposed, with another $700 billion saved on interest payments tied to a smaller national debt. The total, $4 trillion in deficit reduction, comes as Trump’s fiscal agenda raises concerns about spending. The CBO, led by Phillip Swagel, noted that the projected impact from tariffs is about one-third larger than what they estimated earlier in May, when fewer measures had been rolled out. Since then, Trump has stepped up enforcement and announced new trade actions, pushing the numbers higher. New tariff projections help offset spending bill impact Trump’s controversial spending package, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to add $4.1 trillion to U.S. debt by 2035. But the updated tariff estimates now nearly cancel out that rise. That near balance has become a central issue for investors, especially as the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio sits at around 100%, making U.S. Treasuries less attractive to some money managers. The CBO’s latest analysis doesn’t calculate how these tariffs might affect the economy’s overall size. Most economists think the duties will slow growth, but the report doesn’t try to guess by how much. Swagel warned the figures are built on shaky ground. “The estimates are subject to significant uncertainty,” he said, pointing to unknowns like how long the tariffs will last, whether exceptions will be granted, and how much precedent actually exists. Even with the caveats, the numbers are landing well at the White House. Trump and his administration have long argued that tariff revenue would cover increased federal spending. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week he now expects more money to come in from import taxes than he’d planned for earlier. “We’re going to bring down the deficit to GDP,” Scott told CNBC. “We’ll start paying down the debt, and then at that point that can be used as an offset to the American people.” Over at S&P Global, the credit ratings agency highlighted these incoming funds too. This week, the firm reaffirmed the U.S. government’s debt rating, citing “broad revenue buoyancy, including robust tariff income” as the reason. Their analysts said this extra money would help cushion any fiscal damage from the tax cuts and spending baked into Trump’s agenda. The CBO also reminded people that: “Typically, once tariff rates go into effect, they are not applied to goods already in transit to the United States, which can take as long as two months.” White House opens new furniture tariff probe under national security rule On Friday, Trump revealed a new step in his trade crackdown, saying his administration would launch a fresh tariff investigation focused on furniture imports. He posted on Truth Social that furniture coming into the U.S. would be taxed at a “rate yet to be determined.” He said the process will be completed within 50 days, although other similar investigations have often taken longer. A White House official confirmed the probe will be handled under Section 232, which allows the federal government to apply tariffs in the name of national security. This move also creates a legal backup for other duties Trump imposed earlier this year. In April, he hit a long list of U.S. trading partners with “reciprocal” tariffs, and in February, import taxes were placed on China, Canada, and Mexico. But those actions are currently facing legal challenges. If a federal appeals court throws out those earlier duties, this new Section 232 investigation could give the White House a second path to keep them in place. It’s a legal insurance policy, in case Trump’s first round of tariffs doesn’t survive court scrutiny.

Many let fear push them out too soon or steer them toward the wrong coins. Still, there is one digital asset that stands strong during such dull periods. Discover which choice can set up a strong portfolio when the market seems uncertain and slow. Ethena (ENA) Source: TradingView ENA slipped nearly 10% this week, trading between $0.64 and $0.82. Even so, the token still sits just over its 10-day and 100-day averages, hinting at a steady base. A strength reading near 56 is neutral, while a fast oscillator at 81 leans hot, suggesting short-term selling fueled the dip. Zoom out and the mood brightens. ENA is up 27% in the past month and 44% over six months. Buyers have stepped in on every pullback, keeping the price well above the firm $0.57 floor. Momentum has cooled since last week, yet the slight positive trend gauge shows bulls still hold an edge. If demand revives, the first barrier rests at $0.92. A jump from the mid-range price of $0.73 to that mark would mean about 26% upside. Clearing it opens a path to $1.10, roughly 51% higher. Failure to defend $0.57 would expose $0.39, a slide of 47% from current levels. Given the longer-term climb and neutral momentum, odds favor a grind higher toward $0.92, but a quick drop to test $0.57 remains a real risk if sellers press again. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005. At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bonk (BONK) Source: TradingView Bonk lost 10.01% this week and 42.13% over the past month, yet it still clings to a 32.88% gain in six months. The price now drifts near $0.000022 after swinging between $0.00002151 and $0.00002736. The coin is glued to both its 10-day and 100-day averages, pointing to a stalemate. RSI at 45 and a Stochastic reading of 41 show mild selling, not panic. A small negative MACD level backs the idea of flat-to-soft momentum rather than a deep slide. A clear close above $0.00002736 could send BONK toward the first resistance at $0.00003089, about 30% higher. Breaking that opens room for $0.00003674, roughly 50% above current trade. On the flip side, slipping under $0.00002150 would expose the $0.00001920 support, near 20% lower, with $0.00001336 another 40% beneath. Traders are waiting for a breakout to decide whether the next leg is up or down. Raydium (RAY) Source: TradingView Defi crypto RAY slipped 14.29% this week, 5.32% over the month, and 24.54% in 6 months. The token now hovers between $2.99 and $4.12, just below both the 10-day SMA at $3.23 and the 100-day SMA at $3.28. Momentum signals look neutral: RSI sits at 49.56, Stochastic at 56.69, while MACD is slightly red at -0.0117. This mix hints at a pause rather than panic. Bulls must clear $4.68 to regain control. A close above that ceiling could open a sprint to $5.80, adding roughly 40-60% from today's mid-range. Volume near the upper band would likely pull the 10-day SMA back above the 100-day line and flip MACD green, giving buyers a clear path. Failure to shake off the drag keeps eyes on $2.43 support. A dip under that floor risks a slide to $1.31, nearly another 45-55% down. The flat averages and mid-range RSI suggest more range trading first, but the longer downtrend still shadows the chart. Traders will watch $4.68 and $2.43 as the breakpoints that decide the next big move. Sei (SEI) Source: TradingView Sei trades between $0.31 and $0.37 after a sharp pullback. The coin is down 10.39% in 1 week and 17.03% in 1 month, yet it keeps a 4.49% gain over 6 months. Short-term sellers rule, long-term holders still see green. Price floats just above the 100-day average of $0.31. A momentum score of 41.69 hints at weak demand, but a fast oscillator reading of 15.99 shows the market is oversold. With trend power near zero, any fresh bid could lift the pair to the next ceiling at $0.40. Beating $0.40 could spark a sprint to $0.46, adding about 15% then 35% from today’s midpoint. Slip below $0.31 and eyes move to $0.27, roughly 13% lower, and then $0.20, almost 37% down. Given the oversold state and the modest 6-month rise, the chart leans toward a 10%-20% bounce, yet the key lies in defending $0.31. Conclusion Bull run 2025 is rolling; ENA, BONK, RAY, SEI look solid, yet the first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) targets 20,000% growth through community-driven, meme-sports fusion and clear roadmap.

Attention now shifts to which coins might attract their interest next. These moves could signal big changes in the market. Speculation grows as observers watch for hints about the next popular choice among major investors. Cardano (ADA) Source: TradingView ADA sits between $0.81 and $1.07 after a choppy week. The coin slid 7.55% in 7 days and 5.20% in a month but is still up 10.72% over 6 months. Buyers point to that long-term climb, while sellers highlight the fresh dip. The 10-day average at $0.86 hugs the 100-day at $0.88, showing a flat trend. RSI at 46.13 and Stochastic at 38.29 lean slightly oversold. MACD is a touch below zero, hinting that downward drive is weak and could flip fast. A break over $1.17 would mark a 15% pop and could push ADA toward $1.42, roughly 35% higher. Staying above $0.86 keeps that path open. Dropping under $0.81 risks a slide to $0.66, about 20% down, and in a hard sell-off $0.41, nearly 50% lower. For now the mixed signals suggest sideways action, yet the 6-month rise gives bulls a slight edge for an upward move in the next few weeks. XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP trades between $2.95 and $3.29 after a rough stretch. The token slid 6.96% in 1 week and 19.35% in 1 month, erasing most spring gains. Even so, it still shows an 11.27% rise over 6 months, proving buyers did not flee for good. Momentum hints at a pause. Price sits a shade above the 10-day average of $2.86 and almost level with the 100-day line at $2.94. RSI at 44.3 is neutral, while a 27.99 stochastic leans oversold. The MACD is a hair below zero, echoing the recent dip but not flashing panic. Traders now watch $3.49. A clean break could lift XRP by roughly 8% toward $3.84, the next ceiling, and that would leave the monthly chart looking steadier. Failure to clear $3.49 opens room for a drop to $2.80, about 5% lower, and a deeper slide to $2.46 would shave nearly 16% off today’s level. Until either line cracks, expect tight, choppy moves.

Low-Cap Meme Coins Like $MAXI: Where the Real 1000x Potential Lies When we think of meme coins, names like Dogecoin and Pepe instantly come to mind. But the fact of the matter is, while they once delivered 100x or even 1000x returns, those days are long gone. Their popularity has pushed market caps so high that it’s virtually impossible for them to deliver moonshot gains today. So what do you do. Lose out on those life-changing returns? Absolutely not. The key is to look at new, under-the-radar meme coins. Like $MAXI . Thanks to their unique designs and low market caps, these projects are not only positioned to ride the broader crypto wave, but also offer far superior upside compared to the mainstream names. Who Is Maxi Doge? If you’ve looked at Maxi’s face and noticed an uncanny resemblance to Dogecoin, you’re not alone – and you’re not wrong either. Maxi and Doge are, in fact, cousins. But here’s the twist: they couldn’t be more different. Growing up, Doge, because of how ‘cute’ and wholesome it looked, and of course because it became the greatest meme coin on the planet, soaked up all the spotlight at every family gathering. Maxi, on the other hand, was left in the shadows, ignored, and overlooked, even by his own mom. That’s when Maxi made a decision to become the anti-Doge. Unlike Doge, he hit the gym, bulked up his muscles, downed protein shakes and caffeine, and set off on a mission to dethrone Doge as the best meme coin on the planet. He studied candlesticks all day long, to the point that he took one of those fat green candles and turned it into a lightsaber to fight off Doge lovers and mediocre gains. Maxi is a fierce Shiba who lives by the philosophy: never skip leg day, never skip the pump. And that’s exactly the kind of raw degen energy meme coin investors crave. Because let’s face it: ‘cute’ might win attention, but it doesn’t win battles. Maxi Doge: More Than Just a Meme At first glance, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might look like just another glamorous meme coin, one that prides itself on having no utility, no underlying value, and simply chasing big pumps out of thin air. But in reality, the project’s developers have put forward a surprisingly strong roadmap. For instance, 40% of the total token supply has been reserved for marketing, covering PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and relentless social media blitzes, all designed to make Maxi one of the top trending cryptos in the space. The gym-bro humor and viral meme culture behind it give $MAXI the potential to break beyond crypto circles and reach everyday audiences, driving mainstream appeal and popularity. For holders, the benefits don’t stop at potential price action. Owning Maxi unlocks access to weekly trading competitions, leaderboard prizes, and a thriving community of traders eager to share strategies. The goal? To help everyone chase those outsized 1000x returns that are usually only reserved for institutional players with eight-figure capital. Maxi’s mission is simple: bring those moonshot gains to the average Joe. And speaking of massive returns, the project isn’t stopping at CEX and DEX listings. $MAXI is also eyeing futures listings, which could allow holders to take 1000x leverage bets, opening the door to life-changing profits for those willing to play the high-risk, high-reward game. Best Time to Buy $MAXI? NOW! As mentioned earlier, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is currently in presale – just a few weeks in, in fact – meaning you can grab it at some of its lowest-ever prices. Right now, 1 $MAXI is available at just $0.0002535, with the project having already pulled in over $1.45M from early investors.

The reaction came on the heels of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signalling the possibility of a rate cut in September. Sentiment indicators reacted accordingly. The crypto fear and greed index, which had slipped to a weekly low of 46—well within neutral territory—now looks poised to edge back into the greed zone as optimism returns to the broader market. Meanwhile, the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation bounced back above the $4 trillion mark, reflecting renewed investor confidence sparked by Powell’s remarks. In line with this, altcoins also saw a late-week boost, with several top-100 tokens extending their weekly gains on renewed bullish sentiment. Why is the Bitcoin price going up? Bitcoin’s late-week rally came after days of sluggish movement, marked by narrow trading ranges and muted investor interest. The week began with price action hovering sideways, weighed down by uncertainty over what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would signal at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. That anticipation, paired with a notable drop in institutional activity, kept market momentum at bay. The spot Bitcoin ETF market reflected this hesitation. Funds shed assets for five straight days leading into Friday, offloading $194 million on Thursday alone. Total outflows for the week topped $1 billion, underscoring how institutional players had been pulling back amid macroeconomic ambiguity. Ethereum wasn’t spared either—its spot ETFs lost over $700 million during the same stretch, a stark reversal from the inflows seen in previous weeks. However, as Powell took the stage in Jackson Hole and delivered his speech, the momentum shifted. Bitcoin surged to $116,000 after Powell’s speech hinted that the central bank may soon pivot to a more accommodative stance. While Powell was careful with his language, he noted that the current trajectory of inflation and labour market conditions “may warrant adjusting” the Fed’s policy, a statement widely interpreted as dovish by traders. Markets wasted no time responding. Risk assets, including crypto, jumped on the news while the US dollar retreated. Bitcoin gained over 3.5% on the day, bouncing off local lows of $111,658—its weakest level since July 10. The move not only wiped out the week’s losses but also injected fresh volatility into the market. Expectations for a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed’s September meeting have now gained traction. The Kobeissi Letter noted that Powell’s messaging was clear enough to set the stage for such a move. CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed a similar leaning in market pricing. Several prominent analysts noted key technical setups aligning with the news. The Wolf Of All Streets @scottmelker · Follow $BTC 4-HOURBitcoin is showing bullish divergence (again) with oversold RSI on the 4-hour… and 6-hour. Maybe the 12-hour. Maybe the daily.

The bounce also appeared to tap into resting liquidity below the range, according to TheKingfisher, while fellow analyst Daan Crypto Trades noted the recovery followed a “range low sweep” spurred by Powell’s dovish tone. Bitcoin Liquidation map. Source: TheKingfisher on X. What’s next for Bitcoin? One look at Bitcoin’s 24-hour liquidation heatmap shows the spark behind Friday’s surge: a cascade of short liquidations ignited just above $113,000, accelerating BTC’s climb toward $117,000. The steep vertical rally carved through dense layers of bid-side liquidity where bears were heavily positioned just above the recent range. As prices pierced those pockets, liquidations snowballed, forcing traders to cover shorts and contributing to the sudden price spike. Zooming out to the 1-week liquidation map, a broader picture of the battlefield emerges. Bitcoin’s recent bounce from $111,658 came after it absorbed significant bid-side liquidity near the $111K–$112K zone, a region housing concentrated leveraged longs that had built up during the drop. Bitcoin 1-week liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. The recovery flipped that zone into a short-term support base, as the price moved away from the liquidation cluster. Just above, around $117,000 to $119,000, a fresh wall of liquidation leverage looms. This area is densely packed with short interest and could act as both a magnet and a hurdle. If bullish momentum persists, Bitcoin may attempt to sweep through that region next, likely triggering another round of forced buying. However, failure to break above it cleanly could invite rejection and a retest of the $114,000 level, now a key intraday support that coincides with the midpoint of the liquidation sweep. Below the current price, the $111K zone continues to stand out as a structural support. Not only did it mark the week’s lowest low, but it also represents an area where strong bid liquidity absorbed selling pressure. Should the market retrace, that level may serve as a critical line in the sand for bulls. On X, most analysts were already expecting a major run fuelled by Powell’s recent remarks, with some volatility expected over the weekend. For market commentator Mario Nawfal, $130,000 was a possible target for the bulls next week. Others argued that the real upside could come later, with markets likely to rally further once the Federal Reserve formally enacts the anticipated rate cut in December. ₿IGRYAN 🟠 @BigRyanPark · Follow TODAY: #Bitcoin Pumps +2% in 15 Minutes As Fed Chair Jerome Powell Hints at a Rate Cut in SeptemberIf this is how markets respond at the **hint of a rate cut, imagine what happens when an actual rate cut occurs. $btc HIGHER. 🚀🪐 Watch on Twitter View replies 7:53 pm · 22 Aug 2025 23 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies Meanwhile, veteran trader Michael van de Poppe wrote “Uptrend is back” as Bitcoin was crossing the $116,000 mark.

Source: Merlin The Trader. If this retest holds, based on the structure a potential upside move toward the $130,000 region in the coming weeks is a possibility. At press time, Bitcoin was hovering over $116,500 with losses of less than 1% on the weekly timeframe. Altcoin market recap The total market capitalization of all altcoins initially rose 2.4% over the past week before ending the period 2.5% lower, standing at $1.63 trillion as of Friday, Aug. 22. As of press time, the altcoin market was showing renewed momentum following Powell’s speech. Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market cap, settled at $4,650 over the week with gains of 2.2% while other large-cap coins like BNB (BNB), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) posted gains between 1-5%. OKB led the highest gains among the top 99 altcoins, up nearly 125% while Morpho (MORPHO) and Chainlink (LINK) followed with gains of 40% and 21% over the week. Source: CoinMarketCap OKB : The major catalyst fueling OKB’s rally this week was its token burn event, which removed 65 million OKB tokens and slashed its circulating supply from about 300 million to a hard cap of 21 million. Another factor that played a part in OKB’s rally this week was the launch of its zkEVM-based X Layer blockchain, which delivers significantly higher throughput, near-zero fees, and full integration with OKX’s wallet, exchange, and payment systems. Additionally, OKX also phased out its older Cosmos-based OKTChain, migrating 1.3 million OKT tokens into OKB. Morpho : Morpho rallied this week primarily due to the successful launch of its lending protocol on Ethereum, which drove renewed investor interest in the token. The project’s debut was further boosted by a surge in liquidity inflows, as users moved capital into the protocol to take advantage of its competitive yields and efficient design. Chainlink : Chainlink rallied this week primarily due to sustained whale accumulation, with large investors ramping up their LINK holdings. The token also benefited from rising institutional adoption, with more projects integrating Chainlink’s oracle solutions to enhance their smart contract reliability. Adding to that, Chainlink Reserve, which uses revenue from ecosystem integrations to purchase LINK tokens, has also supported its gains via multiple buybacks this week.

The premier cryptocurrency now trades above $116,000, nullifying earlier losses seen in the past week. Interestingly, prominent market analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino has outlined the implications of this price rebound regarding the BTC price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Below $120K as Buyers Retreat, Is the Rally Already Over? Bitcoin’s Latest Bounce Revives Bullish Momentum – Price Targets To Watch In an X post on August 22, Severino explains that Bitcoin showed resilience in its price recovery on Friday by bouncing off the lower boundary of a long-standing ascending channel, tagged as the “Wall of Worry.” Notably, this lower boundary has acted as a key support zone for the leading cryptocurrency, stretching as far back as November 2023. Following each bounce off this support, Bitcoin has popularly reached the upper boundary, raising many expectations of a price surge at this moment. According to the channel analysis, Severino shows that the immediate technical target lies at the median line around $144,000, representing a roughly 24% advance from current levels. Interestingly, should bullish momentum persist, the next major resistance zone would align near the upper boundary of the channel at $183,000. However, a decisive break below the ascending channel would invalidate the bullish structure, potentially triggering a broader retracement toward the $95,000–$100,000 region. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Bottom Out? This Could Be The Signal To Watch Bitcoin Market Outlook At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $115,641, reflecting a 3.21% gain in the last 24 hours. This positive performance is accompanied by a 38.78% gain in daily trading volume, currently valued at $80.33 billion. However, losses of 1.76% and 1.94% on the weekly and monthly charts indicate that new market entrants are yet to break even. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Jordan Pivato is predicting the current market cycle to peak on October 21, 2025. This projection is based on historical data showing that Bitcoin cycles tend to extend slightly longer with each iteration. While the previous cycle lasted 548 days, Pivato estimates the ongoing one will span 550 days, placing the top in late October. He further points to Bitcoin’s strong seasonal performance in October as additional support for his call. Historically, October has been Bitcoin’s most bullish month, logging gains in six of the past twelve years and recording just two losing Octobers in that period. On average, Bitcoin has delivered a 46.72% monthly gain in October, with a median increase of 10.82%, making it the most favorable month in the calendar year for BTC performance.

A soaring SHIB burn rate is making headlines. Millions of tokens are being permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary tactic aims to create scarcity and support price appreciation. Yet many traders are looking beyond this mechanism for real yield. They are turning their attention to Layer Brett . Its 3,000% staking rewards offer a more direct path to growth. While SHIB relies on reducing supply, LBRETT focuses on increasing demand through utility. This fundamental difference is driving a noticeable shift in investor behavior. The limits of token burning Understanding the burn mechanism The SHIB burn strategy is simple in theory. By reducing the total supply, each remaining token should become more valuable. The community rallies around these burn events. They see it as a collective effort to increase scarcity. Why burning isn’t enough But burning alone has its limitations. It does not create any new utility for the token. It does not generate income for holders. The price effect is often slow and uncertain. For traders seeking immediate returns, waiting for burns to work is not a viable strategy. This is where Shiba Inu struggles to meet modern investor expectations. How Layer Brett delivers immediate value Layer Brett takes a completely different approach. Instead of hoping scarcity drives value, it builds value directly into the token. Its massive staking rewards provide instant utility and income generation. This creates a powerful incentive for both buying and holding. The project’s core advantages are clear: Immediate high yield: Earn over 3,000% APY from day one through simple staking. Real utility: Functioning Ethereum Layer 2 technology enables fast, low-cost transactions. Community growth: Active development and engagement beyond tokenomics. Presale accessibility: Fixed pricing structure allows for planned entry without volatility. This combination of features addresses the gaps that token burning cannot fill. The trader’s perspective: yield versus hope From an investment standpoint, the choice is becoming clear. Shiba Inu offers hope that burning will eventually increase value. Layer Brett offers certainty of rewards through its staking mechanism. One is speculative while the other is actionable. Traders are increasingly choosing actionable opportunities. The 3,000% APY provides a concrete return regardless of market conditions. This reliability is particularly attractive during periods of market uncertainty. It represents a modern approach to crypto investing that prioritizes utility over hype. Making the strategic shift The move from SHIB to $LBRETT doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Many investors maintain a position in Shiba Inu while diversifying into newer opportunities. This balanced approach captures potential upside from both established communities and innovative newcomers. Participating in Layer Brett is straightforward. Visit the official website using a connected wallet. Purchase $LBRETT tokens at the current presale price ($0.0047 as of writing). Then immediately stake them to begin earning rewards. The entire process takes minutes but positions investors for both short-term yield and long-term growth. Final thoughts: The new standard for token value Shiba Inu pioneered community-driven tokenomics. Its burn efforts show dedicated supporter engagement. However, the market is evolving toward projects that offer both community energy and tangible utility. Layer Brett represents this evolution. As more traders discover the advantages of utility-based tokens, demand will increase. Visit layerbrett.com today to explore this opportunity. Don’t just watch burns happen.

Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention with projections of a 30x ROI, while other leading altcoins continue to shape market narratives. Here are the 7 best cryptos to buy now. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned for 30x ROI in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about altcoins this year. Built on a zero-tax, security-first infrastructure, it combines meme coin appeal with real DeFi utility. Analysts point to its fair tokenomics and decentralized design as major strengths, making it a standout in a crowded field. With forecasts suggesting a 30x ROI in 2025, many traders see MAGACOIN FINANCE as an early-entry opportunity before upcoming exchange listings. Bitcoin Cooling Before Next Big Move Bitcoin remains at the center of market discussions, currently trading around $115,300 after peaking at $124,450 last week. According to technical analyst CasiTrades, Bitcoin’s recent pullback could pave the way for a bounce toward $119,900–$121,900 before its next decisive move. While some anticipate further downside, others are eyeing the bigger picture, with comparisons being drawn to gold’s historic breakout in the early 2000s. If that pattern repeats, Bitcoin could climb toward $600,000 by 2026. For now, Bitcoin’s consolidation keeps traders alert to the next breakout signal. Ethereum Leads Stablecoin Activity Ethereum continues to dominate the stablecoin market, with an average of $521,000 transferred per holder over 30 days. Hosting 51% of the global stablecoin supply, Ethereum plays a vital role in both institutional and retail transactions. As stablecoin adoption grows, Ethereum benefits through higher fee revenues and broader usage, strengthening its position as the backbone of on-chain finance. Its dominance makes it one of the best cryptos to buy now for those focused on utility-driven networks. Stellar Gears Up for Upgrade Stellar (XLM) is trading around $0.403, with attention shifting to its Protocol 23 upgrade aimed at boosting scalability. Alongside strategic moves like SDF’s investment in UK-based Archax, Stellar is carving a path in real-world asset tokenization. Historically, upgrades have triggered rallies in XLM, and traders are watching closely to see if this trend continues. NEAR Protocol Attracts New Users NEAR Protocol is trading at $2.52 and has outperformed many peers in user growth. Weekly active accounts surged 18.4% to 16 million, surpassing Solana for the first time. With institutional inflows, new AI initiatives, and a major upgrade scheduled, NEAR is gaining traction as one of the best cryptos to buy now. A proposal to cut inflation further adds to its appeal for long-term holders. Solana Maintains Speed Leadership Solana remains a leader in performance, recently recording 107,664 transactions per second. Trading just below $205, Solana has the potential to move toward $250 despite regulatory delays around Solana-based ETFs. Its unmatched speed and scalability continue to attract developers and institutions, making it a strong contender for those seeking high-performance blockchain exposure. Chainlink Benefits from Integration Growth Chainlink (LINK) has climbed above $24, gaining over 30% in the past month. Its growth is fueled by rising institutional adoption and increased wallet activity. As the key provider of off-chain data to blockchains, Chainlink’s utility ensures its relevance. Analysts suggest LINK could advance toward $50–$55 by the end of 2025, reinforcing its position as one of the best cryptos to buy now. What Should Traders Do? With MAGACOIN FINANCE poised for a possible 30x ROI in 2025 and leading tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana shaping the market, traders have a diverse set of opportunities. Those seeking early exposure may consider visiting the official MAGACOIN FINANCE channels to act before broader listings arrive.

It predicted that more gains are coming. The chart identifies an initial accumulation range, a later re-accumulation band, and a separate region labeled as a blow-off top. It displays a sharp upward impulse between the highlighted areas, followed by an extended interval of range-bound trading inside the higher band. The digital asset’s recent price action was near the upper boundary of the re-accumulation area and approaches the breakout zone highlighted by the analyst, suggesting a massive price surge is imminent. More #XRP gains are coming. Send it to new all-time highs with haste! pic.twitter.com/VoqMo6Urk5 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 22, 2025 XRP Technical Interpretation The initial accumulation period shown on the chart lasted from July to September 2024. Shortly after Donald Trump’s election victory and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement , XRP experienced a notable breakout, reaching heights it had not seen since 2018, and closing January 2025 with the highest monthly close in its history . This surge brought the digital asset into the re-accumulation phase. During the reaccumulation phase, the price oscillated between the tested support and resistance levels. It displayed reduced volatility relative to the prior impulse. The asset struggled during this phase, almost testing the bottom of this range in April, before a quick recovery. It built on this momentum, and its recent price movements suggest that the consolidation might be near its end. XRP recently probed the top of the re-accumulation zone, briefly climbing above the upper boundary when it reached a new all-time high of $3.65 in July . A decisive sustained close above that resistance, supported by rising volume and improving momentum indicators, would strengthen the technical case for continued appreciation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Implications and Risk If a confirmed breakout unfolds and price extends toward the region labeled as a blow-off top on the chart, the market conditions could shift substantially. This zone on the chart ranges from $4 to $16, suggesting a potential double-digit target for the digital asset. A sustained move into that area would also attract renewed speculative interest from retail and institutional investors, which could accelerate trend extension. External factors such as macroeconomic shifts, regulatory developments, and significant token flows can also influence the strength and duration of any climb. As a result, market participants must remain watchful, as XRP often moves fast . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Two years after obtaining the license, the company is leveraging this position to launch the distribution of Ripple USD (RLUSD) and other stablecoins in Japan. Ripple and its subsidiary, SBI VC Trade, have signed a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the distribution of RLUSD in Japan, according to a blog post by Ripple. SBI VC Trade has begun offering stablecoin services, becoming the first entity in the country to receive an Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange Service Provider License. The stablecoin market, currently around $300 billion, is expected to reach a trillion dollars in the coming years. The key drivers of this growth will be usage and institutional demand. According to the blog post, RLUSD stands out as a stablecoin developed with institutional-grade principles of reliability, compliance, and transparency. RLUSD is backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US government bonds, and cash-like assets. Transparency is also ensured through monthly verifications by an independent auditing firm. Tomohiko Kondo, CEO of SBI VC Trade, said: “Our company is pioneering the stablecoin space as the first organization to receive an Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange License in Japan. The launch of RLUSD will not only increase stablecoin options in Japan but also represent a major step forward in terms of reliability and ease of use. We will continue to build a secure and transparent financial infrastructure together with Ripple.” Related News: Ethereum Soars to New Heights: Historic Moments Unfold - ATH on the Horizon - Here's Why and the Current Situation Jack McDonald, Senior Vice President of Ripple Stablecoin, added: “Our partnership with SBI has always been about more than just technology; it has aimed to build a reliable and harmonious financial future. The rollout of RLUSD in Japan is a result of this work. RLUSD is designed to create a reliable bridge between traditional and decentralized finance. This collaboration will not only increase stablecoin adoption in Japan, but also set a new standard for the entire market.” *This is not investment advice.

The bounce came as BTC broke out of a descending channel on the 4-hour chart, but upside remains capped by resistance around $116,000. Traders are trying to figure out if this bounce is the start of a bigger reversal or just a short-term rally. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin moved down from $123,700 to $111,700 on the 4-hour chart, then broke out upward. The price action shows that the resistance at $116,200 is being tested again, which is the same level as the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $116,289. After that, there was a rejection, and BTC stayed just above the $114,500–$115,000 range. The Money Flow Index (MFI) is close to 57, which means that liquidity is balanced. The RSI on shorter timeframes is between 42 and 45, which means that the market is neutral to slightly bearish. This means that momentum is starting to stabilize after last week’s drop.

US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s rate cut hint has brought optimism, the Philippines is proposing a $1.1 billion Bitcoin reserve and Taiwan’s $72 million crypto crackdown has boosted regulatory trust. Together, these developments highlight the maturing role of Bitcoin in global finance—both as a hedge and a growth asset. With technical charts also pointing to a potential breakout, traders now eye the path toward $130,000 with renewed confidence. Taiwan’s $72M Crypto Laundering Case Boosts Market Trust Taiwanese prosecutors have charged 14 individuals in what they call the country’s largest crypto money laundering case, worth around $72 million. Led by Shi Qiren, the group used unregistered exchanges “CoinW” and “CoinThink Technology” to scam over 1,500 people. They deposited funds into machines, converted to foreign currency, bought USDT and then moved the money out. Taiwan prosecutors are investigating the largest-ever money laundering case involving a brick-and-mortar virtual currency exchange. Fourteen individuals, using the CoinW exchange, assisted a fraud ring in converting cash into virtual currency.

Prosecutors are pushing for a $39 million asset seizure, while CoinW denied involvement. While the case exposed risks in loosely regulated markets, investors view the crackdown as a step toward stronger regulatory trust—likely supportive for Bitcoin in the long run. Powell’s Jackson Hole Signal Fuels Crypto Rally Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reignited optimism during his Jackson Hole speech, hinting at an upcoming rate cut. He noted that shifting conditions may “call for adjusting policy,” leading markets to assign a 90% probability of a September reduction. A dovish speech by Powell, signaling interest rate cuts, has energized the crypto market. $BTC and $ETH saw an increase, with #Ethereum 's stronger performance relative to #Bitcoin drawing particular attention. pic.twitter.com/SJlN4LkgNm — Crypto Data Space (@cryptodataspace) August 22, 2025 Bitcoin surged from $112,000 to above $114,700 within minutes, with Ethereum jumping 7% to $4,600. Altcoins including Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP all posted 6%+ gains. Investors had sold heavily earlier in the week but Powell’s dovish comments turned sentiment around. Rate cuts have historically driven liquidity driven rallies across crypto and traders expect this to be no different. Philippines Eyes 10,000 BTC National Reserve Another major development came from Manila. Lawmakers in the Philippines have introduced a bill to create a 10,000 BTC strategic reserve worth $1.1 billion at current prices. The plan would see the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas purchase 2,000 BTC annually for five years, holding the coins in trust for 20 years.

If approved, the Philippines’ holdings would rival Bhutan’s 10,565 BTC and exceed El Salvador’s 6,276 BTC, a move seen as a strong bullish signal by traders betting on institutional adoption. Bitcoin Price Prediction – Technical Outlook The short-term Bitcoin price prediction seems neutral as BTC’s chart below is shaping into a battleground between buyers and sellers. After sliding into a descending channel in mid-August, BTC has bounced sharply from $112,000 support, reclaiming the 50-period EMA at $115,578. Price briefly tested $117,000, marking an attempt to break the channel’s upper boundary. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A completed harmonic pattern between $124,450 and $105,150 underscores the recent swings. Candlestick action near support produced a bullish hammer, followed by green candles that could evolve into a three white soldiers formation if momentum sustains. RSI has recovered to 55, while MACD shows a bullish crossover with a widening histogram—both reinforcing a constructive outlook. If Bitcoin clears $117,000 and sustains above $119,000, upside targets emerge at $121,800 and $124,400. A breakout would likely push to $127,500 and possibly $130,000 in the coming months. On the downside $113,500 and $112,000 are key supports. BTC Potential Trade Setup A cautious entry above $116,200 with a stop under $112,000 aligns risk and reward. If confirmed BTC could rally to $124,400 and then $130,000 as bullish momentum builds into 2025.

Bubblemaps data showed that the very first purchase came from a well-known trader with the name “Naseem.” Blockchain data shows that the trader spent $250k worth of USDC to grab $1.2 million worth of YZY. Solscan data shows YZY token’s first buy. According to Bubblemaps, this is the same trader who once turned a million dollars investment in Donald Trump’s TRUMP token into $100 million in profit. The firm described him as a crypto trader who specializes in sniping. The trader managed to snipe the coin despite the fact that the YZY project claimed to have protections in place to prevent such moves. The YZY website explained that the token launch was designed with an “anti-sniping system.” It said 25 different contract addresses had been created, and one was randomly chosen as the official YZY token to make it harder for automated traders to grab early buys. Blockchain data showed that as many as 50 look-alike wallets were also set up by the team, some of which saw minor attempts from traders trying to guess the real one. Despite these efforts, experienced buyers still managed to work around the defenses. In one case, a user who appeared to have inside information mistakenly purchased the wrong contract, losing $710,000 in the process. They later recovered by buying the correct token. Another trader spent $24,000 in fees to push through a priority transaction and walked away with $3.4 million in profit. On-chain Lens, another blockchain tracking service, said an early investor briefly showed a $6 million gain at the token’s peak. Ye’s stance on memecoins shifted dramatically The launch was a surprise to some fans, since Ye had previously spoken against celebrity-backed coins. Back in February, he criticized such projects for preying on followers. But on Wednesday, he promoted the token with a video on X. By Thursday, he shared the official contract address and linked “Yeezy Money,” website describing it as “a new economy, built on chain.” The website stated that YZY would function as a currency inside a broader financial platform called YZY Money. Later, West himself appeared in a video confirming that the YZY token just dropped. Big traders have a lot of confidence in YZY YZY’s market value soared to $3 billion before tumbling back down to about $1 billion within 40 minutes of launching. Despite the volatility, several prominent figures in the crypto community jumped in. James Wynn , a prominent leverage trader said that he believed the coin’s liquidity and trading volume would attract large investors. He called his own entry into YZY a short term move, hoping to double or even quadruple his investment. He compared it to Trump’s token, which surged from $4 billion to $15 billion in just over a day. “Aped $YZY on a 60% pullback,” Wynn posted, noting the rapid gains he expected. Co-founder of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes also appeared to confirm that he had bought into the coin, sharing a post on X. Pls don’t rug me @kanyewest !!! $YZY for the win … cause bull market.

Because of this, the asset may play a much bigger role in global digital money in the years ahead. Institutional Catalysts For XRP: Gemini’s Card & JPM’s Outlook This week, Gemini released a big teaser in New York City. The company put up a huge wraparound billboard showing an XRP-branded Mastercard. On the card was the date August 25, 2025, and the words “Issued by WebBank.” Gemini also posted the picture on X with the caption “Prepare your bags.” The sign and the post suggest that a major launch is coming. Many people believe this date could be significant for XRP, because it may mark the start of a new product that connects the asset directly with the global Mastercard network. Crypto commentator John Squire quickly reacted to the news . He said mass adoption “is coming fast” and added that the date “could change everything.” The idea of an XRP card is exciting because it could let people make payments using XRP or convert their assets into regular money during a purchase. Another development came from JP Morgan as the bank released a report called “Sizing up the XRP ETP Opportunity.” According to a post shared on X by SMQKE, JP Morgan’s report suggests that XRP could generate $4.3 to $8.4 billion in its first year following the launch of an exchange-traded product . The bank also pointed out that the digital asset is very cheap to use, with each transaction costing only about $0.0004, which is far less than Ethereum or Bitcoin. Global Payments Expansion: Europe & Japan Ripple’s progress in Europe and the U.K. is also getting attention as the company’s system now fits with upgrades in the region’s payment networks. The SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme completes euro payments in under ten seconds, and its adoption is growing. In the U.K., the Faster Payments Service (FPS) is already moving trillions of pounds each year, and the Bank of England is modernizing its Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system to connect with new global standards. The fintech company is collaborating with partners like OpenPayd to integrate these systems with Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution , which means XRP could be utilized as a bridge to facilitate swift cross-border transactions. In Asia, Ripple is preparing to launch its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin in Japan during the first quarter of 2026. The rollout will happen through SBI VC Trade, which is part of SBI Holdings, a well-known Japanese financial company. RLUSD is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, Treasury securities, and other cash assets, with monthly audits to show transparency. As of August, RLUSD already had a market cap of $666 million, making it the eighth-largest stablecoin in the world . Ripple’s entry into Japan comes as the country gets ready to approve its first official stablecoins, making this move very timely. The launch follows the company’s approval in Dubai earlier this year and adds another region where RLUSD can operate.",XRP|ripple|Ripple adoption|ripple news|XRP news|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|ASIA|FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-23 09:30:52

Cardano price predictions from different analysts point to ADA price peaking at $150. However, some analysts believe ADA may have passed its peak, and prefer investing in Remittix (RTX), which is termed the 100x altcoin of 2025. Which is the better investment option? Cardano price prediction offering modest gains or Remittix predictions of a 100x? Cardano Price Prediction: Is $150 Feasible? While many analysts are optimistic about the $150 Cardano price prediction, some feel otherwise. Technically, ADA price has broken through the ceiling of a falling trend channel in the medium term. This indicates a slower falling rate initially, or the start of a more horizontal development. ADA has given a positive signal from the double bottom formation by breaking through the resistance at $0.84. A further rise to $1.13 or more is signaled. The currency is testing support at $0.84. This could give a positive reaction, but a downward breakthrough at $0.84 means a negative signal. The RSI curve shows a rising trend, which could also be an early signal of the start of a rising trend for the price. Cardano’s roadmap progress and scheduled upgrade are gaining traction. ADA’s price action has shown building momentum and gradual accumulation by whales. A few hours ago, Whales_alert reported that 59 million ADA tokens worth over 50 million were transferred from Bitstamp to an unknown wallet. That massive transfer indicates a likely whale or institutional accumulation. Source: Whale_alert via X. ADA is bullish for supply dynamics, as immediate sell pressure drops when funds move off-exchange. Remember, ADA is an established token with a market cap of $26 billion, which makes it less likely to deliver massive gains. Investors looking for a higher upside are exploring smaller-cap altcoins like Remittix with real-world utility.

Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert reported a substantial movement of 2,074 Bitcoin from the leading exchange Binance to an unidentified wallet. This single transaction, valued at approximately $240 million, has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation among investors and market watchers. Such large movements often signal important shifts or strategies within the cryptocurrency landscape, prompting us to delve deeper into its potential implications. What Just Happened: The Massive Binance BTC Transfer? On [Insert Date, if known, or simply state ‘recently’], the crypto community observed a colossal Binance BTC transfer . Whale Alert, a prominent service known for monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions, flagged the movement of 2,074 BTC. This significant sum originated from Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and was directed to a wallet address that remains unknown to the public. The sheer scale of this transaction, translating to roughly $240 million, immediately raises questions about its purpose and the identity of the recipient. Transaction Volume: 2,074 BTC Origin: Binance Exchange Destination: Unknown Wallet Estimated Value: Approximately $240 Million USD These large-scale transfers are often referred to as ‘whale movements’ because they involve individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market dynamics. Why Does a Whale Alert Binance BTC Transfer Matter? Understanding why a Binance BTC transfer of this magnitude garners so much attention is crucial. Whale movements are significant indicators in the cryptocurrency market for several reasons: Market Sentiment: Large transfers can create ripples, influencing investor confidence and market sentiment. A transfer to an unknown wallet might suggest a long-term hold or preparation for a large trade. Potential Volatility: While this specific transfer went to an unknown wallet, large movements can sometimes precede significant sell-offs or buy-ins, leading to price volatility. Strategic Insight: These transactions offer a glimpse into the strategies of major holders. Are they accumulating, rebalancing portfolios, or preparing for new ventures? The opaque nature of an ‘unknown wallet’ adds an extra layer of intrigue, prompting analysts to speculate on the underlying intentions behind such a substantial move. Unveiling the Unknown: Implications of This Binance BTC Transfer When a substantial Binance BTC transfer lands in an ‘unknown wallet,’ it leaves a trail of possibilities rather than definitive answers. However, we can explore several plausible scenarios for such a destination: Cold Storage: A common practice for large holders is to move assets from an exchange to a secure offline wallet (cold storage) for enhanced security, indicating a long-term holding strategy rather than immediate trading. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desk: The BTC might be destined for an OTC desk, where large trades are executed privately to avoid impacting exchange order books. This often involves institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. Institutional Investor: A new institutional player might be entering the market, acquiring a significant Bitcoin position for their portfolio. Exchange Rebalancing: Sometimes, exchanges themselves move funds between their own hot and cold wallets for security or operational purposes, though this is less common for ‘unknown’ public addresses. Without direct confirmation, pinpointing the exact reason remains challenging, but these are the most common interpretations within the crypto community. What Are the Potential Market Impacts of This Massive Binance BTC Transfer? While a single Binance BTC transfer doesn’t dictate the entire market, its size warrants consideration for potential impacts. Investors often react to such whale movements, leading to: Increased Scrutiny: The market will likely watch Bitcoin’s price action more closely for any follow-up moves from this address or related entities. Shifting Sentiment: If the market perceives this as a long-term hold, it could be seen as a bullish signal, indicating confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Conversely, if it’s feared to be preparation for a large sale, it might induce caution. Liquidity Considerations: While the funds are off the exchange, they are temporarily out of the active trading supply, which could theoretically affect liquidity, although Bitcoin’s overall market depth is vast. For individuals, staying informed about such transfers and understanding their potential implications can help in making more informed decisions. This substantial Binance BTC transfer underscores the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price might not be drastic, the move highlights the ongoing activity of large holders and the importance of monitoring blockchain data. It serves as a reminder that behind the charts and price fluctuations, significant players are continually making strategic decisions that shape the future of digital assets. Keep an eye on further developments, as the story of this $240 million transfer continues to unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Whale Alert? A1: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various networks, providing transparency into significant movements by ‘whales.’ Q2: Why is a Binance BTC transfer to an unknown wallet significant? A2: A large Binance BTC transfer to an unknown wallet is significant because it suggests a major strategic move by a large holder, potentially signaling a shift in investment strategy, cold storage, or an OTC deal, which can influence market sentiment. Q3: Does this transfer mean Bitcoin’s price will go up or down? A3: Not necessarily. While large transfers can influence sentiment, a single Binance BTC transfer doesn’t guarantee a specific price movement. It depends on the market’s interpretation of the whale’s intentions and subsequent actions. Q4: How can I track such large transactions myself? A4: You can follow services like Whale Alert on social media or use blockchain explorers for Bitcoin (like Blockchain.com or Blockchair) to track transactions by known addresses, though identifying the owner of an ‘unknown wallet’ is generally impossible. Q5: Is it safe to keep my BTC on an exchange like Binance? A5: While exchanges like Binance implement robust security measures, transferring large amounts of BTC to a personal cold storage wallet is generally considered safer for long-term holding to mitigate exchange-specific risks.

Remember “DeFi Summer” in 2020, when farmers turned yield into fortunes? Or “Solana Summer” in 2021, when the chain’s speed and low fees had everyone buzzing like it was the hottest beach party in town? Fast forward to now, and that heat seems to be cooling. Solana still shines, but the hype wave isn’t as wild as before. Instead, a new name is making the rounds on Crypto Twitter and Discords everywhere, “ Layer Brett Summer.” The meme-fueled Ethereum Layer 2 project is turning heads, wallets, and timelines, becoming the season’s unexpected star. Why Solana's summer tan is starting to fade For a while, Solana looked unstoppable, climbing the charts like it was heading for another beach party high. But the data now shows otherwise. Holder activity is slipping fast: mid-term holders dropped from 14.84% to 12.96%, and short-term holders fell by almost half. That’s a lot of wallets choosing to pack up and leave the party early. The charts aren’t helping either. Solana’s price action has carved out a double top around $206–$209, textbook bearish vibes. If $183 cracks, the next stops could be $175 or even $161. Add in SOPR showing weaker profit conviction, and suddenly Solana’s once-flashy rally looks more like a mirage than momentum. All this doesn’t mean Solana’s done, but the cool-down is real. And in crypto, when one summer ends, another begins. That’s why investors are already calling it “Layer Brett Summer” instead, chasing fresh heat in the Ethereum Layer 2 scene. Why Layer Brett summer is heating up fast In crypto, every season has its star. Remember when Polygon suddenly went from “that sidechain thing” to a must-have scaling solution? Or when Shiba Inu surprised everyone with staking utilities that kept holders hooked? That’s the kind of buzz now forming around Layer Brett ($LBRETT), except this time, it’s not just a meme, it’s a full-blown Layer 2 evolution. Ethereum’s Layer 2s are already on track to handle over $10 trillion a year by 2027, and the reason is simple: lower gas fees, faster speeds, and room to scale. Layer Brett rides this exact wave, offering near-instant transactions and dramatically cheaper costs while staying anchored to Ethereum’s security. Think of it as ETH’s fun, faster cousin who actually pays for the drinks. And the sweet part? $LBRETT isn’t just tradable, it’s stakable. With a few clicks on MetaMask or Trust Wallet, holders can lock in high-yield rewards. That’s why the crowd is calling it Layer Brett Summer. Staking just leveled up One reason Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is buzzing is its gamified staking. Instead of boring lock-ups, rewards feel interactive, like how StepN made walking a sport or how Blur turned NFT trading into a farming race. Add NFT integrations here, and suddenly staking isn’t just numbers on a screen, it’s like holding a BAYC that unlocks perks while also paying you. Tokenomics? Straightforward. With a hard cap of 10 billion tokens, no mystery minting, no hidden inflation, $LBRETT stays fully transparent and community-driven. That kind of simplicity reminds people of why SHIB’s community thrived, because everyone knew the rules of the game. And the cherry on top: no KYC hurdles, no middlemen. Pure self-custody. Think the freedom of MetaMask or Uniswap, but with NFTs, staking boosts, and rewards that make hodling fun again. The bottom line Crypto summers always have a headliner, and this year, it looks like Solana’s tan is fading while Layer Brett ($LBRETT) grabs the spotlight. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it blends meme energy with real scaling power, fast, cheap, and secure. Add gamified staking, NFT perks, and transparent tokenomics, and you’ve got a recipe that feels fresh yet familiar, like when SHIB or Polygon had their breakout moments. Whether it’s the staking rewards or the no-KYC, self-custodial freedom, investors are already dubbing it “Layer Brett Summer”, and the buzz suggests this beach party is just getting started.

The crypto community often remembers the summer seasons by their defining trends, such as ""DeFi Summer"" and the more recent ""Solana Summer."" Now, a novel term is gaining traction: ""Layer Brett Summer,"" a movement centered around the Ethereum Layer 2 solution known for its innovative approach and community-driven ethos. Despite Solana's previous allure, its luminescence is waning. Investment metrics and market data indicate a decline in both mid-term and short-term holder activity, suggesting that many are moving away from Solana to explore other promising ventures. This shifting focus is captured in the emergent excitement for Layer Brett, which offers new staking mechanisms and enticing transaction speeds. Shifting Sands: From Solana to Layer Brett While Solana once held the crypto community's attention with its rapid transactions and low fees, it's the innovative features of Layer Brett that are now drawing crowds. The platform not only promises enhanced speed and efficiency but also introduces a gamified staking experience, making it a standout in the Layer 2 landscape. Why ""Layer Brett Summer"" is the New Buzzword Layer Brett isn't just another crypto project. It’s a cultural shift within the Ethereum ecosystem, emphasizing scalability and cost-efficiency but with a twist of fun. Staking on Layer Brett isn't merely an investment; it's an engaging activity that rewards participants in innovative ways, akin to playing a game. Furthermore, the hype around Layer Brett is backed by solid technological advancements that promise to handle significant volumes of transactions, echoing the broad ambitions of Ethereum’s scaling solutions. This potential has not only caught the eye of seasoned investors but also of new participants eager to join the Layer 2 revolution. Investing in Layer Brett: A Smart Move? As interest pivots from Solana to Layer Brett, investors and crypto enthusiasts are keenly observing the benefits of engaging with the platform. The allure of reduced transaction fees, coupled with high-speed operations and robust security measures inherited from Ethereum, makes Layer Brett an attractive option for anyone looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Moreover, the tokenomics of Layer Brett are designed to ensure transparency and fairness, enhancing its appeal among a community that values clarity and equitable opportunity. With the crypto landscape constantly evolving, keeping an eye on emerging trends like Layer Brett could provide insightful leads into where the market is headed next.

Powell used his final Jackson Hole address to hint at looming interest rate cuts. This ignited a sharp rally for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other major altcoins. Data shows that nearly $770 million worth of long and short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Bears got hammered the most during the fresh rally. Bitcoin had been teetering near $112,000 last mid-week, but it roared back to breakthrough the $117 mark again. The cumulative digital assets market cap surged by more than 4% to regain $4 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 79% to stand at $261 billion. The Fear and Greed Index remained “Neutral” while inching towards “Greed” territory. $476M shorts wiped as bulls pushes ETH According to the data shared by CoinGlass, more than $476 million of short bets were liquidated over the last 24 hours. The largest single liquidation order of ETH-USDT-SWAP, worth $10 million, happened on OKX. Ethereum stole the spotlight as it skyrocketed nearly 15% to hit a fresh all-time high just shy of $4,900. The bull frenzy managed to demolish the record made back in 2021. ETH price is now running up by 42% on a YTD basis. It has outperformed Bitcoin gains of 24% in the same period. Ripple’s XRP is the only crypto among the top 10 that outdid Ethereum in the parallel spell. Ethereum is trading at an average price of $4,714 at the press time. Its 24-hour trading volume has spiked by 129% to hit $80.25 billion. Ethereum long and short liquidation, Source: CoinGlass. Data shows that the market saw $384 million worth of long and short bets set on ETH price being liquidated over the last 24 hours. However, $272 million (71%) of the liquidated positions turn out to be short bets. This suggests that traders were hoping that Ethereum price would continue to struggle, but that was not the case. ETH ETFs see $337M inflows while Bitcoin funds bleed Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked US exchange-traded funds reported decoupling again. BTC ETFs saw $23.15 million flowing out of the funds on Friday. BlackRock’s IBIT was the only ETF that leaked funds. It posted almost $200 million in withdrawals. Meanwhile, Ark and 21shares bagged more than $65 million in inflows. BTC ETFs are on a streak of 6 days printing red indices. On the other side, Ethereum ETFs recorded a huge inflow of $337.63 million on Friday. This suggests that investors have now shifted on ETH accumulation. Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, mentioned that ETH has now gained over 250% from April lows, outpacing Bitcoin. He added that the transactions on the Ethereum network jumped 63% in the past 30 days, while active addresses rose 26%. However, wallets holding over 10,000 ETH have risen by 200 since July. Behind the noticeable surge sits Powell’s message from Jackson Hole. Instead of doubling down on inflation worries, the Fed chair noticed that the downside risks to employment are rising. He even cautioned that labor market stress can “materialize quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs.” These remarks fueled speculation that rate cuts could arrive as early as September. As of now, markets are now pricing in a chance of policy easing from the current 4.25%–4.5% range. For crypto traders, the implications are pretty simple.

That’s a 9% daily gain, which exhibits just how quickly momentum can shift when investors are taking control of the market. In just two sessions, ETH added more than $800, a rally fueled by cleaner technical signals and stronger interest from bigger players in the market. Looking at the 4-hour chart, ETH has carved out a classic ABCD harmonic pattern, a sign that the move isn’t random but follows a structured path. The breakout above the 50-period SMA at $4,388 also came with a bullish engulfing candle—an early indication that sellers lost their grip and buyers were willing to commit. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Key Levels to Watch Now Bitcoin price prediction is slightly bullish as the ETH/USD pair is showing strength without looking stretched. The relative strength index (RSI) is holding around 65, high but not yet overbought. Whereas, the (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) MACD is widening on the bullish side, suggesting momentum still has room. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Right now, price action is consolidating around $4,700 in what looks like a flag formation. That’s often the pause before the next leg up. Ethereum is trading near $4,720 after a sharp breakout. Support sits at $4,600 & $4,400, while resistance at $4,900 could open the path to $5,300. #ETH #Crypto pic.twitter.com/e82KAWw9mG — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 23, 2025 Here’s how the chart stacks up: support is sitting around $4,600, with a stronger base near $4,400. Resistance is at $4,900—if ETH clears that, it opens a path to $5,300, and eventually $5,700. These levels line up closely with the extension targets highlighted on TradingView’s path tool. Looking Ahead: Can ETH Push Toward $6,000? For traders, ETH technical analysis is simple. A close above $4,900 and you’re in, stops below $4,600. First target $5,300, then $5,700. If momentum continues, ETH could be laying the foundation for a move to $6,000 in the coming months. Momentum is bullish: RSI near 65, MACD widening. A close above $4,900 sets sights on $5,700–$6,000. ETH’s $569B market cap signals this run may just be beginning. #Ethereum — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 23, 2025 Ethereum’s $569 billion market cap isn’t just a number – it’s the weight it’s carrying across DeFi, NFTs and blockchain infrastructure. That’s why this feels different from just another spike. It could be the start of a bigger move where ETH retests the highs and starts to become the backbone of the digital economy. New Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $11.3 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012775—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

The ETF uses a covered call strategy, trading Bitcoin ETPs and selling call options to generate high yields, though this caps upside during strong rallies. BTCI is ideal for income-focused Bitcoin investors willing to trade some growth for steady cash flow, but it carries risks tied to Bitcoin's price and volatility. With strong early performance, robust distributions, and a compelling value proposition, I rate BTCI a buy for those seeking yield plus Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been one of the most exciting assets in the markets this past decade. Critics argue that its volatility makes it unsuitable as a store of value, while supporters compare it to digital ""Manhattan real estate"" or more commonly digital gold. Over the last year alone, Bitcoin has rallied more than 85%, cementing its reputation as a high-beta asset tied to broader risk sentiment. While bitcoin’s growth has been mind-blowing, and bitcoin believers have made tons of money, there is no way to live off these gains without selling your coins and losing Bitcoin exposure. That is where the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) comes in. This actively managed ETF was launched in late 2024, helping investors like me combine direct exposure to bitcoin with an options strategy that monetizes the asset’s volatility. In other words, BTCI turns bitcoin’s volatility into a source of monthly income. Since its inception, BTCI has quickly gained a ton of traction and has established itself as a top monthly payer. The fund has more than $500 million in assets under management, and it pays one of the most rewarding distribution yields available today. BTCI is paying more than 25% on an annualized basis. I have started contributing half of my bitcoin allocation into BTCI, and I believe many bitcoin investors will do the same. If you are long bitcoin and are willing to sacrifice some upside potential for monthly income and reduced volatility, BTCI is a buy. Breaking down BTCI Inception: October 17, 2024 Assets Under Management: $556 million Expense Ratio: 0.98% Underlying Exposure: Actively managed fund investing in Bitcoin ETPs and futures, with a call option overlay strategy Distribution: Monthly, currently 27.92% annual yield, most distributions are classified as return of capital (ROC) (estimated 96%) Performance: Since inception, BTCI has delivered a total return of 58%. For reference, current date: 8/19/2025. BTCI's Options Strategy BTCI is an actively managed ETF, as you could probably tell by the expense ratio close to 1%. Its strategy is synthetic covered calls on Bitcoin. The fund establishes exposure to Bitcoin through spot Bitcoin ETPs, while selling call options on Bitcoin futures ETFs. These calls are sold about one month away and are held until expiration. Investors benefit from income that is directly tied to bitcoin’s volatility. When volatility is high, option premiums increase, allowing BTCI to deliver double-digit annualized yields. Selling calls means the fund gives up some upside in big Bitcoin rallies. If Bitcoin shoots up 20% in a month, BTCI investors will capture only a portion of that move since the calls sold against the underlying cap the upside. This strategy can produce alpha against Bitcoin in flat or slightly up or down markets. BTCI thrives, as premiums collected provide steady returns even if Bitcoin’s spot price does not move much. Risks While BTCI’s 25%+ yield is extremely attractive, there are several risks we should understand while holding BTCI. Bitcoin’s uncertainty remains high, and BTCI is not a hedge against crypto downturns. If Bitcoin enters a bear market, BTCI’s net asset value will decline. The options strategy provides income but does not offer much downside protection. So it has similar risk profiles to holding bitcoin. Its ability to generate large monthly payments depends on implied volatility in bitcoin options and futures. If volatility compresses and bitcoin trades in a tight range for a while, option premiums will shrink, lowering payouts. Distributions will vary a bit from month to month, depending on market conditions. These distributions won't be as reliable and safe as blue-chip dividend stock; they have a lot more factors associated with them. The range so far has been about $1.12 - $1.5 per share, with most dividends being $1.4 per share. So there is a bit of a gap between the biggest and the smallest payouts, but it's nothing dramatic. The upside is capped. BTCI will underperform pure Bitcoin during sharp rallies because call options limit gains. Investors who do not value income so much and want the full upside potential of bitcoin will do better off just holding bitcoin directly. BTCI is great for income, but it will limit some bitcoin rally upside. Seeking Alpha BTCI just launched in October 2024; it is brand new. With such a short amount of time since its inception, we don't have much data on how it will actually perform in the long term. We have not yet seen how it will perform in a true crypto winter or in a bitcoin halving. We can make estimates and try to back-test the trades, but we will never truly know until it happens and we get to see it for ourselves. Since there is only about 6 months of data for BTCI, I used the last 6 months to compare it to Bitcoin's performance in a pretty bullish cycle for Bitcoin. It has been on par with Bitcoin, which is what we want. Past performance does not guarantee future returns. We will just have to wait a couple of years to see. Distributions Since its inception, BTCI has done a great job at returning income to shareholders. It has paid about $1.40 per share per month. This is roughly a 2% monthly yield; these types of returns can seriously compound money fast. Seeking Alpha BTCI has also done a great job controlling its share price and net asset value [NAV]. BTCI's shares have actually gone up about 20% since its inception, on top of returning huge income to investors. With the continued rise of Bitcoin, this should continue and will allow BTCI to keep paying a high monthly income. I do not see NAV erosion or huge share price decays outside of bitcoin's share movement to be a problem for BTCI. BTCI's future success will come from two things: continued volatility in bitcoin and continued bitcoin appreciation. If the volatility remains high, we will continue to receive 20+% yields yearly, and if bitcoin's price keeps grinding up, we will receive share appreciation. Bitcoin's price appreciation also protects the NAV from decreasing and could eventually offset reduced volatility if Bitcoin becomes a more stable asset. Scenario Analysis: Here are some scenarios on how Bitcoin's price action will affect BTCI. If Bitcoin rallies 50% in a year, BTCI will capture some of the upside. Of course, not all of it, but possibly 15–25% capital appreciation on top of big distributions. Still producing a strong total return even if it lags BTC directly. If Bitcoin trades sideways, BTCI thrives. Monthly option income will keep hitting the account monthly, and we will enjoy double-digit yields. Maybe since volatility is lower, we won't see a 25% yield, but we could see 18%-20%. BTCI in this scenario would outperform Bitcoin and produce really strong results. If Bitcoin declines sharply, BTCI will follow, also declining. While income will continue, total returns could turn negative, just as they would for direct bitcoin holders. BTCI would outperform Bitcoin in this scenario, as calls will keep producing income since volatility will still be there. The calls will also provide a little cushion as the share price falls, since they make it so BTCI has a lower overall beta compared to Bitcoin. BTCI will lag Bitcoin’s return when the price is shooting up, but it could create alpha compared to Bitcoin in slow-moving or bear markets. Why I Am Bullish What makes BTCI compelling is that it solves a problem for people like me who are bullish on bitcoin and want to hold bitcoin for a long time, but also want income. Something bitcoin does not provide. Seeking Alpha BTCI has heavily outperformed the S&P 500 these past 6 months, although we do not have many years of data. If you are bullish on Bitcoin, you do not see this trend slowing down. Even just a small exposure to this ETF can set your portfolio apart and create market-beating returns. Seeking Alpha BTCI has also heavily outperformed other NEOS high-yielding ETFs. Bitcoin's underlying volatility makes it hard for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to compete. Although past returns do not guarantee future returns. I see BTCI as a true winner, it is everything a high-yield ETF should be. I am very bullish on BTCI, and I believe it will keep returning market-beating results for many years to come. Assuming bitcoin's price keeps appreciating over time as more buyers see bitcoin's potential. And, assuming government policy towards crypto does not do a complete 180 from friendly to ban all crypto, BTCI is going to do great. The current macro conditions make BTCI even more favorable, as the Federal Reserve’s expected rate cuts could increase the attractiveness of BTCI’s distributions as people move from treasuries and bonds to other high-yielding assets. This can cause BTCI’s AUM to grow even quicker. Another thing to note that could impact BTCI's AUM is that when the Fed cuts rates, investors will have access to cheaper capital. If you are an investor with a high-risk appetite, you may buy BTCI on margin and be able to pocket the yield difference. Let's say BTCI remains flat in price, but returns a 20% yield. If you are paying 5% in interest, you just made a 15% return on your money. I'm not saying this has to happen, but sentiment online is that more and more people are starting to look at these yield arbitrage plays with covered call ETFs. This definitely could have an impact on BTCI's AUM, and that is why I mention it. This strategy is risky and not meant for every investor. I am currently not using this strategy myself. Conclusion BTCI is one of the most interesting ETFs to launch in recent years. By applying a high-income covered call strategy to Bitcoin, it takes volatility and turns it into a monthly cash flow while still offering some upside participation. Risks remain correlated to Bitcoin’s price and underperformance in upside during big rallies, but the value proposition is clear. For income investors who want bitcoin exposure, BTCI is paradise. With annualized yields currently more than 25%, consistent monthly payouts, and a best-in-class fund backing it in NEOS, the fund provides a nice mix of yield and growth. I rate BTCI a buy, as it represents one of the best ways for investors who are bullish on Bitcoin to generate monthly income while still being exposed to Bitcoin’s long-term price movements.",BTC-USD|BTCI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-23 09:55:00

Altcoins have historically mirrored the performance of Bitcoin with exaggerated rallies, and early indications show that this will not change. Investors have now started paying attention to projects that will perform better as soon as Bitcoin dominance. Among the new names generating buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already been picked by crypto experts as one of the best altcoin choices for the 2025 bull market, highlighting the growing appetite for high-upside opportunities. Among the tokens that most analysts believe could spearhead this next phase of the rally are XRP, ADA, and SOL. Each token presents its value proposition and can take advantage of changing market sentiment as money flows out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. XRP: The Institutional Darling XRP has always been the asset of choice in cross-border payments. The end of regulatory uncertainty has now opened the way to renewed institutional demand and even the possibility of ETFs in the future. Its applicability in the real world is on a steady rise, particularly as RippleNet adopts its usage, thus providing the coin with potential and a growth thesis that sees the world of finance integrate blockchain technology. ADA: The Research-First Innovator The emphasis placed by Cardano on peer review and research-based development has earned a following and provided a solid structure for further development. The governance improvements and rapidly growing dApp ecosystem point to actual usage growth. In combination with its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism and scaling solutions, such as Hydra, ADA is considered one of the top contenders to rally in the current bull market. SOL: The High-Speed Powerhouse Solana is a performance-oriented blockchain used in DeFi, games, and NFTs. It has a Proof-of-History consensus mechanism that makes the system very fast and with low transaction costs, which is attractive to developers and users. The rumour of a possible future spot ETF is only adding anticipation to an already hyped-up market, and the meme coin and dApp phenomenon continues to keep investors deeply invested. A Breakout Opportunity About to Shake the Crypto Market Amid these established altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a breakout contender in 2025. Analysts note that it has significant potential, with some early participants already projecting returns that could increase historical meme coin giants. With demand rising and presale rounds selling out quickly, experts note that a small early allocation – say $1,000 – could realistically turn into $20,000 or more if adoption continues at this pace. This scarcity-driven momentum has cemented MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most talked-about new projects this cycle. Conclusion The timing of “altcoin season” is unpredictable, but history shows that when it begins, opportunities can multiply quickly. As Bitcoin stabilizes, investors will tend to rotate into riskier, high-reward investments. With XRP, ADA, and SOL all carrying strong catalysts, and MAGACOIN FINANCE offering great opportunities for early investors, the stage is set for a potentially explosive second leg of this bull market .

While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the bedrock of the market, the biggest opportunities often come from new tokens entering at attractive price points with strong fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly moving up the ranks, having already surged 300% during its presale. Traders are now questioning whether it could be the next token to deliver a 1,000% rally in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) began its presale at $0.015 and has steadily progressed through multiple phases, now priced at $0.035. To date, the project has raised $14.75 million and onboarded more than 15,550 holders. With a confirmed listing price of $0.06, early participants are already positioned for gains once trading goes live. This momentum stands out, as presales rarely deliver both low-cost access and utility. By offering a sub-$0.05 entry backed by a functioning model, MUTM has drawn interest from everyday traders as well as whales positioning for the next major DeFi success story. Stablecoin Integration: A Utility Advantage One of the standout features of Mutuum Finance is its development of an overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this asset will be fully backed by on-chain reserves and minted from collateral deposited into Mutuum’s lending markets. This stablecoin is a fundamental part of the ecosystem. It strengthens liquidity, provides a reliable medium for transactions, and ensures Mutuum Finance has long-term relevance beyond short-term trading. By embedding this functionality, the protocol sets itself apart from many presale projects that often launch without immediate real-world use cases. Security and Investor Confidence Security has been a critical focus for Mutuum Finance. The project recently completed a CertiK audit, scoring 95/100, a result that ranks it among the most trusted DeFi protocols in development. In addition to the audit, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $50,000 bug bounty program, structured with four reward tiers based on severity: Critical – Up to $2,000 Major – Up to $1,000 Medium – Up to $500 Low – Up to $200 For investors, these measures are a strong signal. They demonstrate that the project isn’t just about growth potential but also about building a safe, transparent, and sustainable ecosystem. This attention to detail is one of the reasons why whales have already begun securing sizable allocations in the presale. Example of Investment Potential The numbers behind MUTM’s growth tell the story best. At today’s presale price of $0.035, a $1,500 investment secures around 42,800 MUTM tokens. By the time the token launches at $0.06, that allocation would already be valued near $2,570. Looking at the broader horizon, analysts are predicting MUTM to reach around $0.85 within its first major cycle. Once that plays out, the same $1,500 investment would be worth over $36,000—a 24x return. Some even suggest that MUTM’s tokenomics and stablecoin integration could drive further upside, placing it in contention for the 1,000% club in 2025. Why Analysts See More Upside Ahead What gives analysts confidence is the combination of mechanics built into the protocol. Mutuum Finance redistributes a portion of protocol fees by buying MUTM on the open market and sending it to mtToken stakers, creating consistent buy pressure. Additionally, the project is launching its beta platform simultaneously with the token listing, giving investors immediate access to lending and borrowing utilities from day one. This removes the uncertainty of waiting months for functionality. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already surged 300% during its presale, and with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, the growth trajectory is firmly in motion. The integration of an overcollateralized stablecoin, strong security audits, and immediate platform functionality only add weight to analysts’ calls that this could be one of the next major gainers of 2025.

Key Takeaways: Grayscale, Bitwise, and others filed updated spot XRP ETF proposals, likely in response to SEC feedback. The filings adjust structures to include XRP or cash creations and both cash and in-kind redemptions. While XRP rallied 7% on the news, BlackRock has stayed out of the XRP ETF race for now. Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin, 21Shares, and WisdomTree all submitted amendments for their proposed spot XRP ETFs. While the SEC has yet to approve any spot XRP ETF, the filings suggest that firms are responding to ongoing regulatory feedback. XRP ETF Filings Likely Sparked by SEC Feedback Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart described the cluster of filings as “almost certainly due to feedback from SEC,” adding on X that while the move is “a good sign,” it was largely expected. The updated proposals appear to adjust fund structures to allow for XRP or cash creations, along with both cash and in-kind redemptions, rather than strictly cash-based mechanisms. Bunch of XRP ETF filings being updated by issuers today. Almost certainly due to feedback from SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected pic.twitter.com/GiSL1kc6lt — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 22, 2025 Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called the simultaneous filings “highly notable,” saying it was “a very good sign” for the prospects of eventual approval. Despite the momentum, the world’s largest ETF issuer, BlackRock, has not joined the XRP race. While BlackRock launched the first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the firm confirmed earlier this month that it has no current plans to pursue an XRP product. The filings arrive amid a broader crypto market rally, with XRP climbing 7% on Friday to trade at $3.08. Meanwhile, VanEck has submitted an application for a JitoSOL ETF, the first proposed Solana fund backed entirely by a liquid staking token (LST). The ETF would track JitoSOL, a token representing SOL staked on the Solana network. The Jito Foundation, which backs the proposal, said the fund marks a milestone now that the SEC has provided clarity that both protocol and liquid staking do not constitute securities transactions. “That clarity opens a compliant path for ETF sponsors to use LSTs,” the foundation said in a Friday blog post. The SEC recently approved in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs, further widening the compliance runway for novel products. Just weeks ago, REX-Osprey became the first ETF issuer to integrate staking rewards into a Solana fund via a JitoSOL partnership. Solana (SOL) was trading at $199 at press time, up nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. Grayscale Moves Forward With Dogecoin ETF Plan As reported, Grayscale is pushing ahead with its bid to launch a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund , revealing the ticker “GDOG” in its latest US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company said Friday it plans to rename its existing Grayscale Dogecoin Trust to the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF.

This community has identified Avalon X (AVLX) as the next best crypto to buy in 2025. As XRP has successfully disrupted the traditional financial sector, Avalon X is about to disrupt the real estate sector. Avalon X is doing with real estate what XRP did for payments. For decades, luxury real estate has been locked away from everyday investors. Avalon X is simplifying and giving access to the ordinary masses without the need for deep pockets or paperwork. Its token, AVLX, is more than just a trade coin. It is a digital key tied to Grupo Avalon’s nearly $1 billion project pipeline. For anyone who believes assets should have a purpose, Avalon X is worth a closer look. Unlike XRP, which tackled the financial sector with no backing, investors are recognizing AVLX has a stronger start due to its billion-dollar backing. Avalon X Crypto: RWA Project Dominates Crypto Market Crypto’s market cap sits in the trillions; its growth in the last decade has been very impressive. But real estate? That market towers at more than $379 trillion worldwide. Most of it is inaccessible to average people. Avalon X is setting up the bridge between the two. By tapping into this market, this will expand into a much bigger, untapped space, creating the next wave of crypto millionaires. Unlike XRP, which has an unlimited supply, Avalon X has further employed great tokenomics with a capped supply of AVLX coins. Allocation of these tokens rewards early adopters and ensures long-term sustainability. In the long term, the plan is global expansion and broader asset classes. To kick things off, they’re giving away $1 million worth of AVLX tokens . Even bigger, one participant will walk away with a luxury townhouse in the Dominican Republic. That’s not “enter to win a t-shirt” marketing. That’s a real property tied directly to the project’s DNA. Timing Is Everything As XRP has proven, timing is everything: buying when it’s still building and selling high. Ethereum early adopters know this as well. Catching a project before the crowd piles in is what separates small wins from transformative gains. Avalon X presale is still early. The presale price is low, the Avalon X giveaways are live, and the roadmap is just beginning to unfold. A moment in time where a token gives you not just access to a new market, but a tangible claim to a piece of tomorrow. The early stages of this journey are fleeting, and the window of opportunity is closing. For the discerning investor who sees the future in the marriage of technology and real assets, the time for hesitation is over. The market is whispering, the foundation is set, and the future is waiting. Secure your position and own a piece of the new frontier.

But what if there is a coin that could give you 100 times more? We’ll talk about a recent XRP price prediction and why some investors are still optimistic even though the XRP price has dropped in the short term. Then we’ll talk about a new meme coin called Layer Brett that combines fun with real blockchain use. Is it the best crypto to buy right now? Let’s find out. XRP Builds Momentum Despite Whale Moves Some investors may have been frightened about the recent $470M whale unwinding, but analysts say there is no need to panic. Retail buyers are becoming involved, which is a symptom of redistribution. The XRP price has decreased more than 7% over the past week, but it is still holding strong in the $2.7 to $2.8 region. The XRP price has been trading between $3.6 and $2.7 over the past month, which signals that it is getting ready for its next move. The XRPArmy remains strongly bullish. CoinCodex’s recent XRP price prediction says that short-term drops may keep happening. Nonetheless, the long-term trend looks good despite the bearish short-term XRP price prediction . XRP has had 12 days of growth over the previous 30 days, with a mild volatility of 4.46%. Long-term holders are excited since the XRP price is only approximately 200% away from its $10 target. The technical sentiment is neutral, but if prices keep going up at this level, it might mean a breakout is coming shortly. According to the XRP price prediction , now would be a good opportunity to buy before the market picks up again. Layer Brett: The 100x Meme Coin With Real Utility Layer Brett is more than just talk. It utilises Layer 2 scaling to facilitate transactions almost instantly and maintain very low gas fees, all while remaining connected to Ethereum for security. You can buy and stake $LBRETT in seconds with ETH, USDT, or BNB through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. The ecosystem stays active and rewarding via gamified staking, NFT integrations, and rewards. It stands out due to its clear tokenomics and community focus. Layer Brett is already looking like the best crypto to invest in for both quick gains and long-term growth for a lot of people. Timing is quite crucial since people who buy early get greater staking rates and higher yields. The presale price is merely $0.0047, and in just a few weeks, approximately $900,000 has already been raised. This shows that there is a lot of interest. You may connect different chains with this project. This makes it better than other Layer 2s, such as Optimism and Arbitrum. Gas rates on Ethereum can be as high as $20, but Layer Brett lowers them to only a few cents, making it easier for average people to use. Layer Brett is a project based on memes that leverages real blockchain technology to fix problems. Final Word: Don’t Miss the 100x Window The $10 aim for XRP sounds great. But it’s slow, steady, and uncertain. On the other hand, Layer Brett is moving quickly. The presale is already bringing in a lot of money, yet the price to get in is still only $0.0047. Early buyers are locking in higher staking payouts and getting ready for big gains. This is where the true 100x chance is. These kinds of chances don’t stick around. Get in before the next stage of the presale to make sure you get a position in what may be the most rewarding meme coin of 2025.

His prediction is not on traditional tools like charts, candlestick patterns, or complex technical indicators. According to him, investors will go from laughing at the digital asset to feeling panic and then chasing it in fear of missing out. In the early stages, people often dismiss cryptocurrencies, claiming they have no real value. But as time passes and the XRP price climbs, that attitude will shift into doubt, regret, and finally desperation to buy in at any cost. Barri C: XRP Investors Will Laugh, Doubt, And Panic At $4, $10, And $100 Barri C says the first stage of investor reaction begins at $4. At this level, many people will mock XRP. They will joke about it being a “shit coin” and point out that the price has reached this level before. In their eyes, this is not a milestone worth noticing, so they laugh it off.

Even though it is only a small step higher, it feels more serious because the number now has two digits. People begin to feel uneasy, but they still hold on to the belief that the coin will crash again. They convince themselves they will be able to repurchase it at a cheaper price later. The real shock, according to Barri C, comes when XRP reaches the $100 mark. At this point, a wave of realization hits investors who had dismissed or underestimated the token for years, as they suddenly recognize the scale of the opportunity they passed up. Panic begins to spread across the market as latecomers scramble to get in, while early critics are with deep regret for not taking action sooner, watching the price climb beyond what once seemed impossible. Why $1,000 XRP Could Trigger Mass Adoption According to Barri C, the most dramatic stage comes when XRP reaches $1,000. At this point, the fear of missing out, often called FOMO, takes control of the market. Everyone, from regular people to long-time critics, will feel desperate to own some XRP.

The demand will rise quickly as people rush in, not wanting to be left behind. For many, it will no longer matter how high the price has gone. The only thought will be to buy before it climbs even more. Barri C adds that this stage is also when XRP could be more than just a cryptocurrency, evolving into the backbone of a new global financial system that supports cross-border payments and institutional transactions. The mix of FOMO and belief in its role in finance would push people from all sides, from supporters, skeptics, and even haters, to grab a share.

The scam allegedly defrauded over 1,500 victims of over NT$1.27 billion ($41 million). According to prosecutors, the suspects operated under the cover of BitShine because it had passed Financial Supervisory Commission checks, helping conceal the activities of another unlicensed firm. Taiwanese Prosecutors Bring Charges In BitShine Fraud Taiwanese authorities have concluded a major investigation into one of the country’s most high-profile crypto fraud cases. The investigation has resulted in changes against 14 individuals associated with the BitShine exchange. Authorities allege the individuals conspired with fraud groups to trick over 1,500 customers and steal NT$1.27 billion ($41 million). According to local media reports, the group operated under the guise of BitShine. BitShine had passed Federal Supervisory Commission checks, allowing the perpetrators to hide the activities of another unlicensed firm, Biying Technology. According to investigators, the two companies worked in tandem, funneling customer funds into cryptocurrency purchases, particularly USDT. The funds were then moved overseas through a series of transfers to hide their origin. How The Fraud Worked Prosecutors identified the mastermind of the scam as a man named Shih. According to authorities, Shih headed operations in Taiwan, with his wife serving as Asia-Pacific director. Another suspect named Yang was responsible for business management. The group worked with organized crime affiliates and instructed victims to transfer funds into specific wallets. The funds were then rerouted through multiple layers of transactions, which officials stated was a deliberate attempt to launder the stolen funds and evade detection. Officials estimate the scam laundered over NT$2.3 billion ($75 million) between January 2024 and April 2025. Authorities tied NT$1.27 directly to the 1,539 identified victims. Authorities stated that the group misled investors by claiming they were the only exchange approved by Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Committee. This claim helped attract significant investor deposits. Sentencing Requests The Shilin District Prosecutor’s Office indicted Shih and 13 other individuals on charges related to fraud, money laundering, providing unregistered virtual asset services, and organizing a criminal enterprise under Taiwan’s Organized Crime Prevention Act. Authorities have requested a 25-year sentence for Shih, highlighting his refusal to plead guilty to the charges and his lack of remorse. Defendants who confessed or have promised to return illicit gains could face a reduced sentence. Prosecutors have also confiscated the seized digital assets and asked the court for the forfeiture of NT$1.275 billion in criminal proceeds.

Investors were braced for a hawkish stance but were surprised after Powell suggested interest rate cuts could be coming soon. The speech breathed new life into BTC , with the flagship cryptocurrency surging past $116,000 from a low of $111,678. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 2%, trading around $115,579. Bitcoin (BTC) Surges After Powell Speech Bitcoin and crypto investors heaved a sigh of relief after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole on Friday. Powell hinted at the possibility of a rate cut as early as next month, boosting market sentiment. As a result, BTC , which was trading below $112,000, surged to reclaim $115,000 and move to its current level of $115,600, up over 2% in the past 24 hours. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates steady throughout the year, citing a strong jobs market and concerns about inflation fueled by President Trump’s tariff policies. However, the Jackson Hole speech indicated that Powell could be receptive to easing interest rates. Powell stated in his speech on Friday morning, “Overall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. The shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee called Jerome Powell’s speech “dovish as can be expected.” The crypto market spent all week sweating about Powell’s speech, as traders positioned themselves for a hawkish tone, selling their BTC in anticipation of a decline. However, the prospect of lower interest rates brought momentum back to the flagship cryptocurrency. Analysts now expect the Federal Reserve to lower its target rate in September. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a stunning recovery after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech. The flagship cryptocurrency was trading below $112,000 on Friday but rebounded after the speech, surging nearly 4% to reclaim $116,000 and settle at $116,908 after reaching an intraday high of $117,416. The jump has allowed BTC to recoup almost all of the losses made during the week, with analysts stating the latest bounce could revive bullish momentum. The jump past $117,000 triggered liquidations, taking out ask liquidity above this level. According to data from CoinGlass, $379.88 million in short positions were liquidated, with Ethereum (ETH) accounting for $193 million and BTC accounting for $56.4 million. Over $629 million was wiped out across the board in short and long positions. 150,217 traders were liquidated thanks to the sudden market recovery, which caught investors completely off guard. According to Michaen van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, BTC’s drop below $112,000 provided traders with a good opportunity to enter the market. Van de Poppe had told his followers to look out for a sweep beneath the August 3 low as a good area to accumulate. “A small sweep took place and an immediate massive move upward on #Bitcoin. Uptrend is back.” Another analyst stated that Bitcoin’s price could retrace following today’s pump, but could see higher prices. “Likely retrace the pump for a reasonable percentage - but the intent is clear. This market wants higher.” BTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $116,683. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline to $116,492. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309. BTC reached an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. Despite the positive start, it lost momentum and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to cross $123,000 and settle at $123,365. Despite the positive sentiment, the price tanked on Thursday, dropping over 4% to a low of $117,208 before settling at $118,389. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Friday as BTC fell 0.80% to $117,436. Price action was positive over the weekend as BTC registered marginal increases on Saturday and Sunday, settling at $117,488. The price was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.02% to $116,286. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell almost 3% and settled at $112,856. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising 1.26% to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,276.

Price moved clearly above $4,600, confirming that the bullish trend would continue after it regained support in its rising channel. The breakout candle had more volume, which means that buyers were really participating. Ethereum is now trading above important support levels between $4,600 and $4,650. Resistance levels above that are at $4,850 and then $5,000. It is very important to hold the current level, because if you don’t, the breakout zone near $4,450 could be tested again.

Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) continue to attract attention, with Polkadot launching its Polkadot Capital Group to bring Wall Street into DeFi, while Avalanche faces short-term bearish momentum. Yet, amid this volatility, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a practical alternative, combining real-world adoption, cross-border payment solutions, and growth-oriented infrastructure. Polkadot moves into institutional finance Polkadot price is currently $3.779. Known as the “blockchain of blockchains,” DOT aims to leverage interoperability and technical rigor to attract institutional investors. The recently unveiled Polkadot Capital Group provides banks, asset managers, and OTC desks with compliance resources, staking solutions, and educational programs. By tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) and providing access to Polkadot-native DeFi protocols, the network hopes to bridge TradFi and Web3. Analysts suggest institutional involvement could strengthen DOT’s ecosystem, but market success depends on navigating compliance challenges, growing liquidity, and proving that blockchain can augment traditional financial infrastructure without friction. Avalanche faces short-term weakness Avalanche price is currently $22, with AVAX slipping below $24 amid bearish derivatives and on-chain data. Funding rates have turned negative, the long-to-short ratio sits at 0.84, and the Taker CVD shows increasing selling pressure. Technical indicators like the 50-day EMA at $22.74, daily RSI at 48, and MACD bearish crossover signal short-term downside risk toward $20.99. However, JPYC’s yen-denominated stablecoin issuance on Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon could improve AVAX adoption and utility in the long term. Traders are cautious, weighing near-term weakness against potential for wider ecosystem integration and stablecoin activity. Remittix: utility-driven growth and PayFi solutions Amid market shifts, Remittix (RTX) presents a compelling alternative for investors seeking real-world utility. Priced at $0.0969, with over 614 million tokens sold and $20.7 million raised, RTX focuses on cross-border payments, DeFi applications, and crypto-to-fiat transfers. The Q3 wallet beta launch and $250,000 giveaway are attracting early adopters and strategic investors. Key features include: Global Reach: Transfer crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Security First: Audited by CertiK for transparency and trust Cross-Border Payments: Supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies Built for Adoption: Ideal for freelancers, businesses, and global earners These functional use cases position Remittix to complement speculative assets like DOT and AVAX, providing investors exposure to a PayFi ecosystem with adoption-ready infrastructure. Conclusion As Polkadot and Avalanche navigate institutional ambitions and short-term market pressures, Remittix stands out as a practical choice for investors seeking diversified exposure. Combining real-world utility, strategic tokenomics, and adoption-focused infrastructure, RTX could capture significant market share in Q4. Savvy traders may consider allocating capital to Remittix while monitoring DOT’s institutional developments and AVAX’s recovery potential, balancing speculative opportunities with tangible functional growth in the evolving crypto landscape.

This move is viewed as another major milestone for Ripple’s native coin, making it to the mainstream in U.S. markets. According to the filing, the ETF is structured as a Delaware statutory trust and aims to directly track the price of XRP using the CoinDesk XRP CCIXber 60m New York Rate as its benchmark. Unlike futures-based products, the fund will hold XRP directly, with custody services managed by a designated trust company. If approved, shares will trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange , allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to manage wallets or interact with crypto exchanges. The Canary Capital ETF filing is intended to provide easier access to XRP and more transparency than the derivatives-based ETFs. Its design is similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs already out there, but centered around Ripple’s token instead. Canary Capital advances despite SEC delays Towering over previous SEC delays, Canary Capital has moved ahead with its plans, becoming one of an increasing list of past issuers who are speculating investor interest in a crypto-backed exchange-traded product. The filing also lists some of the main risks , including the fact that the trust is not subject to registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so investors won’t get the same shield as mutual fund shareholders. Additionally, exchange shutdowns or custody breaches could expose investors to significant losses. That said, sentiment around XRP has improved after a U.S. appeals court threw out parts of the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which has emboldened confidence in the token’s regulatory outlook. SEC’s final decision to shape XRP’s path into regulated ETFs On related developments, asset managers Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin, 21Shares, and WisdomTree also filed amendments for their proposed spot exchange-traded funds, signaling that they are eager to get the SEC’s approval to list. Several analysts see this step as a sign that asset managers are responding to feedback from the regulatory agency. The SEC has yet to approve a spot XRP ETF, though both spot and futures-based funds have been proposed. “[The filings were] almost certainly due to feedback from the SEC,” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X. “Good sign, but also mostly expected.” The amendments filings seem to alter the structure of some of the funds to allow for XRP or cash creations and cash or in-kind redemptions, instead of simply cash creations and redemptions. While BlackRock operates the world’s largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the asset manager has not sought approval for an XRP product. Earlier this month, BlackRock said it has no current plans to launch an XRP fund. The final response by the SEC will decide if XRP stands to be one of the digital assets that can be offered through regulated ETFs. During Friday’s market-wide rally, XRP climbed 7%, trading at $3.08. XRP, which has often reacted sharply to developments in its ongoing case with the SEC, rallied strongly once the news broke. Its upswing also aligned with the broader market rebound after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential interest rate cuts. Even so, XRP has gained over 10% from its multi-week low of just under $2.80 earlier today and is now trading near $3.o5. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The leading cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high near $124,000, only to tumble below the $115,000 level within days. This swift reversal highlighted the fragility of momentum in overheated conditions but also underscored the market’s ability to rebound when macroeconomic catalysts emerge. The turning point came during Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole, where a key statement triggered an immediate market reaction. Powell hinted at a potential shift in policy stance, suggesting that restrictive conditions could soon be adjusted. Within minutes, risk assets, including Bitcoin, surged as liquidity poured back into markets, sparking renewed optimism across the crypto space. Following the speech, Bitcoin regained strength, climbing back above the $115K support zone. This recovery has reignited bullish sentiment, with traders eyeing the next resistance levels that could decide the short-term trajectory. The broader crypto market followed suit, with altcoins showing renewed momentum as investors reallocated capital. Bitcoin Futures React To Powell’s Jackson Hole Speech According to top analyst Darkfost, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole acted as a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin futures markets. In his remarks, Powell stated that “with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” This subtle yet impactful statement hinted at a potential easing of the Fed’s monetary policy, immediately sparking a surge of optimism across global markets. The reaction in crypto was swift and decisive. Within just 15 minutes of Powell’s speech, over $300 million in fresh liquidity flooded into Binance’s Bitcoin futures market. This sudden inflow pushed Binance BTC Open Interest to approximately $13.3 billion, underscoring how sensitive the crypto derivatives market remains to macroeconomic cues. Darkfost noted that this surge highlights the market-moving power of central bank communications, especially in an environment where liquidity conditions play a defining role in speculative demand. Bitcoin’s sharp reaction mirrored broader risk-on sentiment, as traders positioned themselves for the possibility of looser monetary conditions that would favor higher-yielding and alternative assets like BTC. The event also reaffirmed the volatility of Bitcoin futures, where shifts in Open Interest can rapidly amplify price moves. In this case, the spike in demand aligned with BTC reclaiming key support zones, reinforcing bullish sentiment across the market. BTC Testing Critical Resistance The 4-hour chart for Bitcoin shows strong volatility following Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks, with BTC rebounding sharply from lows near $112K to $116.5K. This sudden spike highlights how macroeconomic catalysts can trigger liquidity inflows within minutes. The bounce aligns with the reclaim of the 200-period SMA (red line), which now sits just under current price and acts as critical short-term support. Despite the rally, BTC remains below its recent $123,217 resistance, a level that has capped price twice this cycle. The mid-term structure still suggests consolidation, with the 50-SMA (blue) and 100-SMA (green) converging around $116K–$117K, creating a decision zone for bulls and bears. Sustaining above this area could open the path for another retest of the highs, while failure to hold risks a deeper pullback toward the $112K region. Momentum indicators suggest buyers are attempting to regain control, but price action is not yet showing a clean breakout. For bulls, defending $115K–$116K is key to maintaining the bullish structure. Bears, however, will look for rejection below the SMAs to reinforce downside pressure.

In terms of USD value, this stash is worth over $160 million at today’s prices. Cardano’s native token had followed the rest of the market in the past several days and had plunged to $0.82 on Friday. This was its lowest price tag since August 12, when the asset went on a roll that drove it from $0.78 to $1. However, Powell’s speech was met with tremendous enthusiasm by investors, as evidenced by all financial markets’ moves yesterday. The crypto industry was no exception, as the total market cap jumped from under $3.9 to over $4.1 trillion in hours. ADA was among the top performers during this substantial rise, rising from its daily low of $0.82 to a local peak of $0.94 before it slightly corrected to the current $0.91. ADAUSD. Source: TradingView Several crypto analysts have outlined bullish trajectories for ADA. However, it needs to overcome certain resistance levels before it is able to unlock future gains.

It has dropped seven percent in twenty-four hours. This decrease is happening despite its weakening correlation with Bitcoin. Technical indicators are now signaling more potential losses ahead. Consequently, many Cardano traders are actively seeking better opportunities elsewhere. They are discovering immense potential in a new decentralized finance project. This project is named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Its ongoing presale is attracting significant attention and capital. Investors are eagerly participating in its sixth phase. Cardano’s current market challenges Cardano is facing considerable selling pressure right now. Its price has fallen to $0.85. This makes it one of the day’s worst-performing altcoins. A key bearish crossover on its MACD indicator is also forming. This technical development suggests further downward momentum is likely. Moreover, its correlation with Bitcoin has dramatically fallen to 0.51. This decoupling means ADA is not benefiting from any Bitcoin rallies. These crypto prices are causing concern among its holder base. Therefore, numerous investors are reallocating their funds into promising new projects. They are looking for superior returns in a competitive crypto market. Mutuum Finance presale achieves remarkable success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently conducting its Phase 6 presale. The token price is now $0.035. This represents a massive 250 percent increase from its initial offering. Demand has been extraordinary since the event began. The project has successfully raised over $14,750,000 so far. Furthermore, a thriving community of 15,550 token holders has already formed. Phase 6 is currently underway and selling out fast. Consequently, the chance to acquire tokens at this price is quickly ending. The subsequent phase will introduce a 14.3 percent price hike. This will increase the cost to $0.04 per token. Early participants are therefore positioning themselves for substantial gains. They anticipate a launch price of $0.06, ensuring impressive profits. Comprehensive security and active incentives Mutuum Finance prioritizes security and community trust above all. The team has successfully finalized its Certik audit. This examination yielded an exceptional 95.00 security score. It confirmed the project’s solid security posture. No vulnerabilities were discovered in the smart contract. Furthermore, no security incidents have occurred in the past ninety days. Mutuum Finance has also launched an official Bug Bounty Program. This initiative partners with CertiK and offers $50,000 USDT in rewards. The program covers four distinct tiers of vulnerability severity. Additionally, the project is hosting a monumental $100,000 MUTM giveaway . Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 in tokens. Participation requires a minimum $50 presale investment. This approach effectively rewards early supporters and enhances engagement. A strategic investment for forward-thinking traders Mutuum Finance presents a compelling case for crypto investment. Its innovative DeFi lending model operates on a Layer-2 network. This ensures lower fees and faster transactions for all users. The protocol supports both peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending. This dual system accommodates various risk appetites and strategies. The team has also launched a new dashboard feature. It includes a leaderboard ranking the top fifty holders. These individuals will receive bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. This incentivizes long-term holding and strengthens price stability. Final words For Cardano traders facing uncertainty, Mutuum Finance offers a refreshing alternative. Its strong fundamentals and rapid presale progress make it one of the best cryptos to buy now. Mutuum Finance represents a high-utility DeFi protocol with real growth potential. Its successful audit and generous giveaway build immense confidence. The current presale phase offers a final opportunity at a discounted rate. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now should strongly consider MUTM.

Among these systems is Grok, the AI platform backed by Elon Musk through xAI, which has been actively generating predictions across various digital assets. In the case of XRP, Grok has weighed in on where it expects the token’s price to stand on September 1, 2025, offering a projection that adds to the debate among traders and analysts. Grok’s Price Prediction for XRP According to Grok, XRP is expected to trade at $3.25 on September 1, 2025. The system described this as a balanced projection that accounts for XRP’s current consolidation around the $3 level and the potential for modest gains in the weeks ahead. In Grok’s own words, the forecast reflects “a moderate but steady upward movement, aligning with broader market sentiment while staying within historically supported resistance ranges.” This positions XRP within a cautiously optimistic range, suggesting stability rather than extreme volatility. By situating its prediction around the $3.25 level, Grok acknowledges both upside potential and the limiting factors in the current market environment. While some analysts have issued forecasts that envision XRP reaching $5, $10, or higher before the end of 2025, Grok’s output highlights a more conservative outcome. Macroeconomic Shifts Support the Outlook Broader macroeconomic factors have also started to align with this outlook. According to a Times Tabloid report , speaking at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that changing economic conditions may warrant interest rate reductions in the coming months, especially if signs of weakness in the labor market persist. His comments represented a notable change from the Fed’s previously guarded approach. Investors read the remarks as dovish, which fueled gains across equities, bonds, and risk-oriented assets such as cryptocurrencies. If the central bank follows through on this approach, liquidity conditions could provide a more favorable environment for assets such as XRP, supporting Grok’s prediction of a steady upward trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Cautious Yet Bullish Perspective The context of this forecast is important because XRP has been one of the most closely monitored assets in the digital asset sector, particularly following years of regulatory scrutiny and legal disputes. With the legal uncertainty now resolved , the token has regained momentum, supported by both institutional interest and boosted use cases. Other factors that could support higher valuations include Ripple’s stablecoin developments, deeper integration with global payment corridors, and a continuation of the broader cryptocurrency bull market. In summary, Grok projects XRP to be valued at $3.25 on September 1, 2025, placing it slightly above current levels but short of the more aggressive targets circulating in the market.

This outlook is based on analysis by pseudonymous crypto expert Master Ananda , who noted in an August 22 TradingView post that XRP established its main low during the week of July 28 and has since formed a higher low, signaling renewed strength. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Price action has currently stalled at the 13-day exponential moving average ( EMA ), where selling pressure was quickly absorbed, leading to a full recovery of losses within hours, a bullish development. According to Ananda , this rapid rebound indicates room for continued upside, with the retracement phase now appearing to be over. At the same time, the recent pullback that culminated in a drop below $3, has lasted five weeks since the July 14 peak, aligning with a standard retracement period before the continuation of the main trend. With support confirmed, Ananda projects that XRP is likely to resume its upward trajectory. The first price target stands at $4.44, with the primary short- to mid-term objective set at $6.28. XRP price fundamentals Beyond technicals, XRP is also supported by fundamentals that could trigger a rally. Most notably, following the conclusion of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against Ripple, attention has shifted to the potential approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). To this end, on August 22, a wave of asset managers, including Canary, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Grayscale, and Bitwise, submitted amended registration statements for proposed XRP ETFs. The move came after a federal appeals court formally dismissed the SEC’s case against Ripple, clearing the way for issuers to act quickly. Bloomberg Intelligence now estimates approval odds for XRP ETFs at 95%. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $3.03, up more than 7% in the past 24 hours, though down 3% on the weekly chart. XRP seven-day price chart.

The agencies claimed they wanted to encourage more equitable competition and promote openness in the digital economy. Per their joint announcement, the draft regulations are intended to plug regulatory gaps in internet pricing, especially in price presentation, algorithm-driven adjustments, and dynamic promotions. The draft calls on platforms to disclose fee charges, promotions, and subsidies clearly The NDRC said the draft rules would ban online platforms from using unfair methods such as reducing store traffic or pulling products off shelves to squeeze the merchants’ pricing autonomy. It added that the regulation also sets behavior, accountability, and data use standards while encouraging cooperation among regulators, industry organizations, and platform operators. According to the draft, without consumer knowledge, platforms may not use big-data profiling to alter prices or fees for the same product or service under identical conditions—based on factors like consumers’ willingness or ability to pay, preferences, or habits. Market platforms would also need to display prices and be more transparent on promotions, subsidies, price discrimination, variable quotas, and ranking systems. Per the commission, all these rules would promote fair competition. It affirmed, “The platform economy involves many operators whose pricing behavior directly affects consumers. Refining these rules will help ensure orderly, fair competition and protect the rights of both businesses and consumers.” So far, the agency has also invited public comments on the proposal for a month. China’s top regulator also proposed new rules in May Vendors have long complained that leading platforms distorted prices to encourage sales, and consumers have raised issues about misleading pricing tactics. Alibaba, for example, was slapped with a record $2.75 billion fine in 2021 over antitrust violations, which the enterprise accepted. Nonetheless, major e-commerce firms have since dismissed regulatory threats while intensifying competition in “instant retail.” A few months ago, China’s top market regulator had proposed new rules to standardize commission fees on e-commerce platforms , promoting fairness and transparency. The announcement even prompted a decline in Meituan’s share price. The Chinese government also ended the practice of e-commerce platforms enforcing customer refunds on behalf of buyers, as reported earlier by Cryptopolitan . Now only merchants will have the authority to initiate refunds, giving them greater control over transactions. Previously, platforms could process refunds without merchant approval, allowing customers to receive reimbursements without returning goods. This approach, which began in 2021 with PDD Holdings leading the way, was intended to improve customer satisfaction and streamline disputes. However, the policy resulted in significant financial losses for merchants, who often lost both their products and revenue. The newly announced guideline, titled Compliance Guide for Online Trading Platform Fees, was posted on the State Administration for Market Regulation’s website, to which the watchdog claimed it covered all internet platforms that provided online storefronts, facilitated deals, shared information, and delivered services. It further noted that the proposals would lessen the burdens on vendors and boost small and medium-sized businesses. Per the draft, platforms would have to shoulder social responsibility during natural disasters or public health crises by cutting or waiving commissions and reducing other fees. It also called on platforms to set fair pricing structures grounded in factors such as operating costs, contractual agreements, transaction norms, consumer habits, and similar considerations. Furthermore, it stated that platforms should reinforce pre-compliance review structures to ensure charges remain fair.

The financial markets, including crypto, quickly picked up his words as promises that there would be an interest rate cut as soon as September. Polymarket Agrees Given its success rate of over 90% in the past, Polymarket has become among the most reputable websites for different types of bets, including interest rate cuts. The odds for such reductions to be made as soon as September shot up in early August from 35% to almost 80% following some positive reports about the state of the US economy. However, they started to decline in the following weeks, especially after the hotter-than-expected PPI data from last week. The culmination was yesterday, when the odds plunged to 57% ahead of the highly anticipated speech by the Fed Chair from Jackson Hole. Fed Rate Cut Odds for September Although he failed to provide any precise details on when a rate cut will occur, he offered mild hints about a potential pivot in the central bank’s monetary policy. All financial markets reacted immediately. Crypto didn’t disappoint as ETH and BNB skyrocketed to new all-time highs, while BTC rose from under $112,000 to over $117,000 before correcting slightly. The focus is now on next month’s FOMC meeting, which will reveal whether Powell indeed intends to implement a rate cut, a move that US President Donald Trump has urged for months. The odds on Polymarket are in favor of such a rate reduction, as they jumped to 78% for a 25 bps cut. Impact of Powell’s Speech CryptoPotato spoke with Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, about the impact of Powell’s comments and what investors can expect now. “While he opened the door to potential rate cuts, his emphasis on tariff-driven inflation and careful evaluation suggests the Fed won’t rush into aggressive easing. This measured approach creates an interesting dynamic for risk assets like Ethereum.” ETH has indeed performed better than BTC in the hours after the meeting, which could be a first sign of what is to follow. Bitcoin has already tapped new all-time highs several times this year, while Ethereum just managed to do so yesterday. Consequently, Kazmierczak seemed more bullish on the second-largest digital asset. “Looking ahead, if the Fed does initiate a modest easing cycle while maintaining its data-dependent approach, this could provide the final catalyst for ETH to break through the $4,800-$5,000 resistance zone and establish new all-time highs.” However, Kazmierczak also cautioned that Powell’s “careful tone” could indicate that any rally will need to be “supported by continued fundamental adoption rather than purely monetary policy speculation.” The post September Rate Cut Odds Surge After Powell, What’s Next for BTC and ETH? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Federal Reserve|Jerome Powell,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-08-23 11:18:01

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.035 in stage 6 of presale. Investors in the project are set to enjoy at least 400% ROI as MUTM starts trading in the market. Mutuum Finance has reached $14.75 million raised and more than 15550 token purchasers. Mutuum Finance is set to benefit from Ethereum’s bull rally, which can make way for strong market movement. PEPE Coin: Holding Steady Amid Market Shifts PEPE is presently trading at $0.00001068, a 4.92% increase over the past 24 hours. Despite this gain, the token has fallen 12.90% over the past week. PEPE is now ranked 30 by market capitalization, with a market cap of approximately $4.5 billion and a circulating supply of approximately 420 trillion tokens. The price action in recent times is partly attributable to PEPE’s bullish reversal, which has attracted new liquidity and community interest. Some analysts caution, however, that PEPE’s price may be exposed to downward pressure in the near future, with some estimates pointing to a push lower to $0.000008 by August 25, 2025. In the broader market, the resurgence of Ethereum (ETH) has served to spark renewed interest in a whole host of altcoins, including PEPE. Newer projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining prominence in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale in 2025 has been a massive success.

The agency mentioned that victims who would love to help them in the ongoing investigations of some suspects should report to its Ibadan and Lagos 2 Zonal Directorates. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the EFCC got the approval from the federal high court in Abuja to arrest and retain six promoters associated with the CBEX investment platform in April. According to the application, six people, including Adefowora Olanipekun, Adefowora Oluwanisola, Emmanuel Uko, Seyi Oloyede, Avwerosuo Otorudo, and Chukwuebuka Ehirim, were all being held responsible for over $1 billion worth of investment fraud. EFCC urges CBEX victims to assist with investigations In its statement , the EFCC says it prefers input from individuals who dealt directly with some of the detained promoters at the CBEX offices in Ibadan. The victims were asked to visit the EFCC. The agency made the call in a statement that it shared on its official X handle on Friday, with the detailed statement signed by the EFCC Head, Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale. The EFCC claimed that CBEX led to serious financial losses for Nigerians who invested their life savings under the promises of unrealistic returns on investments. The agency had previously mentioned that the individuals detained had used their company to promote the scam by creating ads and misleading the general public. According to the EFCC, the defendants promised the victims unrealistic returns on up to 100% of their investments in several advertisements they made. Court documents showed that victims initially had access to their investment page on the platforms to keep an eye on their investments and potential rewards. However, things started to go from bad to worse after they realized they could no longer access the CBEX website or get back their funds from the investments they made on the platform. Suspects plead not guilty in court EFCC mentioned that out of the initial six suspects it detained, it is currently prosecuting three, Adefowora Abiodun Olanipekun, Otorudo Avwerosuo, and Justice Ehirim Chukwuebuka, for their “alleged involvement in the fraudulent online cryptocurrency trading platform called CBEX.” Court documents showed that Otorudo and Ehirim were arraigned by the EFCC before Judge Mohammed Umar of the Federal High Court in Abuja on July 7. Several reports showed that the pair were eventually granted bail for 10 million naira each, with two sureties in like sum. Documents also showed that Olaonipekun, alongside his company ST Technologies International Limited, was also arraigned in the same court on July 18. In one of the charges read before the court, the EFCC alleged that between January 2024 and May 2025, the defendants urged members of the public to deposit money for a fixed term or payable on call through CBEX. They promised up to 88% return on investment without obtaining written consent from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the EFCC, the group allegedly violated Section 1 of the Investment and Securities Act, 2025, and is punishable under Section 96(5) of the same Act. The suspects pleaded not guilty to the offenses. However, the EFCC wants victims who invested funds directly in the scheme to come forward to assist the commission in its investigations, which will likely see them serve as witnesses to prove that the suspects invited the general public to invest in CBEX via their ads.

The move comes as bulls regained full control of the market following a remarkable 14% surge on Friday, marking one of the strongest single-day performances of the year. Related Reading: TRON Spot Market Signals Relief – Seller Dominance Weakens After Cycle High The rally was ignited by remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium. In his speech, Powell hinted at a potential easing of US monetary policy, stating that restrictive conditions may no longer be appropriate as risks shift. The market reaction was immediate: within minutes, both equities and cryptocurrencies spiked sharply, with Ethereum leading the charge in the altcoin sector. At the same time, derivatives market data confirms the intensity of the move. Open Interest (OI) surged aggressively as traders piled into leveraged positions, reflecting renewed speculative appetite. The sudden influx of liquidity added fuel to Ethereum’s rally, pushing price momentum beyond its multi-year resistance level. With ETH now in uncharted territory, analysts see potential for continuation as long as OI expansion does not overheat into excessive leverage. The coming weeks will determine whether this breakout sustains or turns into another volatile correction. Ethereum Derivatives Signal Historic Momentum Ethereum’s breakout into new highs is being reinforced by extraordinary action in the derivatives market. According to top analyst Maartunn, at least $3.18 billion in new positions have entered Ethereum derivatives within just 24 hours, pushing Open Interest (OI) up nearly 10%. He described this as “insane stuff,” highlighting the scale and speed at which traders are positioning for the next move. This surge in OI indicates aggressive speculation, with investors betting on Ethereum’s momentum continuing after breaching its 2021 all-time high. While higher OI often fuels rallies by injecting liquidity, it can also create sharp volatility if leveraged positions unwind. Still, the magnitude of the inflows reflects growing conviction in ETH’s upside potential. At the same time, Ethereum’s Taker Buy Volume (hourly) has reached a multi-month high of $5.76 billion. This metric, which captures aggressive market buy orders, shows that demand is not just speculative but also immediate. Such strong taker-side activity often coincides with breakout phases, when bulls dominate both spot and derivatives markets.

Price Surges To Retest New Highs The 4-hour ETH chart shows Ethereum exploding higher, pushing above $4,800 after a sharp breakout from recent consolidation. This surge follows a bounce near the 100-period SMA (green line around $4,298), where bulls defended support aggressively before sending the price into a vertical move. Ethereum is now retesting its previous all-time high region around $4,860, with momentum signaling strong buying pressure. The 50-period SMA (blue line) is turning upward again, confirming a short-term bullish structure. Meanwhile, the 200-period SMA (red line around $3,994) remains comfortably below the price, showing the broader uptrend is intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Transfers Collapse: Lowest Since Bull Market Peak In 2021 This rally also broke through a series of lower highs formed during the recent pullback, suggesting that bearish control has faded. Volume spikes during the breakout add confidence to the strength of this move. If bulls sustain momentum, Ethereum could enter price discovery, targeting the $5,000 psychological level. However, if rejection occurs at $4,860, ETH may retest the $4,400–$4,500 support zone, where the moving averages converge. The chart highlights a critical phase: Ethereum either continues its breakout toward new highs or consolidates before another attempt. Bulls clearly hold the upper hand after this explosive breakout.

The stage is set.,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/08/23/genius-was-just-the-prologue-stablecoins-represent-a-platform-shift-in-payments-the-stage-is-set,"Every era of economic transformation has begun the same way: with infrastructure that seems niche – until it isn’t. Early irrigation systems unlocked the first cities. Early railroad networks rewired entire economies. The internet’s core protocols, TCP/IP, turned slow and siloed information networks into a single, global system of communication. And the Cloud turned idle servers into the foundation of the digital economy. We don’t remember them for how they started. We remember them for how they scaled. Because in effect, what once looked like niche experiments became the backbone of global markets. Stablecoins are next. Welcome to the age of the stablecoin layer: an open, programmable foundation for global money movement. Just last year, stablecoins lacked clear regulation and were dismissed by much of the financial establishment. Fast forward a matter of months, and the U.S. Congress has passed the GENIUS Act, creating the country’s first federal framework for stablecoins and defining them explicitly as payment instruments. Major banks and card networks have entered this space. Early-movers like Circle have made their Wall Street debut. And fintech leaders from Stripe to Shopify are embracing stablecoins to power faster, cheaper, always-on transactions. These aren’t isolated milestones. They’re early signs that stablecoins are on track to become core infrastructure, just like AWS became the quiet engine of the cloud economy. Stablecoins represent a platform shift in payments. Just like prior platform shifts – mainframe computing to individual computers, desktop to mobile, and on-premises to cloud-based infrastructure – stablecoins will unlock a wave of innovation by modernizing financial infrastructure. This is the tipping point, but it’s also only the beginning, and too many people are still thinking far too small. To many, dollars are still shackled to outdated infrastructure like wire transfers and ACH. None of it is built for composability, automation, or machine-to-machine interaction as is required in the modern age. It’s a slow-motion relic holding back an interconnected, global economy that wants to move faster and include more people. Until we modernize the rails, we’re capping the true velocity of money – and with it, global economic potential. Stablecoins snap that bind. No bank holidays, no middlemen, no concept of business days or hours. Just global, cheap, and instantaneous settlement at scales of billions of dollars at a time. That transformation is as fundamental as turning mail into email. Stablecoins offer what legacy financial infrastructure simply can’t: instant settlement, borderless reach, low costs, and programmable design. They will disrupt more than any other crypto building block – rewriting payments, liquifying capital markets, and bringing the internet’s speed and interoperability to money itself. This shift goes well beyond payments between people. Stablecoins will also underpin the next phase of AI-native commerce as sovereign AI agents abandon legacy fiat systems in favor of decentralized money that flows freely across blockchain infrastructure. This will power automated treasury flows, agentic commerce, machine-to-machine transactions, and sovereign AI agent transactions. Money is getting an upgrade. The stablecoin layer isn’t just a new system, it’s a new substrate for the global economy. The velocity of money movement is positively correlated with economic growth. Stablecoins will unlock trillions in latent economic activity and help grow global GDP by full percentage points each year. And all of this activity will be AI-native. Yet for all the progress, the opportunity is still in its infancy. The GENIUS Act was a critical milestone, but it’s still one piece of legislation. And while the stablecoin market cap sits at over $280 billion today, the U.S. M2 money supply – the total amount of money circulating within the US economy – exceeds $20 trillion. That’s nearly a 100:1 gap. We’re still underselling how fast and forceful the shift to the stablecoin standard will be, and how quickly AI will accelerate it. Put simply, this summer marked only the soft launch of the stablecoin era. The infrastructure is in place, and the scale of what’s coming far exceeds the conversation today. This shift won’t be loud, and that’s by design. In a few years, no one will say they’re “using stablecoins,” just like nobody says they’re “using cloud computing” to store pictures of their kids. They’ll just use money. And stablecoins will be the infrastructure powering it all behind the scenes, moving billions across the globe in real time. The biggest winners in this transition will be the platforms operating behind the scenes: those who power the rails, provide liquidity, and earn our trust. Fintechs will use stablecoins for instant settlement and global reach. Governments – eventually, reluctantly – will integrate stablecoins into critical economic functions. AI agents will speak the language of stablecoins natively. This isn’t a bet on crypto hype. It’s a recognition that our financial system needs an upgrade, and stablecoins are the gateway. They’re not just a better form of money; they’re the onramp to the onchain economy. Once users hold stablecoins, they’re one step away from accessing a global, open, and programmable financial system. That’s why the stablecoin layer isn’t just the most important sector in crypto – it’s the foundation for the future of digital currency.",Opinion|Coinbase|US Congress|Stablecoin|Opinion,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-23 11:38:30

Wang described the deal as a “technical collaboration between our research teams,” signaling work that goes beyond simply enabling Midjourney inside Meta’s apps. The announcement arrives as Meta pours resources into what it calls AI “superintelligence” in an effort to keep pace with OpenAI and Google. Zuckerberg has offered big pay packages to recruit researchers. Wang joined after Meta paid $14.3 billion for 49% of Scale AI, the company he co-founded. The deal supports Meta’s plan to add AI images across its apps. Meta AI shows a feed of AI images and videos, Facebook has a “create AI image” button, and WhatsApp and Instagram let you make images in chats. Midjourney became prominent for its image and video generators. As the tech company expands the Meta AI app’s social feed, it may lean on Midjourney’s approach to help users produce more polished visuals. “We are incredibly impressed by Midjourney,” Wang said . “They have accomplished true feats of technical and aesthetic excellence, and we are thrilled to be working more closely with them.” He said both companies will share more “soon.” Even with the collaboration, Midjourney remains “an independent, community-backed research lab” with “no investors,” founder and CEO David Holz said. Meta brings in another Apple AI expert amid hiring freeze According to people with knowledge of the situation, the company is bringing aboard another senior Apple AI leader after Cryptopolitan reported that the company prepares to slow hiring . Frank Chu, who has led Apple teams focused on cloud infrastructure, training, and search, will join Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL, the people said. At Apple, Chu helped operate large language models on the company’s cloud servers, oversaw parts of model training, and contributed to search features for Siri and Apple’s entertainment services. Chu is at least the sixth Apple AI-models staffer to head to Meta. The departures began in July, when Ruoming Pang, who created Apple’s models team, left for a $200 million package at Meta. Since then, AI engineers Tom Gunter, Mark Lee, Bowen Zhang, and Yun Zhu have also departed for Meta. Aside from Pang, Chu is the most notable exit given his remit and seniority. He served as a lieutenant to Benoit Dupin, Apple’s executive overseeing AI infrastructure, who reports to John Giannandrea, Apple’s AI strategy chief. Chu is slated to join a new unit called MSL Infra responsible for AI infrastructure at Meta. Earlier this week, Meta reorganized its AI organization into four groups, all reporting to Wang. Meta’s AI talent raid undermines Apple’s efforts In a memo to hiring managers, the company wrote the pause “will allow leadership to thoughtfully plan our 2026 headcount growth, as we work through our strategy.” The memo also said, “Alex’s staff will evaluate any business critical hires on a case by case basis.” Wang, however, said in a social media pos t Th ursday that Meta is “investing more and more into Meta Superintelligence Labs.” For Apple, the departures add turbulence to an AI push already trying to make up ground. The company has delayed a high-profile Siri update. Following a leadership shake-up , Apple is weighing the use of third-party AI models for the voice assistant instead of relying solely on its own technology. That shift, together with Pang’s exit, unsettled Apple’s AI models team and accelerated the talent drain.

Experts Say Layer Brett Today Is Like Buying DOGE in 2014,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-presale-right-now-experts-say-layer-brett-today-is-like-buying-doge-in-2014/,"The best crypto to buy now is a hot debate, especially with the surge of meme coins and Layer 2 solutions. The current crypto presale for Layer Brett offers a unique entry point, reminiscent of buying DOGE during its early days. Unlike older meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk, Layer Brett leverages Ethereum Layer 2 technology for lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low gas fees. While Dogecoin and Brett (original) remain popular, they face scalability and cost limitations. In contrast, Layer Brett’s foundation as a Layer 2 crypto means it processes transactions off-chain, reducing gas fees to pennies and boosting speed. This technological leap gives it an edge over legacy meme tokens like Bonk, which struggles with congestion, and Pepe, known for volatile price swings but lacking real scalability. How $LBRETT rewards early buyers Analysts call Layer Brett the best crypto to buy now because its presale price is just $0.0047 per token. Early adopters can stake their $LBRETT and earn staking rewards of over 2,500% APY, with some rates reported as high as 55,000% for initial participants. This is a massive opportunity compared to established coins like DOGE, Brett (original), or Bonk, where staking rewards are minimal or nonexistent. Key benefits for early $LBRETT buyers: Immediate staking with high APY through the dApp Flexible buy-in using ETH, USDT, or BNB via MetaMask or Trust Wallet Gamified staking and NFT integrations for active ecosystem rewards Transparent tokenomics with only 10 billion total supply What makes Layer Brett different from Brett (original), DOGE, Pepe, and Shiba Inu Unlike Brett (original), which originated on Base without real utility, Layer Brett is engineered for performance and community rewards. Shiba Inu and Pepe have built large followings, but their growth is often driven by hype rather than technological innovation. Bonk has shown high trading volume but remains highly volatile with limited real-world use. Layer Brett combines meme power with true blockchain utility. Its DeFi coin mechanics, transparent tokenomics, and focus on community-driven rewards set it apart. The ongoing $1 million giveaway and active community campaigns further fuel its rapid adoption, something competitors like Dogecoin and Bonk struggle to match. Why the crypto community is getting behind Layer Brett The crypto community is rallying behind Layer Brett for several reasons: Crypto presale access at early-entry pricing with high upside Cutting-edge scalability as a Layer 2 blockchain Staking rewards far exceeding those of Brett (original), DOGE, Bonk, or Pepe Fully decentralized, no KYC, and self-custodial ethos Transparent roadmap with NFT and DeFi integrations on the horizon Buzzwords like next big crypto, top meme coin, and best meme coins are already being used to describe Layer Brett. Its blend of meme culture and real utility positions it as a frontrunner for the crypto bull run 2025. Conclusion: Don’t miss the best crypto to buy now Layer Brett is still in presale, but not for long. With a smaller market cap than Dogecoin, Bonk, or Brett (original), the upside potential is enormous. Early investors can lock in massive APY by staking immediately and join a community primed for explosive growth. Don’t wait—secure your spot in the most scalable, rewarding, and community-driven memecoin project to launch on Ethereum Layer 2. Visit the official website to buy at $0.0047 and stake $LBRETT today.

Bitcoin is hovering at $116,000, while tokens like Pudgy Penguin, Arbitrum, and AAVE are leading with over 15% gains. Crypto market rally sparked by Jerome Powell speech The ongoing crypto market rally was sparked by Jerome Powell who had a closely-watched speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming on Friday. This speech came at a difficult time for the US economy, with data showing that it is teetering on the verge of a stagflation. The labor market has cooled, with the unemployment rate ticking upward, reaching 4.2% in July. The BLS downgraded the previous month’s two reports and indicated that the economy created just 35k jobs in June and May. It added 73k jobs in July, a figure that will come down in the next revision. US inflation, especially in the producer side, is also ticking upwards and recently jumped to 3.7%. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, rose to 3.1%. S a result, faced with these numbers, the central bank has a choice to make. It can cut interest rates with the goal of boosting the labor market, a move that would risk inflation rising. On the other hand, the bank can decide to maintain higher rates and hope that inflation will come down. The challenge is that this inflation is not organic, rather, it is an artificial one caused by Donald Trump’s tariffs. In his statement, Powell leaned on the former side and noted that his focus in the next meetings will be to safeguard the labor market. He said: “Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.” Crypto sentiment was weak before his speech The crypto market rally happened as investors now believe that the Fed will cut interest rates in the September 17 meeting. Cryptocurrencies and other risky assets do well when the Fed is cutting interest rates. However, there are chances that the crypto market rally would happen even if he had delivered a highly hawkish statement. That is because market participants expect the bank to ultimately cut interest rates either later this year or in 2026 when Trump replaces Jerome Powell. Also, the market sentiment was weak before the speech. Bitcoin was down from the all-time high of $124,200 to a low of $112,000 and Ethereum moving much lower. As such, chances are that market participants would have bought the dip. This is the opposite of buying the rumor and selling the news.

The most likely scenario is where the crypto market continues the ongoing rally. That’s because there are still catalysts that will push it higher in the longer term. In addition to the potential interest rate cuts, there is strong demand from investors as evidenced by the rising ETF inflows and the rising number of crypto treasury companies. Further, top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin have formed bullish chart patterns. Most importantly, the SEC will approve spot crypto ETFs later this year, boosting their prices.

In this article, we will also show you which entities are selling ETH and who is buying. Hint: the US President is involved. ETHUSD. Source: TradingView Has the Time Come? The chart above paints a picture worth a million dollars. It shows how ETH, which was once among the poorest performers in 2025, turned the tables and skyrocketed from under $2,200 marked on June 23 to an all-time high of $4,900 two months later, on August 22. From a percentage perspective, this mindblowing rally represents a 130% surge in roughly 60 days. A lot changed for Ethereum along the way. Investors went wild for its underlying asset, which is evident from the massive inflows in the ETH ETFs as well as the growing number of tokens purchased by many Ethereum treasury companies. But, still, the essential question for ETH investors has popped up – has the time come to sell (at least some portions)? #ETH is up over 100% after one month Now is a good time – Realise BIG profits! Gave you ETH to buy low, and now sell high Many will regret in the next weeks.. https://t.co/f87L1Ov4bi pic.twitter.com/QiXSS9dT1c — Doctor Profit (@DrProfitCrypto) August 23, 2025 Doctor Profit seems to think so. The self-described “elite trader, master of x100” believes ETH investors should realize “BIG” profits. This wouldn’t be a surprise in the crypto market. Recall that profit-taking went through the roof for both XRP and BTC in July and August as the assets charted new all-time highs of their own. Matrixport has apparently adopted Doctor Profit’s approach, as several of the company’s wallets have made substantial deposits into Binance and OKX, with the most likely intention of selling $450 million worth of ETH. Multiple wallets linked to #Matrixport deposited 95,873 $ETH ($452M) into #Binance and #OKX over the past 3 hours. https://t.co/NKiO55cVOy https://t.co/U8AXgsVjSW pic.twitter.com/DFEJatM4LA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 23, 2025 But They Are Buying In contrast to the above is the approach undertaken by this Bitcoin OG , who sold large BTC portions only to buy ETH spot and open long Ethereum positions. The mysterious wallet has only doubled down on their ETH position since yesterday. This Bitcoin OG deposited another 300 $BTC ($34.86M) into Hyperliquid to sell for $ETH an hour ago.

According to Lookonchain, the team spent $5 million USDC to acquire an additional 1,076 ETH. Obviously, the question of whether it’s time to sell is a very personal one and it depends on the investor’s current financial situation and risk appetite.

Imagine setting aside just $10 every week for XRP, starting back in 2013. What might have seemed like spare change then could have turned into life-changing wealth today. As investors revisit these long-term strategies, many are also turning their attention to new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has already raised $12.5 million in record time and is drawing comparisons to the early days of other breakout coins. The Discipline Behind Dollar-Cost Averaging The $10-a-week XRP plan is built on dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Instead of betting on perfect timing, DCA means putting the same amount into the market at regular intervals, no matter the price. This smooths out volatility and removes the stress of trying to guess when to buy. Had someone started in 2013, when XRP traded below a penny, every $10 purchase stacked up thousands of tokens. Even as the price later climbed to $0.05 or $0.10, the strategy kept accumulating large amounts at very low costs. By the time XRP reached its all-time high of $3.84 in early 2018, those cheap buys would have ballooned into an extraordinary fortune. New Early-Stage Opportunity Raising Eyebrows While XRP’s story shows how discipline pays off, today’s investors are searching for the next project with similar upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming that story. With $12.5 million raised almost instantly and multiple rounds selling out, it’s already proving demand is huge. Analysts highlight that early backers are seeing gains before major listings, and history suggests projects with this kind of momentum often reward those who act early. What the Numbers Say Over 12 years, a $10-a-week plan would equal about $6,240 invested. But here’s the catch: much of that money bought XRP when it was under $0.10. At today’s price, just the tokens from those early years alone would already be worth tens of thousands. At the 2025 peak, the total value could have soared into the millions , transforming small weekly contributions into a once-in-a-lifetime windfall. Even during downturns, DCA kept building the stash at bargain prices, setting the stage for every rebound. Lessons for Today’s Investors The $10-a-week XRP journey highlights a few timeless rules: Consistency beats speculation. Dollar-cost averaging thrives in volatile markets. Starting small can still lead to massive gains. Holding through years—not weeks—often brings the biggest rewards. Conclusion The $10-a-week XRP strategy shows that patient investing can turn pocket change into serious wealth, especially when buying at early prices below $0.10. For today’s market, new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE are being eyed in the same light, with record fundraising hinting at explosive potential. The lesson is clear: steady accumulation and early positioning can change the game.

However, following yesterday’s Federal Reserve announcement regarding a possible interest rate cut, the market found support at a key level and bounced. If this zone continues to hold, BTC could be primed for another upward rally. By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, Bitcoin has recently broken below its long-term ascending channel, signalling a potential trend reversal. Yet, with the likelihood of an upcoming interest rate cut, the price has rebounded strongly from the $110K support zone, which also aligns with the 100-day moving average. At the same time, the RSI is hovering near 50, reflecting market indecision and neutral momentum. As long as the price remains beneath the lower boundary of the broken channel, the risk of a deeper decline, with the 200-day moving average being a potential target near the $100K area, persists. However, if the current rebound gathers strength, a rally toward the $130K region and possibly higher remains a likely scenario. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights the recent price action with more clarity. As soon as Bitcoin touched the $112K support, which aligns with the major low from early August, the market reacted sharply to the interest rate news, triggering a nearly vertical rally toward the $117K resistance zone. While momentum currently favors the buyers, the $117K level remains a key hurdle. If this resistance holds, the price could easily retreat back to the $112K support level or even lower. A decisive breakdown of this support zone would likely trigger a wave of long liquidations, potentially driving the market down toward the critical $100K level, which is the make-or-break area for the broader uptrend. Onchain Analysis Funding Rates Bitcoin’s funding rates have remained consistently positive for an extended period, showing that the derivatives market continues to lean toward bullish positioning. While there have been small liquidation phases along the way, these corrections have not shifted the overall bias, as the futures market sentiment is still positive. What’s notable is that the magnitude of the current funding rates is nowhere near the extreme peaks observed during previous major price tops. This suggests that the market is not yet overly overheated, leaving room for the bullish trend to continue potentially. However, in a positive funding environment, the risk of a liquidation cascade always lingers. If key support levels break, long traders could be forced out rapidly, intensifying the downside move and triggering a sharp correction.

While familiar names continue to dominate headlines, smart money is increasingly watching Remittix , a project combining real-world payment infrastructure with deflationary tokenomics. Already raising more than $20.7 million and selling over 614 million tokens at $0.0969, Remittix has confirmed a BitMart listing and a wallet beta launch in Q3. With a $250,000 community giveaway live and additional exchange announcements imminent, many investors now call Remittix the best crypto to buy now. Remittix positioned for explosive Q4 growth Remittix has already secured a solid foundation, having sold over 614 million tokens at $0.0969 and raised more than $20.7 million to date. This momentum unlocked a BitMart CEX listing, and the next listing is scheduled once Remittix passes $22 million, promising significantly wider liquidity and exposure. Its PayFi features span 40+ tokens, enabling real-time transfers and utility. Analysts now forecast 35× to 50× returns heading into 2026, positioning Remittix among the most compelling utility-driven cryptos this cycle. What Sets Remittix Apart This Season Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Built for adoption, not speculation Wallet beta launching this quarter (Q3 2025) Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Audited by CertiK for trust and transparency This utility-first structure, combined with its funding and delivery schedule, sets Remittix apart in a crowded market. Real utility + milestones = high growth opportunity Remittix offers a different narrative. Well-funded, focused on cross-border utility and backed by exchange access and wallet infrastructure, it could rise far faster. For those chasing outsized returns, Remittix appears to offer a more aggressive alternative, one grounded in delivery, not just hopeful charts.

A trader who multiplied his original holding of $125,000 to over $43 million in four months lost almost all that money in two days, as Ethereum temporarily dipped below $4,000. The episode shows how risky and unstable strategies that rely too much on leverage can be. After seeing the heavy losses, many investors are rethinking their approach. They are now looking at diversification and exploring smaller altcoins. One of the projects attracting attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is quickly gaining popularity as a new option . From Millions to Almost Nothing The liquidation happened on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. The trader lost $6.2 million and was left with just 770000 after ETH crashed. Lookonchain, a blockchain tracker, commented on the event and said it is one of the most astonishing turnarounds in a long time. Other large-name traders also sustained huge losses. Even James Wynn, a long-term DeFi maximalist, has admitted to being reduced in size. He said the aggressive all-in bet had turned out to be a naked move, and he would tighten his belt should the altcoin sailing season fail to happen. The New Altcoin that Gains Investor Attention Ethereum smart investors are interested in diversifying into smaller-cap altcoins, and MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the most regarded. The project is gaining traction fast, with analysts pegging it at a potential 50x multiplier before major exchanges add it. Its complete audit, growing ecosystem, and fast-expanding community are making MAGACOIN FINANCE comparable to the early years of ETH after its ICO. Some of the early adopters are acting swiftly before access levels become restricted. With $12.5 million received in record speed, analysts have high hopes about this next unknown gem. Whales Dump While Opportunists Buy Ethereum whales also exhibited sudden trends as a result of the turbulence. According to on-chain data, big holders sold almost 147 million in ETH during the dip. However, not all of them rushed to exit the coin. More opportunistic traders took advantage of the sell-off, and some ended up acquiring multi-million dollar sums at discounted prices. Even the wallet linked to the infamous Radiant Capital exploit had apparently bought more than $16 million worth of ETH. All Eyes on the Federal Reserve Looking ahead, the next big move in the market may be decided by factors outside of crypto charts. Investors will be paying close attention to the speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in Jackson Hole on Friday. Researchers at Nexo believe that the direction of monetary policy and the signals given by interest rates can dictate whether Ethereum can rally significantly or continue its bearish push. Conclusion The fluctuations of Ethereum experienced in the last week remind investors of just how volatile the cryptocurrency world is. With traders losing millions of dollars within hours, other traders are betting that the dips will give them chances. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most highly anticipated new altcoins. Investors want to be first in line to invest before it goes to the market.

At 32, she framed her plan as a direct question to the community, asking whether such a strategy could realistically provide the means for early retirement. Her post blended personal ambition with a wider curiosity about XRP’s long-term potential, prompting a mix of encouragement, skepticism, and practical advice from other users.

One contributor revealed that he retired at 45 due to his early investment in XRP. He further revealed that he is now 49. Another commenter noted that while early retirement is possible with XRP , she would need to start accumulating as much as possible before the price appreciates. One community member referenced an investment begun in 2017 to illustrate the effect of early entry and persistence. He bought XRP in 2017 at $0.20 and held the asset for 8 years. Today, XRP is worth $3, and analysts are anticipating a major rally in its immediate future . However, some replies were skeptical, with one arguing that other tokens could help with the early retirement goal, but XRP is not a great option.

The asset recently hit a new all-time high of $3.65 . However, XRP still has a long way to go for Bernice’s goal to become realistic. Factors that could drive such growth include increased adoption in cross-border payments, integration into institutional systems , and regulatory clarity that enhances trust. Ripple and the SEC recently concluded their legal battle, with the court approving their joint stipulation for dismissal of their appeals . With the lawsuit now over, XRP has a clearer path to higher targets with more clarity than other assets in the market.

The comment comes just hours after the U.S. abruptly canceled a major trade delegation visit, originally planned for August 25 through 29, which had been seen as a chance to dial back the tension before the rest of the penalties roll in. Indian products are now facing U.S. tariffs as high as 50%, some of the biggest trade penalties the Biden or Trump administrations have ever imposed on India. A 25% round has already kicked in, with another 25% set to be enforced on August 27. The trigger? India’s rising imports of Russian crude, a move that has irritated the White House even though other nations, like China and members of the European Union, are doing the exact same thing on a bigger scale. Jaishankar said there are non-negotiable issues India will not surrender, and that India’s farmers and small producers are top priority. “We have some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended,” he said during his speech at the Economic Times forum. He also made it clear that India isn’t going to let another country tell it what sectors to open or close. “It is our right to make decisions in our ‘national interest,’” he said. Jaishankar challenges tariff logic, points to hypocrisy The foreign minister pointed out that U.S. frustration over Indian-Russian trade feels selective. He questioned why Washington is going after India while larger buyers like China and European governments face no similar punishment. “If the argument is oil, then there are (other) big buyers. If argument is who is trading more (with Russia), then there are bigger traders,” Jaishankar said. He added that Europe’s trade volume with Moscow is higher than India’s, yet only India is being penalized. Even more confusing, Jaishankar said this oil issue wasn’t even part of earlier trade negotiations with Washington. The tariffs came later, without warning, and the U.S. never raised the matter in official meetings before announcing its penalties. He also described Trump’s approach to diplomacy as unorthodox: “We have not had a U.S. president who conducts his foreign policy so publicly as the current one and (it) is a departure from the traditional way of conducting business with the world.” These trade talks had already crashed once this year, when India refused to open its agricultural and dairy sectors to U.S. exporters. That refusal is still in place. And it’s part of the reason a deal is so hard to lock in. India doesn’t want outside pressure changing policies that affect its food security and job market. Right now, the total annual trade between the two countries is over $190 billion, but that number could take a hit. U.S. lawmaker downplays drama, says relationship remains strong On the U.S. side, Republican Congressman Michael Baumgartner tried to cool things down in an interview with NDTV. He said Donald Trump “respects” India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi “a lot”, and believes the situation will work itself out. “We know President Trump is a dealmaker, and he has a lot of respect for India. He also enjoyed his trip to India very much a few years ago. He values the relationship with PM Modi. I’m very optimistic that it will be worked out,” Baumgartner said. Baumgartner added that the high tariffs should be seen as pressure between allies, not hostility. “Well, I think sometimes you have to ask more of your friends, and it should really be interpreted, I think, as a sign of respect towards India that America is asking more of India,” he said. He admitted that India’s side might see it differently but emphasized that the overall ties remain solid. “And so the message I’ve communicated to your leaders is simply that the fundamentals between our two countries are very strong,” Baumgartner said.

According to him, temporary pullbacks or even daily closes below this level should not distract traders. The real signal, he insists, will only emerge once XRP consistently closes above $3.30. As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.03, after moving between $2.79 and $3.10 in the day’s session. The $3.30 Breakout Threshold EGRAG identifies $3.30 as the level where XRP’s momentum transforms from sideways movement into genuine breakout territory. In his analysis, only consecutive daily closes above this threshold will unlock the next stage of the rally. This makes $3.30 more than just a technical barrier—it represents the point where sentiment shifts decisively to the bullish side. #XRP – $3.30 Is the Target! Our objective is clear: $3.30! Any daily closure below this level is just noise; the real signal comes when we close above $3.30. That’s where the magic happens! Remember, $2.73 is our MACRO SUPPORT level, and it’s crucial for maintaining… pic.twitter.com/TQ0LddQbBb — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 23, 2025 The Role of Macro Support at $2.73 While the focus is firmly on the $3.30 breakout, EGRAG also highlights $2.73 as the crucial macro support level. As long as XRP holds this floor, the broader bullish structure remains intact. A decisive break below it, however, would signal weakening momentum and open the door to deeper consolidation. This level, therefore, serves as the foundation upon which the bullish objective rests. Where XRP Stands Now With XRP reclaiming the $3 handle , the market is pressing into a resistance zone between $3.10 and $3.30. The battle between buyers and sellers in this area will determine the short-term trajectory of the market. A strong daily close above $3.30 would confirm that resistance has been absorbed, paving the way for further gains. On the other hand, if sellers regain control, the market will likely retest local defenses at $2.90, with the stronger $2.73 floor waiting below as the ultimate support line. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Will Confirm the Next Rally According to EGRAG, XRP’s bullish trend will be confirmed not just by reaching $3.30, but by how the market performs after surpassing that level. Sustained daily closes above $3.30, supported by rising trading volumes and improving momentum indicators, would provide the clearest evidence that XRP is ready for the next major leg upward. Failure to achieve this, coupled with repeated rejections and a breakdown of $2.73, would suggest the market is not yet prepared for liftoff. Looking Ahead EGRAG Crypto’s analysis provides a precise roadmap for XRP traders: $3.30 marks the breakout gateway, while $2.73 serves as the foundation that must hold. With XRP trading near $3.03 today, the market sits at the edge of this critical battle zone . The direction of XRP’s next move – whether it’s a breakout into a new bullish phase or continued consolidation – will be determined by upcoming daily closes. For now, all attention is on the $3.30 threshold, because that is where, in EGRAG’s words, “soon we shall fly so high.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

50540957,563980,1755950917,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50540957.jpeg,"Ethereum Breaks $4,880 ATH as GENIUS Act Pushes for Fall Implementation, Hyping Up $BEST",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-hits-ath-of-4880-best-rally-coming/,"Ethereum surged by over 15% today, which catapulted it to an ATH of $4,885, higher than the 2021 ATH of $4,868. The boost all took place in one day, with $ETH jumping from $4,231 to $4,885 and keeping its momentum even after dropping below the $4,800 mark. At the time of writing this article, Ethereum is hovering around $4,700 , which may suggest a consolidation phase before the next push. While we may explain the increased investor interest as dip buying, this time may be different, as Trump’s GENIUS Act has just entered its months-long implementation phase. Ethereum’s Surge Hints at a Coming Alt Season This Fall Ethereum’s recent performance is an indicator of bigger things to come. Trump’s GENIUS Act is currently the force behind the 2025 market thanks to the many changes it brings. The act now forces stablecoin issuers to back their stablecoin reserves on a 1:1 ratio with liquid assets like government bonds and the US dollar. It also offers more clarity by requiring issuers to disclose their reserves monthly and focuses on protecting investors against scams and illicit crypto activity. The Act has now entered its implementation phase, with the Treasury Department issuing a ‘Request for Comment Related to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins,’ The directive offers interested individuals and companies the opportunity to ‘provide feedback on innovative or novel methods, techniques, or strategies that regulated financial institutions use, or could potentially use, to detect illicit activity involving digital assets.’ The GENIUS Act is creating a safer, more stable, and more predictable crypto landscape, which explains the surge in investor confidence. Ethereum is naturally reaping the benefits, seeing how it’s been on a sustained push throughout August, doubling in value in less than 30 days. More importantly, we may see additional gains as we push into the fall and more investors join the buy spree, which is already in full force. According to CoinGecko data , 11 public institutions hold almost 2.8M $ETH or over 2.3% of the total supply. Bitmine is leading in the top with an $ETH reserve of 1.5M coins, valued at $7.1B. Ethereum’s chart performance is likely to accelerate as the market rallies and Bitcoin recovers its lost ground. In that context, projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) could see a surge in investor interest. Why Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is Eyeing Massive Gains in 2025 Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is one of the best presales of 2025 after it raised over $15M so far. $BEST trades at the presale price of $0.025515 and supports the Best Wallet ecosystem, which aims to take over 40% of the crypto wallet market share by 2026. $BEST offers not only great value, given that it’s trading at its presale price now, but also a variety of perks for holders. These include reduced transaction fees, community governance rights, and even exclusive access to partnered presales before they go public. Because it supports Best Wallet, $BEST shows a lot of long-term growth potential. Our analysts expect the token to surge post launch, with our 2025 price prediction placing $BEST at $0.072. This would mark a growth rate of 181% in just a few months. By 2030, $BEST could push to $0.82 or higher, for a boost of 3,113% based on the current presale price. With Best Wallet experiencing mainstream adoption, there’s no telling how high $BEST could surge. Best Wallet is a non-custodial, free crypto wallet with no KYC requirements and a user-friendly UI, making it a great choice for beginners and veteran traders alike. The wallet comes with a variety of features, including the Market Insights, which allows you to gauge the market sentiment and identify hot trends, and the Token Launchpad, which lists partnered presales. If you want to get involved, read our ‘ How to buy $BEST ’ guide, then go to the presale page and grab your $BEST today. Is Ethereum Going Bull Again? It’s safe to say that, after doubling in value in less than a month, Ethereum has just started its record-breaking run. We expect $ETH to reach another ATH by the end of the year, as the fall sets in and the GENIUS Act sees noticeable progress. Best Wallet is likely to see an influx of investors as well, as $BEST is getting close to its public release. This isn’t financial advice.

Powell's speech, along with recent data on the labor market and changes in the inflation outlook, reveals a clear shift in the Fed's priorities, according to UBS analysts. In his speech, Powell summarized the economic outlook for the first half of the year, then referenced July employment data and highlighted imbalances in the labor market. UBS said this remarks signaled a potential shift in the Fed's policy bias. According to UBS, the critical points in Powell's message were as follows: Focus on employment rather than inflation: Powell stated that the Fed will now consider employment risks as well as inflation. UBS stated that this signifies a dovish shift in policy stance. Labor market risks: Powell warned that job losses could occur rapidly and lead to sharp increases in unemployment. Inflation expectations will be monitored: Powell said that inflation is rising with temporary, not permanent, effects and that the Fed will change its stance again if necessary. Related News: Ethereum Soars to New Heights: Historic Moments Unfold - ATH on the Horizon - Here's Why and the Current Situation According to UBS, Powell's following statements underscore the shift in direction: “Policy is now in restrictive territory; the outlook and balance of risks may require adjustments to our policy stance.” UBS notes that these statements have strengthened expectations that the Fed may cut interest rates, while markets are increasingly focused on employment and recession risks. *This is not investment advice.
