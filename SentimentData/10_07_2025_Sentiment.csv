47919221,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=176293,1752102019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/47919221.jpeg,Exclusive: Circle USDC Bybit Deal Unlocks New Era for Stablecoin Adoption,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/circle-usdc-bybit-agreement/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news of a potentially game-changing alliance: reports indicate that Circle, the issuer of the popular stablecoin USDC, has forged a significant revenue-sharing agreement with Bybit, one of the globe’s largest and fastest-growing Bybit Crypto Exchange platforms. This isn’t just another business deal; it’s a strategic move that could profoundly impact the landscape of stablecoins and digital asset liquidity, especially for those keen on understanding the intricate mechanics of the crypto market. What is the Circle USDC Bybit Deal All About? At its core, the reported agreement between Circle and Bybit mirrors similar arrangements Circle has established with other major players like Coinbase and Binance. The fundamental principle is straightforward yet powerful: Bybit, by facilitating the use and holding of USDC on its platform, would receive a share of the yield generated from Circle’s USDC reserves. Think of it as a partnership where both entities benefit from the increased utility and circulation of USDC. For context, USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, meaning each USDC is backed by an equivalent amount of high-quality, liquid assets. These assets are held in reserve by Circle and its partners, and they generate yield. By sharing a portion of this yield with exchanges that promote USDC, Circle incentivizes its broader adoption and ensures robust liquidity across the crypto ecosystem. While neither Circle nor Bybit have officially commented on the specifics, the implications of such a deal are substantial. It signals a deepening integration of traditional financial principles – like interest-bearing assets – into the fast-paced world of digital currencies, aiming to create a more stable and attractive environment for users and institutions alike. Understanding USDC Revenue Sharing : A Strategic Move The concept of USDC Revenue Sharing is a cornerstone of Circle’s strategy to expand the reach and utility of its stablecoin. It’s a win-win model designed to foster symbiotic relationships within the crypto ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of why this is a strategic move: Incentivizing Adoption: By offering a share of the yield, Circle directly incentivizes exchanges like Bybit to prioritize USDC. This encourages exchanges to list more USDC pairs, offer better liquidity, and potentially even integrate USDC into new products or services. Enhancing Liquidity: Greater adoption across major exchanges means more liquidity for USDC. This makes it easier and cheaper for users to convert between USDC and other cryptocurrencies or fiat, reducing slippage and improving the overall trading experience. Strengthening Trust: When a stablecoin is widely adopted and supported by major exchanges through such transparent (though often confidential) agreements, it bolsters confidence in its stability and reliability. This is crucial for attracting both retail and institutional users. Diversifying Revenue Streams: For exchanges, a revenue-sharing agreement provides a new, potentially significant, and relatively stable income stream that complements their traditional trading fee models. Consider the sheer scale: USDC’s supply currently hovers around $62 billion. Even a small percentage of yield on such a massive reserve can translate into substantial revenue for partners. This model transforms stablecoins from mere transactional tools into yield-generating assets that can support the operational costs and growth initiatives of major crypto platforms. How Does This Impact Bybit Crypto Exchange Operations? For Bybit Crypto Exchange , a platform known for its derivatives trading and rapidly expanding spot market, this reported partnership with Circle could bring several transformative benefits: Increased USDC Dominance: While Bybit already supports USDC, this deal could solidify its position as a preferred stablecoin on the platform. Users might see more trading pairs, better rates for USDC conversions, and perhaps even innovative products built around USDC. Enhanced Liquidity and Stability: Deeper integration with USDC’s liquidity pool means Bybit can offer more robust and stable trading environments, particularly important during periods of high volatility. This benefits traders looking for reliable exit and entry points. Competitive Edge: In a fiercely competitive market, securing a revenue-sharing deal with a major stablecoin issuer like Circle gives Bybit a unique advantage. It can attract users who prioritize stablecoin utility and reliable yield opportunities. New Revenue Avenues: Beyond trading fees, the shared yield from USDC reserves provides a predictable and potentially significant new revenue stream, strengthening Bybit’s financial foundation and supporting its expansion plans. This partnership isn’t just about financial incentives; it’s about strategic alignment. Bybit, as the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, wields immense influence over user preferences and market trends. By working closely with Circle, Bybit can actively shape the future of stablecoin usage among its vast global user base, cementing its role as a leader in the digital asset space. The Bigger Picture: Driving Stablecoin Adoption Globally The reported Circle-Bybit agreement is a microcosm of a much larger trend: the relentless drive towards mainstream Stablecoin Adoption . Stablecoins like USDC are increasingly viewed as the critical bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto economy. Here’s why their widespread adoption is so crucial: Reducing Volatility: Stablecoins offer a safe haven during volatile market swings, allowing traders to preserve capital without exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely. Facilitating Cross-Border Payments: They enable fast, low-cost international remittances, bypassing traditional banking inefficiencies and high fees. Enabling DeFi Growth: Stablecoins are the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), providing the necessary liquidity and stability for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols. Attracting Institutional Capital: Institutions, wary of crypto’s volatility, find stablecoins a more palatable entry point into the digital asset space, seeing them as digital cash. Circle’s strategy of forging these revenue-sharing deals with major exchanges is a direct accelerator for this global adoption. By ensuring that USDC is readily available, liquid, and economically beneficial for platforms to support, Circle is effectively laying down the rails for a more integrated and efficient global financial system powered by digital dollars. This move with Bybit, given its global reach and significant user base, marks a substantial leap forward in this mission. Future Outlook: What Do These Crypto Partnerships Mean? The reported Circle-Bybit deal underscores a significant trend in the digital asset industry: the increasing importance of strategic Crypto Partnerships . As the crypto space matures, companies are realizing that collaboration, rather than pure competition, is key to expanding market share, driving innovation, and achieving broader mainstream acceptance. Here’s what these partnerships signify for the future: 1. Interoperability and Ecosystem Growth: Such agreements foster greater interoperability between different platforms and protocols. They create a more cohesive ecosystem where assets and services can flow seamlessly, benefiting users and developers alike. 2. Maturing Industry Landscape: The shift from isolated platforms to interconnected networks signifies a maturing industry. Companies are focusing on building robust infrastructure and user-friendly services, moving beyond speculative trading to real-world utility. 3. Regulatory Adaptation: As partnerships deepen, so does the collective effort to navigate complex regulatory landscapes. Collaboration can lead to shared best practices, compliance frameworks, and a more unified voice when engaging with policymakers. 4. Innovation and New Products: Synergies from partnerships often spark new product development. Imagine Bybit leveraging USDC in novel ways, perhaps for enhanced staking rewards, new derivatives products, or even innovative payment solutions for its users. The Circle-Bybit agreement is more than just a deal; it’s a testament to the evolving dynamics of the crypto market. It highlights a future where stablecoins play an even more central role, supported by powerful alliances that bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world. As these partnerships continue to form, we can expect a more integrated, efficient, and user-friendly digital asset landscape. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Stablecoins The reported revenue-sharing agreement between Circle and Bybit marks a pivotal moment for the stablecoin sector and the broader cryptocurrency industry. By aligning the interests of a leading stablecoin issuer with a top-tier crypto exchange, this deal has the potential to significantly accelerate USDC’s reach, enhance liquidity across the market, and solidify stablecoins as foundational elements of the digital economy. While official comments are pending, the strategic implications are clear: such collaborations are not just about individual company growth but about fostering a more robust, integrated, and accessible global financial future built on digital assets. Keep an eye on how this powerful partnership unfolds, as it could indeed unlock a new era for stablecoin adoption and reshape the competitive dynamics of the crypto world.

The cryptocurrency market structure currently reflects a short-term bearish correction within a broader bullish trend, supporting the likelihood of a potential surge to new all-time highs soon. Bitcoin Prepares For Final Dip Below $107,000 Crypto market expert, Tehi Thomas, in a recent TradingView post, suggested that Bitcoin’s current structure may be entering its final corrective phase. The analyst points to a potential price crash below the $107,000 level as part of a strategic play by smart money. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here’s The Target The analyst shared a chart showing Bitcoin forming consecutive lower highs while its price presses downwards. Across these highs, the market is also respecting a descending trendline, a pattern which often indicates short-term bearish pressure. Notably, this trendline appears to be serving as a potential trap designed to engineer a liquidity grab and discount entry. Thomas notes that once the key zone and sell-side liquidity area around $107,800 is taken, Bitcoin’s price is expected to dip into a nearby Fair Value Gap (FVG), extending down to the $106,500-$106,200 region. This FVG overlaps with critical Fibonacci levels, particularly the 0.786 retracement near $106,200, strengthening the confluence for a potential reversal point. Thomas has highlighted this $106,200 level as a high-probability buy zone, where institutions may re-enter the market. Notably, the analyst’s anticipated price correction for Bitcoin is not seen as a breakdown of structure or market failure, but rather a calculated liquidity grab to fill inefficiencies left from the previous lag. As long as the price respects the $106,000 range and displays bullish order flow afterward, its projected correction is expected to complete the accumulation phase. All-Time Highs In Sight After Key Reversal Following Bitcoin’s projected sweep and fill of the FVG, the cryptocurrency is expected to form a reversal structure that could kick off the next major rally. Despite the projected crash below $107,000, Thomas asserts that Bitcoin’s overall macro trend remains bullish. Moreover, this short-term pullback is considered a setup for a much larger move toward a new all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline Thomas’s chart marks the $110,500 zone as the final magnet and ATH target, with a significant layer of untapped liquidity above it. The analyst’s thesis is that once the sell-side pressure is exhausted and displacement confirms the shift in direction, Bitcoin could once again regain bullish momentum. Furthermore, the TradingView expert has pointed out that the FVG near $106,200 acts as both a liquidity magnet and a springboard, set to launch the flagship cryptocurrency into price discovery mode once again. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $108,744, meaning a potential surge to the projected ATH level at $110,500 will represent a 1.61% increase.

47919831,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=176294,1752102616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/47919831.jpeg,Consensys ETH Transfer: A Strategic Move Unveiling New Crypto Horizons,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/consensys-eth-transfer-sharplink/,"In a development that has sent compelling ripples across the cryptocurrency landscape, Ethereum infrastructure powerhouse Consensys recently executed a significant Consensys ETH transfer . This substantial transaction, involving precisely 5,071 ETH valued at approximately $13.47 million at the time of the transfer, was directed to SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed entity known for its proactive and strategic accumulation of Ethereum. This pivotal movement, first reported by Jinse Finance, is more than just a transaction; it underscores a profound narrative of evolving institutional engagement and growing confidence within the digital asset sphere. What Does the Consensys ETH Transfer Mean? The recent Consensys ETH transfer of 5,071 ETH to SharpLink Gaming is a fascinating case study in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning blockchain economy. Consensys, a leading force in the Ethereum ecosystem, is renowned for developing essential software and tools that power decentralized applications and services. Their contributions range from the ubiquitous MetaMask wallet to the Infura development suite, making them a foundational pillar of Web3 infrastructure. Therefore, any significant financial maneuver by Consensys warrants close attention, as it often reflects broader trends or strategic partnerships within the industry. SharpLink Gaming, on the other hand, operates in the dynamic world of sports betting and iGaming. As a Nasdaq-listed company, its engagement with cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, signals a deliberate and forward-thinking approach to asset management and potential future business models. This transfer isn’t merely a sale or a liquidation; it’s a direct flow of a substantial amount of Ethereum from a major blockchain infrastructure provider to a publicly traded company actively building its digital asset reserves. This type of transaction speaks volumes about the increasing legitimacy and utility of cryptocurrencies as a strategic asset class for established corporations. The specifics of the transfer – its size and the entities involved – suggest a meticulously planned operation rather than a speculative trade. It highlights the growing sophistication of how large enterprises are interacting with blockchain technology, moving beyond simple curiosity to active participation and integration. Why is SharpLink Gaming Making This Ethereum Investment? The decision by SharpLink Gaming to engage in significant Ethereum investment and strategically stockpile ETH is a powerful indicator of shifting corporate treasury strategies. For a Nasdaq-listed company, every financial move is scrutinized, and a substantial allocation to a volatile asset like Ethereum suggests a strong conviction in its long-term value and utility. There are several compelling reasons why a company like SharpLink might undertake such a strategy: Diversification of Treasury Assets: In an era of fluctuating inflation and economic uncertainty, companies are seeking alternative assets to traditional cash and bonds. Ethereum, with its potential for significant growth and its role as the backbone of a new digital economy, presents an attractive diversification option. Anticipation of Web3 Integration: The gaming and iGaming sectors are ripe for disruption by Web3 technologies, including NFTs, play-to-earn models, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). By holding ETH, SharpLink positions itself to seamlessly integrate these innovations into its future platforms, potentially offering new revenue streams and enhanced user experiences. Balance Sheet Strategy: Following in the footsteps of pioneers like MicroStrategy, companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin and Ethereum as primary treasury reserve assets. This strategy aims to hedge against fiat currency depreciation and potentially generate significant capital appreciation over time. Signaling to Traditional Finance: By publicly accumulating ETH, SharpLink sends a clear signal to its investors, competitors, and the broader financial market that it is embracing technological innovation and positioning itself for the future of digital finance. This can attract new investors who are keen on companies with exposure to the crypto space. This strategic stockpiling is not merely speculative; it reflects a belief in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition as a decentralized computing platform, capable of hosting a vast array of applications and services. SharpLink’s move could inspire other traditional companies, particularly those in tech-adjacent sectors, to explore similar Ethereum investment strategies, further bridging the gap between legacy finance and the crypto world. Is Institutional Crypto Adoption Accelerating? The Consensys ETH transfer to SharpLink Gaming is a microcosm of a much larger, accelerating trend: institutional crypto adoption . Over the past few years, the narrative around cryptocurrencies has shifted dramatically from niche speculation to serious consideration by major financial players. This shift is driven by several factors: Maturing Market Infrastructure: The development of regulated custody solutions, derivatives markets, and spot ETFs (particularly for Bitcoin) has provided institutions with safer and more familiar pathways to access digital assets. Clearer Regulatory Landscape: While still evolving, regulatory frameworks are gradually becoming clearer in various jurisdictions, reducing uncertainty for institutional investors. Macroeconomic Environment: Persistent inflation concerns, low interest rates, and geopolitical instability have pushed institutions to explore alternative assets that are less correlated with traditional markets. Technological Innovation: Institutions recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology beyond just cryptocurrencies, seeing its applications in supply chain management, digital identity, tokenized assets, and more. We’ve seen numerous examples of this accelerating adoption: Corporate Treasuries: Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and now seemingly SharpLink Gaming, are adding Bitcoin and Ethereum to their balance sheets. Asset Managers: BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have launched or are planning various crypto-related investment products, including spot Bitcoin ETFs, making crypto accessible to a broader institutional client base. Hedge Funds and Venture Capital: Dedicated crypto funds and traditional hedge funds are allocating significant capital to digital assets, blockchain startups, and DeFi protocols. Traditional Banks: Major banks are exploring offering crypto services, custody solutions, and even stablecoin projects, acknowledging the irreversible shift towards digital finance. This increasing institutional involvement brings several benefits to the crypto market, including enhanced liquidity, reduced volatility, and increased legitimacy. It signals a move towards mainstream acceptance, paving the way for even broader adoption by retail investors and corporations alike. The Consensys-SharpLink transfer serves as a powerful testament to this ongoing institutional embrace of digital assets. What Can ETH Whale Movements Tell Us? In the cryptocurrency world, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. An ETH whale , therefore, is a holder of a significant quantity of Ethereum. The movement of these large holdings, like the Consensys ETH transfer , is often closely watched by market participants and analysts because it can provide valuable insights into market sentiment, potential price action, and strategic shifts by major players. On-chain analytics tools allow anyone to track these large transactions on public blockchains. When an ETH whale moves a substantial amount of Ether, several interpretations are possible: Accumulation: If a whale is moving ETH from an exchange to a private wallet, or from one institutional wallet to another for strategic holding (as appears to be the case with SharpLink Gaming), it often signals an intention to hold for the long term, indicating bullish sentiment. Distribution/Selling: Conversely, if a whale moves a large amount of ETH to an exchange, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially leading to increased selling pressure and a price drop. Internal Transfers: Sometimes, large movements are simply internal reorganizations of funds between different wallets owned by the same entity (e.g., for security, rebalancing, or operational purposes), which might have less immediate market impact. Strategic Partnerships/Investments: As seen with the Consensys-SharpLink transfer, such movements can signify direct investments, strategic partnerships, or treasury management decisions by corporations entering the crypto space. The Consensys to SharpLink transfer falls squarely into the category of strategic accumulation by a public company. This particular whale movement is bullish, as it demonstrates a commitment to holding Ethereum rather than liquidating it. It provides tangible evidence of real-world corporate adoption, which can instill confidence in other investors and potentially attract more institutional capital into the Ethereum ecosystem. Understanding these whale movements helps market participants gauge the health and direction of the market beyond just price charts, offering a deeper look into the actions of the most influential holders. What’s Next for Ethereum Investment and Its Ecosystem? The strategic Ethereum investment by SharpLink Gaming, facilitated by Consensys, paints a compelling picture for the future trajectory of Ethereum and its vibrant ecosystem. Ethereum continues to be the leading smart contract platform, powering the vast majority of decentralized applications (DApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs. Its ongoing evolution, particularly with significant upgrades like the Merge and upcoming enhancements like sharding and Danksharding, promises increased scalability, efficiency, and sustainability. For investors, the implications of such institutional moves are clear: Ethereum is solidifying its position as a legitimate and essential digital asset. Its utility as a programmable blockchain, capable of hosting complex financial systems and entirely new digital economies, makes it incredibly attractive to forward-thinking corporations. The continued development by entities like Consensys ensures that the underlying infrastructure remains robust and capable of supporting global demand. Looking ahead, we can anticipate several key trends: Increased Enterprise Adoption: More companies, beyond just those in tech or gaming, will likely explore integrating Ethereum-based solutions for supply chain, data management, and financial services. Growth of Tokenized Assets: The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) on Ethereum is a massive potential growth area, making illiquid assets more accessible and efficient to trade. DeFi and Web3 Innovation: Ethereum’s ecosystem will continue to be a hotbed for decentralized finance innovations and the broader Web3 movement, attracting talent and capital. Regulatory Clarity: As institutional involvement grows, pressure for clearer and more supportive regulatory frameworks will increase, further de-risking the space for traditional players. For those considering or already engaged in Ethereum investment , the actionable insights from this Consensys-SharpLink transaction are profound. It underscores the importance of a long-term perspective, focusing on fundamental utility and institutional adoption rather than short-term price fluctuations. Monitoring strategic corporate moves, understanding the underlying technology’s roadmap, and staying informed about the evolving regulatory landscape will be crucial for navigating the opportunities within this dynamic asset class. The recent Consensys ETH transfer to SharpLink Gaming is far more than a routine transaction; it’s a powerful signal of confidence in the enduring value and strategic importance of Ethereum within the global financial landscape. This move by a leading Ethereum infrastructure provider to a Nasdaq-listed company actively building its digital asset reserves highlights the accelerating pace of institutional crypto adoption . It underscores a strategic Ethereum investment trend where traditional enterprises are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology. As ETH whale movements continue to shape market narratives, this particular transfer stands out as a beacon of long-term commitment, further solidifying Ethereum’s position at the forefront of the digital economy. The blending of established corporate entities with decentralized innovation is not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift, paving the way for a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into mainstream finance and business operations.

While Ethereum remains a foundational layer of the blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum alternatives are now emerging as top picks in presale conversations — and one name is climbing the ranks fast: MAGACOIN FINANCE. This decentralized meme-powered altcoin is shaking up expectations and drawing comparisons to early Ethereum challengers — thanks to its bold positioning, zero-tax model, and viral cultural appeal. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Leading Coin Breaking Into Analyst Rankings Topping the list of best crypto presales right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the most talked-about Ethereum alternative among early adopters. But it’s not a Layer-1 network — it’s a politically charged meme-powered altcoin that’s rewriting what utility and culture can look like in the Web3 era. Built around the themes of decentralization, community ownership, and cultural relevance, MAGACOIN FINANCE operates on a zero-tax system with no centralized control or VC involvement. It has already attracted thousands of wallets, with multiple stages of its presale selling out rapidly — a major indicator of demand. The token supply is fully capped and audited by HashEx, giving it a layer of legitimacy that most meme coins never achieve. Analysts and investors are drawing comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, but noting that MAGACOIN FINANCE comes with structural advantages those projects lacked — including scarcity, clarity, and governance. This project isn’t just chasing hype — it’s building a narrative ecosystem that reflects real-world ideologies, making it one of the most unique Ethereum alternatives currently in presale. Why Ethereum Alternatives Are Attracting Attention While Ethereum remains dominant in smart contract infrastructure, investors are now casting a wider net. Rising gas fees, slower network upgrades, and scalability concerns have opened the door for new ecosystems and assets that can offer utility, speed, or a cultural edge . Ethereum alternatives fall into two categories: Technical challengers like Solana, Avalanche, and Base Narrative-driven alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE The second group is gaining momentum fast — especially among younger, meme-savvy retail investors looking for high-upside entries that blend narrative and function . Community Power and Presale Scarcity Create FOMO What’s accelerating MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise is the blend of community virality and scarcity mechanics. With a hard cap on supply and no token inflation, the tokenomics reward early entry. The presale is still live, but stages have been selling fast — with investor groups, Telegram forums, and influencers already discussing its moonshot potential. This kind of movement mimics the early energy of Ethereum challengers in 2017 and meme coin giants in 2021. Now in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as the intersection of those two powerful forces. Final Thoughts: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Presale to Watch Closely While Ethereum alternatives continue to gain analyst attention, few are offering the raw potential and community momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As the presale accelerates and attention builds, this may be the ideal early entry window for those seeking the next top-performing crypto in the current cycle.

Recently, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released the minutes from its June 2025 meeting, sending ripples across markets. For crypto investors , understanding these insights is paramount, as the Fed’s stance on monetary policy directly influences the broader economic landscape and, by extension, the performance of digital assets like Bitcoin . This latest report highlights a significant concern: the potential for tariffs to ignite an alarming surge in inflation . Let’s dive deep into what the FOMC discussed and what it means for your portfolio. Understanding the June 2025 FOMC Meeting Minutes The Federal Open Market Committee’s deliberations are always closely watched, providing crucial insights into the economic outlook and the future direction of monetary policy. The June 2025 minutes, as summarized by Bitcoin World, revealed several key takeaways that are essential for anyone tracking the markets: Unanimous Agreement on Current Rates: All members of the committee concurred that it was appropriate to maintain interest rates at their prevailing level. This decision signals a collective assessment that the current economic conditions, including employment and inflation trends, do not warrant an immediate change in borrowing costs. Hawkish Perspectives Emerge: A segment of the FOMC expressed a more hawkish stance. These members suggested that the current federal funds rate might not be significantly higher than the neutral rate—the theoretical rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth. This viewpoint implies a belief that monetary policy may not be as restrictive as previously thought, potentially necessitating a longer period of higher rates to achieve desired economic outcomes. Dovish Openness to Future Cuts: Conversely, some members indicated a willingness to consider cutting rates as early as the July meeting, provided that incoming economic data aligns with their expectations. This data-dependent approach underscores the committee’s flexibility and responsiveness to evolving economic indicators, such as employment figures, consumer spending, and inflation readings. Broad Expectation of Rate Cuts This Year: A significant majority of members anticipated that a rate cut would become necessary at some point later in the year, given appropriate circumstances. This consensus suggests a general trajectory towards easing monetary policy, albeit with careful consideration of economic developments. Tariffs as an Inflationary Risk: Perhaps the most striking revelation was the widespread concern among most members that tariffs pose a substantial risk of stimulating inflation. This point is particularly critical for markets, as it introduces a new, external factor that could complicate the Fed’s efforts to manage price stability. The Great Debate: Future of Interest Rates and Economic Stability The discussions within the FOMC reveal a nuanced internal debate about the path forward for monetary policy. This isn’t a monolithic body; it’s a collection of diverse economic viewpoints trying to navigate complex data. The divergence between hawkish and dovish members highlights the challenges of balancing economic growth with price stability. Here’s a breakdown of the two main camps: Stance Key Beliefs Potential Implications Hawkish Members Believe current rates might not be restrictive enough; concerned about persistent inflation. May advocate for holding rates longer or even hiking if inflation accelerates. Higher borrowing costs for longer, potentially slower economic growth, stronger dollar. Dovish Members More focused on potential economic slowdown or disinflation; willing to cut rates sooner if data supports it. Emphasize risks to employment. Lower borrowing costs, potential economic stimulus, weaker dollar, potentially positive for risk assets. This internal tug-of-war is crucial for markets. The balance between these views will ultimately determine the timing and magnitude of any future rate adjustments. For crypto investors , understanding this dynamic is key, as shifts in interest rate expectations can trigger significant movements in asset prices. The Alarming Threat: How Tariffs Fuel Inflation The most pressing concern voiced by the FOMC is the inflationary potential of tariffs. But how exactly do these trade barriers lead to higher prices? Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services. When a country imposes tariffs, it makes foreign goods more expensive, aiming to make domestically produced goods more competitive or to raise revenue. The Mechanism of Tariff-Induced Inflation: Increased Import Costs: When tariffs are levied, the cost of importing goods rises. Importers typically pass these increased costs on to consumers in the form of higher retail prices. For example, if a tariff is placed on imported electronics, the price of those electronics in stores will likely go up. Reduced Competition: Tariffs can reduce the supply of foreign goods in the market, thereby decreasing competition. With fewer foreign options, domestic producers might face less pressure to keep their prices low, leading to overall price increases. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, forcing companies to find alternative, often more expensive, sources for materials or components. These higher production costs are then passed down to the end consumer. Retaliatory Tariffs: When one country imposes tariffs, others often retaliate with their own tariffs on the first country’s exports. This can lead to a trade war, further increasing costs for businesses and consumers across multiple sectors. Challenge: Impact on Consumer Purchasing Power The direct consequence of tariff-driven inflation is a reduction in consumer purchasing power. As prices for everyday goods and services rise, each dollar buys less. This can erode savings, reduce discretionary spending, and put a strain on household budgets. For the broader economy, persistent inflation can lead to wage-price spirals, where workers demand higher wages to compensate for rising costs, which in turn leads businesses to raise prices further. This cycle can be difficult to break and poses a significant challenge to economic stability, impacting everything from housing costs to the price of your morning coffee. Navigating the Currents: What This Means for Bitcoin and Digital Assets The FOMC’s discussions, particularly on tariffs and inflation, have profound implications for the cryptocurrency market. Historically, Bitcoin has been touted as a potential hedge against inflation, often referred to as ‘digital gold.’ However, its performance during inflationary periods has been mixed, depending on the broader macroeconomic context. Bitcoin as an Inflation Hedge: The Debate The Narrative: Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s fixed supply (21 million coins) makes it inherently resistant to the inflationary pressures that can devalue fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks. In times of rising prices, investors might seek refuge in scarce assets. The Reality: While Bitcoin shares some characteristics with traditional inflation hedges like gold, its relatively young age and high volatility mean it doesn’t always act as a reliable safe haven. During periods of aggressive monetary tightening (like rate hikes to combat inflation), risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, tend to suffer as liquidity tightens and investors seek safer, yield-bearing assets. Impact of Interest Rates on Crypto: The Fed’s stance on interest rates is a critical determinant for crypto market sentiment. Higher rates typically increase the cost of capital, making speculative investments less attractive and drawing funds away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies towards safer, interest-bearing traditional investments. Conversely, the prospect of rate cuts, as discussed by some FOMC members, can signal looser monetary policy, potentially boosting liquidity and making risk assets more appealing. Challenge: Volatility and Macro Sensitivity The crypto market remains highly sensitive to macroeconomic indicators and central bank policy. News of potential inflation, or hawkish signals from the Fed, can lead to increased volatility. Crypto investors need to be aware that while the long-term narrative for digital assets may involve hedging against traditional financial system flaws, the short-to-medium term price action is heavily influenced by global economic health and monetary policy decisions. Empowering Your Portfolio: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the insights from the latest FOMC meeting and the looming threat of tariff-induced inflation , how should crypto investors position themselves? Staying informed and adopting a strategic approach is more critical than ever. Key Actions to Consider: Monitor Economic Data Closely: Pay close attention to upcoming inflation reports (CPI, PCE), employment figures, and GDP growth. These will be key in influencing the Fed’s decisions regarding interest rates and potential rate cuts. The data dependency of the FOMC means that economic releases will directly impact market sentiment. Understand the Inflation Narrative: While Bitcoin has long been considered an inflation hedge, its effectiveness can vary. Diversify your understanding beyond just this narrative. Consider how different inflation scenarios (e.g., supply-side vs. demand-side inflation) might affect various crypto assets. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: In an environment of economic uncertainty and potential inflation, volatility can increase. Re-evaluate your personal risk tolerance and ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with it. Avoid over-leveraging and maintain a healthy cash position for opportunities or to weather downturns. Diversify Your Crypto Holdings: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Bitcoin is the market leader, consider a diversified portfolio that includes other major cryptocurrencies, stablecoins (for capital preservation), and perhaps even exposure to different sectors within crypto (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s) that might react differently to macro trends. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term price movements are influenced by macro news, the long-term value of many crypto projects lies in their underlying technology, utility, and adoption. Continue to research and invest in projects with strong fundamentals and real-world use cases. Stay Informed on Trade Policy: Given the FOMC’s specific concern about tariffs, keep an eye on global trade policies and geopolitical developments. Escalations in trade disputes could directly impact inflation and, subsequently, central bank policy. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in a Dynamic Market The U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC minutes serve as a critical reminder of the interconnectedness of global finance. The unanimous decision to hold interest rates , coupled with the internal debate on future cuts and the alarming warning about tariff-induced inflation , paints a complex picture for the economy. For Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, these macro shifts are not just background noise; they are fundamental drivers of sentiment and price action. By understanding the Fed’s concerns, particularly regarding tariffs and their inflationary potential, and by proactively adjusting your investment strategy, crypto investors can better navigate the turbulent waters ahead. Staying informed, adaptable, and focused on long-term value will be your greatest assets in this evolving landscape.

Bitcoin Rally Faces Critical Test John Glover, the chief investment officer at crypto lending platform Ledn and a former managing director at Barclays Investment Bank, noted that the recent rally appears to be a retest of the previous all-time high set on May 22, which encountered selling pressure. As some investors opted to take profits, notable publicly traded companies, including Trump Media & Technology Group and GameStop, have announced their intentions to purchase Bitcoin to bolster their treasuries. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 50% “Moonshot” For XRP Price If This Line Breaks Glover emphasized that the competition among these companies to accumulate Bitcoin could significantly impact market dynamics, given that the cryptocurrency’s popularity among publicly traded companies appears to be growing. However, the sustainability of Bitcoin’s rally largely hinges on macroeconomic conditions and developments in trade negotiations. Sid Powell, CEO of crypto asset-management firm Maple, highlighted that any setbacks in trade discussions before President Donald Trump’s August 1 deadline could pose challenges for Bitcoin’s price movement. Conversely, if trade negotiations progress and inflation continues to ease, the Federal Reserve (Fed) might consider cutting interest rates, which could further support Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Scenarios For A Potential Breakout Toward $130,000 Market expert Doctor Profit recently took to social media, declaring that Bitcoin’s rally is just beginning. He confidently stated, “THE PARTY IS NOT OVER YET,” predicting a potential new all-time high soon. His analysis indicates a target range of $120,000 to $130,000 for this cycle. According to Doctor Profit, two potential scenarios could pave the way for this breakout. The first involves Bitcoin reaching the $113,000 to $114,000 range, followed by a correction to the $92,000 to $93,000 level, which aligns with a major liquidity pool and the CME gap. A rebound from this lower range could set the stage for a rapid ascent toward the $120,000 mark. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP’s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated The second, more aggressive scenario suggests that Bitcoin could break through the $113,000 to $114,000 barrier and continue its upward momentum without revisiting lower liquidity levels. In either case, the $113,000 to $114,000 range is critical, as the market’s reaction to this level will significantly influence the speed and direction of Bitcoin’s next leg. When writing, BTC has retraced back toward $111,422, attempting to make this level its new support floor for further price appreciation.

Criptonoticias reported that the price of USDT rose above the 1,280 peso mark on July 8. At the time of writing, that would price USDT at USD 1.02, rather than USD 1.00. The news comes just three months after the Lemon Cash platform, one of the country’s most popular crypto exchanges, recorded an all-time high for stablecoin purchases. The firm said that between April 14, between 10 am and 11 am, stablecoin transactions grew by more than 350% hour-on-hour. The USDT market cap over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinMarketCap) USDT: Argentina Demand Growing? The same crypto exchange said that stablecoin buying is a growing trend in Argentina. It announced that, in February this year, combined USD-pegged coin trading volumes were 2.5 times higher than the monthly average for 2024. Experts and media analysts in the nation have credited much of the rise to the Argentine government’s announcement on April 13 that it would lift a much-maligned cap on USD buying. The foreign exchange restrictions were first imposed back in 2019, when Buenos Aires attempted to address ballooning inflation rates and falling domestic investment rates. However, the newspaper La Nacion claimed that other factors are also at play. Fears of a peso devaluation remain high. And while the government has seemingly emerged victorious in its battle with hyperinflation, trust in the peso remains low.

Ahead of his election in 2023, President Javier Milei promised to scrap the Argentine peso and dollarize the country’s economy. Media outlets also pointed to growing “uncertainty” ahead of legislative elections slated for October 26. Criptonoticias wrote that “many savers are seeking refuge in dollar-denominated assets in the face of possible changes in the government’s economic direction.” However, experts also pointed to new Christmas bonus rules, which this year saw companies pay their employees bonuses in June. This has led many to invest surplus funds in assets they think can store value in the medium and long term. For many, this is the US dollar. But for others, it is Bitcoin (BTC) , which also remains popular in Argentina. Many traders use USDT and other USD-pegged coins to buy and sell BTC. USDT prices versus the Argentine Peso over the past month. (Source: Google Finance) However, others explained that FOMO (fear of missing out) may also be driving the dollar market. The concept of the “ dólar barato ” (literally: “cheap dollar”) appears to have taken root in the Argentinian markets. An acceleration of the agricultural sector’s liquidation process was cited as another factor. This refers to a recurring Argentine economic phenomenon whereby farmers and exporters convert their foreign currency earnings from agricultural exports into fiat pesos. The consulting firm Ecolatina explained to La Nation: “The acceleration of the agricultural sector’s liquidation is occurring amid two factors. First, increased seasonal demand from individuals during the Christmas bonus season. And second, a deterioration in expectations [as savers think about the] ‘day after the agricultural sector’s liquidation.’ This anticipates higher demand at a time when the dollar is perceived as cheap. And that, in turn, creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.” President Javier Milei is counting on a shale-oil boom in Argentina to cement his libertarian economic reforms https://t.co/djmmzH5npj — Bloomberg (@business) July 6, 2025 Black Market USD Prices Also Climbing Criptonoticias, meanwhile, explained that “dólar barato” sees savers “buy to protect themselves, which in turn increases demand and pushes the price up.” In other words, the outlet concluded, “the rise ultimately occurs because of the trading activity of people who anticipate” a rise in USD prices. La Nacion explained that black market dollar prices are also on the rise, climbing 3.25% from July 4 to July 7. The rate if MEP dollar, which is used to legally dollarize savings as an emergency measure, climbed 2.4% from ARS 29.52 to ARS 1,276.44 in the same period.

This isn’t just a casual dip; it’s a strategic crypto investment that signals a growing embrace of digital currencies within influential circles. The eldest son of former President Donald Trump has reportedly acquired a significant stake in Thumzup Media, a company with a clear focus on the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. What does this mean for the future of crypto and the broader financial landscape? What is Driving Donald Trump Jr.’s Crypto Investment? In a move that has captured widespread attention, Donald Trump Jr. has reportedly purchased 350,000 shares in Thumzup Media, a transaction valued at an impressive $6 million as part of a private placement. This significant acquisition was initially reported by Bloomberg and further highlighted by Wu Blockchain on X, underscoring the high-profile nature of this development. This isn’t merely an individual venture; it aligns with what appears to be a broader, evolving Trump crypto strategy , indicating a family interest in the digital asset space. The Trump family, including the former President himself, has shown increasing signs of engaging with cryptocurrencies, from NFT collections to public statements that, while sometimes critical, also acknowledge the growing importance of the sector. This latest investment by Donald Trump Jr. suggests a more direct, capital-intensive commitment to the industry, moving beyond digital collectibles into equity in a crypto-focused enterprise. It raises questions about the motivations behind such a substantial financial commitment: Diversification: A potential strategy to diversify assets beyond traditional markets. Growth Potential: Belief in the long-term growth and disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Alignment with Audience: A nod to a segment of their political base that is increasingly interested in or invested in crypto. Understanding Thumzup Media’s Bitcoin Holdings and Future Plans The company at the heart of this news, Thumzup Media , is not new to the crypto scene. It already boasts substantial Bitcoin holdings , reportedly exceeding $2 million. This existing treasury of the world’s leading cryptocurrency positions Thumzup Media as a player with established exposure to digital assets. However, their ambitions don’t stop there. Thumzup Media has publicly announced plans to expand its crypto portfolio significantly by adding six more cryptocurrencies. While the specific names of these additional assets have not been disclosed, this strategy suggests a proactive approach to building a diversified crypto treasury. For investors and market watchers, this diversification could mean: Broader Market Exposure: Moving beyond just Bitcoin to capture growth in other promising altcoins. Risk Management: Spreading risk across multiple digital assets rather than relying solely on one. Strategic Alignment: Potentially selecting cryptocurrencies that align with their core business or future technological integrations. This expansion of Bitcoin holdings and the planned addition of new cryptos is a clear indicator of Thumzup Media’s long-term vision within the digital economy, making it an attractive target for a significant crypto investment like Donald Trump Jr.’s. How Does This Crypto Investment Impact Thumzup Media? The influx of $6 million from this private placement, particularly with a high-profile investor like Donald Trump Jr. , brings several immediate and potential long-term benefits for Thumzup Media . Beyond the capital injection itself, the association with a prominent name can significantly boost the company’s visibility and credibility, especially within the mainstream financial world. Consider the potential impacts: Enhanced Capital: The $6 million provides significant working capital for Thumzup Media to execute its growth strategies, including expanding its crypto treasury and developing new projects. Increased Visibility: The association with the Trump name automatically puts Thumzup Media in the spotlight, attracting more attention from potential investors, partners, and users. Market Confidence: A high-profile investment can signal confidence in the company’s business model and future prospects, potentially leading to increased investor interest. Strategic Guidance: While the extent of Donald Trump Jr.’s involvement beyond shareholding is unknown, his connection could potentially open doors or provide strategic insights. This investment is not just about the money; it’s about the powerful endorsement and the potential for a ripple effect across the company’s operations and market perception. It’s a clear win for Thumzup Media as it navigates the competitive crypto landscape. Decoding the Broader Trump Crypto Strategy The investment by Donald Trump Jr. in Thumzup Media, with its significant Bitcoin holdings and plans for further crypto expansion, is more than an isolated event. It fits into a pattern that suggests an evolving Trump crypto strategy . While former President Trump has had a fluctuating stance on crypto, his ventures into NFTs and now his son’s direct investment in a crypto-focused company point towards a pragmatic recognition of the digital asset space. This broader strategy could be interpreted in several ways: Economic Realism: Acknowledging the irreversible growth and influence of cryptocurrencies on the global economy. Political Play: Appealing to a growing demographic of crypto-savvy voters and supporters who value financial innovation and decentralization. Future-Proofing: Positioning the family’s financial interests in emerging technologies that are poised for significant future growth. The alignment of Thumzup Media’s plans to add more cryptocurrencies to its treasury with this perceived family strategy suggests a cohesive approach to digital asset management. It underscores a belief that cryptocurrencies are not a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in finance and technology that warrants serious consideration and investment. The Future Outlook: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment? This high-profile crypto investment by Donald Trump Jr. serves as a powerful testament to the increasing mainstream acceptance and institutional interest in digital assets. When prominent figures make such moves, it often sends a signal to other investors, potentially encouraging more capital to flow into the sector. The news, reported by reputable sources like Bloomberg and Wu Blockchain, adds a layer of legitimacy and visibility to the crypto space. For the average investor, this development reinforces several key trends: Growing Legitimacy: Crypto is moving beyond niche discussions into mainstream financial portfolios. Institutional Adoption: More companies are actively building substantial crypto treasuries. Diversification Benefits: The appeal of digital assets as a component of a diversified investment strategy continues to grow. While the crypto market remains volatile, strategic investments like this one highlight the long-term confidence some major players have in its foundational technology and disruptive potential. It encourages a closer look at companies like Thumzup Media and their specific strategies for leveraging Bitcoin holdings and other cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Thumzup Media and Crypto The significant crypto investment by Donald Trump Jr. in Thumzup Media marks a compelling moment for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency market. With a substantial capital injection and the added visibility of a high-profile investor, Thumzup Media is well-positioned to execute its plans for expanding its Bitcoin holdings and integrating additional cryptocurrencies. This move also provides further insight into the evolving Trump crypto strategy , indicating a pragmatic and growing engagement with digital assets by influential families. As the lines between traditional finance and the digital economy continue to blur, such investments serve as powerful indicators of the shifting landscape. They highlight the enduring appeal of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class and the increasing willingness of notable figures to embrace their potential. This development is certainly one to watch as the crypto market continues its journey of maturation and wider adoption.

47920826,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73900,1752103850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP’s Future at Stake: Ripple’s Escrow Depletion Date Looms,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-future-at-stake-ripples-escrow-depletion-date-looms/,"Ripple’s escrow management strategy , designed to regulate the flow of XRP into circulation, may see the total escrow balance exhausted within the next decade if recent patterns continue. However, certain adjustments to release practices could accelerate this timeline. Current Structure of Ripple’s Escrow Mechanism Ripple established the escrow system in December 2017 by locking away 55 billion XRP across multiple wallets to prevent an oversupply from impacting market stability. Each month, 1 billion XRP is released from escrow. However, Ripple typically relocks a substantial portion of that monthly release to maintain supply control. As of July 2025, data from XRPScan shows that the escrow still contains 35.908 billion XRP, distributed across 14 wallets. The remaining balance is released on a predetermined schedule and remains subject to Ripple’s discretionary re-locking strategy. Projected Timelines Based on Different Scenarios A prominent analyst who runs the “XRP Liquidity” account recently published projections regarding the escrow’s future, depending on how much XRP Ripple continues to use each month. In 2025 so far, Ripple has re-locked 700 million XRP each month, except June, when 670 million was returned . By comparison, from April to October 2024, Ripple had been re-locking 800 million XRP monthly, except in November, when only 530 million was re-locked. This suggests a moderate reduction in the amount Ripple is returning to escrow in 2025. If Ripple continues to retain 700 million XRP monthly and utilizes only 300 million per month, the escrow balance would last approximately 10 more years. If, starting in January 2026, Ripple increases its usage to 400 million XRP per month, the remaining escrow would be depleted in roughly 7.5 years. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A more aggressive approach, increasing monthly use by 100 million XRP each year, could reduce the timeline to just six years. If Ripple ceases re-locking entirely and utilizes the full 1 billion monthly, the depletion would occur much sooner. Adjustments in Release Timing and Behavior In addition to changes in the re-locking amounts, Ripple appears to be modifying the release schedule itself. Traditionally, the 1 billion XRP is unlocked on the first day of each month. However, since March 2025, the company has begun staggering the release. For example, in July 2025, Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP on July 1 and another 500 million on July 4. This new phased-release method aligns with a broader shift in how Ripple allocates unlocked XRP. In July, of the 1 billion XRP released, 300 million was used for business activities such as Ripple Payments (formerly On-Demand Liquidity), exchange-traded products, and strategic partnerships, while the rest was returned to escrow. Ripple’s evolving escrow practices reflect an effort to balance market supply while supporting ongoing operational needs. While current trends point to a potential depletion within a decade, any further changes in release frequency or retained amounts could significantly impact how long the escrow reserves will last.

In fact, it’s getting wilder, weirder, and way more rewarding. If you’re wondering which Top Meme Coins to Buy for 2025 could turn peanuts into private islands, you’re in the right digital jungle. From mythic quests to meme-powered mayhem, coins like Arctic Pablo Coin , GOHOME, Test, doginme, Banana For Scale, and Keyboard Cat are making serious waves. These aren’t just jokes on the blockchain—they’re cultural movements packed with utility, community, and high-octane returns. Whether it’s Pablo’s icy expedition, GOHOME’s sarcastic rebellion, or Keyboard Cat’s nostalgic remix, these are hands-down the Top Cryptos to Join Now before they blow up. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin: Where Myths Freeze, And Fortunes Melt Imagine a snowmobile slicing through ancient glaciers, chasing coins that shimmer like legends from long-lost empires. Welcome to Arctic Pablo Coin, a meme coin presale unlike anything you’ve seen in crypto—and one of the Top Cryptos to Join Now if you’re hunting for massive ROI and mythical vibes. Each week, Pablo uncovers a new enchanted location, and with it, a new presale chapter. Right now, we’re at Location 31: Frigid Fortress, with the presale price locked at just $0.00047. That’s laughably low compared to its planned listing price of $0.008, offering a potential 1602% ROI. Drop $25,000 in today and walk away with 53,191,500 APC tokens. If APC hits its target listing price? That becomes a jaw-dropping $425,532.00. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), this narrative-driven coin isn’t just another pump-and-dump—it’s a full-blown mythological expedition. With a capped supply of 221.2 billion, Arctic Pablo ignites weekly token burns, slicing through supply like Pablo through ice. These burns create a deflationary crunch that gets nastier (in a good way) as the presale progresses. It’s one of the Top Cryptos to Join Now for investors craving scarcity with storyline. And here’s the kicker: a 66% APY staking program, vested for 2 months post-launch, lets holders earn while Pablo explores. Plus, every burn, every presale phase, every move—fully transparent on BSC. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Arctic Pablo Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coin presales, blending storytelling, deflation, and insane math into one of the Top Cryptos to Join Now before it moons. 2. GOHOME: Satire Meets Serious Gains In a sea of coins begging you to stay, GOHOME tells you to leave—and that’s exactly what’s attracting the degens. GOHOME plays on internet irony with such relentless sarcasm that it accidentally built one of the most loyal meme communities in 2025. The token’s tagline? “Go home, you’re early.” But those who ignored the nudge and bought in saw early gains as GOHOME surged 700% in just two weeks after launch. With frequent Twitter raids, meme contests, and token-gated community events, this project taps into the chaotic Gen Z humor while still maintaining clear tokenomics. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because GOHOME is a walking contradiction—anti-hype that generated mega hype—and that’s exactly what makes it one of the Top Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. 3. Test: The Glitch In The Meme Matrix If Test looks like an accident, that’s the point. Launched with no announcement, no website, and literally named “Test” , this token exploded on X (formerly Twitter) after a prominent influencer joked about aping into it… and it moonshot 1000% in 48 hours. The developers eventually stepped in—still pseudonymous but now active—and built a “debugged” version of the meme coin world. Every token holder gets randomized airdrops, memified bug reports, and retro 8-bit art from the early PC era. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Test represents the unpredictability of meme coin culture—and in crypto, unpredictability can mean profit. 4. doginme: Alpha Dog Energy On-Chain The phrase “He got that dog in him” just became a full-blown blockchain movement. doginme is not just a meme, it’s a motivational, self-aware alpha energy wrapped in a meme token. Think Top G vibes meets doge culture. Utility-wise, it offers a unique social staking platform where holders gain reputation points instead of just tokens. Those points can be redeemed for exclusive content, IRL events, and elite access to alpha trading groups. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because doginme is more than a meme—it’s a whole mindset, and that cultural stickiness is crypto rocket fuel. 5. Banana For Scale: Internet Humor Turned Hyper Asset “Banana for scale.” What started as a silly internet joke about object sizes has become a full-on memecoin with a real market cap—and get this, it’s bananas.

47921331,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=176328,1752104400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/47921331.jpeg,Justin Sun TRUMP Pledge: Unlocking Massive $100M Memecoin Potential,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/justin-sun-trump-memecoin-news/,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to bold moves and unexpected announcements, but even by its standards, the latest news from Tron founder Justin Sun has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape. Imagine a figure as influential as Justin Sun, publicly declaring a staggering commitment to a memecoin. That’s precisely what happened, as Sun outlined on X that the Tron project has pledged to acquire a massive $100 million worth of the TRUMP memecoin . This isn’t just a casual investment; it’s a profound statement, with Sun proclaiming that TRUMP and TRON together represent “the future of crypto.” This significant Justin Sun TRUMP pledge could reshape perceptions and strategies within the volatile memecoin sector. Justin Sun TRUMP Pledge: The $100 Million Catalyst The announcement from Justin Sun is more than just a headline; it’s a potential game-changer. His declaration on X (formerly Twitter) signals a serious intent from the Tron project to back the TRUMP memecoin with substantial capital. A commitment of $100 million is not a trivial sum in any market, especially not in the often-speculative realm of memecoins. Sun’s vision is clear: he sees a symbiotic relationship between the TRUMP token and the Tron network, asserting their combined role as a cornerstone for the future of decentralized finance. What makes this pledge particularly noteworthy is the context. Bitcoin World previously reported that the TRUMP memecoin is slated for launch on the TRON network itself. This integration suggests a strategic alignment, potentially leveraging Tron’s robust infrastructure—known for its high transaction speeds and low fees—to facilitate the memecoin’s growth and accessibility. The sheer volume of this commitment from a major industry player like Justin Sun can act as a powerful catalyst, drawing significant attention, liquidity, and potentially new users to both the TRUMP memecoin and the broader Tron ecosystem. What is the Buzz Around TRUMP Memecoin? Before Justin Sun’s monumental announcement, the TRUMP memecoin was already gaining traction, albeit within its niche. Memecoins are a unique phenomenon in the crypto space, often driven by internet culture, social media trends, and community sentiment rather than traditional utility. The TRUMP memecoin, as its name suggests, is likely tied to political figures or themes, tapping into a different vein of public interest and engagement. Here’s what typically fuels the buzz around a memecoin like TRUMP: Community Enthusiasm: A strong, active community is the lifeblood of any successful memecoin, driving adoption and trading volume. Social Media Virality: Memecoins thrive on trending topics and shareable content across platforms like X, Reddit, and Telegram. Speculative Appeal: The allure of rapid, exponential gains attracts investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Novelty and Niche Appeal: Tokens tied to specific cultural or political narratives can capture dedicated audiences. The decision to launch TRUMP on the TRON network is also strategic. Tron offers a scalable and efficient blockchain environment, which can support the high transaction volumes often associated with popular memecoins, ensuring a smoother user experience for trading and holding the TRUMP memecoin . How Does This Impact the Tron Ecosystem? Justin Sun’s substantial backing of the TRUMP memecoin carries profound implications for the Tron ecosystem . Tron, a blockchain platform known for its focus on decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and high throughput, stands to gain considerably from this high-profile endorsement and capital injection. The potential impacts include: Increased Visibility and Adoption: The $100 million pledge will undoubtedly draw global media attention, spotlighting Tron and potentially attracting new users and developers to its network. Enhanced Liquidity: A significant investment of this magnitude can inject substantial liquidity into the Tron-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) where TRUMP will likely be traded, improving price stability and trading efficiency. Strengthening the Memecoin Narrative: By actively supporting a prominent memecoin, Tron reinforces its position as a versatile blockchain capable of hosting a diverse range of tokens, including those driven by community and speculation. Developer Interest: The influx of activity and attention might encourage more developers to build on Tron, further enriching its dApp ecosystem. However, it also presents challenges. Associating closely with a politically-themed memecoin could expose the Tron ecosystem to specific regulatory or public relations risks. Balancing the benefits of increased liquidity and attention with potential controversies will be crucial for Tron’s long-term strategy. Understanding the Dynamics of Memecoin Investment The memecoin investment landscape is notoriously volatile and distinct from traditional cryptocurrency investments. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which often derive value from their underlying technology, network effects, or utility, memecoins largely rely on community sentiment, social media hype, and often, the “greater fool” theory. Key dynamics of memecoin investment: Factor Description Impact on Price Community Hype Strong social media presence and enthusiastic supporter base. Significant price pumps, but also rapid crashes. Influencer Endorsement Celebrity or prominent figure mentions (like Justin Sun). Massive short-term gains, often followed by corrections. Market Sentiment Overall bullish or bearish mood in the broader crypto market. Memecoins amplify market trends, both up and down. Tokenomics Supply, distribution, and burning mechanisms. Can influence scarcity and long-term value, though often secondary to hype. For potential investors, engaging in memecoin investment requires extreme caution. While the allure of 100x returns is powerful, the risk of total capital loss is equally significant. Due diligence, understanding market sentiment, and only investing what one can afford to lose are paramount. Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Justin Sun’s substantial commitment to a memecoin is not just about TRUMP or Tron; it sends a broader signal to the entire cryptocurrency market . This move could signify a shift in how major players view and interact with the memecoin sector, potentially legitimizing a category often dismissed as purely speculative. Consider these broader implications: Mainstream Acceptance of Memecoins: While still highly speculative, a $100 million pledge from a known figure might push memecoins further into the mainstream crypto discourse, beyond niche communities. Trendsetter for Other Whales/Institutions: If this investment proves successful, it could inspire other high-net-worth individuals or even institutional entities to explore similar high-risk, high-reward memecoin strategies. Focus on Narrative and Community: It reinforces the idea that in crypto, strong narratives and vibrant communities can drive immense value, sometimes even more so than complex technological innovations. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased attention on memecoins, especially those with political ties, could lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny, impacting how these tokens are launched, traded, and promoted globally. The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and this development adds another layer of complexity and excitement, blurring the lines between traditional finance, digital assets, and internet culture. Challenges and Considerations While the potential for significant gains and increased attention is evident, this high-stakes venture also comes with considerable challenges: Volatility Risk: Memecoins are inherently volatile. A $100 million investment could face significant fluctuations, impacting Tron’s balance sheet and reputation. Reputational Risk: Associating with a politically charged token can be divisive and may alienate parts of the broader crypto community or attract unwanted political attention. Sustainability: The long-term viability of memecoins, especially those tied to transient political cycles, remains a major question mark. Will the hype sustain the value over time? Regulatory Landscape: The evolving global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, particularly for politically sensitive tokens, could pose unforeseen hurdles. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For those observing or participating in the crypto space, Justin Sun’s move offers several key takeaways: Diversify and Research: Never put all your eggs in one basket. If considering memecoins, thoroughly research the project, its community, and the risks involved. Monitor Influencer Impact: Understand that endorsements from figures like Justin Sun can create short-term pumps. Be cautious of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Watch the Tron Network: This development is likely to bring more activity to Tron. Explore its dApps and infrastructure if you’re looking for new opportunities. Stay Informed on Regulations: Keep an eye on how regulators react to high-profile memecoin activity, as this could shape future market dynamics. Justin Sun’s audacious pledge of $100 million to the TRUMP memecoin is a testament to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency world. It underscores a growing, albeit risky, trend where significant capital is being directed towards tokens driven by narrative and community rather than purely technological innovation. This move could indeed be a pivotal moment, not only for the TRUMP memecoin and the Tron ecosystem but for the entire cryptocurrency market , forcing a re-evaluation of what constitutes value and potential in the digital asset space. Whether it paves the way for a new era of memecoin legitimacy or serves as a cautionary tale, one thing is certain: all eyes are now on this intriguing intersection of politics, finance, and decentralized technology.

Turtle Capital and Volatility Shares set July 21 for potential XRP ETF debuts. Over 10 spot filings in total await a final SEC decision due by mid-October. Key XRP ETF Launches Await SEC Decision This Month July is packed with deadlines that could shape the future of XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. Several fund issuers are waiting for regulatory clearance to proceed with listings. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not object before the set dates, the funds might see greenlight and begin trading. One of the main players is ProShares, which aims to launch three futures-based XRP ETFs on July 14. These are the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, the UltraShort XRP ETF, and the Short XRP ETF. Each product is structured to give investors exposure to different levels of daily XRP performance, including leveraged and inverse positions. ProShares Sets July 14 as Launch Target The company initially filed its applications in January 2025. A previous effective date of April 30 was moved to July 14, following a June 24 update to its prospectus. As of now, only the Ultra XRP ETF appears on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) list under the ticker UXRP. The other two funds are pending DTCC listing. Unless the SEC raises objections before the deadline, ProShares expects to move forward with all three ETFs on July 14. These products will provide new options for traders interested in futures-based exposure to XRP. There sure is a lot of $XRP ETF deadlines in July pic.twitter.com/kbvPHNVtJy — Nick | Crypto Crusader (@NCashOfficial) July 8, 2025 Turtle Capital and Volatility Shares ETFs in Line for Approval Turtle Capital is also scheduled to launch its 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF on July 21. The SEC is currently reviewing the application. If the agency allows the window to pass without comment, the fund will begin trading on that date. Volatility Shares has similar plans, with two XRP ETFs — a standard and a 2X leveraged version — targeting a July 21 debut. One of its products, the 1X XRP ETF, became effective on July 7, signaling a smooth regulatory process so far. REX-Osprey is another firm waiting for clearance. Its filing is aiming for a July 25 activation date. All of these products are tied to futures contracts rather than spot market holdings. However, while the SEC has not stopped the launch of some futures-based XRP ETFs, it has not yet approved any spot-based versions. More than 10 applications for spot XRP ETFs remain pending. A final decision is expected by mid-October, unless further delays occur.

47921645,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=763237,1752104725,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47921645.jpeg,"Bitcoin hits a new all-time high of $112,052 amid Nvidia-led stock rally",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-hits-a-new-all-time-high-of-112052/,"Bitcoin exploded to a record high of $112,052 late Wednesday afternoon, pushed up by a red-hot rally in tech stocks led by Nvidia, whose surge helped carry the rest of the market straight into the close. The rally broke past the previous all-time high of $111,999, set back in May. At the closing bell, Bitcoin hovered around $110,947.49, up 1.9% on the day, according to Coin Metrics. This move didn’t come out of nowhere. Bitcoin has been stuck in a tight zone for weeks, even as billions of dollars poured into Bitcoin ETFs. But it wasn’t the funds doing the heavy lifting this time. Public companies buying Bitcoin directly outpaced the ETFs in the second quarter, giving the market its first real push in a while. Even with all that action, Bitcoin was only up 2% in the last month, until today changed the game. Nvidia’s market cap touches $4 trillion as tech leads Wednesday’s rally wasn’t limited to crypto. Over in equities, Nvidia briefly hit a $4 trillion market cap, becoming the first company to reach that number even for a moment. That triggered a tech-wide boost that lifted the Nasdaq Composite to a new record close, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Investors also brushed off the newest tariff moves from President Donald Trump, showing they were more focused on risk assets than White House policy shifts. The connection is simple: when traders get aggressive and pile into growth stocks, Bitcoin usually joins the ride. Despite being labeled “digital gold” by institutions, it still moves like a high-risk play. It rises and falls with stocks when sentiment turns risk-on. That’s what happened today—tech ripped, and Bitcoin followed. Expectations for Bitcoin breaking new highs this summer have been building. Corporate treasuries have been loading up, and lawmakers in Washington, D.C. are inching closer to passing long-awaited crypto legislation. The combination of money flowing in and possible regulatory clarity is setting the table for more price jumps in the coming weeks. Traders expect Bitcoin to run past $120K With Crypto Week approaching in D.C., traders are getting more aggressive. Ryan Gorman, chief strategy officer at Uranium Digital, said this might just be the beginning. “With crypto week on the horizon next week in DC, and a likely flood of positive momentum heading into the dog days of summer, bullish sentiment and thinner trading volumes could see prices gap up to $120,000 or higher by the end of next week,” Ryan said. He added that open call interest outweighing puts “normally reveals traders are bullish and expect upward price momentum to continue.” This bullish behavior has been building for a while. But what’s different now is the pace. Corporate buying is ramping up. Retail is waking back up. Options markets are leaning hard toward calls. And for once, everyone’s looking ahead instead of bracing for a sell-off. Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures stayed mostly flat Wednesday evening. Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones barely moved after recouping some losses from the recent tariff-driven slide earlier in the day. The calm didn’t rattle crypto traders, though. They’re still focused on momentum. Chris Kline, the chief operating officer and cofounder of BitcoinIRA, pointed out that macroeconomic conditions haven’t changed. “The same fundamentals of a scarce asset are at play amid record-breaking budgets and debt ceilings,” Chris said . He also mentioned that the regulatory environment is becoming more crypto-friendly, and that Bitcoin is finally gaining real traction among institutional players. But that wasn’t all. Chris also brought up growing speculation about Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s future. “The rumor mill has continued to accelerate speculation that Fed Chair Jerome Powell may either step down or be removed, which has crypto bulls excited about a potential rate cut,” he said. Lower interest rates would make risky assets like Bitcoin even more appealing. Chris wrapped it up by saying, “This is a perfect storm for even the smallest catalyst to springboard Bitcoin and crypto overall to new price discovery levels and … more volatility.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Bitcoin|Nvidia,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-09 23:45:25

Grayscale Investments, a titan in the cryptocurrency investment space, has once again captured the market’s attention with its latest strategic update. As part of its June quarterly rebalance, Grayscale announced a pivotal addition to its Crypto Sectors Index: Space and Time (SXT). This move is more than just a portfolio adjustment; it’s a powerful endorsement of the burgeoning decentralized data landscape and a testament to the continuous evolution of the Web3 ecosystem. Understanding the Grayscale Crypto Index: Why Does Inclusion Matter? Grayscale Investments has long been at the forefront of bringing digital assets to institutional investors. Their suite of products, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has provided regulated avenues for traditional finance to access the crypto market. Central to their offering is the Grayscale Crypto Index , a meticulously curated benchmark designed to provide diversified exposure to various segments of the crypto economy. Unlike single-asset trusts, these indexes aim to capture broader market trends and innovation across different sectors. Inclusion in a Grayscale index is a significant milestone for any cryptocurrency project. It brings: Institutional Validation: Being part of a Grayscale index lends immense credibility and signals to traditional investors that the project meets a certain standard of maturity and potential. Increased Visibility: It places the project on the radar of a much wider audience, including large institutional funds, wealth managers, and accredited investors who might otherwise overlook smaller, innovative projects. Enhanced Liquidity: With institutional interest comes potential for increased trading volume and deeper liquidity, which is crucial for market stability and growth. Capital Inflow: As index funds rebalance to include the new asset, they typically purchase the underlying tokens, creating direct capital inflow for the project. The Grayscale Crypto Sectors Index specifically aims to categorize and track the performance of various segments within the crypto market, providing investors with thematic exposure. This strategic approach allows Grayscale to adapt to market innovations and ensure its offerings remain relevant and reflective of the industry’s growth. Space and Time (SXT): Powering the Future of Web3 Infrastructure The latest addition, Space and Time SXT , is not just another token; it represents a crucial piece of the puzzle for the future of Web3. At its core, Space and Time is a decentralized data warehouse that offers tamper-proof, blockchain-verified data and computation. It aims to bridge the gap between off-chain data and on-chain smart contracts, enabling dApps and enterprises to build more robust, intelligent, and secure applications. Consider the challenges faced by decentralized applications today: Data Access: Most on-chain data is limited. To build complex applications, dApps often need to query large datasets from both on-chain and off-chain sources. Data Integrity: Ensuring the integrity and immutability of off-chain data when used in smart contracts is a significant hurdle. Scalability: Traditional databases are centralized and often struggle with the scale and trustless nature required by decentralized systems. Space and Time addresses these issues with its innovative Proof of SQL technology, which uses zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically guarantee that queries run on its data warehouse are accurate and untampered. This makes it an indispensable component for: DeFi protocols needing real-time market data. Gaming dApps requiring verifiable game state and user data. Enterprise solutions building on blockchain for supply chain, identity, and more. Its inclusion in the Utilities & Services sector alongside giants like Chainlink (LINK), The Graph (GRT), and Filecoin (FIL) is particularly telling. These projects are the foundational layers, the essential tools and services that enable the broader Web3 ecosystem to function and scale. SXT’s role as a decentralized data provider perfectly aligns with this sector’s mission to provide critical infrastructure for the decentralized internet. What Does SXT’s Inclusion Mean for Crypto Index Funds and Investors? The addition of Space and Time (SXT) to Grayscale’s index carries significant implications for Crypto Index Funds and the investors who rely on them for diversified exposure. For starters, it signals Grayscale’s confidence in the long-term viability and growth potential of decentralized data solutions. For investors, this move offers: Exposure to Emerging Technologies: Investors in Grayscale’s Crypto Sectors Index will now automatically gain exposure to a cutting-edge project addressing a critical need in Web3. This reduces the burden of individual research and due diligence for complex, nascent technologies. Diversification within Web3 Infrastructure: SXT complements existing assets in the Utilities & Services sector, further diversifying the fund’s exposure to foundational Web3 services. While Chainlink focuses on oracles and The Graph on indexing, SXT brings robust, verifiable data warehousing to the mix. Potential for Future Growth: If Space and Time achieves its ambitious goals and becomes a cornerstone of decentralized application development, its inclusion could provide significant upside for the index’s performance. This rebalance also highlights Grayscale’s active management strategy, ensuring their index products remain relevant and capture the evolving landscape of digital assets. It demonstrates a proactive approach to identifying and integrating projects that are poised to shape the next generation of the internet. Decentralized Data and the Growing Importance of Web3 Infrastructure The trend towards Decentralized Data solutions is accelerating, driven by the increasing demand for transparency, security, and censorship resistance in the digital realm. Traditional centralized databases, while efficient, present single points of failure and trust requirements that contradict the ethos of blockchain technology. Space and Time’s entry into the Utilities & Services sector underscores the growing recognition of foundational Web3 Infrastructure . This sector is the backbone of the decentralized internet, providing essential services without which dApps cannot thrive. Projects like Chainlink provide external data feeds, The Graph indexes blockchain data for easy querying, and Filecoin offers decentralized storage. Space and Time completes this picture by providing a decentralized, verifiable data warehouse capable of handling complex queries and computations. The synergy within this sector is powerful: A dApp might store its data on Filecoin. It could then use Space and Time to query and analyze that data, combining it with real-time market feeds from Chainlink. Finally, The Graph could index the resulting on-chain interactions for easy access by other applications or users. This integrated ecosystem is what will truly unlock the potential of Web3, moving beyond simple token transfers to complex, data-rich applications that rival or surpass their centralized counterparts in functionality and security. Benefits and Broader Implications The inclusion of SXT in Grayscale’s index has several layers of benefits: For Space and Time: It provides a stamp of approval from a leading institutional player, potentially attracting more developers, users, and further investment. It solidifies SXT’s position as a key player in the decentralized data space. For Grayscale and its Investors: It demonstrates a commitment to innovation and provides diversified exposure to a high-growth sector within Web3. It ensures that the index remains at the cutting edge of the crypto market. For the Web3 Ecosystem: It highlights the maturation of foundational infrastructure layers. As more institutional capital flows into these critical services, it incentivizes further development and adoption, paving the way for more robust and scalable decentralized applications. This strategic rebalance is a clear indicator that the market is increasingly valuing projects that build essential, scalable infrastructure for the future of the internet, rather than just speculative assets. Challenges and Considerations While the news is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge that the crypto market, and particularly the Web3 infrastructure space, is still nascent and faces challenges: Adoption Curve: While promising, widespread adoption of decentralized data solutions by mainstream enterprises is still in its early stages. Technological Complexity: Projects like SXT involve advanced cryptography and distributed systems, which can be complex to understand and integrate. Competition: The decentralized data space is growing, and SXT will face competition from other emerging solutions. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for digital assets could impact the growth and operations of such projects. Despite these challenges, Grayscale’s decision reflects a calculated bet on the long-term necessity and value of verifiable, decentralized data solutions. Actionable Insights for Readers What does this mean for you, whether you’re an investor, a developer, or simply an enthusiast? For Investors: Consider the long-term thesis of Web3 infrastructure. Projects like SXT, LINK, GRT, and FIL are building the foundational layers. While index funds offer diversified exposure, individual research into these projects can provide deeper understanding and potentially inform individual investment decisions. For Developers: Pay attention to the tools and services being adopted by institutional players. Space and Time offers a powerful solution for dApps requiring secure and verifiable off-chain data. Exploring its capabilities could significantly enhance your next project. For Enthusiasts: This move underscores the shift from purely speculative assets to utility-driven projects. The focus is increasingly on real-world applications and the infrastructure needed to support them. Stay informed about these foundational technologies, as they are shaping the future of the internet. A Strategic Leap Towards a Decentralized Future Grayscale’s decision to add Space and Time (SXT) to its Crypto Sectors Index is a powerful statement. It underscores the growing importance of decentralized data solutions and the foundational Web3 Infrastructure that will power the next generation of the internet. This strategic inclusion not only validates SXT’s innovative technology but also provides institutional investors with a new avenue to gain exposure to a critical and rapidly expanding sector of the crypto economy.

Their conversation focused on current market conditions, upcoming regulatory shifts, and projected price trajectories for XRP. Based on their analysis, they outlined how much XRP one might need to accumulate in anticipation of a significant price increase. Regulatory Catalysts and Market Shifts Nassif emphasized that upcoming legislative developments could serve as key triggers for an XRP price surge. He referenced Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s upcoming appearance before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, as well as the House of Representatives’ scheduled review of the Crypto Clarity Act. These events, according to him, signal growing political and financial sector engagement with digital assets, which could influence investor sentiment and drive institutional interest. He also drew attention to data from the XRP Rich List . Currently, holding 2,500 XRP places an investor among the top 10% of all XRP wallets globally, while reaching the top 1% requires ownership of approximately 51,300 tokens. Nassif stated that most investors may not realize how relatively small holdings can position them in the upper tier of XRP ownership. He further argued that XRP does not need to outperform the entire crypto market, but simply needs to follow a growth trajectory similar to Bitcoin’s historical rise. Projections: How Much XRP to Become a Millionaire Johnny broke down the process of reaching $1 million in XRP holdings by introducing three potential market scenarios, divided between a speculative phase and a utility-driven phase. He believes the speculative phase could be activated by regulatory clarity, especially the passage of the Crypto Clarity Act. If XRP reaches $10 to $12 within the next two years, an investor would need to hold around 100,000 XRP to hit the $1 million mark. In a scenario where XRP climbs to $54, a holding of only 18,000 XRP would be sufficient. At a projected price of $25 per token, owning 40,000 XRP would bring an investor close to $1 million. These projections suggest that investors would need to accumulate between 18,000 and 100,000 XRP, depending on the extent of market momentum post-regulation. At current prices, this translates to an investment of approximately $41,760 to $232,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Rising Barriers to Entry Nassif pointed out that the cost of entering elite XRP ownership levels has risen significantly over the past year. For example, in late 2024, 2,500 XRP could be acquired for roughly $500, whereas that same amount now exceeds $5,000. He warned that this trend is likely to continue as more institutional players enter the market and absorb available supply. He estimated that securing a position in the top 1% of XRP wallets today would require an investment of around $100,000. If XRP were to reach $50 in the future, that holding would be valued at approximately $5 million. Nassif added that owning 25,000 XRP may be sufficient to reach the $1 million threshold, especially given the projected direction of the digital asset sector. In comparing XRP with Bitcoin , Nassif explained that Bitcoin would require a $2 trillion increase in market capitalization to double in value, whereas XRP could achieve similar growth with just $130 billion in new market cap. This, he argued, reflects XRP’s relatively higher potential for return on investment. Johnny advised investors not to delay action. He believes that XRP’s current pricing may not last long, particularly if regulation accelerates market growth. His sentiments are similar to views shared by other analysts like Edoardo Farina, who have repeatedly stressed the narrowing window for affordable entry into XRP. Ultimately, how much XRP an investor needs depends on the level of risk they’re willing to take and their expectations for the market. While projections vary, the consensus remains that early positioning could offer considerable upside. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Smart investors are already focusing on standout presales that could follow the early days of legendary coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Three names are catching serious attention: SHIBA INU, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. Thousands of early buyers are positioning themselves now, knowing these opportunities could be ranked top performers this year. Let’s look at why MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strongest pick. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Leading This List MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as one of the top meme-powered political altcoins on the market. The coin’s presale stages have sold out at record speed, showing how hungry investors are for a project that combines cultural energy with real decentralized principles. Every new stage reaches higher levels in hours, proving that supply is limited and demand keeps pushing higher. One of the strongest points for MAGACOIN FINANCE is its capped 170 billion token supply. This fixed supply structure gives it a clear scarcity advantage over many open-ended altcoins. On top of that, it runs on a zero-tax model, making trading cleaner and more transparent for early buyers. The contract is fully audited by HashEx, which adds another layer of trust. Unlike typical meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into a wider political and cultural angle. This means it’s attracting not just crypto enthusiasts, but also people interested in bigger narratives and community-driven governance. Analysts say this positioning gives it a shot to become the next Doge or SHIB, but with an ideological edge. Momentum is so strong that some traders are placing it on watchlists alongside XRP and Ethereum. This is exactly the phase that smart money loves: limited spots, sold-out rounds, and massive traction that hints at bigger moves ahead. SHIBA INU Eyes AI Growth in 2025 SHIBA INU remains a staple name among meme coin traders. Its core community is loyal and active, which is helping fuel new developments. The SHIBA INU team plans to roll out AI-powered projects to boost the coin’s reach and utility. With Shytoshi leading the vision, SHIB wants to move beyond its meme status and become a force in AI-driven blockchain spaces. This big AI push has sparked new excitement. The community expects that if SHIB can break key resistance levels, the coin could test price targets above $0.00003 in Q3. Some analysts even mention an extreme upside scenario of hitting $0.0000326 if the market rides a meme coin supercycle this year. With social engagement still ranking high, SHIB keeps its spot as one of the most popular meme coins on the planet. Solana’s Institutional Wave Gains Pace Solana is the other major project on this 2025 radar, and for good reason. It’s pulling in serious institutional attention. The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF has just launched, adding fuel to Solana’s already growing DeFi and NFT ecosystem. Mainstream predictions for Q4 2025 place Solana in a strong position if the market stays healthy. Some technical models suggest a near-term rally to $208, with many forecasts clustering between $208 and $250. This is based on steady ETF inflows and robust DeFi activity that keep Solana’s network fundamentals strong. Traders eye Solana for its blend of institutional money and high-speed blockchain tech, which keeps it near the top of every watchlist. Final Verdict: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Strongest Pick SHIBA INU and Solana both offer powerful reasons to stay on investor watchlists this year. But when you compare all three, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strongest presale opportunity for 2025. Its sold-out rounds, limited supply, and political meme power are pulling in thousands of early supporters. With top analysts forecasting major moves ahead, this is the one that could capture the energy of early Dogecoin and Shiba Inu days — and take it even further.

Recent reports from Santiment, a leading crypto market intelligence platform, indicate a significant shift in the landscape for XRP. If you’ve been watching the charts, you’ve likely noticed that XRP whales are making moves, with their balances hitting a seven-week high. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a powerful signal that could reshape the narrative around one of the market’s most prominent digital assets. What’s Behind the XRP Whale Accumulation? When we talk about ‘whales’ in the crypto space, we’re referring to large holders of a particular cryptocurrency. These are entities, often individuals or institutions, that hold substantial amounts, enough to potentially influence market dynamics. Santiment’s latest data, shared via X, reveals that XRP has surged past the $2.39 mark, a level not seen since May 23. More importantly, the number of wallets holding at least one million XRP tokens is on the rise, and their collective balances are increasing significantly. This surge in whale accumulation suggests a deep-seated confidence in XRP’s long-term prospects. So, why are these large players accumulating? Several factors could be at play: Long-Term Vision: Whales often have a longer investment horizon, looking beyond short-term volatility. Their accumulation could signal a belief in XRP’s fundamental value and future utility. Market Sentiment: Positive developments, regulatory clarity (or anticipation of it), and general bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market can encourage large holders to increase their positions. Strategic Positioning: Accumulating at specific price points allows whales to position themselves favorably for potential future price rallies. Analyzing the XRP Price Surge and Market Dynamics The recent jump in XRP price above $2.39 is a critical milestone. This seven-week high not only reflects increased buying pressure but also potentially marks a breakout from previous consolidation phases. While whale activity is a strong indicator, it’s essential to consider other market dynamics that contribute to such price movements. These can include: Broader Market Trends: The overall health and direction of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin’s performance, often influence altcoins like XRP. News and Developments: Any significant announcements related to Ripple, partnerships, or regulatory outcomes can have a direct impact on XRP’s valuation. Trading Volume: A healthy increase in trading volume accompanying a price surge lends credibility to the move, indicating genuine market interest rather than just a few large trades. Understanding the interplay between these factors provides a more holistic view of XRP’s current trajectory. The confidence displayed by whales, combined with positive market sentiment, creates a powerful upward momentum. The Role of Crypto Market Intelligence in Tracking Digital Asset Trends Platforms like Santiment are indispensable for investors navigating the complex world of cryptocurrencies. Their ability to provide granular data on on-chain metrics, social sentiment, and whale movements offers unparalleled insights. This crypto market intelligence allows investors to: Identify Trends Early: Spotting patterns in large holder behavior or network activity before they become mainstream news. Assess Market Health: Understanding the underlying health of a network beyond just price charts, by looking at active addresses, transaction counts, and development activity. Mitigate Risks: Recognizing potential red flags or areas of concern by analyzing unusual whale movements or sentiment shifts. The report on XRP whales is a prime example of how such intelligence empowers investors. It provides concrete data points that support the narrative of growing confidence in this particular digital asset , moving beyond mere speculation. Implications of Whale Accumulation for the Future of XRP What does this sustained whale accumulation mean for the future of XRP and its community? The implications are multifaceted: Benefits: Price Stability and Growth Potential: Large holders can act as a stabilizing force, providing liquidity and potentially absorbing sell-offs. Their continued accumulation suggests they anticipate significant future growth. Validation of the Asset: When institutional or large individual investors commit substantial capital, it often validates the underlying technology and use case of the digital asset in the eyes of the broader market. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): A strong base of long-term holders can sometimes reduce extreme short-term price swings. Challenges: Concentration Risk: A high concentration of tokens in the hands of a few entities can sometimes lead to concerns about market manipulation, although this is heavily debated and often overstated for liquid assets. Market Dependence: While whales signal confidence, their actions alone don’t guarantee future success. External factors like regulatory clarity remain crucial. Actionable Insights for Investors: For retail investors, observing whale movements can be a valuable, though not definitive, indicator. It’s crucial to: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow whale activity. Understand the fundamentals of XRP, its technology, partnerships, and regulatory landscape. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Crypto markets are inherently volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Diversify: While XRP shows promise, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with single-asset exposure. Conclusion: A Resounding Vote of Confidence The latest data from Santiment paints a compelling picture: XRP whales are not just holding; they are actively accumulating, pushing balances to a seven-week high and signaling a profound confidence in the digital asset. This sustained interest from large holders, combined with the recent XRP price surge, underscores a growing conviction in its potential. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the insights provided by crypto market intelligence platforms become invaluable, offering a window into the strategic moves of key players. While no investment is without risk, the current trends suggest a bullish outlook for XRP, driven by those with the deepest pockets and, presumably, the clearest long-term vision.

The SEC’s acknowledgment of an amendment from Bitwise concerning physical redemptions for its proposed Spot Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETFs is more than just bureaucratic paperwork; it’s a crucial signal that could shape the future of institutional crypto adoption. This move brings us closer to a new era where mainstream investors can access digital assets with greater ease and regulatory clarity. What Does it Mean When the SEC Acknowledges an Amendment? When the SEC acknowledges an amendment, it signifies that the regulatory body has officially received and begun reviewing updated filings from an applicant. In this case, Bitwise submitted an amendment detailing how its proposed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs would handle ‘physical redemptions.’ This isn’t an approval, but it’s a necessary procedural step that indicates the application is still active and being considered. For the crypto market, every such acknowledgment is scrutinized for hints about the SEC’s evolving stance on digital asset products, especially after a period of significant regulatory caution. Historically, the SEC has been hesitant to approve spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the underlying assets. However, the landscape has been shifting, particularly following landmark court decisions and increased institutional interest. Bitwise, a prominent player in the crypto investment space, has been at the forefront of pushing for these products, continually refining their applications to meet regulatory expectations. This latest amendment suggests a proactive approach by Bitwise to address potential SEC concerns, particularly around the mechanics of ETF operations. The Game-Changer: Understanding Physical Redemptions One of the most significant aspects of Bitwise’s amendment is its focus on Physical Redemptions . To understand why this is a potential game-changer, let’s compare it with the more common ‘cash redemption’ model: Cash Redemption Model: In this model, when an investor wants to redeem their ETF shares, the issuer sells the underlying assets (e.g., Bitcoin) in the open market and gives the investor cash. This method can introduce tax complexities for the issuer and potentially impact the underlying asset’s price through selling pressure. Physical Redemption Model: Here, when an investor redeems ETF shares, they receive the actual underlying asset (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) directly, rather than cash. This is often preferred by institutional investors and large market makers because it allows for more efficient arbitrage opportunities, potentially leading to tighter tracking between the ETF’s price and the underlying asset’s price. It also avoids certain tax events for the issuer that arise from selling assets. For the SEC, allowing physical redemptions could be seen as a step towards greater integration of crypto assets into traditional financial frameworks, albeit with careful oversight. It addresses concerns about how the ETF interacts with the spot market and could provide a more direct, transparent link to the underlying digital assets. This mechanism is crucial for market makers to efficiently create and redeem ETF shares, ensuring the ETF trades close to its net asset value (NAV) and maintaining market integrity. Cash vs. Physical Redemption in ETFs Feature Cash Redemption Physical Redemption Underlying Asset Exchange Issuer sells assets for cash; investor receives cash. Issuer directly transfers assets; investor receives assets. Tax Implications (for issuer) Potential capital gains/losses on asset sales. Generally no direct tax event on asset transfer. Arbitrage Efficiency Less direct, potential for slight tracking errors. More direct, better for precise arbitrage. Market Impact Can create selling pressure on underlying asset. Direct transfer, less direct market impact from redemption. Institutional Preference Less preferred for large-scale operations. Often preferred for operational efficiency. The Road Paved for a Spot Bitcoin ETF The journey towards a fully approved Spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. has been long and arduous, marked by numerous rejections and delays. However, 2024 has witnessed a breakthrough with the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs, transforming how investors can gain exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. These approvals have been hailed as a watershed moment, bringing Bitcoin into the mainstream financial ecosystem and attracting significant institutional capital. The SEC’s current acknowledgment of Bitwise’s amendment builds on this momentum, signaling continued refinement and potential expansion of the existing framework. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has democratized access to Bitcoin, allowing investors to trade it through traditional brokerage accounts without the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up wallets or managing private keys. This has opened the floodgates for new capital, providing a regulated, accessible, and often more cost-effective way to invest in Bitcoin. The success of these initial products has likely encouraged further regulatory review and a deeper understanding of the mechanisms required for their smooth operation, including the nuanced details of redemption processes. What About the Spot Ethereum ETF? While Bitcoin has garnered much of the spotlight, the prospect of a Spot Ethereum ETF is also gaining significant traction. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi, represents another critical pillar of the crypto economy. Many analysts believe that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs sets a precedent for Ethereum, as the underlying regulatory and market dynamics share many similarities. However, there are unique considerations for Ethereum, particularly concerning its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and its classification by the SEC. Bitwise’s amendment for both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests a comprehensive strategy to address regulatory concerns for both major cryptocurrencies. The path for an Ethereum ETF might be slightly different due to its distinct features and ongoing regulatory discussions about whether ETH should be classified as a security or a commodity. Nevertheless, the SEC’s engagement with Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF amendment indicates that discussions are progressing, and the possibility of an ETH ETF joining its BTC counterpart in the near future remains high, offering investors diversified exposure to the top two digital assets. Bitwise ETFs: Pioneering the Next Wave of Crypto Investment Bitwise ETFs have consistently been at the forefront of bringing crypto assets into regulated financial products. From their early efforts in launching crypto index funds to their persistent pursuit of spot ETFs, Bitwise has demonstrated a commitment to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space. Their strategic filings and amendments, like the one recently acknowledged by the SEC, highlight their dedication to meeting stringent regulatory requirements and innovating within the evolving crypto landscape. Bitwise’s proactive approach in proposing physical redemptions underscores their understanding of institutional needs and market efficiency. By addressing these intricate operational details, they aim to create ETF products that are not only compliant but also highly attractive to a broad range of investors, from retail participants seeking easy access to sophisticated institutional players looking for efficient arbitrage mechanisms. Their ongoing efforts are crucial in shaping the regulatory dialogue and setting benchmarks for future crypto-backed financial products. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the SEC’s acknowledgment is a positive step, the road to full approval for all aspects of these ETFs, especially those involving physical redemptions, still presents challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains high, and the SEC will likely demand robust frameworks for custody, valuation, and market surveillance to protect investors. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies will continue to be a factor for both regulators and investors to consider. However, the opportunities are immense. The approval of more sophisticated ETF structures, such as those with physical redemption capabilities, could further legitimize digital assets as an asset class, attracting even more capital and fostering greater market liquidity. It could also spur innovation in related financial services and products, cementing cryptocurrencies’ place in the global financial system. For investors, it means more options, greater flexibility, and potentially lower costs for gaining exposure to this dynamic asset class. Conclusion: A Step Towards Maturation The U.S. SEC’s acknowledgment of Bitwise’s amendment for physical redemptions in its proposed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs marks another significant milestone in the journey of digital assets into mainstream finance. While not an outright approval, it signals continued engagement and a deeper dive into the operational mechanics that are crucial for robust, regulated ETF products. The focus on physical redemptions highlights a move towards greater efficiency and alignment with institutional preferences, potentially paving the way for more sophisticated and attractive investment vehicles. This development underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the persistent efforts of firms like Bitwise to innovate within regulatory boundaries. As the dialogue between innovators and regulators continues, the prospect of more accessible and diverse crypto investment products becomes increasingly real, promising a future where digital assets play an even more integral role in global portfolios. Keep a close watch on these developments, as they are shaping the financial landscape of tomorrow.

Bitcoin’s price has once again defied expectations, breaching the significant 150 million won (KRW) mark on South Korea’s leading exchange, Upbit. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful statement about Bitcoin’s enduring strength, the robust appetite of the Korean crypto market , and the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets . For many, this milestone represents not just financial gain, but a validation of the decentralized future that blockchain technology promises. Let’s dive deep into what this historic achievement means for investors, the market, and the broader financial landscape. What Does a Bitcoin Price of 150 Million Won Mean for Korea? The psychological impact of Bitcoin surpassing 150 million won cannot be overstated, particularly within the highly active South Korean investment community. This isn’t merely a local record; it signifies a new peak in a market known for its intense trading volumes and unique dynamics. When Bitcoin hits such a formidable figure, it triggers a ripple effect: Investor Confidence Boost: Existing holders see their portfolios swell, reinforcing their belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. New Investor Influx: The headline-grabbing number attracts new retail investors, eager not to miss out on what appears to be a parabolic ascent. This FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) often fuels further price increases. Increased Market Liquidity: Higher prices and renewed interest typically lead to more trading activity, enhancing market depth and liquidity on platforms like Upbit. Validation for Digital Assets: For a country that has seen both booms and busts in crypto, reaching this new high solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate, albeit volatile, investment vehicle. It moves beyond speculative asset to a recognized store of value for many. This milestone also highlights the ‘Kimchi Premium’ phenomenon, where Bitcoin often trades at a higher price on South Korean exchanges compared to global averages. This premium reflects the strong domestic demand and capital controls, making the 150 million won mark even more impressive within its local context. Unpacking the Unique Dynamics of the Korean Crypto Market South Korea stands out as one of the most vibrant and influential Korean crypto markets globally. Its distinct characteristics play a crucial role in Bitcoin’s price movements and the overall adoption of digital assets : High Retail Participation: A significant portion of the Korean population, particularly younger demographics, actively participates in cryptocurrency trading. This grassroots interest drives considerable market activity. Technologically Savvy Population: South Korea’s advanced technological infrastructure and high internet penetration make it fertile ground for digital innovations like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Landscape: The Korean government has been proactive in establishing regulations for the crypto sector, aiming to balance innovation with investor protection. While strict at times, this regulatory clarity has also lent a degree of legitimacy to the market. The ‘Kimchi Premium’ Explained: This persistent phenomenon, where cryptocurrencies trade at a premium in Korea compared to international markets, is a testament to strong domestic demand and limited arbitrage opportunities due to capital controls. When Bitcoin reaches 150 million won in Korea, it often means it’s trading significantly higher than its USD equivalent elsewhere. Understanding these unique dynamics is key to appreciating the full impact of Bitcoin’s recent surge. The market’s maturity and investor sophistication contribute to its resilience and rapid response to global trends. The Role of Upbit Exchange in Bitcoin’s Korean Triumph No discussion of Bitcoin’s performance in Korea is complete without acknowledging the pivotal role of the Upbit exchange . As the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea by trading volume, Upbit is the primary gateway for millions of Korean investors to access the crypto market. Its dominance means that its price reflects the collective sentiment and trading activity of a significant portion of the nation’s crypto enthusiasts. Upbit offers a robust trading platform, a wide array of digital assets, and high liquidity, making it the preferred choice for both seasoned traders and newcomers. The platform’s ability to handle massive trading volumes efficiently is crucial during periods of rapid price appreciation, like Bitcoin’s climb to 150 million won . The seamless execution of trades on Upbit directly contributes to the market’s efficiency and investor confidence. Key Features of Upbit that Contribute to Market Health: Feature Impact on Market High Liquidity Ensures smooth trading, minimizes price slippage, especially during volatile periods. Wide Range of Assets Attracts diverse investors, offers more trading opportunities beyond Bitcoin. Strong Security Measures Builds trust among users, essential for protecting large sums of digital assets . User-Friendly Interface Lowers the barrier to entry for new investors, fostering broader adoption. The activity on the Upbit exchange is a powerful barometer for the health and direction of the entire Korean crypto market . When Bitcoin reaches new highs on Upbit, it’s a clear signal of strong domestic demand. Beyond Bitcoin: The Broader Impact on Digital Assets in Korea While Bitcoin often captures the headlines, its monumental surge to 150 million won has a significant ripple effect across the entire spectrum of digital assets . Historically, Bitcoin’s strong performance tends to pull the rest of the altcoin market higher, a phenomenon often referred to as ‘altcoin season’ or ‘trickle-down effect’. For the Korean market, this means: Increased Altcoin Interest: As Bitcoin’s price becomes less accessible for some new investors, or as existing investors seek higher potential returns, attention often shifts to other cryptocurrencies. Growth in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and NFTs: The renewed interest in the broader crypto space encourages exploration of innovative sectors like DeFi, which offers decentralized financial services, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which represent digital ownership. Innovation and Development: A thriving market provides incentives for developers and entrepreneurs to build new blockchain projects and applications, further solidifying Korea’s position as a hub for crypto innovation. Regulatory Scrutiny and Adaptation: With increased market activity and value, regulators may also intensify their focus on consumer protection and market integrity, leading to a more mature and regulated environment for all digital assets . The current bullish sentiment, largely driven by Bitcoin’s impressive Bitcoin price action, is fostering an environment where a wider array of blockchain-based projects can gain traction and adoption within the Korean crypto market . Navigating the Momentum: Challenges and Actionable Insights for Investors While the surge past 150 million won is cause for celebration, it’s crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market, by its very nature, is highly volatile. What goes up can also come down, sometimes dramatically. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing in any digital assets , thoroughly research the project, its technology, team, and market cap. Don’t rely solely on hype. Understand Risk Tolerance: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin’s journey to 150 million won has been filled with significant corrections. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a strong performer, consider diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or even traditional assets to mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if you are investing for short-term gains or long-term growth. Different strategies apply to each. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global macroeconomic factors, regulatory changes, and technological developments that can impact the Bitcoin price and the broader Korean crypto market . For those considering entering the market or expanding their portfolios on the Upbit exchange , this period of high momentum offers both opportunities and heightened risks. Prudent decision-making and a clear strategy are paramount. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin and the Korean Market? The question on everyone’s mind is, “What’s next?” While no one can predict the future with certainty, several factors could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory beyond 150 million won and the overall health of the Korean crypto market : Global Macroeconomic Conditions: Inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can all impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Institutional Adoption: Continued influx of institutional money through spot ETFs and corporate treasury allocations could provide significant buying pressure, pushing the Bitcoin price even higher. Technological Developments: Upgrades to the Bitcoin network or the broader blockchain ecosystem could enhance utility and drive demand for digital assets . Regulatory Clarity: Further clear and supportive regulations in major economies, including South Korea, could provide more confidence for both retail and institutional investors. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply reduction events (halvings) have historically preceded significant bull runs. The recent halving’s impact is still unfolding. The journey of Bitcoin has always been marked by volatility, but its resilience and growing acceptance are undeniable. The Korean crypto market , with its unique characteristics and enthusiastic participant base, will undoubtedly continue to play a crucial role in this global narrative. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin in Korea Bitcoin’s ascent past the 150 million won mark on the Upbit exchange is more than just a fleeting headline; it’s a testament to the cryptocurrency’s growing maturity, its unwavering appeal, and the dynamic strength of the Korean crypto market . This historic achievement solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a premier digital asset and opens new discussions about its role in the global financial system. While the path ahead may be volatile, this milestone serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of decentralized finance. It underscores the importance of staying informed, managing risk, and embracing the evolving landscape of digital currencies.

The regulation, under the Stablecoin Bill, will come into effect on August 1, when the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) begins accepting formal applications. Major Firms Line Up for Stablecoin Licenses Firms that have publicly stated their intent to apply include JD.com, Ant Group, Standard Chartered, and Circle. Several law firms assisting clients with preparation told Yicai they are managing ongoing consultations for others still finalizing application materials. Alex Zuo, who oversees the payments division at Cobo, said most candidates are large mainland Chinese firms. “Many small and medium-sized companies are not qualified to apply and are only using the topic for short-term publicity,” he said. Entities preparing to apply include digital finance providers, logistics firms with overseas operations, and internet companies. Several are hiring for blockchain compliance and engineering roles. Use cases under consideration include stablecoin issuance, settlement infrastructure, and multi-address wallet tools to facilitate fiat conversion. Zuo described a growing separation between companies committed to developing stablecoin-based services and those issuing public statements with limited technical or operational backing.

He added that full transaction costs, when accounting for exchange fees, on-chain processing, and compliance checks, may be close to one percent. The stablecoin process in Hong Kong now serves as a case for how financial authorities structure regulated issuance without adopting crypto-native practices wholesale. Licensing volume remains low, while demand among qualified institutions continues to increase. Several jurisdictions are also advancing their own stablecoin frameworks, with Singapore, Japan, and the EU pursuing licensing rules focused on payments and reserve assets. Each model represents different approaches to integrating private digital currencies into formal oversight. The outcome in Hong Kong may shape how Asian financial centers balance reserve backing, compliance requirements, and operational scope. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why are smaller firms unlikely to receive licenses? Many lack technical and operational capacity and are engaging with the topic for publicity rather than implementation. How does Hong Kong’s approach compare to other jurisdictions? While Singapore, Japan, and the EU focus on payment use and reserve requirements, Hong Kong’s approach emphasizes regulatory structure and formal oversight without adopting crypto-native models. Are stablecoins expected to reduce transaction costs? Analysts say costs may still reach 1% when accounting for fees, compliance, and on-chain expenses, challenging assumptions about efficiency gains.

Bitcoin & Ethereum Showing Different Degrees Of Correlation To Other Assets In a post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) has talked about how the latest Correlation Matrix has looked between the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and traditional markets. The “Correlation Matrix” here refers to an indicator that tells us how closely tied together the prices of two given assets currently are. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the assets are reacting to moves in each other by moving in the same direction to some degree. The closer the metric is to 1, the stronger the relationship. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies there is a negative correlation between the two prices. That is, they are moving in opposite directions. For this side of the scale, the extreme point is -1. Naturally, the Correlation Matrix showing a value exactly equal to zero suggests there is no correlation whatsoever between the assets. In statistics, the two variables are said to be ‘independent’ in this case. Now, here is the table shared by Sentora that shows how the Correlation Matrix of Bitcoin and Ethereum stands with respect to some traditional markets: As is visible above, the index that Bitcoin and Ethereum have the strongest positive correlation to is DAX. That said, the Correlation Matrix stands at 0.46 for ETH, meaning that while some correlation does exist, it’s not too intense. This isn’t the case for Bitcoin, which has the indicator sitting at 0.85, indicating its price is pretty in tandem with DAX. Likewise, BTC has a notable correlation to other stock market indices, with a metric value of 0.7, 0.68, and 0.69 for the Russel 2000, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, respectively. In contrast, Ethereum is almost fully independent from these indices, with the indicator standing quite close to zero for each of them. For US Dollar Index and VIX Index, the last two markets listed in the table, the Correlation Matrix is inside the negative zone for Bitcoin. This means that the digital asset has actively been moving against these indices.

Then you’ve likely noticed the recent impressive performance of the US stock market . The three major U.S. stock market indices closed higher, signaling a renewed sense of optimism that could have interesting implications for the world of digital assets. While crypto markets often march to their own drum, understanding the pulse of traditional finance, especially the US stock market , is crucial for any savvy investor. Understanding the Latest US Stock Market Rally The past trading session brought good news for investors in traditional equities, as the prominent stock market indices demonstrated robust performance. This collective upward movement often reflects a broader investor confidence in the economic outlook, corporate earnings, or future monetary policy. Let’s break down the numbers: S&P 500: +0.60% – This index is often considered the best gauge of large-cap U.S. equities, representing 500 leading publicly traded companies. Its rise indicates widespread strength across various sectors. Nasdaq: +0.94% – Home to many of the world’s largest technology and growth companies, the Nasdaq’s significant climb suggests a strong appetite for innovation and future-oriented businesses. Dow: +0.49% – The Dow Jones Industrial Average, comprising 30 significant U.S. companies, also moved higher, reflecting stability and growth in established industries. This positive close across all major stock market indices is more than just a daily fluctuation; it can be a barometer for investor sentiment globally. But what does this mean for your crypto portfolio? Why Are Stock Market Indices Surging? The factors driving these impressive gains in stock market indices are multifaceted. Often, such rallies are fueled by a combination of positive economic data, encouraging corporate earnings reports, and expectations regarding central bank policies. For instance, signs of cooling inflation, a resilient job market, or hints of future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve can inject optimism into the markets. When investors feel confident about the economy’s direction, they tend to allocate more capital towards riskier assets, including stocks and, by extension, potentially cryptocurrencies. Consider the following drivers that typically contribute to a strong market day: Factor Impact on Stock Market Potential Crypto Link Positive Economic Data Signals healthy growth, lower inflation, or strong employment. Increases overall risk appetite, potentially boosting crypto. Strong Corporate Earnings Companies exceeding profit expectations. Reflects business health, can attract investment across sectors. Favorable Fed Outlook Expectations of stable or lower interest rates. Lowers borrowing costs, makes riskier assets more attractive. Investor Confidence General belief in market stability and growth. Encourages capital flow into various asset classes. The Nasdaq Gains and Its Tech Ripple Effect The Nasdaq gains , specifically, are particularly noteworthy for crypto enthusiasts. The Nasdaq Composite Index is heavily weighted towards technology and growth companies. Many blockchain projects and cryptocurrency-related firms are inherently tech-driven, sharing similar investor bases and growth narratives with the companies listed on the Nasdaq. When tech stocks perform well, it often indicates a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more willing to bet on high-growth, innovative sectors. This correlation isn’t always direct or immediate, but a robust tech sector in traditional markets can: Boost Investor Sentiment: A thriving tech sector can spill over into a positive outlook for other innovative and digital asset classes. Increase Capital Flow: Profits from successful tech investments might find their way into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Reflect Innovation Appetite: Strong performance in tech often signals a broader market appreciation for disruptive technologies, a core tenet of blockchain. Therefore, paying attention to the Nasdaq gains can offer valuable insights into the broader tech investment climate, which often influences crypto valuations. S&P 500 and Dow Jones: Broader Market Confidence While the Nasdaq highlights the tech connection, the strong performance of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average reflects a more generalized optimism across the economy. The S&P 500 , being a broader representation of the U.S. economy, rising signifies that confidence isn’t confined to just one sector. Similarly, the Dow Jones , with its focus on established industrial giants, signals health in foundational economic pillars. When these broader indices show strength, it suggests that: The economic outlook is perceived as stable or improving. Corporate profitability is strong across diverse industries. Overall market liquidity and investor funds are ample. This macro-level confidence can create a favorable backdrop for all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. A healthy traditional market can mean more disposable capital for speculative investments and a general willingness to take on more risk, which benefits crypto. Navigating Crypto Volatility Amidst Stock Market Trends While the positive movements in the US stock market are generally a good sign for crypto, it’s crucial for investors to remember that correlation does not equal causation. Cryptocurrencies have their own unique drivers, including technological advancements (e.g., Ethereum upgrades), regulatory news, institutional adoption, and specific market narratives (e.g., Bitcoin halving cycles). However, understanding the interplay between traditional finance and crypto is key. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Macro Trends: Keep an eye on inflation data, interest rate decisions, and global economic reports. These influence both stock and crypto markets. Diversify Wisely: While a rising tide lifts all boats, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Understand Risk Appetite: A strong stock market often indicates higher risk appetite, which can flow into crypto. However, be prepared for potential shifts if traditional markets face headwinds. Focus on Fundamentals: Beyond market sentiment, always research the underlying technology, use cases, and development teams of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. The crypto market remains highly volatile, but insights from the broader financial world, particularly the performance of major stock market indices , can provide valuable context for your investment decisions. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Optimism for Digital Assets The recent strong close for the US stock market indices – the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow – paints a picture of renewed investor confidence and a ‘risk-on’ sentiment. While cryptocurrencies operate in a distinct ecosystem, their increasing correlation with traditional markets means that such positive movements can often signal a more favorable environment for digital assets. The significant Nasdaq gains , in particular, highlight the continued investor appetite for technology and innovation, a sentiment that often extends to the crypto space. As the broader market shows resilience, it creates a backdrop where investors might feel more comfortable exploring the potential of cryptocurrencies. However, vigilance and a deep understanding of both macro trends and crypto-specific fundamentals remain paramount for navigating this exciting, yet dynamic, investment landscape.

This move, revealing letters sent to various global leaders, signals a potentially dramatic shift in the ongoing narrative of US trade relations and could have far-reaching economic implications across the globe. What does this mean for the intricate web of global trade? What Are These New Trump Tariffs and Who’s Affected? In a bold declaration, Donald Trump unveiled details of new tariff impositions, targeting a diverse group of nations. This follows his earlier actions during his presidency and indicates a consistent approach to leveraging trade as a tool for negotiation and influence. The letters, shared publicly, specify varying tariff percentages for each country, reflecting a tailored approach rather than a blanket measure. It’s crucial to understand the specifics of these newly announced duties to grasp their potential impact. Here’s a breakdown of the countries and the announced tariff rates: Country Tariff Rate Brazil 50% Libya 30% Iraq 30% Algeria 30% Sri Lanka 30% Brunei 25% Moldova 25% Philippines 20% This latest batch brings the total number of countries notified of tariff impositions by Trump to 22, showcasing a broad and aggressive stance on international trade policy . These aren’t minor adjustments; the rates, especially the 50% on Brazil, are substantial and designed to create significant pressure on the affected economies. Understanding the Global Trade Impact of Such Moves Whenever a major economy like the United States announces new tariffs, the ripple effects are felt far beyond the immediate borders of the involved nations. The global trade impact of these new Trump tariffs could manifest in several ways, affecting supply chains, commodity prices, and even consumer costs. For instance, a 50% tariff on Brazil could significantly impact agricultural exports or other key commodities, potentially shifting global market dynamics. Similarly, tariffs on nations like Iraq and Libya, often significant oil producers, could have broader energy market implications, though the specific goods targeted by these tariffs would determine the exact nature of the impact. Consider the potential challenges: Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies relying on imports from these countries might need to seek alternative suppliers, leading to increased costs or delays. Retaliatory Measures: Affected countries might respond with their own tariffs on U.S. goods, escalating trade tensions and creating a tit-for-tat scenario. Consumer Price Increases: Tariffs are often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for imported goods, reducing purchasing power. Reduced Trade Volumes: Higher costs associated with tariffs can lead to a decrease in overall trade between the U.S. and the affected nations. These actions underscore a persistent belief that tariffs can be a powerful tool to rebalance trade deficits or achieve specific geopolitical objectives, but their broader consequences on global economic stability are always a subject of intense debate. What Are the Economic Implications for Affected Nations and Beyond? The economic implications of these new tariffs extend deeply into the economies of Brazil, the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Sri Lanka. For countries like Brazil, a 50% tariff could severely hamper its export competitiveness to the U.S., forcing its industries to find new markets or significantly reduce production. This could lead to job losses, reduced foreign exchange earnings, and a slowdown in economic growth. For nations like Libya and Iraq, where economies might already be fragile due to geopolitical factors, additional trade barriers could exacerbate existing challenges, making recovery or stability even harder to achieve. Conversely, there are also implications for the U.S. economy. While tariffs are intended to protect domestic industries, they can also lead to higher input costs for American manufacturers who rely on imported components. Consumers might also face higher prices for a range of goods. The broader effect on US trade relations is also a critical aspect. These tariffs could strain diplomatic ties, making future cooperation on other international issues more challenging. The delicate balance of global economic interdependence means that unilateral actions often have unintended consequences, creating a complex web of reactions and adjustments across the world. How Does This Shape International Trade Policy Moving Forward? Donald Trump’s continued emphasis on tariffs as a primary instrument of foreign policy raises fundamental questions about the future of international trade policy . His approach challenges the multilateral trade system that has largely governed global commerce since World War II, advocating instead for bilateral agreements and protectionist measures. This strategy, characterized by the new Trump tariffs , prioritizes perceived national interests over global economic integration. It forces other nations to re-evaluate their own trade strategies, potentially leading to a more fragmented global trading environment. Key considerations for the future of trade policy include: Bilateral vs. Multilateral: A shift away from large trade blocs and agreements towards country-specific negotiations, potentially increasing complexity and reducing predictability. Supply Chain Resilience: Nations and corporations may increasingly prioritize diversifying supply chains to reduce reliance on any single country, particularly those prone to tariff imposition. Digital Trade Rules: As physical goods trade becomes more contentious, the focus might shift to establishing rules for digital trade and services, an area where tariffs are less straightforward. Geopolitical Leverage: Tariffs are increasingly being used as a geopolitical tool, intertwining trade policy with national security and diplomatic objectives. This evolving landscape demands that businesses and governments alike develop agile strategies to navigate potential disruptions and capitalize on new opportunities in a world where trade rules are constantly being redefined. Navigating the Complexities of US Trade Relations The announcement of these new Trump tariffs significantly impacts US trade relations with the targeted countries and, by extension, with the broader international community. While the stated goal might be to protect American industries or compel specific policy changes from the affected nations, the reality is that such actions often lead to complex diplomatic challenges. For example, Brazil, a major South American economy, has strong agricultural ties with the U.S., and a 50% tariff could lead to significant friction. Similarly, the Philippines, a long-standing U.S. ally, might view a 20% tariff as a strain on their relationship. This approach to trade relations emphasizes a transactional mindset, where economic leverage is used to achieve specific outcomes. It contrasts sharply with approaches that prioritize long-term partnerships and multilateral cooperation. Businesses operating across borders must now consider the heightened risk of sudden policy shifts and their potential impact on profitability and market access. Understanding the nuances of these relationships, the underlying motivations for such tariff actions, and the potential for diplomatic responses is crucial for anyone involved in international commerce or policy analysis. The ongoing saga of these tariffs will undoubtedly continue to shape the narrative of global economic interdependence. The recent announcement by Donald Trump regarding new tariffs on eight additional countries is a powerful reminder of the ever-present volatility in global trade. These significant Trump tariffs , ranging from 20% to a staggering 50%, are poised to create substantial economic implications for the affected nations and ripple effects across the world. From the potential for supply chain disruptions to shifts in international trade policy and the complexities of US trade relations , the global trade impact of these decisions cannot be understated. As businesses and governments navigate this evolving landscape, adaptability and foresight will be paramount. The future of global commerce remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: trade will continue to be a potent instrument in the geopolitical toolkit, shaping economies and international alliances for years to come.

BTC is up ~15% year to date and is now ~2% below its record high from May 2025. Ether's closing price jumped 8% from last week to a four-week high. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price was up slightly from the previous week, hovering around $109,000. BTC is up ~15% year to date and is now ~2% below its record high from May 2025. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price jumped 8% from last week to a four-week high. However, ETH is still down ~22% year to date and is ~46% below its record high from November 2021. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers, such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu proved that simple narratives can transform into multi-billion-dollar giants — and now, a fresh contender, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is capturing the attention of thousands of investors chasing the next 100x meme play . Why DOGE and SHIB Still Set the Meme Standard Dogecoin is the original meme king, evolving from an internet joke into a household crypto name. Its longevity and loyal community keep it firmly anchored as the meme benchmark. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu took things a step further by building an ecosystem with staking, NFTs, and even its own Layer-2 network. SHIB turned meme speculation into long-term utility, showing that viral coins can also drive serious adoption. Together, DOGE and SHIB still lead the meme world, offering traders proven liquidity and meme-fueled staying power. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Top Meme Presale Drawing Thousands What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is how it combines meme culture with rock-solid fundamentals. This new political meme coin has already sold out multiple presale stages, attracting thousands of wallets eager to grab limited spots. With a capped supply, zero-tax trading, and no VC unlocks , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a next-generation meme token designed to favor retail investors. It’s also independently audited, giving it credibility that many meme launches lack. Analysts are already labeling it a top meme coin pick , comparing its early momentum to the very start of DOGE and SHIB — before they delivered life-changing gains. FOMO Building: Still Early, But Spots Are Vanishing Fast MAGACOIN FINANCE is exactly the kind of project that fuels crypto FOMO. Its community is growing rapidly, pushing the project to the top of meme watchlists. As each presale stage fills, new buyers rush in, not wanting to miss what many are calling the best altcoin presale of the cycle . With limited allocations left and huge social buzz, investors see a rare “still early” window that could vanish quickly — the same conditions that once launched DOGE and SHIB into the stratosphere. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB remain essential long-term meme holds, many traders believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is the top meme coin to buy right now . It blends the viral humor that fuels memes with smart tokenomics built for serious upside. That’s why analysts and thousands of early investors are positioning themselves ahead of what could be the next breakout. If meme cycles repeat, MAGACOIN FINANCE might just be the most compelling early-stage opportunity in today’s market.

While tons of coins are fighting for attention, only a few are backed by serious development, real adoption, and active communities. Whether it’s fresh exchange listings, system upgrades, or rare presale access, the top-performing cryptos today are offering real opportunities you don’t want to miss. Here are four hot projects to watch right now. Each one brings a unique edge to the table, but only one still has a presale running at a crazy low price. If you’re ready to act, this list will show you where the upside lives. 1. BlockDAG: Game-Changing Speed With 3,025% Upside BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight due to its next-gen structure. Instead of a slow, one-block-at-a-time chain like Ethereum or Bitcoin, it uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) format to process many blocks at once. That means lightning-fast transactions without sacrificing security. Plus, it’s built on Proof-of-Work, giving it battle-tested reliability. It also works with Ethereum apps, so devs can jump right in. Even better, BlockDAG offers a no-code builder so anyone can create NFTs or tokens without needing a dev team. With a live testnet, a full explorer, and tools already available, the network is almost ready for its mainnet launch later this year. But here’s what’s really turning heads, the presale. BDAG is now in Batch 29 at $0.0016, with over $333 million raised already. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release runs until August 11, locking in this low price and giving early buyers perks like raffle tickets, miner QR rewards, and exchange-ready coins. With a set listing price of $0.05, that’s a 3,025% potential ROI. For anyone checking the top-performing cryptos today, BlockDAG is more than hype, it’s a real shot at massive gains, with working tech and physical miner hardware to back it up. 2. Cardano: ETF Listings & Airdrops Drive Momentum Cardano is making noise again, thanks to its inclusion in Grayscale’s newly approved ETF. That means more institutional eyes on ADA and more potential buying pressure. But the momentum doesn’t stop there. Cardano is also rolling out cross-chain features like the Astrolescent bridge to Radix, new governance systems with 14 visual flowcharts, and a major airdrop via its Midnight privacy layer. This drop is handing out 24 billion $NIGHT tokens to holders across various blockchains, including ADA users. ADA is trading near $0.585 and is testing resistance at $0.63 and $0.70. A clear break could send it toward $0.77, or even higher. Google’s AI model is forecasting an ambitious jump to $2.30–$3 by the end of July if everything aligns. That’s a huge leap, but Cardano’s ranking as the fourth most active development community in crypto shows it has the builder power to chase it. It’s one of the top-performing cryptos today that could surprise you with big gains, especially as the ETF effect plays out. 3. Pi Network: Mainnet Live & Expansion Underway Pi Network is no longer just an app on your phone, it’s now a full mainnet. Since launching in February 2025, verified users can use real Pi tokens across more than 80 dApps. New tools like Pi App Studio and wallet features show that Pi is building fast. They’ve even rolled out governance options and staking-like features to keep users engaged. During the Pi2Day event on June 28, they dropped seven major updates, think Fiat access, desktop support, and ongoing developer contests. Pi is currently priced between $0.47 and $0.50, with some signs pointing to a potential breakout, if upcoming unlocks are absorbed smoothly. Around 318 million tokens are expected to unlock, which could stir the waters, but the project’s massive user base and active builder scene give it strong long-term appeal. While it’s no longer ultra-early like BlockDAG, Pi still stands tall among the top-performing cryptos today for anyone who’s betting on scale and user adoption. 4. XRP: Banking Moves, Stablecoin Plans, & Price Heat XRP is back in the spotlight and pushing higher, with its price sitting around $2.27. Analysts are watching closely as its chart forms a falling wedge, a pattern that could break toward $2.92 or even $3.63. Ripple is adjusting its escrow system, releasing 1 billion XRP in July while relocking 700 million. That’s a smart play to balance liquidity without flooding the market. With 36.4 billion XRP still held in escrow, these shifts will have an ongoing impact on price action. On top of that, Ripple is going head-to-head with traditional banks. It’s rolling out its own U.S. stablecoin (RLUSD) and seeking a banking license. These developments could expand XRP’s use far beyond just cross-border payments. Analysts see price targets anywhere from $5 to $7 this year, with bold predictions going up to $9.5 or even $37.5 in a full bull run. Whether or not it hits those extremes, XRP earns its place among the top-performing cryptos today, especially for those betting on financial regulation finally catching up with crypto. Identifying the Top-Performing Cryptos Today All four of these projects are charging into 2025 with serious momentum. Pi Network is scaling fast now that its mainnet is live. Cardano is benefiting from ETF exposure and pushing new updates. XRP is taking bold steps into banking and stablecoins. But BlockDAG is in a league of its own, still in presale, priced low, and backed by strong tech and real miner shipments. If you’re scanning the top-performing cryptos today for short-term potential or long-term growth, these four offer a diverse mix. But BlockDAG stands out as the one with the clearest shot at multiplying gains before it even hits the big exchanges. Don’t let this presale window pass you by.

Should XRP and Toncoin Investors Make the Move?",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-set-to-deliver-3025-roi-at-launch-should-xrp-and-toncoin-investors-make-the-move/,"Finding the best crypto for the future often comes down to seeing where real progress meets market traction. Ripple continues to hold its ground in cross-border payments, with the Ripple (XRP) price forecast remaining positive as ETF discussions and large cold wallet transfers support confidence. In the meantime, Toncoin is strengthening its link with Telegram, and the Toncoin (TON) price analysis shows growth in daily use. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) brings something unmatched, with presale momentum pushing forward at a strong pace. BDAG offers an entry price of $0.0016 until August 11, unlocking a possible 3,025% ROI when it reaches its confirmed launch price of $0.05. Its six-week launch plan covers its mainnet, community mining nodes, DeFi rollout, and multiple exchange listings. This article explores how Ripple, Toncoin, and BlockDAG compare in use cases, scalability, and why BlockDAG is seen as the best crypto for the future. Ripple Price Forecast Gets Boost From ETF News and Payment Usage Ripple is known as a practical solution for global payments, with fast settlements, low fees, and strong alliances that keep the Ripple (XRP) price forecast on track. Recently, a $1.7 million cold wallet transfer suggested that major holders believe Ripple will keep its momentum. Adding to this is the ongoing talk around ETFs, which has brought roughly a 5% rise in optimism for Ripple. But regulatory questions remain a hurdle for its bigger market push. Even so, Ripple’s trusted network keeps it on lists of the best crypto for the future. Toncoin Price Analysis Strengthened by Telegram Integration Toncoin is gaining pace through its link to Telegram’s huge global user base. The Toncoin (TON) price analysis shows a positive trend as the network builds in-app payments and decentralized services for everyday use. Its fast and secure framework that gives it an edge over other blockchain solutions. With Telegram pushing for actual TON usage, the project stays rooted in real utility that many others don’t offer. Some concerns exist about managing heavy transaction loads as popularity grows. BlockDAG $0.0016 Entry, 3,025% ROI & a Clear Six-Week Rollout Plan BlockDAG’s upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release gives people a rare chance to buy BDAG at only $0.0016 until August 11, opening a potential 3,025% gain when it reaches its locked launch price of $0.05. The project is in Batch 29, with the current price at $0.0016, and early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since Batch 1. This isn’t just presale excitement. BlockDAG has a six-week launch plan that outlines what it will deliver next: Week 6: Presale ends with wallet migration completion. Week 4: The Internal mainnet becomes active with official nodes and ASIC rigs. Week 3: Community nodes and mining pools start operating. Week 2: 40% of presale coins unlock as DEX, lending, bridges, and launchpad launch. Week 1: Developer tools and early dApps launch alongside exchange integration and a major marketing drive. Launch Week: Early exchange listing begins before expansion to multiple platforms. Having raised over $333 million and sold 23.7 billion coins, BlockDAG is building a complete ecosystem based on transparency, mining rewards, and practical DeFi tools. This rollout strategy proves it is not just hype but a serious project for anyone searching for the best crypto for the future. The Bottom Line! Ripple’s strong payments network keeps the Ripple price forecast stable, despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Toncoin, with its Telegram integration, shows a clear path for growth in daily use, and the Toncoin price analysis reflects this progress. Still, BlockDAG’s rare entry price of $0.0016 until August 11, with a possible 3,025% return and its structured six-week rollout plan, puts it ahead of both. With its steps from mainnet launch to DeFi tools and exchange listings, BlockDAG proves what real delivery looks like. For anyone looking for the best crypto for the future , this current window could be the moment to secure a position before BlockDAG’s next phase begins.

The objection, submitted to a U.S. bankruptcy court on Tuesday, comes from Weiwei Ji, a Chinese passport holder currently living in Singapore. Ji stated that despite their current residence, they’ve been classified as a Chinese creditor due to their nationality. According to the filing, Ji represents a group of more than 300 Chinese creditors with substantial claims. FTX Repayment Restrictions Under Fire FTX’s motion, filed on July 2 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, seeks to temporarily halt repayments to creditors in 49 jurisdictions. These include countries like China, Russia, Zimbabwe, and Moldova, where laws around cryptocurrency are either ambiguous or restrictive. The estate argues that making payments to residents in these areas could potentially result in criminal penalties, financial fines, or personal liability for those administering the repayments. Moldova, in particular, was cited as a risk example, where even auxiliary services involving virtual assets are deemed criminal offenses. Claimants Argue Distribution Should Proceed In the objection, Ji argued that digital assets are considered personal property in China, and U.S. dollar settlements are a recognized legal form of payment. This, Ji claims, nullifies the rationale for withholding distributions. “My family holds four KYC-verified accounts with aggregate claims exceeding $15 million USD,” Ji wrote. “We have fully complied with every procedural requirement under the Plan. The proposed motion now jeopardizes our right to distribution in an arbitrary and inequitable manner.” Wider Implications for Creditors Worldwide The motion estimates that around 5% of the total value of approved claims belongs to residents in restricted regions. The estate’s filing seeks to mitigate potential legal complications arising from international payouts. However, creditors like Ji argue that the motion imposes unfair barriers and contradicts the spirit of the agreed-upon bankruptcy plan. The objection brings attention to the complexities of cross-border bankruptcy proceedings involving digital assets. FTX Repayments Already Underway FTX began issuing repayments on February 18, prioritizing convenience class claimants. These initial payments are based on the value of digital assets at the time of the company’s collapse in November 2022—a decision that has been criticized by some creditors. While the estate continues to navigate legal and logistical hurdles, the backlash from international creditors could pose new challenges in the already controversial repayment process.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-10 01:13:55

While some of the company’s plans may have seemed speculative, its steps into the TradFi space are steadily being solidified. Decisively Climbing The Ranks RLUSD quickly made waves by being designed to be Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) compliant, the European Union’s regulatory framework for digital assets, as it processed over 33,000 transactions within its first 6-month test phase before being released. The majority of the coins ($52.9M) were available on Ethereum, and the rest were minted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) – $13.3 million. After being approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the stablecoin was then officially launched late last December. Initially available on MoonPay, Uphold Inc., CoinMena, and several other platforms, it’s now available on more well-known exchanges such as Kraken, Bitget, and Uniswap, to name a few. By the end of Q1 of 2025, it had already amassed a market cap of over $244 million across both XRPL and Ethereum. Further achievements did not lag far behind , as the product, pegged 1:1 to the dollar, was recognized by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) as a crypto token within the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), and by that time, the market cap was around $310 million. Some of the latest news features the stablecoin being the first to be supported by a Swiss global bank, AMINA, which offers trading and custody services, along with the announcement that XRP is seeking a US banking license. Earlier today, the company announced that it has chosen BNY Mellon to serve as the stablecoin’s custodian. At the time of printing, the market cap of RLUSD stands at just above $500 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Although this is a significant milestone for a stablecoin that has been in existence for just over half a year, it still has a way to go to reach the heavy hitters, USDT by Tether and USDC by Circle, which boast capitalizations of $158 billion and $61 billion, respectively. A Successful And “Failed” Acquisition by Ripple Apart from the notable accomplishments in the stablecoin rankings, the company behind RLUSD has also made a significant purchase this year. In April, Ripple acquired the brokerage firm Hidden Road in a $1.25 billion deal, marking one of the largest investments by the company and making it the only one in the crypto world to own and operate a multi-asset broker. Hidden Road clears $3 trillion per year from over 300 institutional clients across markets, and RLUSD will be used as collateral for the prime products they offer. Ripple was reportedly also eyeing acquiring Circle, the company behind USDC, for a deal valued at $4 to $5 billion, but it seemed the offer was too low. The same report also noted that Ripple is “still interested” in the purchase . However, a post on X by Chris Brummer, a Georgetown professor, following a conversation with Circle’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, completely contradicts this, suggesting that such plans never existed. “Brad was unequivocal – Ripple never pursued an acquisition of Circle. And while he wished the company well, it wasn’t something he was considering.” The post Ripple’s RLUSD Hits Massive Milestone as Adoption Increases: Details appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|ETH|EXCHANGE|USDC|USDT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-10 01:25:07

The presale is now in presale, currently in stage 5 at $0.03. Over 60% of the phase has already been sold. Mutuum Finance has over $11.9 million as fund raise with over 12,900 investors already. As the price levels of XRP make the headlines, Mutuum Finance is establishing itself as among the best cryptos to invest in at the moment. Assuming that this strength persists, then there are high chances of Mutuum Finance reaching $10 before the year 2025 reaches its end. XRP Price Forecast: $10 Remains Achievable in the Pursuit to 2025 The price of XRP is at $2.21, and the cryptocurrency is being traded at this level due to the moderate pressure in the market. As of late activity has been seen between $2.20 and $2.23. Although the immediate trend is quiet, it is in the long term perspective that interest is increasing. The continued attempts of Ripple to acquire a national banking charter in the U.S. and a master account through the Federal Reserve have brought yet another wave to the discussion, but all this goes to stimulating the speculation that XRP might even score a reach to the $10 mark by 2025. The introduction of XRP futures on CME and the unspent hopes of a spot ETF authorization are other factors analysts cite as the possible catalysts. XRP is forming a consolidation pattern right under important resistance and a rise above $2.24 may trigger a larger rally. Mutuum Finance Presale Hits $11.9 Million Mark in No Time Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been entered by more than 12,900 investors with a rise of more than $11.9 million. Hype for the project is through the roof and this is clearly a very good sign of the project moving forward. MUTM tokens are $0.03 in phase 5 but will go up 16.67% in phase 6. This phase is already more than 60% sold out as investors scramble to get in at the lowest price. The demand is becoming exponentially excellent and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a disruptor in DeFi is even more precious considering that it will be one of the hot crypto investments of 2025. MUTM Giveaway Offers $100,000 in Rewards Mutuum Finance is set to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with $10,000 MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time’s running out. Mutuum Finance Prioritizes Security with New $50K Bounty Mutuum Finance has launched its Bug Bounty Program with the help and coordination of CertiK, and a reward pool of 50,000 USDT will be provided in total. Reward is in four levels namely; Major, critical, minor, and low so that each level of exposure will be rewarded. This is one more step confirming that Mutuum is a project with a proactive safety attitude and its commitment towards establishing the environment favorable to the finances that can be trusted. While XRP bulls continue to eye a potential breakout toward $10 by year’s end, another contender is rapidly making its mark, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $11.9 million raised, more than 12,900 investors on board, and Stage 5 already 60% sold out, MUTM is becoming one of 2025’s most talked-about DeFi launches.

This tight trading range reflects market uncertainty, yet the structure favors bulls as long as support levels remain intact. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support – Momentum Builds For Range Breakout Meanwhile, macroeconomic conditions are evolving rapidly. The US Congress recently passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” economic package ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline, signaling a new phase of fiscal stimulus marked by tax cuts and aggressive spending. Combined with strong job reports, these factors suggest inflation may soon accelerate — a trend that historically supports Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat devaluation. On the market sentiment side, funding rates provide a crucial clue. According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, the 30-day average of Bitcoin perpetual funding rates is currently very low. This reflects a lack of excessive greed and typically marks a favorable setup for bullish continuation. Historically, periods of low funding rates have preceded major upward moves, especially when paired with strong macro tailwinds. With economic pressure building and Bitcoin still in a bullish structure, the coming days could define the next major move for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Calm Before The Breakout: Bitcoin Gains Strength Above $107K Bitcoin is up more than 3% since the start of July, holding firmly above the $107,000 local low despite repeated resistance at the $110,000 level. This sustained strength signals underlying buyer support and growing momentum as BTC continues to consolidate just below all-time highs. The $110K resistance remains a critical ceiling — once breached, analysts expect a strong move into price discovery as bullish momentum builds. So far, the market has digested a wave of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Global trade dynamics — including rising tariffs, export restrictions, and deglobalization trends — continue to shape sentiment. Yet, compared to the sharp volatility seen earlier this year, both Bitcoin and US equities appear more resilient. This suggests that much of the uncertainty has already been priced in, reducing the downside risk for risk assets like BTC. A key technical factor reinforcing the bullish case is the low 30-day average of funding rates. This indicator reflects a neutral-to-cautiously optimistic market environment — a stark contrast to overheated bullish phases that often precede corrections. Calm periods like this often set the stage for explosive moves, particularly when supply squeezes and strong demand meet a macro environment ripe for risk-taking. With BTC coiling tightly and sentiment balanced, a breakout could be imminent. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise BTC Holds Steady as Bulls Eye $109,300 Breakout The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin (BTC) consolidating within a tight range, holding above the key support at $107,000 and testing resistance around $109,300. This price level has consistently acted as a local ceiling, with several failed breakout attempts in late June and early July. However, the bulls continue to defend higher lows, signaling strength and setting the stage for a potential breakout. The 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) are stacked close together and gradually trending upward, suggesting the consolidation phase could soon transition into a more directional move. Volume remains low, which often precedes a volatility spike, especially near key resistance levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical The $103,600 support remains the crucial line in the sand for bulls. A breakdown below that level would invalidate the short-term bullish structure and likely lead to a deeper retrace. On the upside, a daily close above $109,300 with volume confirmation could trigger a rally toward price discovery above the all-time high.

Analysts at LightShed Partners have openly urged the company to replace CEO Tim Cook, warning that Apple risks falling behind in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. Apple should “absolutely” replace CEO Tim Cook with a more forward-thinking new leader, one analyst told a news outlet Wednesday. “Apple now needs a product-focused CEO, not one centered on logistics,” wrote the analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone. The call for changes is occurring in a period of transition. The company said Jeff Williams, Apple’s longtime chief operating officer , would leave the firm this month. Williams was widely considered to be in the running to succeed Cook, and his departure is thought to pave the way to a major shake-up in the brand’s leadership. Sabih Khan, who has been with Apple for 30 years, is the company veteran who will replace William. With Williams on his way out, the focus is already shifting on John Ternus (Apple’s Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering), who may emerge as the top internal candidate to replace Cook. Ternus has been leading the development of Apple’s key products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. AI failures damage Apple’s market position Apple’s slow adoption of generative AI has not escaped investors’ notice or the wider tech ecosystem. Unlike Microsoft and Google, which have moved aggressively to push AI-based tools and alliances, Apple has made only slight past forays. But that silence is starting to come at a cost for the company. In 2025, Apple stock fell 16%, versus increases of 25% in shares of AI-forward companies including Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. And Apple’s stock market performance is a reflection of investors’ jitters that the company is failing to keep up in a sector that is already revolutionizing industries from software to hardware and beyond. Start-ups are wading in too, releasing hardware and software that is directly competitive with Apple’s once unassailable ecosystem. Consumers are also increasingly drawn to AI-enabled devices, which learn, predict, and adjust. At this rate, if Apple doesn’t have a good comeback ready soon, it’s going to see its market share and cultural influence start to wane. Apple revealed a handful of features called “Apple Intelligence” at its Worldwide Developers Conference in 2024. Still, analysts say the update was more evolutionary than revolutionary regarding AI features, which could not be said about what rivals offered. Cook’s legacy faces a new AI reality The performance of Tim Cook, as CEO, is nothing less than historic. Under Mr. Cook’s watch since 2011, Apple’s stock has risen more than 1,400 percent, far outpacing the broader S&P 500, which has climbed roughly 430 percent over the same period. During his tenure, Apple was the first company to reach a $3 trillion market capitalization and added new devices and services to its product lineup. Cook has also steered Apple through multiple international crises, including COVID-19 and global supply chain problems. He was able to keep the ship running and growing, which made him a trusted figure on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. But for some analysts, that legacy alone doesn’t justify keeping things as they are. Piecyk and Galone acknowledged that Tim Cook was the right CEO when he took over and credited him for doing an exceptional job. However, they argued that the current era demands new leadership—someone who can drive the bold product innovation that originally made Apple a global leader. They noted that with Jeff Williams stepping down, the moment calls for more disruptive change, not less. The push for Cook to leave hasn’t reached the point where it’s a common demand of investors or among directors, and there’s no sign the CEO intends to abandon the ship himself. However, the note from LightShed is one of an increasing number chastising Apple’s direction in the era of accelerated progress in the field of AI.

While veterans like SHIBA INU and Solana continue to evolve and expand, one emerging token, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is quietly building a case as the most overlooked 100x altcoin of this cycle. SHIBA INU: A Meme Coin Reinventing Itself Through Utility Once dismissed as a purely speculative token, SHIBA INU has steadily transformed into a multi-functional ecosystem. With the launch of SHIB The Metaverse, AI integrations teased for mid-2025, and a fast-paced token burn campaign removing billions of tokens from circulation, SHIBA is actively expanding its utility base. Its fiercely loyal community, the “SHIB Army”, continues to support the project’s evolution, pushing SHIB toward a new identity beyond its meme coin origins. With increasing DeFi integration and smart contract developments on the horizon, SHIBA is cementing its place in the next phase of blockchain adoption. Solana: The Institutional-Grade Blockchain Powering Next-Gen Finance With its lightning-fast transaction speeds and near-zero fees, Solana remains a heavyweight in the Layer-1 space. Institutional interest is rising, bolstered by the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF, a product offering traditional investors exposure to SOL with staking yields of around 7.3% annually. Solana is also at the center of financial innovation. Payment giants like Fiserv, Circle, and Paxos are building stablecoin solutions on Solana’s chain, including the soon-to-launch FIUSD. Meanwhile, Japan’s Minna no Bank is testing tokenized settlements on Solana, underlining its increasing role in global-scale finance. DeFi activity is growing, with TVL surging from $6B to $8.6B since April, pointing to broader adoption and ecosystem maturity. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Decentralized Revolution in Layer-1 Blockchain Design MAGACOIN FINANCE is reshaping Layer-1 blockchain design with a truly decentralized, fair-launch model. Sixty percent of the token supply is allocated to presale participants, excluding VCs and institutional investors, to ensure community-first ownership. With zero taxes on buys and sells, MAGACOIN offers frictionless trading for both traders and long-term holders. A smart contract audit by Hashex underscores its commitment to security and transparency. MAGACOIN is a cultural and political statement within Web3, built on principles of freedom, fairness, and anti-establishment values. Its fast-growing community is driving visibility across platforms like Telegram, X, and DEXTools—echoing the early grassroots momentum seen in successful projects like Kaspa. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE May Be the Best Pick of 2025 While SHIBA INU and Solana bring scale and brand recognition, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers what few projects today can deliver . These are air tokenomics, security, ideological relevance, and extreme upside potential, all wrapped in a high-performance Layer-1 platform. With no venture capital interference, a 60% presale allocation, zero trading taxes, and a 3,400% ROI window, MAGACOIN is exactly the kind of token early-stage investors dream of discovering before it goes mainstream.

BTC is currently trading at $110,900, according to CoinDesk market data , after rallying during the U.S. trading hours to over $111,000 and briefly touching all-time high. Glassnode analysts had previously described Bitcoin’s recent market activity as quiet , characterized by declining on-chain transactions, minimal miner revenues, and suppressed fees. Rather than interpreting these factors as bearish indicators, Glassnode highlighted a mature market increasingly dominated by large-value institutional transactions and cautious long-term holders. All this being said, the correlation between Nvidia and BTC might be short-lived as data suggests its weakening. While the correlation between the GPU giant and BTC peaked above 0.80 during the AI-driven euphoria of early 2024, and the three-month average remains relatively strong at 0.69, the latest data shows a dip to around 0.36, indicating a possible decoupling as investor focus shifts. Still, Nvidia’s milestone seemed to serve as a potential trigger for BTC breakout from weeks of price inertia. However, it's possible that Nvidia's share prices might correct at some point, given its volatile nature. But this weakening correlation means that BTC price might remain resilient – when that day comes. Australia Begins Real-World CBDC Tests Australia’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, Project Acacia, has entered its next phase as the Reserve Bank of Australia names 24 industry participants selected to trial real-world applications of digital money in tokenized asset markets. Spearheaded by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, the project brings together major banks, fintechs, and infrastructure firms to trial programmable digital money in real-world financial workflows. The pilots will explore settlement across asset classes such as bonds, carbon credits, private markets, and trade receivables. Nineteen projects will involve live transactions, while five will remain at the proof-of-concept stage. ASIC has granted targeted regulatory relief to allow testing with real assets, continuing its approach of enabling responsible innovation in digital finance. While Australia is pushing ahead with further CBDC development, the Bank of Canada has shifted its focus away from developing a retail CBDC, amid mounting criticism that such a system could enable government surveillance by allowing authorities to monitor every transaction, unlike the anonymity offered by cash. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin hovered near $109,000 as institutions defended key support levels amid light resistance at $110,000, showing resilience despite dormant wallet activity and regulatory uncertainty, while macro conditions such as a weakening dollar and steady rate cut odds bolstered corporate appetite for risk assets, according to the CoinDesk market insights bot. ETH: ETH closed a volatile 23-hour session up 2.8 percent, with strong institutional volume and resilience above $2,650 signaling continued bullish positioning amid market uncertainty. Gold: Gold prices extended losses for a second day, hovering near $3,285 as reduced July Fed rate cut bets, a strong U.S. dollar, and firm Treasury yields pressured the metal, though trade tariff concerns and upcoming FOMC minutes helped limit further downside . Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday as investors weighed the Bank of Korea’s rate hold and U.S. President Trump’s move to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, citing unfair trade and retaliation over Bolsonaro’s prosecution, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.45%. S&P 500: Stock futures were mostly flat Wednesday evening after the S&P 500 clawed back some losses from this week’s tariff-driven decline, with Dow futures slipping just 37 points.

Crypto’s Not Going Anywhere, Tim Scott Says According to a Wednesday press release from the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Scott praised the chamber’s passage of the GENIUS Act while doubling down on the significance of the hearing to be able to “build on that success.” “Today’s hearing is the first full committee hearing on digital assets,” Scott said. “This is a crucial step toward developing a comprehensive framework that gives innovators the clarity they need and gives investors the protections they deserve.” “Because make no mistake: blockchain technology and digital assets are not going away – they are here to stay,” he added. The question we should ask ourselves is whether the United States will lead in shaping the future of digital finance, or whether we’ll let other countries like Singapore and the UAE set the standards while American jobs and innovation leave our shores.” Elizabeth Warren Delivers Her Own Crypto Priorities List Titled “From Wall Street to Web3: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets,” the hearing largely focused on developing broad crypto market legislation in the United States under a crypto-friendly White House. Heavyweight crypto policy witnesses who testified before the committee included Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin. Senator Elizabeth Warren also unveiled her own crypto market structure priorities during the hearing, stating that the U.S. needs crypto legislation that “will strengthen our financial system, not make it worse.” “I’m concerned that what my Republican colleagues are aiming for is another industry handout that gives the crypto lobby exactly its wish list: The blessing of the government’s approval, combined with crypto rules that are weaker than the rules every other financial actor must follow,” Warren said.

On Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing that exposed deep partisan divisions on how to regulate the rapidly expanding digital asset market. Republican senators hailed a regulatory structure called “light-touch,” asserting that innovation must be protected and fostered. They stressed that government overreach must be avoided, but recognized the importance of ensuring that a clear and predictable legal framework was established to protect crypto businesses and investors. “Our job is to set clear, light-touch guardrails to protect investors, stop fraud, and allow responsible innovation to flourish,” said Senator Tim Scott, the committee’s Republican chair. He emphasized that the legislation must specify which tokens are securities and commodities — a source of confusion that has long impeded enforcement. The banker also stressed the importance of addressing the threat of illicit finance without smothering innovation. On the opposite end, Democratic senators demanded tighter guardrails and warned that the current proposals are too weak and pockmarked by loopholes. Democrats express concerns about loopholes and conflicts Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia sharply criticized the bill, saying it fails to address growing conflicts of interest among political leaders and lacks adequate consumer protections. He pointed to recent developments involving President Donald Trump and his family, noting that they have launched or endorsed meme coins and crypto tokens nearing listings on public exchanges. Warnock argued that political favoritism increasingly shapes the marketplace, where well-connected individuals benefit from largely unregulated activity. He added that while some lawmakers push for action on market structure, the current environment hardly reflects a fair or free market. Democratic senators also flagged a provision that allows companies to self-certify as “decentralized” and therefore avoid needing to register with either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Critics say this would enable large companies to skirt regulatory oversight by declaring themselves decentralized even if their functioning is anything but. Timothy Massad, a former CFTC Chair who testified at the hearing, commented that the current legislative text would facilitate a dangerous transition of regulated activity from regulated to unregulated venues. “This broad carve-out for decentralized entities is a regulatory black hole,” he added. Massad recommended that legislators draw definitions more tightly and construct a framework encompassing centralized and decentralized systems, but that didn’t offer companies unjust loopholes to slip through. Republicans advance crypto legislation amid disputes Even under the tense stare-down, Republican senators showed no signs of blinking. Sens Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Tim Scott (R-SC) published a joint statement sharing their “market structure principles” for a crypto regulatory framework. These proposals would provide definitions for digital assets, allowing for a clear legal categorization of such assets and apportioning enforcement jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC. Their method is similar to that of the CLARITY Act, a House-approved bill that advanced through committee in June. That bill proposes to define whether a digital asset is a commodity or a security according to how it is used, not just how it was initially sold — an idea that has drawn heavy support from the industry. Senator Hagerty was confident that there would be bipartisan cooperation down the road. He shrugged off the day’s tensions as routine friction in the legislative process. “I would not be dissuaded by what you just heard in that hearing,” he said, predicting that Democrats who once backed stablecoin legislation would eventually align on broader market structure issues. The House will also soon debate its digital asset legislation. If the two chambers approve compatible versions, the United States could inch closer to having a single, unified national crypto framework — a longtime ambition of digital asset enthusiasts as the technology becomes increasingly mainstream.

In 2025, analysts are drawing a clear line between established assets like XRP and Ethereum and new, fast-moving contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The verdict? While XRP and ETH may offer steady gains, the chance for a 1,000x return lies elsewhere. Why XRP and Ethereum Are Unlikely to Deliver 1,000x Returns XRP’s Growth Ceiling XRP has regained traction after years of legal uncertainty, thanks to renewed institutional interest and expanding global adoption. Prices have climbed into the $3–$5 range, with some bullish predictions floating the idea of $10 or even $100 in the long run. But there’s a hard limit to how far XRP can go. To achieve a 1,000x from current levels, XRP would need to trade at several thousand dollars per coin—resulting in a market cap of over $50 trillion. That’s more than the combined GDP of every major economy. Analysts widely agree that this kind of price action, while theoretically possible, is mathematically out of reach for an asset with such a large circulating supply. Ethereum Is Too Big to Multiply That Fast Ethereum is still the most dominant altcoin by market cap and remains a foundational layer of the Web3 ecosystem. It powers smart contracts, decentralized finance, and NFTs, making it a cornerstone of the blockchain world. But with a market cap already in the hundreds of billions, the window for 1,000x returns has closed. Early adopters did see massive gains during ETH’s formative years, but today, Ethereum is seen as a blue-chip asset—ideal for long-term stability, not explosive upside. Analysts expect continued growth, but nowhere near the scale that new investors chasing moonshot returns are looking for. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Newcomer with 1,000x Energy Built for Exponential Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early stages and priced well below one cent. It enters the market as a meme-powered altcoin with strong political and cultural resonance—elements that have historically driven some of the most dramatic gains in crypto. Analysts say this kind of low entry price is exactly what gives the token its edge. Unlike XRP or ETH, the math here supports a 1,000x trajectory if momentum continues. Analyst Confidence Is Growing Several analyst reports name MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout pick for 2025. While conservative models suggest 25x to 50x returns based on current growth, some projections indicate that a 5,000% gain or more could be on the table. These forecasts are built on a mix of strong tokenomics, early-stage momentum, and a community that appears to be expanding rapidly. The token is backed by an audited smart contract and a zero-tax trading model, both of which enhance its credibility. But it’s the grassroots energy and viral marketing strategy that truly set it apart—traits that have fueled past breakouts in the meme coin category. Final Word: The Search for 1,000x Starts Early Most established cryptocurrencies have already had their explosive moment. XRP and Ethereum still hold value, especially for those seeking safer plays. But if the goal is to find the next token capable of 1,000x returns, the spotlight now turns to low-cap, early-stage assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that profile. It’s unburdened by large market caps, rich in narrative appeal, and quickly capturing the attention of retail traders and analysts alike. For those willing to take calculated risks, it may just be the high-upside opportunity they’ve been waiting for.

In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,980 resistance zone or even $3,000 in the near term. Are Downsides Supported In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,800 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,750 level. The first major support sits near the $2,720 zone. A clear move below the $2,720 support might push the price toward the $2,650 support or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,516 swing low to the $2,795 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,500.

All funds are allocated for the acquisition of Bitcoin. The company aims to hold 3,000 BTC in the near term. However, it warned that fluctuations in the crypto asset’s prices and its own stock price could affect the plan. Remixpoint Bets Big on Bitcoin Following the initial acquisition, additional purchases will be based on the average stock price over three consecutive trading days. In its disclosure, Remixpoint stated that after extensive internal discussions, it has become increasingly convinced of Bitcoin’s future potential. Although various opinions were expressed within the company, the board unanimously concluded that the move would boost corporate value from a risk-return perspective while expanding future strategic options. “We understand the difference between seizing opportunities and playing it safe, as well as the distinction between a challenge and recklessness. We kindly ask for your continued warm support.” The latest development comes just a day after the Japanese energy firm said that it will pay its President and CEO, Yoshihiko Takahashi, his entire executive compensation in Bitcoin. Following the move, it became the first listed company in the country to adopt this approach. The step is in line with Remixpoint’s goal of “shareholder-oriented management,” ensuring that management shares the same economic fate as shareholders, especially as its share price often moves in tandem with Bitcoin’s price. The decision follows shareholder feedback urging management to align more closely with investor interests. While insider trading restrictions make it difficult for executives to acquire company shares, paying the CEO in Bitcoin offers a practical alternative to share economic value with shareholders while supporting Remixpoint’s strategy of integrating crypto assets, energy, and Web initiatives. The announcement comes amid a broader trend in Japan of companies, including Gumi, Value Creation, Metaplanet, and SBC Medical, adding Bitcoin to their strategies and balance sheets. Semler’s Corporate Bitcoin Accumulation Race Outside Japan, corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset continues to gain momentum. For instance, Nasdaq-listed healthcare tech firm Semler Scientific acquired 187 BTC for $20 million at $106,906 per bitcoin this week. The purchase was funded using proceeds from its at-the-market (ATM) stock program. With this latest addition, Semler now holds a total of 4,636 BTC. The stash is currently valued at around $502 million, against a total purchase cost of $430 million. This implies paper gains of approximately $72 million and places the company 15th among corporations with the largest BTC holdings.

Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $111,000, ether (ETH) jumped nearly 7% to above $2,700, and Solana’s SOL climbed above $158, catching traders betting against the move completely offside. More than 114,000 traders were liquidated, with combined losses topping $527 million, according to data from Coinglass. Of that, $463 million came from short positions — or leveraged bets that the market would go lower — while only $64 million came from longs. The single largest liquidation was a $51.5 million short on HTX’s BTC-USDT pair. Liquidations occur when traders using leverage, or borrowing funds to amplify their positions, are unable to meet margin requirements as prices move against them. Exchanges forcibly close these positions to prevent further losses, often adding fuel to the move itself. In this case, as BTC and ETH pushed higher, waves of short liquidations may have created sudden price acceleration, forcing more traders to exit in a cascade. This reflexive dynamic makes liquidation data a useful trading signal. Sharp spikes in liquidations, especially from one side of the book, often indicate local tops or bottoms, depending on direction and timing. Some traders even position around it, betting on short squeezes or long flush-outs when the numbers start to skew. When combined with volume and price action, liquidation events often confirm the strength of a trend or signal its exhaustion.

In a statement posted on Wednesday, July 9, the regulator accused Meta of exploiting its dominant position by limiting access to ad verification partnerships for ads it sells under allegedly opaque, discriminatory, and unfair terms. The notification, formally known as a statement of objections, does not determine the probe’s outcome. Meta will be allowed to respond and defend itself, the agency added. A Meta spokesperson in Paris did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meta finds itself in trouble with the French media firms in the online advertising sector French media firms, including TF1, France TV, and BFM TV, sued Meta over allegedly illegal business methods, the law firms acting for the plaintiffs said. This was after a group of 67 media companies, which represent 200 publications, had filed a case in the Paris business tribunal court in April. They claimed Meta’s leading position in the digital advertising market was largely due to illegal activities such as massive personal data collection and the utilization of targeted advertising. The company will also face trial this October in Spain over a 551 million euro complaint, equivalent to a $582 million complaint lodged by more than 80 media companies accusing it of unfair competition in advertising. Still, there are other complaints raised on Meta. In February, online rights activists lodged complaints in Europe over Meta’s ad practices, and earlier on, EU antitrust regulators fined Meta and Apple for what they said were breaches of EU law. The French media groups are being represented in the Paris case by US law firm Scott+Scott and French law firm Darrois Villey Maillot Brochier. It is not only the television companies involved, but also Figaro, Lagardere, L’Express, La Depeche, Liberation, Radio France, and Centre France. Google follows Meta’s lead, finding itself in the same “ditch” Alphabet’s Google is embroiled in a legal fight with Texas and a handful of other states that now threatens to lead to a possible confrontation that might end up costing the company more than $100 billion in fines because it enforced a digital advertising monopoly. Both sides made dueling demands on Tuesday, July 8, to US District Judge Sean Jordan in the federal court in Plano, Texas. They asked to restrict certain information that jurors can access during the trial, set for Aug. 11, such as potential payments to the states and Google’s financial condition. In 2020, Google was also found guilty of the same scandal. Texas and more than a dozen other US states filed a suit against Google, claiming the company illegally owned advertising markets and violated rules that guard against deceptive business practices. That trial followed an April victory by the US Justice Department in the government’s case accusing Google of illegally monopolizing the market for online advertising technology, a decision by a federal judge in Virginia. Neither Google nor Texas’s lead lawyer responded to a request for comment.

The January 2024 SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs had fundamentally rewired how institutional money flows into crypto, and we were watching the payoff in real time. Here’s what struck me about this moment: after years of regulatory resistance, the approval didn’t just legitimize Bitcoin; it created an entirely new infrastructure layer that traditional finance could finally plug into. The result? Bitcoin went from digital curiosity to portfolio necessity faster than anyone anticipated. The infrastructure shift is where things get interesting. These aren’t your typical investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs hold actual Bitcoin, not contracts or derivatives. Think of it like a gold ETF that stores physical bullion, except the “vault” is digital and the custodians are crypto-native companies that suddenly found themselves managing institutional billions. Nine of the twelve currently trading spot Bitcoin ETFs rely on Coinbase for custody. Coinbase’s custody of 9 out of 12 Bitcoin ETFs creates both competitive advantage and concentration risk. This infrastructure dominance generates stable revenue but raises questions about single points of failure in the crypto ecosystem. That’s not an accident; it’s the market recognizing that crypto infrastructure requires crypto expertise. Traditional banks talking about “blockchain solutions” for years suddenly needed companies that actually knew how to secure digital assets at institutional scale. This concentration creates fascinating dynamics. Coinbase transformed from a platform dependent on trading fees (feast during bull markets, famine during crypto winters) into critical financial infrastructure. ETF custody generates predictable revenue regardless of market sentiment. It’s the difference between being a casino and being the bank that handles the casino’s money. The numbers tell the story. Coinbase posted record results through 2024, positioning itself for what analysts expect will be a massive 2025. The company evolved from riding crypto waves to becoming the infrastructure that institutional waves crash against. But infrastructure plays attract competition, and Robinhood has been gaining ground with a different approach. While Coinbase focuses on institutional custody and compliance, Robinhood targets the retail investor frustrated with crypto complexity. The ETF revolution transformed revenue models for crypto platforms. Trading fees dropped from 70% to 35% of revenue while infrastructure services grew from 15% to 45%, creating more predictable business models less dependent on market volatility. Recent moves show this strategy in action: tokenized U.S. stocks across Europe, crypto staking for major cryptocurrencies, perpetual futures trading, and a custom blockchain for real-world asset settlement. Robinhood is building the on-ramp for mainstream adoption while Coinbase manages the vault. The platform’s commission-free crypto trading and streamlined experience have captured market share, particularly as regulatory clarity reduces friction. Record trading volumes and analyst optimism for 2025 suggest this retail-focused approach complements rather than competes with institutional infrastructure. Then there’s BTCS Inc., which offers a different lesson entirely. As the first cryptocurrency company on NASDAQ back in 2014, BTCS represents the pure-play approach to crypto business models. The company pioneered “Bividends” (paying shareholders in Bitcoin rather than cash) and operates blockchain analytics while maintaining direct crypto holdings. BTCS currently holds 90 Bitcoin and has expanded to 12,500 Ethereum through strategic financing. The company demonstrates how crypto-native businesses adapt to institutional validation without abandoning their foundational principles. While giants battle for infrastructure dominance, specialized players carve sustainable niches. Get Brendan on Blockchain’s stories in your inbox Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer.Subscribe What makes this entire ecosystem shift fascinating is how quickly traditional finance absorbed what was supposed to be disruptive technology. Spot Bitcoin ETFs solved the institutional access problem by providing compliant exposure through familiar investment vehicles. This flow diagram shows how different investor types can now access Bitcoin without direct crypto custody requirements. ETFs provided the compliant wrapper institutional investors needed, turning crypto from alternative asset to portfolio component. The regulatory environment signals this acceptance is permanent. Political leadership openly supporting crypto as strategic national infrastructure, combined with continued SEC evolution, suggests the framework will expand rather than contract. Ethereum ETFs, multi-crypto funds, and integration with traditional wealth management represent logical progressions. Institutional behavior confirms this maturation. Recent filings show mixed activity: some asset managers trimming Bitcoin ETF positions during Q1 2025 volatility while others made first-time allocations. This isn’t speculation; it’s portfolio management. Institutions treat crypto like any other asset class requiring risk assessment and allocation decisions. The infrastructure supporting this transformation continues solidifying. Custody solutions evolved from exchange wallets to institutional-grade security. Trading infrastructure handles billions in daily volume without the technical failures that plagued early crypto markets. Regulatory frameworks provide clarity for compliance officers nervous about digital assets. Market structure reflects this evolution. Price discovery happens across regulated exchanges with institutional participation rather than fragmented crypto-only platforms. Liquidity comes from diverse sources including algorithmic trading, institutional arbitrage, and retail participation through familiar brokerages. But here’s what I find most compelling: we’re witnessing the creation of parallel financial infrastructure rather than replacement of existing systems. Crypto didn’t disrupt traditional finance; it forced traditional finance to build crypto-compatible systems. Coinbase became the bridge between Bitcoin networks and institutional custody requirements. Robinhood built crypto trading that feels like stock trading. ETF providers wrapped crypto exposure in familiar investment vehicles. Each player solved specific friction points rather than demanding wholesale adoption of new paradigms. This infrastructure approach explains why Bitcoin ETF approval catalyzed such dramatic price movements. Bitcoin’s price acceleration correlates directly with ETF infrastructure milestones rather than speculative bubbles. The correlation between regulatory developments, ETF volume, and sustained price growth demonstrates institutional demand driving the market. Institutional money wasn’t waiting for crypto to mature; it was waiting for compliant access methods. Once those existed, allocation decisions followed standard portfolio logic rather than speculation. The winners in this transformation aren’t necessarily the platforms with the most users or the highest trading volumes. They’re the companies providing reliable infrastructure for an asset class that institutional investors can no longer ignore. Success metrics have shifted accordingly. Revenue stability matters more than growth rates. Regulatory compliance generates competitive advantages. Technical reliability determines institutional trust. These factors favor established players with resources to build proper infrastructure over startups promising disruption. Looking forward, the infrastructure is set. Regulatory frameworks continue evolving supportively. Institutional adoption follows predictable patterns based on risk tolerance and allocation models. The speculation phase is ending; the infrastructure utilization phase is beginning. The revolution isn’t in Bitcoin’s price reaching six figures. It’s in the infrastructure making crypto a standard component of diversified portfolios. The companies that built this infrastructure (and continue maintaining it) control the future of institutional crypto adoption. That’s where the real value gets created and captured.

ADA is trading at $0.60, under both its 50‑day MA at $0.66 and its 200‑day MA at $0.64. That gap means bulls need more firepower to push price back above key levels. Still, the weekly signal has many calling a bullish move ahead. Anyone else notice that Cardano just had it’s first Weekly Golden Cross ever? 📈🚀 pic.twitter.com/d7gvWQfN1Z — Mr Brownstone (@GunsRoses1987) July 9, 2025 Price Levels To Watch Based on examination from MasterAnanda, ADA will likely need to reclaim its 34‑period EMA and the 200‑day MA before a real uptrend can take hold. Many traders use those levels as checkpoints. If ADA closes above $0.64, it could draw new buyers in. On the flip side, a drop under $0.59 might trigger more selling pressure. Whales Return To Accumulate Analyst Ali Martinez has noted that large holders scooped up about 120 million ADA over the past two weeks. These addresses, each holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA, now control roughly 5.5 billion ADA—worth around $3.3 billion at current prices. When big wallets pile in, it often suggests confidence that prices will head higher. But it can also lead to quick flips if whales decide to take profits. Whales bought over 120 million Cardano $ADA in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/HOjvzB6fqd — Ali (@ali_charts) July 8, 2025 Cardano: Forecasts And Sentiment Several price targets have emerged in recent weeks. Some analysts expect ADA to climb to $1.33, while others think $10 is within reach this cycle. Price prediction by CoinCodex points to a 25% rise to $0.74 by August 8, 2025. Right now, technical indicators lean bearish, and the Fear & Greed Index sits at 59 (Neutral). Cardano has seen 14 out of the last 30 days end in green, with volatility around 7.54%, according to the price prediction site. Related Reading: 2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands — But Who Is He? Outlook And Next Steps Cardano’s weekly golden cross is a bullish sign, but price still needs to clear shorter‑term hurdles. Traders looking for confirmation may wait for ADA to close above $0.66 on the daily chart. Those already in position might set a stop‑loss below $0.59 to guard against a rejection. With whale activity back on the rise and long‑term targets ranging from $1.33 to $10, Cardano is once again on investors’ radar. However, broader market trends—especially moves in Bitcoin—will likely dictate whether ADA’s momentum can stick.

Earlier today, Bitcoin briefly touched $112,150, crossing its old all-time high by a small margin. Though the price has slightly pulled back to around $111,400, analysts say this move shows strong bullish momentum in the market. Despite fears of market crashes, wars, and negative news, data from charts, on-chain activity, and macroeconomic trends have pointed to a continued uptrend. Many have been expecting this breakout for months and Bitcoin’s next major target could be around $120,000. At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has climbed to $3.47 trillion, marking a 3.03% increase over the past 24 hours. Ethereum has also slipped in green, trading at $2,786, gaining over 7% in a day. XRP, Solana, and Cardano are showing upward momentum, with XRP up 5%, Solana rising 4%, and Cardano climbing 6.25% in the same period. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bitcoin’s price is currently hovering close to a key resistance zone, awaiting a breakout above the $111,000–$112,000 level. If the price manages to break and hold above this range, it could trigger a new bullish price target around $111,500, with short-term resistance sitting slightly higher at $112,000. On the other side, if Bitcoin fails to break out, it faces support around $107,500, with a deeper support zone near $105,500. At the moment, price action remains mostly sideways on shorter timeframes, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. However, large amounts of liquidity are building just above and below Bitcoin’s current price, raising the possibility of sudden price moves or fake-outs in the short term. Overall, while momentum is still lacking on higher time frames, the market is on edge waiting for Bitcoin’s next decisive move.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ADA|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 03:38:00

Surpassing other hyped early-stage projects like Qubetics and RAVI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called the most promising meme-powered altcoin of the year, offering rare early-entry potential and viral momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: #1 on the 2025 Presale Radar More than just another meme coin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a decentralized political memecoin that leverages the cultural weight of the “Make America Great Again” movement while combining it with robust tokenomics and full community ownership. The result? A meme-powered altcoin that actually delivers on fundamentals — and it’s moving fast. The presale has already attracted thousands of wallets, with several stages selling out rapidly. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers: Zero-tax transactions A fully capped supply , preventing inflation An audit by HashEx , ensuring security and trust Strong investor engagement across Telegram and Twitter/X Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to the early days of SHIBA INU and Dogecoin, but with more refined mechanics and a politically charged brand narrative that could make it one of the biggest breakout tokens of the cycle. As FOMO builds, many believe this is one of the few projects in 2025 that could deliver 30x to 100x ROI for early buyers. The window to enter before listings is closing — and that’s exactly why it’s now ranked #1 on presale watchlists. Qubetics: AI-Driven Utility Meets Growing Ecosystem Qubetics has caught the eye of analysts with its AI-integrated infrastructure, offering smart contract automation tools for developers. As an Ethereum-compatible chain with a focus on scaling dApps, Qubetics blends tech utility with smart token incentives. While it’s still early, Qubetics has built a solid reputation among developers. However, in terms of viral traction and explosive investor demand, it currently trails behind MAGACOIN FINANCE — which is moving at meme-speed through crypto forums and social media channels. Qubetics remains a top altcoin pick for those focused on AI + blockchain convergence, but it’s more of a medium-growth asset compared to MAGACOIN’s high-upside, meme-fueled trajectory. RAVI: Stable Yield and Real-World Payments Focus RAVI enters the scene as a stablecoin-focused DeFi protocol, targeting real-world payments and staking rewards. With a fixed APY model and global remittance ambitions, RAVI appeals to long-term holders looking for consistent, passive crypto income. Though the model is stable and appealing to conservative investors, RAVI’s growth is likely to be slow and steady, lacking the viral appeal or narrative-driven momentum of a meme-powered movement like MAGACOIN FINANCE. As a result, RAVI ranks well on the utility front, but falls behind in terms of presale urgency, cultural relevance, and FOMO potential. Final Thoughts: MAGACOIN FINANCE Dominates Analyst Rankings Among all the crypto presales gaining attention in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands above the rest. Its combination of scarcity-based tokenomics, a politically viral narrative, and community-driven growth puts it in a class of its own. If you’re looking for the next crypto presale with 100x potential and serious cultural firepower, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where the smart money is heading.

With markets gaining momentum, tech upgrades rolling out, and interest growing across both retail and institutional circles, this is no time to sit still. Some tokens are pushing forward with strong foundations, while others are gaining traction on speculation and roadmap milestones. Whether you’re targeting presale access or hunting solid projects with long-term potential, this lineup highlights names worth watching. From a scalable Layer 1 platform to tokens attracting ETF buzz, here are the top-trending cryptos for 2025, with BlockDAG leading the charge as it moves through one of the biggest presales of the year. 1. BlockDAG: $0.0016 Entry, 3,025% Potential, & a Live $2M Raffle BlockDAG is creating real waves across the space, thanks to a mix of low-entry pricing and next-gen infrastructure. It merges the strength of Proof-of-Work with the speed of DAG tech, letting multiple blocks get confirmed at once. The result? A scalable, secure network that avoids the typical bottlenecks most chains face. It’s fully EVM-compatible, meaning Ethereum dApps can run without friction. Non-coders aren’t left out either, with a no-code smart contract builder already active. Mining is already underway with over 2 million users earning through the X1 Mobile Miner, and hardware miners like the X10, X30, and X100 are also part of the rollout. Right now, the presale is in Batch 29, and coins are priced at $0.0016. With $333 million raised and 23.7 billion BDAG already sold, it’s among the top presales in the market. The listing price is locked at $0.05, which signals more than 3,000% in potential gains. Until August 11, the GLOBAL LAUNCH release promo keeps the price fixed, while also offering entry to a $2 million Summer Raffle. If you’re narrowing down your picks for the top-trending crypto for 2025, BlockDAG is sitting right at the centre of the spotlight. 2. Litecoin: Whale Moves & ETF Buzz Fuel the Comeback Litecoin may not dominate headlines daily but don’t mistake quiet for inactive. At around $87.90, with price ranges between $86.14 and $88.24, it’s holding steady, but the real action is in the data. More than 105 million LTC moved in a single day recently, suggesting major accumulation by large holders. What’s stoking the fire? Growing talk about a potential Litecoin spot ETF. Grayscale and CoinShares have active filings, and Bloomberg odds sit at a strong 90% for approval. Analysts say LTC could spike to $150 or more if that green light arrives. Even without the ETF, Litecoin’s stability and proven utility still make it relevant. It’s not chasing trends, it’s riding institutional attention. If you’re curating a list of the top-trending crypto for 2025, Litecoin checks the boxes for longevity, momentum, and upside. 3. Cardano: Developer Surge & ETF Speculation Take Hold Cardano is showing signs of renewed strength, trading around $0.584 after bouncing between $0.571 and $0.588. It’s catching serious attention again, not just because of the price action, but because developer activity is ramping up. GitHub commits and on-chain data suggest the Cardano network is building faster than many realize. Historically, July has been kind to ADA, with average gains of around 8%, setting the stage for what could be a strong upward move. Short-term price targets reach up to $0.72, and some analysts are going bold with projections of $3 by year-end. What’s adding fuel? Hopes of a Cardano ETF approval, with some platforms suggesting 90% odds. While nothing is set in stone, that kind of speculation has already driven volume higher. With its blend of development growth and ETF anticipation, ADA is a smart name to consider among the top-trending crypto for 2025. 4. Polkadot: Ecosystem Upgrades & Bullish Signals Polkadot is gaining traction again, currently priced around $3.40. It recently bounced off key support at $3.31, then rallied 6% in early July. This has traders watching the $3.70–$4.00 range closely. But it’s not just charts driving DOT’s movement, fundamental growth is in motion too. A major governance vote is underway to launch a Polkadot-backed crypto payment card. Alongside that, scalability upgrades are planned for later this year, which could make DOT’s tech more competitive. Notably, Lightchain AI is set to launch its mainnet on Polkadot, adding another layer to its expanding ecosystem. With strong dev activity, growing parachain interest, and rising speculation, Polkadot looks positioned for a stronger second half of the year. It’s not just about short-term trades, DOT offers one of the more balanced entries on this top-trending crypto for 2025 list. Evaluating the Top-Trending Crypto For 2025 Crypto in 2025 is delivering variety, but not every opportunity is created equal. Cardano is gaining from dev growth and potential ETF exposure. Litecoin has the attention of institutions, with whale activity and ETF chatter supporting its case. Polkadot is upgrading its network while breaking technical resistance. Then there’s BlockDAG. With a running presale, real mining participation, a built-out ecosystem, and a price locked at $0.0016 until August 11, it’s offering multiple value channels at once. If you’re genuinely trying to spot the top-trending crypto for 2025 , now’s the time to look deeper into projects like BlockDAG, because once the window closes, the upside might not come back around.

This upward move has brought the token back to a critical resistance zone between $2.31 and $2.36, an area where the price has struggled multiple times in recent weeks. Experts are now closely watching to see if XRP can finally close above this level. If XRP manages a daily candle close above $2.36, it could trigger a fresh rally towards the next resistance levels at $2.44–$2.45. Beyond that, the next key target would be around $2.61–$2.62, which marks a local high reached in mid-May. A confirmed breakout above $2.36, especially if the price holds this level as new support, would be a strong bullish signal. However, on the shorter time frame, XRP appears to be forming a rising wedge pattern, which is typically seen as a bearish sign. This pattern will only be confirmed if the price drops below $2.27. If that happens, XRP could pull back to short-term support zones at $2.21 and $2.17. In short, if XRP breaks above $2.36, bulls could take control and push towards $2.60. But if the price slips below $2.27, a temporary pullback might follow. An expert said that while XRP’s price is rising, traders should be careful because global trading volumes are still low. They warned this move could be part of a pump and dump setup. Real, strong price moves usually happen when trading volumes cross $10 billion, like when XRP previously jumped from $0.58 to over $2. Santiment reported that XRP’s price has hit a 7-week high, rising above $2.39 for the first time since May 23rd. Right now, there are 2,742 wallets with over 1 million XRP — just one less than yesterday’s record of 2,743 wallets. These big holders now control 47.32 billion XRP, showing they still have strong confidence in XRP’s future.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 04:01:41

On Wednesday, AWS announced that it developed the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), its custom liquid-cooling system designed for data centers with high-performance Nvidia GPUs. Such chips, which are used to train large AI models like the chatbots or image generators so popular today, are among the power-hungriest pieces of hardware in the world. Their rising popularity in AI workloads has strained traditional cooling solutions, particularly air-based cooling. Rather than leaving it up to the market to deliver a scalable cooling solution, Amazon had to get creative and solve it. The IRHX is suitable for retrofit and new data center applications without requiring a wholesale redesign. It does this by circulating chilled liquid close to the servers’ rows to remove heat from the tightly packed GPUs. Dave Brown, Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services at AWS, explained that standard cooling solutions were not viable for their needs. He said these options would have wasted too much data center floor space and used water inefficiently. While such systems might work for a few cabinets at smaller providers, he noted they lacked the liquid-cooling capacity required to support AWS’s scale. AWS launches P6e instances featuring Nvidia Blackwell GPUs AWS has also just introduced P6e instances that leverage Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72, a dense, supercomputing platform containing 72 Blackwell GPUs in one rack. These are designed to cope with the computationally intensive nature of huge AI models and generative AI tasks. Until now, only companies like Microsoft and CoreWeave have offered this next-level GPU cluster. And now AWS customers can access the newest and most advanced custom GPU machine learning training infrastructure available in the cloud, powered by the latest-generation, water-cooled NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The IRHX keeps these pockets of clusters at safe temperatures, providing optimal performance without overheating. By baking the IRHX directly into its data center design, AWS can avoid waiting to retrofit entire structures for liquid cooling or paying for costly construction. In his announcement of the launch of the P6e, Brown noted that by combining the GB200 NVL72 system with Amazon’s IRHX, customers can leverage unmatched computing power at scale. It will also allow developers, researchers, and companies to train much larger AI models more quickly and efficiently than they could in the past. Amazon strengthens its lead in cloud infrastructure The push to in-house its cooling tech at the in-progress data center reveals even more about Amazon’s broader play to own more of its infrastructure. In recent years, AWS has spent heavily developing its chips, storage systems, and networking gear to power its cloud services. These advancements enable Amazon to mitigate reliance on third-party suppliers further and strike a balance between operational performance and cost. This approach has paid off. In the first quarter of 2025, AWS notched its highest operating margin since the unit was created and is now the chief engine of Amazon’s overall profitability. The IRHX launch expands AWS’s innovation leadership and infrastructure footprint in the cloud industry. Other tech titans are also doing likewise. Microsoft, for example, built its own AI chips and custom cooling system, Sidekicks, to go with them. Google and Meta are also investigating ways to construct hardware and systems tailored to AI workloads. However, Amazon has a crucial advantage — its sprawling global footprint of data centers and years of experience building and deploying custom hardware at scale. The IRHX could add to that by streamlining its AI-ready infrastructure, making it more efficient, sustainable, and scalable. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Analyst Warns of Sell-Side Liquidity Squeeze as Whales Take Over,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-ready-to-pop-analyst-warns-of-sell-side-liquidity-squeeze-as-whales-take-over/,"Bitcoin continues to hover just below its previous all-time high, consolidating around the $109,000 mark despite a modest 1.9% gain over the past day. The asset reached a 7-day high of $110,307 but has yet to reclaim the historic high of $111,814, a level set back in May. While short-term price action remains within a tight range, on-chain data reveals deeper structural developments that could shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the weeks ahead. As attention focuses on Bitcoin’s potential for a breakout, some analysts are turning to supply dynamics for clues. One notable observation comes from CryptoQuant contributor Chairman Lee, who has identified a significant reduction in BTC held on centralized exchanges. This trend may serve as a key indicator of future price behavior, especially in the context of institutional demand and exchange activity. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating? Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Drop to Multi-Year Lows Chairman Lee’s analysis highlights a continued decline in exchange-held Bitcoin, with reserves falling to a multi-year low of 2.4 million BTC. This figure is down from over 3.1 million BTC reported in mid-2023. The consistent drawdown in exchange balances is interpreted as a signal that selling pressure is decreasing, which historically has preceded price expansions. According to Lee, “This persistent decline in reserve levels suggests that sell-side liquidity is drying up… Historically, such conditions—where BTC held on exchanges is low—precede major bullish expansions as demand exceeds supply.” In past market cycles, including the 2020–2021 bull run, similar drops in exchange reserves were followed by sharp upward movements in Bitcoin’s price. The logic is based on basic supply-demand mechanics: when available BTC becomes scarce on exchanges, any increase in demand, particularly from ETFs or institutional buyers, can lead to accelerated price growth. Lee emphasizes that this current trend could act as a foundational tailwind, potentially supporting further gains if current demand patterns remain in place. Binance Dominates Whale Transaction Flows Another piece of the market structure puzzle comes from CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk, who examined large-scale BTC transactions across major centralized exchanges. According to his report, Binance has maintained its position as the dominant venue for Bitcoin whale activity. Whale flows are defined in this context as daily inflows or outflows exceeding 1,000 BTC. Binance has recorded cumulative whale inflows of 31.36 million BTC and outflows of 30.82 million BTC, along with 53.2 million whale transactions, significantly more than any other exchange. Notably, these numbers do not reflect unique BTC, but rather total flow volumes that include repeated movements of the same coins. High transaction volumes suggest Binance is favored for its liquidity and infrastructure, allowing whales to engage in trading, custody shifts, and arbitrage with minimal friction.

The data also places HTX Global and Kraken in the second and third positions, respectively, for whale inflows, though their volumes are substantially lower than Binance’s.

On Truth Social, Trump unleashed a scathing attack on the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, criticizing its handling of ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, a conservative leader. Trump wrote that Bolsonaro, who was facing charges over an alleged coup plot, was a highly respected leader worldwide during his term. He branded the case a “Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY! He mentioned that the tariff would start on August 1 and would be used in part due to Brazil’s sneaky attacks on Free Elections and the basic Free Speech Rights of Americans. Trump puts pressure on trading partners to make a deal or face a tariff The US president also slammed Brazil’s Supreme Court for allegedly handing down hundreds of secret and unlawful Censorship orders against US social media platforms and threatening them with millions of dollars in fines and eviction from the country. Following Trump’s remarks, Brazil’s currency slid 2.3%, falling to R$5.58 against the Us dollar during afternoon trading in New York. Meanwhile, futures tied to Brazil’s Bovespa stock index extended their losses, down 2.3% by evening trading in São Paulo. The letter to Brazil was the eighth in a series of letters Trump sent out on Wednesday, July 9, and is part of a larger sweep targeting 22 nations in recent days as he pushes to put pressure on trading partners to make a deal or face a tariff. Earlier that day, Trump had already imposed 25–30% tariffs on countries including Algeria, Brunei, Iraq, Libya, Moldova, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. These letters followed threats of 25% tariffs against Japan, South Korea, and others. Lula da Silva responded to Trump’s 50% tariff threats, stating that Brazil is a self-governing nation with its own institutions that will not allow anyone to control them. He then claimed that Trump’s accusations were false, asserting that in Brazil, freedom of expression should not be mistaken for aggression or violent actions. According to Lula, all companies from Brazil or other countries must follow Brazilian laws to do business there. Geraldo Alckmin calls on Trump to remove the new US tariff on Brazilian imports While near-identical letters were sent to other countries affirming the strength and commitment of the US trading relationship, the message to Latin America’s largest economy took on a sharply different tone. The proposed 50% tariff far exceeds the 10% duty already levied on Brazil as part of the “reciprocal” tariffs announced on April 2. After Trump signaled a new wave of import taxes targeting South American nations, Brazil’s Vice President and Trade Minister Geraldo Alckmin criticized the move, calling it “inappropriate.” He emphasized that Brazil is not a problem for the Us, citing economic data in the country’s defense. Addressing reporters in Brasília, Alckmin argued there was no justification for higher tariffs on Brazilian goods, noting that the US has a trade surplus with Brazil. According to the US Office of the Trade Representative, America recorded a trade surplus of $7.4 billion in goods with Brazil in 2024. Alckmin also warned that new tariffs could backfire on the US economy, using the steel industry as an example. He pointed out that Brazil is the third-largest buyer of coal used in American steelmaking. The country produces a semi-finished product and exports it to the US for final processing, meaning added tariffs would only increase US supply chain costs. Trump’s letter appears to reaffirm his earlier threat of imposing a 10% blanket tariff on all BRICS nations, a bloc in which Brazil is a founding member. The former president later accused BRICS of fostering “anti-American policies.” Adding to the diplomatic strain, US Secretary Marco Rubio said in May that Washington was considering sanctions against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The judge has been at the center of political controversy after ordering the suspension of social media accounts accused of spreading misinformation. Earlier that day, Brazil’s foreign ministry summoned the acting US ambassador in response to an embassy statement that supported former President Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil’s Supreme Court has not commented on the matter.

The relentless flows are now forcing ""under-positioned"" traders to chase upside through derivatives, reviving the bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research . ""The sharp surge in bitcoin ETF inflows since late April 2025 has been primarily driven by political pressure on the Federal Reserve, with Donald Trump openly demanding that Chair Jerome Powell cut rates to 1% and resign. What began as a partisan push has since broadened, with Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and Senator Cynthia Lummis also calling for Powell to step down, criticizing his perceived hawkish stance,"" Thielen said in a note to clients Thursday. Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve have revived memories of Turkish President Erdogan's similar actions between 2019 and 2021, which led to a broad-based shift away from Turkish assets and a crash in the Lira. Back then, Erdogan issued multiple decrees dismissing central bank officials for not cutting rates. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly called for Powell's resignation, saying his reluctance to cut rates is costing America billions of dollars. The minutes of the Fed meeting held on July 17-18 showed a growing divide over how policy should proceed from here. According to CNBC, Opinions ranged from a ""couple"" of officials who said the next cut could come as soon as this month to ""some"" who thought no reductions this year would be appropriate. Under-positioned bulls re-enter The relentless ETF flows, combined with growing pressure on the Fed to cut rates, are finally forcing traders, who have been hesitant to commit to bullish trades, to re-enter the market fully. ""Since mid-April, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $15 billion worth of Bitcoin, and notably, this buying has continued uninterrupted, even as Bitcoin has consolidated since mid-May. This steady demand now appears to be forcing underpositioned traders back into the market, as suggested by positioning data from the derivatives space,"" Thielen said. Traders have been chasing call options at strikes $130,000, as CoinDesk noted early this week. A call option represents a bullish bet on the market, with the demand for the $ 130,000 call reflecting expectations for a price surge above that level. These bullish flows are consistent with the positive seasonality typically observed in July. Data tracked by Coinglass shows BTC has put in a positive performance in July in eight out of the past 12 years, with an average gain of over 7%. ""Combined with historically strong seasonality in July and potential bullish catalysts from upcoming macro data and policy developments, the backdrop remains supportive for further upside,"" Thielen noted.

47940247,https://invezz.com/?p=2794780,1752123748,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Most underrated DeFi token: MUTM may surpass XRP before year-end,https://invezz.com/news/2025/07/10/most-underrated-defi-token-mutm-may-surpass-xrp-before-year-end/,"Recently, analysts predict Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at $0.03 in its Phase 5 presale with a $11.9M raise, could surpass XRP, trading at $2.22 with a $130B market cap, by year-end. MUTM’s dual-lending DeFi model (P2C and P2P) and CertiK-audited platform drive a projected 150x rally to $4.50, fueled by $100K giveaway and 12,900 holders. XRP, down 2.5% last week, faces $2.27 resistance, with a 1.3x rally to $2.80 possible on 90% ETF approval odds. However, XRP’s regulatory overhang and $1.95 support risk contrast MUTM’s low-cap upside and Defi tokenomics, potentially outpacing XRP’s market cap growth by December 2025. What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from conventional DeFi platforms is its innovative lending structure. It will introduce a peer-to-peer (P2P) experience that’s built for full customization. Unlike platforms that force users into standardized borrowing terms, Mutuum’s P2P model gives both borrowers and lenders total control. Users will be able to set their own loan duration, interest rate, and even accept partial fills from multiple lenders—all on-chain and without intermediaries. The use cases extend far beyond basic crypto trading. In the P2C model, one retail user, for example, can deposit $20,000 in ADA as collateral—based on a 60% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio—and unlock a $12,000 borrowing amount. In parallel, the protocol will offer passive dividends through mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens received when users lend assets into shared liquidity pools. A user who deposits $15,000 worth of BNB into Mutuum’s peer-to-contract (P2C) pool will receive 15,000mtBNB in return, automatically accruing yield at an average annualized rate of 10.5% (depending on pool utilization). These mtTokens act as a user’s proof of deposit and will grow in redeemable value as interest accumulates from borrower activity. No need to manually compound or monitor: the interest grows passively over time, making it one of the simplest yet most effective ways to earn in DeFi. Presale momentum and revenue-backed growth model The protocol plans to use a portion of its profits to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers in the designated contracts. This approach does two things: it strengthens long-term user incentives while applying continuous upward price pressure on the token itself. As the ecosystem scales, these mechanics are expected to compound value for early supporters. To further drive confidence in its rollout, the team has introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. This initiative supports the upcoming launch while reinforcing security across the smart contracts, which have already undergone CertiK’s thorough review processes. Additionally, the project has launched a $100,000 giveaway for early token buyers—ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM, further boosting the incentive to join before the next price jump. The excitement around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t speculative—it’s tied to real lending activity, on-chain revenue generation, and user engagement. For those who are tired of watching XRP stagnate and want to move their capital into a token designed for growth, income, and utility, this may be the moment to act. The $0.03 price tag today will be a distant memory by the end of the year, and as the DeFi sector evolves, Mutuum is quickly becoming the one token everyone will wish they had discovered sooner.

47940248,https://invezz.com/?p=2794771,1752123976,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Top undervalued crypto: XLM stagnates while this asset prepares for 600% growth,https://invezz.com/news/2025/07/10/top-undervalued-crypto-xlm-stagnates-while-this-asset-prepares-for-600-growth/,"While XLM holders continue to watch the same sideways movement week after week, opportunity cost becomes very real. An investor who held $2,000 worth of Stellar (XLM) over the past 90 days has seen almost no gains. On the other hand, a similarly sized investment made into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 2—when tokens were priced at $0.015—has already grown 100%, long before the token has even launched. Stellar (XLM) price stagnation Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized blockchain platform launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, focused on fast, low-cost cross-border payments and financial inclusion, rivaling XRP. Using the Stellar (XLM) Consensus Protocol (SCP), it achieves 3–5-second transaction finality with $0.00001 fees. XLM, its native token, facilitates transactions, supports asset tokenization, and powers DeFi, remittances, and RWAs. On July 7, 2025, XLM traded at $0.24 with a $4.6B market cap, backed by 8.7M accounts and $2.8B in stablecoin volume. XLM remained flat last week, trading at $0.24 with a $4.6B market cap. A double bottom at $0.225 hints at a 1.2x rally to $0.29, but $0.2479 resistance and an RSI of 45 signal bearish pressure. $2.8B in stablecoin volume and HashSphere integration are offset by Aptos’s TVL overtake and a 3.2% address drop, risking a fall to $0.20. Posts on X highlight fading ETF hopes, dampening sentiment. Lending activity that rewards every user At the heart of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) model will be its dual-mode lending framework. The protocol will offer both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending options. This flexibility will allow users to either supply assets to shared liquidity pools and earn interest automatically, or directly negotiate terms for more volatile assets in P2P scenarios. The structure will appeal to a wide spectrum of users and will help keep the protocol capital-efficient. A practical example will show the value of participation. Someone who deposits $8,000 worth of LINK into the P2C model will earn $736 at 9.2% APY, driven by dynamic interest rate adjustments that will respond to pool usage. There will be no need for manual claiming or reinvesting. As a depositor receives mtTokens, which will represent their share in the pool, these tokens will increase in value passively as interest accrues. On the borrowing side, the system will be just as efficient. A user holding $5,000 in MATIC will be able to borrow up to $2,750 in DAI at a 55% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. This approach will offer unmatched flexibility, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appealing to both traders and long-term holders who will seek liquidity without having to sell their assets. Presale surge, real tokenomics, and a strong security backbone Momentum is building fast. The project is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.03 with a significant price jump to $0.035 just around the corner. With over $11.9 million already raised, more than 12,900 holders onboard, and 65% of this phase already sold out, the window for low-entry access is closing rapidly. The final listing price is locked in at $0.06, and early buyers are positioning themselves for strong short-term and long-term gains. What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from legacy tokens like Stellar (XLM) is how it ties token value directly to ecosystem activity. The protocol will use a portion of its earnings to buy MUTM tokens from the market and distribute them to users who stake mtTokens in the designated smart contracts. This mechanism not only creates buying pressure but also reinforces long-term staking behavior and deepens liquidity in the system. Security is also being prioritized from the start. The team has enlisted CertiK to audit the platform, including a full manual code review and static analysis. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program is currently running, offering top-tier rewards to developers who help identify vulnerabilities ahead of the launch. This transparent, security-first approach positions the protocol to grow responsibly and sustainably over time. While XLM continues to trade on legacy reputation alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an income-driven ecosystem with functional lending, dynamic tokenomics, and a rapidly growing community. As the presale advances and the token edges toward exchange listings, the $0.03 price point may be remembered as the last dip before explosive growth. In the evolving world of DeFi, those who recognize revenue-backed innovation early are the ones who gain the most.

To illustrate, purchasing 10,000 MUTM tokens now at $0.03 would cost just $300, and if the price rises to $0.15, those holdings would be valued at $1,500, delivering a net profit of $1,200 even before factoring in additional staking or yield incentives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the center of its design will be mtTokens, which will act as a transparent and efficient reflection of a user’s share in the protocol’s lending pools. Every time someone deposits assets like BTC, ETH, or USDT, they will receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio. These tokens will grow in value over time, collecting interest directly from borrower activity. What will make them powerful is that they will accumulate yield passively, meaning holders won’t need to manually reinvest or harvest. The longer users hold their mtTokens, the more they will earn automatically. On the borrower side, the protocol will introduce flexible, overcollateralized loans. One retail user, for example, will be able to borrow $1,200 (depending on LTV ratio) by locking up $2,000 worth of SOL as collateral. That user will have the option to repay the amount at any point, even after just 20 days, and will only pay interest for the duration the loan remains open. Meanwhile, lenders looking to earn passive returns will find serious value in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s (MUTM) peer-to-contract (P2C) pools. A deposit of $7,500 in BTC is expected to gain $757.5 yield at a solid 10.1% APY. These yields will be driven by the protocol’s dynamic rate system, which will adjust based on pool utilization, ensuring that both lenders and borrowers benefit from a constantly balancing ecosystem. Utility meets growth in a high-conviction ecosystem Unlike many tokens that rely purely on speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ties its value directly to revenue and utility. The protocol plans to use a portion of its profits to repurchase MUTM tokens from the market and distribute them to users staking mtTokens in the designated contracts. This ensures ongoing demand while rewarding long-term participation, helping MUTM grow in both price and user commitment. Additionally, these redistributions are not just a reward—they’re part of a system that strengthens liquidity and protocol resilience over time. Investors who recognized the value early are already seeing strong gains. Someone who entered Phase 1 of the presale at just $0.01 now holds tokens valued at 3X that amount—before public listing even begins. This kind of growth is drawing attention, especially as the project approaches a crucial pricing threshold. Currently in Phase 5, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.03, with 65% of the round sold out and over $11.9 million already raised. The next price jump to $0.035 is expected soon, and with the final listing at $0.06, this is likely the last dip before price action accelerates. The broader community is also growing fast, now boasting over 12,900 holders who are positioning themselves ahead of launch. This momentum is being fueled by a $100,000 giveaway , with ten early participants expected to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each. It’s a strategic way to reward early believers and drive long-term engagement. Security is another cornerstone of the project. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program is live to encourage top developers to strengthen the system ahead of the mainnet release. The protocol’s audit with CertiK includes both manual reviews and static analysis, confirming that safety is more than just a talking point—it’s part of the DNA of the platform. As larger sections of the market continue chasing hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a protocol that works—one that delivers interest, liquidity, and income. Its combination of mtToken mechanics, flexible lending terms, and smart tokenomics has it positioned to break into price discovery quickly after listing. For investors seeking value that lasts beyond the next meme cycle, Mutuum isn’t just a hidden gem—it’s the next DeFi powerhouse on the rise toward $0.15 and beyond.

SOL price is now consolidating gains and might struggle to rise above the $160 resistance. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $150 and $155 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $152 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $155 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

This strategic move, according to their statement, aims to support the development of the token on the TRON chain and increase cross-ecosystem cryptocurrency adoption by collaborating with communities like GetTrumpMemes. Sun used the following statements in his post on X (formerly Twitter) today: “We are committed to the $100 million acquisition of TRUMP! TRUMP and TRON together are the future of crypto. This move reflects our belief in growing the crypto ecosystem by working with communities like GetTrumpMemes.” Related News: JUST IN: Coinbase Announces Listing News for Two Altcoins as Bitcoin Breaks a New Record On Monday, the Tron DAO announced that the TRUMP memecoin would be integrated into the TRON network. Earlier this year, Sun was also invited to a gala dinner attended by Donald Trump. According to CNBC, prior to the event, Sun stated that he held approximately $19 million worth of TRUMP tokens and was the largest investor in the market. The Sun-Trump relationship isn't limited to the TRUMP token. Shortly after Trump was elected president in November 2024, Sun invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial, another crypto project named after the president. Trump's sons are also involved as “ambassadors” in the project. Sun later increased this investment to $75 million and was appointed as an advisor to the project. In January, World Liberty purchased millions of dollars in TRON's native token, TRX. *This is not investment advice.

In partnership with investment firm 10X Capital, the new company aims to acquire and hold BNB, with the ultimate goal of listing on a major U.S. stock exchange. The goal is to offer traditional investors easier, regulation-friendly access to BNB, without needing to use crypto exchanges directly. This move is part of a growing trend to bring digital assets into mainstream financial markets. BNB meets Wall Street. YZi Labs is officially supporting @10XCapitalUSA to develop the BNB Treasury Company. U.S. investors now have a gateway for BNB’s growth. YZi Labs champions BNB as a treasury asset, and chooses our partners with care. Rely only on our official channels… https://t.co/4zEGKki0ve — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) July 10, 2025 A Regulated Gateway to BNB The company will be led by David Namdar, co-founder of Galaxy Digital, with 10X Capital acting as the asset manager. Moreover, by offering publicly traded shares backed by BNB, the firm intends to mirror existing strategies in the crypto space, where firms like MicroStrategy and ETFs have bought large quantities of Bitcoin. This move marks one of the first serious efforts to apply the model to exchange-tied tokens like BNB. The effort opens the door for investors who have so far had limited access to BNB due to regulatory and infrastructural limitations in the U.S. market. CZ’s Deep Stake in BNB Though barred from managing Binance following a plea deal with U.S. authorities, CZ remains its biggest shareholder. In February, he disclosed that 98.5% of his crypto portfolio is held in BNB. A June 2024 Forbes report estimates that Zhao holds 94 million BNB, valued at around $63 billion and accounting for over 64% of the circulating supply, with Binance controlling another 31.5%. Nano Labs Bets on BNB’s Future Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs has taken a bold step by purchasing $50 million worth of BNB, roughly 74,000 tokens at ~$672 each. This move is part of a plan to accumulate up to $1 billion in BNB, targeting 10% of its total supply. Facing a slowdown in its chip manufacturing business, the company is pivoting to digital assets to fuel future growth. Following the announcement, Nano Labs’ stock doubled to $22, while BNB price saw a 2.7% uptick in price. BNB Market Snapshot BNB is trading at $670, showing a 1.3% daily gain. Backed by major players and new institutional channels, BNB is growing from an exchange utility token into a more broadly recognized financial asset. What It Means for Investors These moves show rising interest in BNB from big investors. Both BNB Treasury Company and Nano Labs aim to provide safe and regulated investment options for BNB. More public companies are now holding crypto like BNB and XRP, not just Bitcoin. Nano Labs plans to buy up to $1 billion in BNB, and others like Trident Digital and Webus are doing the same. CZ said over 30 teams are working on similar BNB-focused public firms, showing that institutional interest in BNB is growing fast . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The BNB Treasury Company, backed by YZi Labs and 10X Capital, will be a publicly traded entity that holds BNB. It aims to offer shares backed by BNB, similar to how MicroStrategy holds Bitcoin, providing traditional investors indirect exposure to BNB. How does listing the BNB Treasury Company on a U.S. stock exchange make BNB more accessible? Listing on a U.S. stock exchange provides a regulated, familiar, and accessible investment vehicle for traditional investors who might otherwise face regulatory hurdles or technological barriers when buying BNB directly on crypto exchanges. How will the BNB Treasury Company and Nano Labs’ purchases impact BNB’s price and adoption? These significant purchases by the BNB Treasury Company and Nano Labs are likely to increase demand for BNB, potentially driving up its price. Their institutional backing also boosts BNB’s legitimacy, fostering wider adoption among both retail and institutional investors.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BNB|REGULATION|BUSINESS|ZRX|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 05:23:40

The Beijing Internet Finance Association highlighted the dangers of fundraising schemes involving stablecoins and digital currencies, saying that investors in these schemes have no legal recourse. The notice cautions against high-return promises tied to ""financial innovation"" and ""blockchain technology"" narratives. The association also cautioned against unauthorized schemes exploiting buzzwords such as “stablecoins,” “decentralized finance (DeFi),” and “Web 3.0,” which often lure investors with promises of high returns but no legal recourse in case of fraud. ""These activities can easily evolve into crimes such as illegal fundraising, financial fraud, pyramid schemes and money laundering, which would severely disrupt economic and financial order, and endanger public interest and social trust,"" the association said. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar ( DXY ) and are gaining popularity for their potential to disrupt traditional payment structures. Globally, nations like Hong Kong and the U.S. are racing to establish regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, aiming to expand their influence in the digital finance landscape. While mainland China maintains strict prohibitions, Hong Kong is set to implement stablecoin legislation from August 1, 2025, as part of its strategy to become a digital asset hub. The collateralized fiat stablecoin with the largest market cap is Tether ( USDT-USD ), which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. A collateralized crypto stablecoin is Dai ( DAI-USD ).

This trend mirrors the overall corporate shift towards Bitcoin reserves, which was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Meanwhile, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao is backing a new venture—BNB Treasury Company—aiming to give institutional investors exposure to BNB via a US-listed vehicle. Remixpoint, a Tokyo-based fintech and energy firm, is also making headlines after raising $215 million to triple its Bitcoin holdings to 3,000 BTC, with its CEO now also taking his salary in Bitcoin. Trump Jr Buys Into BTC Focused Media Company Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of US President Donald Trump, revealed an investment in Thumzup Media Corp, a social media marketing firm that adopted a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. According to Bloomberg, Trump Jr. owns 350,000 shares of the company, which is currently worth nearly $3.3 million based on a trading price of about $9.50 per share. Thumzup Media Corp share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Thumzup’s embrace of Bitcoin began in November of 2024 when its board authorized the purchase of up to $1 million in BTC as part of its corporate treasury. CEO Robert Steele explained that the move was driven by the rise of Bitcoin ETFs and increased institutional support. Bitcoin's scarcity and inflation-resistant properties were also valuable traits that were considered for safeguarding company capital. Thumzup’s BTC holdings over time (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) To expand its position even more, Thumzup filed a universal shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May, to raise $200 million through debt and equity financing. As of now, the company holds 19.11 BTC, currently valued at over $2.1 million. The trend of companies like Thumzup adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset led to a wider discussion on the long-term viability of this strategy. Since 2024, there has been a surge in firms adding Bitcoin to their treasuries, with 258 institutions now listed on BitcoinTreasuries, ranging from public and private companies to crypto-native custodians and even government-linked entities. The movement was originally popularized by Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, who pivoted his business intelligence firm into a Bitcoin-focused treasury company back in 2020. Despite the growing list of adopters, some analysts are still skeptical about the sustainability of the trend. Critics argue that many of these newer entrants lack the strong conviction that is necessary to endure the extreme volatility of the crypto market. Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser explained that Saylor and his company have already proven their resilience through multiple market downturns, unlike the recent wave of companies whose conviction has yet to be tested. A June report from venture capital firm Breed shared very similar concerns, and warned that most Bitcoin treasury companies could fail during the next bearish cycle. This could trigger a potential cascade of selloffs that may deepen any future downturn. CZ Backs New BNB Treasury Firm Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao’s family office is also backing a new investment venture that aims to give institutional and retail investors exposure to BNB through a publicly listed company in the United States. YZi Labs announced that it will support 10X Capital in launching the “BNB Treasury Company,” which plans to list on a major US exchange. The new firm will be led by David Namdar, a senior partner at 10X Capital and co-founder of Galaxy Digital, and 10X Capital will act as the company’s asset manager. This initiative is also part of the trend among firms aiming to create public vehicles for cryptocurrency exposure. BNB is the native token of the Binance ecosystem, and was originally created to provide trading discounts. It now powers applications across the BNB Chain, a blockchain that was launched by Binance in 2019. Ella Zhang, head of YZi Labs, stated that expanding institutional access to BNB could provide many meaningful benefits to the broader public. 10X Capital founder Hans Thomas stated that although BNB is one of the largest and most active ecosystems globally, US investors have had limited access to its growth. The BNB Treasury Company expects to announce the closure of its financing round in the coming weeks. Exchange-tied tokens like BNB serve as both user incentives and funding mechanisms for crypto platforms. While Binance created BNB and its blockchain, the company claims not to be directly involved in their ongoing development. However, Zhao revealed in February that nearly all of his crypto holdings—98.5%—are in BNB. According to Forbes , Zhao controls approximately 94 million BNB tokens, which equates to over 64% of its circulating supply. Binance controls an additional 31.5%. Combined, Zhao and Binance reportedly control close to 96% of all circulating BNB , currently worth around $63 billion. Despite being barred from managing Binance as part of a money laundering settlement with US authorities, Zhao is still the company’s largest shareholder. On Wednesday, he posted on X that more than 30 teams are interested in launching similar BNB-focused public treasury firms. While Bitcoin is the primary focus of most corporate crypto treasuries, BNB is beginning to attract institutional attention. Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs recently announced plans to purchase up to $1 billion worth of BNB, having already acquired $50 million. Remixpoint Plans to Triple Bitcoin Holdings Meanwhile, Tokyo-based energy and fintech firm Remixpoint announced that it raised 31.5 billion yen, or approximately $215 million, to expand its Bitcoin treasury reserves. The company revealed on X that the entire sum will be used for purchasing Bitcoin, which will help in its aggressive push into digital asset accumulation. The capital was secured through its 25th series of stock acquisition rights and the fourth series of unsecured bonds, which will result in the issuance of 55 million new shares—equivalent to a 39.9% dilution. The shares will be issued at market price without any discount. Remixpoint announcement on X Remixpoint stated that it plans to grow its Bitcoin holdings to 3,000 BTC in the short term. The company currently holds 1,051 BTC, worth over $113.8 million, placing it as the 30th largest Bitcoin-holding corporation according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . This move happened on the heels of an announcement that CEO Takashi Tashiro will begin receiving his salary in Bitcoin to align his interests with shareholders and reflect the firm’s deepening belief in Bitcoin’s future potential. The board unanimously approved the strategic allocation, due to Bitcoin’s potential to enhance corporate value while balancing risk and flexibility. The company stressed that this decision was only made after very rigorous internal debate and is aimed at seizing long-term opportunity rather than taking reckless risks. Other Japanese companies are also ramping up their crypto holdings.

Her remarks come as Robinhood, the retail trading platform, gains renewed market momentum from its tokenization initiatives, with its stock nearing record highs. The company’s push into blockchain-based offerings—particularly in Europe—has sparked investor enthusiasm, but also prompted regulatory inquiries, underscoring the balancing act between innovation and compliance in the evolving financial landscape. SEC’s Hester Peirce Warns Companies Eyeing Tokenized Securities Hester Peirce , a commissioner at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and head of its crypto task force, issued a stern caution to companies exploring the burgeoning field of tokenized securities. In a public statement released Wednesday, Peirce urged firms to consult with the SEC before moving forward with any plans to distribute or trade tokenized versions of traditional financial assets, emphasizing that these instruments are still subject to existing federal securities laws. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said. “Tokenized securities are still securities. Accordingly, market participants must consider—and adhere to—the federal securities laws when transacting in these instruments.” The warning arrives at a pivotal moment for the crypto and financial technology sectors, just two weeks after stock trading giant Robinhood launched its own tokenization-focused Layer-2 blockchain. The initiative aims to bring US equities and exchange-traded products (ETPs) onchain, initially targeting European markets. While Peirce did not mention Robinhood by name, the timing and tone of her remarks strongly suggest that the SEC is paying close attention to the firm’s aggressive foray into tokenized finance. Regulatory Caution Amid Tokenization Hype Peirce’s comments serve as a reminder that while blockchain can enhance transparency, accessibility, and efficiency in financial markets, it does not exempt participants from legal scrutiny. The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) like stocks, bonds, and ETFs—long touted as a game-changing use case for crypto—must still comply with the same investor protections and disclosure requirements that apply in traditional finance. Her statement echoed the sentiment of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who repeatedly urged crypto firms to “come in and talk to us” before launching potentially non-compliant products. However, the regulatory tone under the Trump administration and new SEC Chair Paul Atkins appears to be shifting. Peirce’s statement struck a balance between caution and openness, suggesting a willingness to collaborate on updating outdated rules. “When unique aspects of a technology warrant changes to existing rules or where regulatory requirements are outdated or unnecessary, we stand ready to work with market participants to craft appropriate exemptions and modernize rules,” she added. Robinhood, whose stock has recently surged to near-record highs, appears to be walking a fine regulatory line with its tokenization strategy. The company plans to offer tokenized versions of US stocks and ETPs to investors in Europe, taking advantage of less stringent regulatory barriers abroad while simultaneously submitting a proposal to the SEC for a tokenized asset regulatory framework in the United States. The move positions Robinhood as a first-mover among traditional financial platforms entering the tokenized securities space. By building a custom Layer-2 blockchain focused on compliance and scalability, Robinhood aims to onboard millions of retail investors into a future where traditional assets and crypto coexist seamlessly onchain. However, questions remain about how these products would be treated under US law—especially if they were to be offered domestically. Peirce’s statement appears to serve both as a warning and a roadmap: the SEC is not necessarily against innovation, but it expects companies to proactively engage with regulators to ensure compliance. A Changing Regulatory Landscape The legal ambiguity surrounding tokenized securities may soon be addressed through congressional action. Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives are preparing to move forward with the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, a bill designed to define the jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) when it comes to regulating digital assets. If passed, the bill could help resolve long-standing conflicts about which agency oversees different categories of tokens, including tokenized versions of traditional assets. Industry experts believe that such clarity could unlock a wave of institutional adoption by reducing legal risk and compliance uncertainty. Tokenization: Innovation vs. Regulation The SEC’s heightened scrutiny comes as tokenization gains significant momentum in both the crypto-native and traditional finance worlds. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have explored tokenizing money market funds, while blockchain firms such as Polygon, Avalanche, and Chainlink are building infrastructure specifically designed for tokenizing assets. According to a recent report from Citi, the total market for tokenized real-world assets could reach $16 trillion by the end of the decade. However, regulatory clarity remains a prerequisite for the industry to reach that scale. Peirce’s measured tone and openness to modernizing securities laws suggest a regulatory strategy that seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation and upholding the SEC’s investor protection mandate. Robinhood Stock Soars on Tokenization Strategy Amid Regulatory Scrutiny in Europe Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD) is riding a powerful wave of investor optimism as its strategic move into blockchain tokenization fuels a historic stock rally. The online brokerage’s embrace of decentralized finance infrastructure has pushed its stock price to $94.65, within striking distance—just 4%—of its all-time high reached earlier this month. HOOD extended its rally on Wednesday (Source: Google Finance) HOOD shares have surged more than 27% in the past 30 days and are now up an eye-popping 137% since the beginning of the year, pushing Robinhood’s market capitalization past $82 billion. The rally underscores a resounding vote of confidence from Wall Street in Robinhood’s evolving business model, even as regulators—especially in Europe—scrutinize parts of its growing tokenization platform. Blockchain Strategy Ignites Market Momentum Robinhood’s momentum picked up significantly in late June, following the launch of its very own Layer-2 blockchain network focused on asset tokenization. Built on Arbitrum, a prominent Ethereum scaling solution, the new blockchain enables tokenized representations of US stocks and exchange-traded products (ETPs) to be traded by investors in Europe. This bold foray into tokenization reflects CEO Vlad Tenev’s vision of a more accessible, globalized financial system where real-world assets (RWAs) can be traded with the same efficiency as cryptocurrencies. According to Robinhood, the blockchain will support the creation, trading, and settlement of tokenized assets, helping it break new ground in the digital asset arena. Robinhood’s stock rally has been supported by fundamentals as well. The company reported a 50% year-over-year increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2025, reaching $927 million. That momentum, combined with strong user growth and international expansion, has led to a fresh wave of institutional interest. While Robinhood's tokenization strategy is initially focused on the European market due to regulatory flexibility, the company is also setting the stage for a broader play in the US. The brokerage has proposed the Real World Asset Exchange (RWAX)—a dedicated platform to facilitate the onchain settlement and secondary trading of tokenized real-world assets. If approved by US regulators, RWAX could become the first regulated marketplace in the country to offer compliant trading of tokenized stocks and funds on a blockchain. The proposal reflects Robinhood’s calculated attempt to stay ahead of potential legal roadblocks while lobbying for clearer crypto asset regulation through both internal efforts and external partnerships. European Regulators Raise Eyebrows Over Equity Tokens Despite the enthusiasm from investors, Robinhood’s expansion into tokenized equities has raised red flags with financial watchdogs in Europe. In particular, the Bank of Lithuania, which serves as Robinhood’s primary regulator for its European operations, has requested more details about certain offerings tied to private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. The controversy stems from Robinhood’s issuance of private equity tokens—digital assets that mirror the value of shares in privately held firms. These tokens are not technically shares but are structured to offer indirect exposure to private equity through derivative-style instruments. According to research by Galaxy Digital, these instruments function more like total return swaps than traditional stock tokens, making them more palatable from a regulatory standpoint—yet still requiring careful oversight. Investor Sentiment Remains Bullish Despite concerns over regulatory pushback, investors remain overwhelmingly optimistic. The tokenization narrative has revitalized the company’s growth outlook, with analysts revising price targets upward across the board. Daily trading volume in HOOD shares has increased nearly 40% over the past two weeks, reflecting heightened interest from institutional players. Moreover, Robinhood's expansion into tokenized equities positions it favorably amid growing calls for more transparency and efficiency in traditional financial markets. If its efforts in Europe prove successful, the company could become a blueprint for other brokerages eyeing the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-10 05:30:00

The acquisition was announced in a July 9 press release via Business Wire. Portal, which provides embedded stablecoin payment tools for developers and businesses, will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Monad Foundation. The deal gives Monad access to Portal’s payment rails and stablecoin settlement infrastructure, which powers millions of dollars in daily onchain volume. Raj Parekh, Portal’s chief executive officer and co-founder, will join the Monad Foundation as head of payments and stablecoins. Parekh previously led Visa’s global crypto product strategy and brings experience in both traditional and decentralized finance. “Portal was built to lower the barrier for anyone to move money onchain. The complementary visions of Portal and the Monad Foundation will scale that mission faster.” — Raj Parekh , CEO and co-founder of Portal Portal’s remaining co-founders, Parsa Attari, David Scrobonia, and Rami Shahatit, will continue to lead the company independently, while contributing to Monad’s efforts to build a high-speed, enterprise-grade blockchain for stablecoin payments. You might also like: Circle to enable USDC on Monad mainnet on day 1 Monad is currently operating in testnet and has processed more than 2 billion transactions to date, with throughput reaching 10,000 transactions per second and block finality in under one second. The blockchain is designed to be Ethereum-compatible and uses a combination of parallel execution and custom infrastructure to support large-scale applications. A mainnet launch is expected later this quarter. The acquisition aligns with Monad’s goal of positioning payments as a core use case. “Payments are a killer use case for blockchains,” said Monad co-founder Keone Hon. “Portal’s production-grade stablecoin rails will provide enterprises and developers with plug-and-play solutions to incorporate stablecoin payments into their platforms and apps,” Hon added. This move also builds on Monad’s earlier partnerships, including its integration with Chainlink Scale in April 2025, which improved access to low-latency data feeds for decentralized finance builders. With Portal now onboard, Monad intends to compete directly in the fast-evolving stablecoin infrastructure space, targeting both Web2 fintechs and Web3-native platforms.

The initiative, announced by YZi Labs in a July 9 press release, will operate under the name BNB Treasury Company and plans to pursue a public listing on a major American stock exchange. The goal is to offer U.S. investors regulated access to BNB ( BNB ), the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and the broader BNB Chain ecosystem. BNB Chain, known for powering millions of users and thousands of decentralized apps, remains one of the most active blockchain ecosystems. Yet, U.S. investors have had limited ways to gain regulated exposure to BNB itself. The company will be developed in partnership with 10X Capital, a digital asset investment firm that previously helped launch Nakamoto (Nasdaq: NAKA).

David Namdar, co-founder of Galaxy Digital, joins as a senior partner alongside Russell Read, former chief investment officer for CalPERS and Deutsche Asset Management. Also on board is Saad Naja, previously a director at Kraken and now on the board of Exinity. 10X Capital will serve as the BNB Treasury Company’s asset manager, working with Cohen & Company Capital Markets and Clear Street LLC to raise funds for its initial BNB purchases. The financing round is expected to close in the coming weeks. “By supporting this initiative, we aim to combine the strengths of the BNB ecosystem with 10X Capital’s institutional asset management and capital markets expertise,” said Ella Zhang, head of YZi Labs The new company is one of several treasury entities turning to BNB as a strategic reserve asset. Build & Build Corporation is reportedly raising $100 million to accumulate BNB, while Nano Labs has already committed $50 million and is targeting a position worth up to $1 billion. BNB Treasury Company plans to provide transparent asset reporting and engage closely with the BNB Chain community. If successful, it could become a key vehicle for bridging U.S. capital markets and one of crypto’s most active networks.

However, companies providing crypto services must register with the Office of the Republic of Slovenia for the Prevention of Money Laundering and other regulatory bodies. Conclusion With a positive regulatory environment and supportive government agencies, Slovenia has positioned itself as a global leader in crypto regulation. The country is home to a growing number of cryptocurrency startups and is one of the wealthiest crypto countries, with an average of $240,000 per investor. As platforms like Coinbase, Bitpanda, MetaMarket, Trust Wallet, and others gain traction among Slovenian users, the government continues to focus on tightening crypto laws—ensuring transparency, security, and proper taxation moving forward. Slovenia’s crypto regulation model could soon serve as a blueprint for other nations navigating the evolving digital asset space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, Slovenia is widely considered a crypto-friendly country, especially in 2025. It has been proactive in establishing a clear regulatory framework, including comprehensive tax reforms, anti-money laundering (AML) laws, and the full implementation of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. This robust and supportive environment has positioned Ljubljana as the world’s most crypto-friendly city and made Slovenia a leading nation in crypto wealth concentration. What is Slovenia’s crypto adoption rate in 2025? Slovenia has an estimated 98,000 crypto users, with a 4.66% crypto user penetration rate and an adult crypto ownership rate of 15% in 2024, reflecting its growing tech-savvy population. How much is crypto tax in Slovenia? Currently, in 2025, capital gains from selling or spending crypto are generally not taxed for individuals unless it’s a professional business activity. However, from January 1, 2026, a proposed 25% flat tax on capital gains will apply when converting crypto to fiat or spending it. Mining and staking income are taxed as regular income. Corporate crypto activities are subject to the standard 19% corporate income tax.",Cryptocurrency Regulation|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|MINING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 05:51:09

The stake, disclosed in a Wednesday filing , was worth more than $4m at the previous close of $12.36 per share. Trump Jr. reportedly made the investment on his adviser’s recommendation and holds no further involvement with the company, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The filing followed a $6m private placement of convertible preferred stock arranged by Dominari Securities. Both Trump Jr. and his brother Eric serve as advisors to the parent of that firm. Image Source: Thumzup Media SEC filing Thumzup Leans Into Crypto, Trump’s Family Doubles Down Thumzup offers an app that pays users for product recommendations on Instagram. It recorded a $2.2m loss on just $151 in revenue in Q1. Still, its stock soared almost 75% over the prior four sessions before tumbling 17% by mid‑Wednesday. In January, Thumzup made a notable pivot by announcing it would hold most of its liquid assets in Bitcoin. Since then, it has accumulated over $2m worth of the crypto asset. Now, the company plans to diversify further by adding six more coins, using funds raised in its latest round. The purchase deepens the Trump family’s involvement in crypto treasury strategies. Trump-linked entities have embraced Bitcoin hoarding across ventures, ranging from Dominari’s ETF investments, Metaplanet advisory board roles, to Trump Media & Technology Group’s $2.3b Bitcoin deployment. Trump Bets Big on Crypto, Raising Eyebrows Over Conflicts and Controversy Donald Trump has shifted from crypto skeptic to advocate, promoting policies to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” His investments, including World Liberty Financial , the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins and NFT deals, have reportedly generated nearly $1b in revenue . These intertwined ventures have drawn scrutiny over potential conflicts, insider governance, and ties to controversial investors. Yet they continue to benefit from a rising regulatory tide and the Trump administration’s pro‑crypto posture.

Peirce noted that tokenized securities still have securities status and therefore remain subject to federal securities laws. “No matter how powerful blockchain technology is, it does not have the ability to magically change the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said in a written statement today, adding, “Tokenized securities are still securities.” Related News: BREAKING: Much Anticipated FED Minutes Have Been Released - Here Are All the Details Peirce's statement comes as cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase and Kraken are intensifying their plans to launch tokenized stock products in the U.S. If these companies receive SEC approval, they would be able to offer blockchain-based stock trading, putting them in direct competition with traditional brokerage firms. Peirce's comments came on the heels of a Senate Banking Committee hearing on digital asset regulations. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the committee's top Democrat, argued that the Clarity Act, a bill expected to be voted on soon in the House of Representatives, contains language that could allow non-cryptocurrency companies to tokenize their assets to avoid SEC oversight. *This is not investment advice.

In a new post on X, she said she expects XRP to hit $3 by the end of the month. This projection quickly drew responses from fellow community members, with one commenter calling it realistic and another labeling it modest. I predict $3 by the end of July #XRP — XRP QUEEN (@crypto_queen_x) July 8, 2025 Potential Bullish Catalysts for XRP While price targets often surface in speculative environments, this projection comes amid a series of developments that lend it some weight. Over the past few months, Ripple has progressed on several fronts. This gives investors new reasons to see XRP’s upside potential. In late June, Ripple made a significant legal move by withdrawing its cross-appeal in the SEC lawsuit. This decision is widely viewed as a step toward closing one of the most prolonged legal sagas in crypto, and experts believe the SEC will follow suit. Ripple has also applied for a banking license in the U.S., contributing to growing confidence. If granted, the license would allow Ripple to operate under federal oversight and provide a wide range of financial services directly tied to XRP and its blockchain infrastructure. It’s a first for a crypto-native company and reflects Ripple’s intent to integrate more deeply with the traditional financial system. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Expansion and Institutional Adoption Additionally, adoption of XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has continued to expand. Early July saw the official launch of USDC on the ledger, making stablecoin operations on the network more accessible and positioning the XRPL as a viable option for DeFi and enterprise applications. XRP has also seen an increase in institutional interest with spot ETFs already launching around the globe and anticipation building for approval of similar products in the U.S. Is XRP Going to $3? Some in the community responded with enthusiasm to XRP Queen’s prediction, pointing to the momentum of these developments. Others noted that while $3 appears achievable, its timing may depend on broader market behavior. One user stated that XRP is likely to reach that level at some point, but argued that there was no guarantee it would do so before the end of July. However, analysts have been predicting a massive spike in July for months, with one prominent analyst stating that the asset would hit its peak for the current cycle this month. XRP Queen’s $3 target is a notable increase from current levels and could pave the way for further gains, as bullish developments unfold.

While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not recognized as legal tender, they operate in a regulatory grey area with evolving tax and compliance frameworks. Over 107 million Indians now engage with crypto assets. Below is a timeline of key crypto regulation updates in India during 2025, Table of contents Crypto Regulation India Timeline – 2025 Crypto Tax in India – 2025 (Fact-Checked) Crypto Adoption in India (2025 Snapshot) Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulation India Timeline – 2025 June 2025 : Discussion paper on Cryptocurrency The Indian government planned to release a discussion paper to establish a regulatory framework for crypto in India. The initiative also promised to seek public consultation on– stakeholders, including financial institutions, legal experts, crypto companies, and the general public. May 22, 2025 : FSB Peer Review Preparation India gears up for the Financial Stability Board (FSB) review in October, aiming to align local crypto regulation with global regulatory standards. April 1, 2025 : SEBI Oversight Begins SEBI starts monitoring crypto tokens that resemble securities. A multi-agency regulatory model is proposed, including RBI, SEBI, and the Finance Ministry. February 13, 2025 : VDA Income Tax Amendment Bill Introduced The bill expands the scope of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) to include NFTs and undisclosed income. However, the 30% tax rate remains unchanged. February 10, 2025 : Crypto Exchanges Declared Reporting Entities Exchanges, wallets, and even mining pools are categorized as “reporting entities.” They must report all transactions to tax authorities under the new AML Crypto Tax in India – 2025 (Fact-Checked) As of now, no official reduction has been made to the 30% tax on crypto gains or the 1% TDS , despite industry demands. 1. For Investors and Traders Flat 30% Tax on gains from crypto sales, swaps, or gifts. No deductions allowed except for cost of acquisition. 1% TDS on transfers above ₹10,000 (buyer deducts and remits). No loss set-off or carry-forward permitted. Example: Buy BTC at ₹2.72 lakh → Sell at ₹8.72 lakh → ₹6 lakh profit → Tax = ₹1.8 lakh + TDS = ₹6,000 2. For Crypto Companies & Exchanges KYC/AML compliance is mandatory. 1% TDS to be collected and remitted on every qualifying user transaction. Transaction reporting to tax authorities under PMLA and IT laws. Category Tax Rate TDS Example Investors 30% 1% if >₹10k ₹50k profit → ₹15k tax + ₹500 TDS Traders 30% 1% if >₹10k Taxed as business income Companies NA 1% collected ₹10L transaction → ₹10k TDS Crypto Adoption in India (2025 Snapshot) Active Users : Over 107.3 million Indians (7.37% of population) hold or trade crypto. Revenue Forecast : India’s crypto market is projected to hit $6.4 billion by year-end. Exchanges : Platforms like CoinDCX, CoinSwitch, and Mudrex offer access to over 500 tokens. Growth Drivers : Rising financial inclusion, smartphone penetration, and blockchain innovation. Government Holdings : No official disclosure yet; policies prioritize transparency and user safety. Conclusion India’s crypto regulation in 2025 reflects a delicate balance between enabling innovation and enforcing oversight. With strict taxes (30% + 1% TDS) and real-time transaction reporting, the government is creating a compliant ecosystem without enforcing an outright ban. As the FSB review nears, clarity in crypto regulation India could open new doors for mass adoption and position the country at the forefront of the $7 trillion global digital economy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

47942646,https://cryptonews.com/?p=380579,1752128193,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/47942646.jpeg,Ripple CEO: Stablecoin Market Could Hit $2 Trillion in Coming Years,https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-ceo-stablecoin-market-could-hit-2-trillion-in-coming-years/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. Key Takeaways: Ripple sees a $2 trillion stablecoin market as a realistic near-term outcome. RLUSD has surpassed $500 million in market cap, with BNY Mellon as its custodian. Ripple is pursuing a US banking license to deepen integration with traditional finance. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Wednesday , Garlinghouse described the expansion as “profound,” citing institutional momentum and evolving regulation as key drivers. Ripple entered the stablecoin space late, Garlinghouse noted, largely because the company had been leveraging third-party stablecoins in its enterprise payment flows. Ripple Bets on RLUSD to Compete in Stablecoin Race RLUSD, Ripple’s own USD-pegged stablecoin, has given the firm an opportunity to compete, thanks to its existing institutional base and focus on regulatory compliance. “Many people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,” Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory. He also announced that BNY Mellon will act as custodian for RLUSD, which crossed the $500 million market cap milestone this week. Industry voices appear to echo Ripple’s optimism. Henrik Andersson, CIO at Apollo Capital, told Cointelegraph the projection aligns with their internal forecasts. “We are seeing fintechs, banks, social networks, and large retailers all launch their own stablecoins,” he said, pointing to growing competition and adoption across sectors. Andersson also highlighted the success of market leaders like Tether, which has turned its dominance into strong profitability. Looking ahead, he said the GENIUS Act , a bill that would give stablecoins legal tender status in the US, could be a major accelerant. The legislation passed the Senate in June and is expected to be enacted later this month. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, added that a friendlier regulatory stance from the SEC could create favorable conditions for the stablecoin market to grow severalfold, possibly hitting the $2 trillion mark within a few years. ANNOUNCEMENT: BNY selected to serve as the primary reserve custodian of @Ripple ’s enterprise-grade stablecoin, Ripple USD ( #RLUSD ). #BNY and Ripple are jointly committed to paving the way for digital asset adoption at institutional scale and together are helping to bridge the… pic.twitter.com/RjyDyBj0Qk — BNY (@BNYglobal) July 9, 2025 Ripple is also tightening its ties to traditional finance. Earlier this month, the firm applied for a banking license with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and a Federal Reserve Master Account. Garlinghouse said the move is aimed at building “bridges between traditional finance and DeFi.” Ripple’s RLUSD Gains Traction Meanwhile, RLUSD continues to gain traction , recently integrating with crypto payments provider Transak. RLUSD’s growing adoption comes against a background of the stablecoin reaching a $500 million market cap for the first time since it debuted trading less than seven months ago. XRP, Ripple’s cross-border payments token, has rallied 7% this week, trading at $2.42, its highest level in nearly two months. Stablecoins have emerged as one of crypto’s rare success stories, capturing the attention of corporations and regulators alike. Recent reports that Amazon, Walmart, and other major companies are exploring stablecoin payments sent ripples through traditional finance, briefly pushing stablecoin transaction volumes ahead of Visa’s in 2024. Frank Combay of Next Generation said regulatory clarity , especially Europe’s MiCA framework, has unlocked stablecoins’ growth potential by removing the biggest barrier: uncertainty. He believes stablecoin ecosystems can reduce transaction costs by over 90% and are becoming increasingly attractive to both consumers and corporations.

After a shaky few weeks, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is now not only soaring in price but has also overtaken Alphabet Inc. in market value. With a $2.213 trillion market cap, Bitcoin is once again the talk of Wall Street and the crypto world alike. But what’s pushing this rally? Let’s break it down. US Lawmakers Finally Talk Crypto Clarity One of the biggest drivers behind Bitcoin’s rise is growing support from US policymakers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently testified before Congress in support of the CLARITY Act, legislation that aims to bring clear rules to the crypto industry. For the first time, all Senators on the panel agreed that crypto is here to stay and needs regulatory clarity. This kind of shift in tone is giving investors fresh hope that the US might finally embrace crypto innovation. Trump’s Big Moves Add Fuel Adding more excitement to the mix, President Donald Trump is pushing for a huge 300 basis point rate cut, the largest in U.S. history. Lower interest rates often push investors toward high-growth assets like Bitcoin, and this move could drive even more capital into crypto markets. Weak Dollar = Strong Bitcoin Another key factor is that the U.S. dollar is losing steam. The Dollar Index (DXY) is trading far below its 200-day average , a level not seen in over two decades. A weaker dollar often encourages investors to move money into alternative assets like Bitcoin, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing now. Institutional Investors Keep Buying On July 9th, Bitcoin ETFs saw fresh net inflows of $215 million , making it five days in a row of steady new money coming in. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack with $125.6 million, while Ark Investment added $57 million and Grayscale brought in another $15.8 million. Liquidations Create Risk and Reward In the past 24 hours, over 114,500 traders were liquidated , with total losses hitting $515 million. The biggest single liquidation was a $51.5 million BTC-USDT order on HTX. Most of the liquidations came from short-term traders, losing about $451 million, while long-term holders lost around $64 million.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 07:08:38

Imagine a scenario where an AI, like ChatGPT, becomes such a prolific ‘hype man’ for your product that it inadvertently forces you to build a new feature. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the very real experience of Adrian Holovaty , founder of the innovative music-teaching platform, Soundslice. His story highlights the unpredictable nature of AI, especially its tendency towards ChatGPT hallucination , and how it can surprisingly drive genuine AI innovation . The Curious Case of ChatGPT Hallucination and Soundslice The tale begins with a peculiar digital mystery that unfolded over several weeks for Adrian Holovaty, the visionary founder behind Soundslice. As the creator of the renowned open-source Django project, Holovaty has a deep understanding of web development and innovation. His current passion, Soundslice, launched in 2012 and proudly bootstrapped, is a sophisticated music-teaching platform. It stands out for its unique video player synchronized with music notations, guiding users through how notes should be played. One of its standout features is an AI-powered sheet music scanner, which transforms physical sheet music into interactive digital formats. It was while monitoring the error logs for this very scanner that Holovaty stumbled upon a baffling phenomenon: an influx of strange images, clearly screenshots of ChatGPT sessions, being uploaded to his site. This wasn’t just an oddity; it was a symptom of a larger, unexpected force at play, stemming directly from ChatGPT hallucination . Unveiling the AI Misinformation : What ChatGPT Got Wrong The uploaded images weren’t traditional sheet music; instead, they were filled with words and a distinctive array of symbols known as ASCII tablature. This is a text-based system primarily used for guitar notations, easily typed on a standard keyboard without specialized musical characters. While these uploads weren’t financially burdensome for Soundslice in terms of storage or bandwidth, they were creating a significant number of error logs, baffling Holovaty. His scanning system was never designed to process such notation. The mystery deepened until Holovaty decided to investigate directly, interacting with ChatGPT himself. What he discovered was astounding: ChatGPT was confidently instructing users that they could transform these ASCII tab images into audible music simply by uploading them to their Soundslice accounts. The critical problem? Soundslice couldn’t actually do this. The AI was generating pervasive AI misinformation , leading new users to a false expectation and posing a significant reputational risk to the platform. This wasn’t just a minor bug; it was a direct challenge to user trust. A Forced Hand? Music App Development Driven by AI Faced with this peculiar predicament, Holovaty and his team at Soundslice weighed their options. Should they plaster disclaimers across their site, explicitly stating, “No, we can’t turn a ChatGPT session into hearable music”? Or, should they embrace the challenge and build the very feature that ChatGPT was falsely promising? The latter option was particularly intriguing, despite ASCII tablature being an “offbeat” notation system that Soundslice had never considered supporting. In a bold move that speaks volumes about adaptability in the digital age, Holovaty chose to build the feature. This decision exemplifies a unique form of music app development , where external AI-generated misinformation directly influences product roadmap. While pleased to offer a new, helpful tool to users, Holovaty openly expressed his conflicted feelings. “I feel like our hand was forced in a weird way. Should we really be developing features in response to misinformation?” he pondered. This raised a profound question: could this be the first documented instance of a company being compelled to develop a feature solely because an AI repeatedly hallucinated its existence to a broad audience? Beyond the Bug: AI Innovation and Unexpected Outcomes The story quickly resonated within the tech community, especially among programmers on Hacker News. Their perspective offered a surprisingly relatable analogy: they likened ChatGPT’s behavior to that of an overly enthusiastic human salesperson who promises clients the moon, thereby inadvertently forcing developers to deliver new, un-planned features. Holovaty found this comparison both apt and amusing, highlighting the curious parallels between human and artificial intelligence in a business context. This incident transcends a simple bug fix; it’s a testament to the unpredictable paths that AI innovation can carve. It forces businesses to consider not just the capabilities of AI, but also its potential for unintended consequences and how to adapt strategically. In an era where AI tools like ChatGPT are becoming ubiquitous, understanding and responding to their ‘hallucinations’ might become a critical skill for entrepreneurs and developers alike, shaping the very direction of product evolution. The Vision of Adrian Holovaty : Adapting to the AI Frontier At the heart of this compelling narrative is Adrian Holovaty , whose pragmatic approach transformed a challenge into an opportunity. His decision to integrate the ASCII tablature scanning feature, despite initial reservations, demonstrates remarkable foresight and agility. It underscores a crucial lesson for all businesses navigating the AI frontier: while AI offers immense potential for efficiency and creativity, it also introduces new complexities, including the need to manage AI-generated expectations. Holovaty’s experience with Soundslice serves as a pioneering case study, illustrating how companies might increasingly find themselves in a reactive, yet ultimately innovative, position due to AI’s evolving capabilities and occasional misfires. His commitment to his music career and to the Soundslice platform ensures that the app continues to evolve, adapting not just to user needs but also to the unpredictable influence of powerful AI tools. The Soundslice saga is a fascinating microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities presented by advanced AI. It highlights how a seemingly detrimental phenomenon like ChatGPT hallucination can, in an unexpected twist, become a catalyst for genuine AI innovation and drive crucial music app development . For Adrian Holovaty and Soundslice, it was a reputational risk turned into a unique feature, demonstrating unparalleled adaptability in the face of AI misinformation . As AI continues to integrate into every facet of our lives, stories like this serve as vital lessons for entrepreneurs and developers alike: prepare for the unexpected, and be ready to turn AI’s quirks into your next groundbreaking feature.

However, as the price nears the upper Bollinger Band and horizontal resistance at $112,400, early signs of exhaustion are surfacing. The question now is whether Bitcoin price today can secure a breakout above this resistance or if bulls will step back and allow a short-term correction. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin has surged out of a two-week ascending triangle, supported by a strong trendline from late June. The breakout above $110,000 was accompanied by a volume spike, pushing price into the $111,300–$111,600 region. BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, BTC is approaching the upper Bollinger Band at $112,377, with price currently facing rejection near this line. The EMA cluster (20/50/100/200) is fully stacked beneath price and showing healthy bullish alignment.

Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) rose over 23% intraday to hit $0.0177, its highest price since January 29. The latest move brings the token’s gains to over 125% since last month’s low and approximately 370% above its year-to-date bottom. The token’s rally has propelled it to become the top performer among the top 100 crypto assets by market capitalization, with PENGU now ranking as the 89th largest crypto asset. Its market cap has reclaimed the $1 billion milestone, underscoring a significant return of investor confidence. The recent surge was catalyzed by news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has formally acknowledged the filing for the proposed Canary spot PENGU ETF. The ETF would allocate 80–95% of its assets to PENGU tokens and 5–15% to Pudgy Penguins NFTs, combining exposure to both the token and the broader Pudgy Penguins IP ecosystem. An acknowledgment from the securities regulator is generally viewed as bullish because it marks the first formal step in the approval process. You might also like: BREAKING: Bitcoin price hits record high as ETF demand overwhelms bearish market setup Among other on-chain trends supporting a bullish narrative, large holders, or whales, have increased their PENGU holdings by 21% over the past month, now collectively controlling 2.18 billion tokens. This accumulation during recent price dips suggests growing long-term conviction among sophisticated investors. Source: Nansen Simultaneously, PENGU’s circulating supply on exchanges has declined notably, from 15.6 billion on June 12 to 14.3 billion as of this week. A reduction in exchange reserves is typically interpreted as bullish, as it indicates reduced selling pressure and a higher likelihood of tokens being held in cold storage or long-term wallets. Further reinforcing the bullish case, data from CoinGlass shows that PENGU’s weighted funding rate turned positive on derivatives exchanges for the first time since July 1. A positive funding rate indicates that long positions are paying shorts, typically reflecting a shift toward bullish market sentiment and increased demand for leverage on the long side. PENGU price forms a cup and handle pattern The daily chart for PENGU reveals a clear cup-and-handle pattern formation, a historically reliable bullish continuation setup. The token bottomed at $0.0037 in March before rebounding to a local high of $0.0175 in May, creating a rounded base followed by a brief consolidation phase, the “handle” portion of the pattern. PENGU 1-day price chart — July 10 | Source: crypto.news The cup-and-handle formation is defined by two distinct price swings, an initial drop and recovery forming the “cup,” followed by a smaller, shallower pullback that shapes the “handle.” It has since broken above the neckline resistance of this structure, which usually signals the start of a potential breakout. The vertical distance between the cup’s upper resistance and the March low measures approximately 79%. Applying this projected move from the breakout point suggests a potential upside target near $0.0318. This would represent a gain of around 75% from the current price level. However, this bullish forecast would be invalidated if the token drops below the support level at $0.0142. At press time, PENGU remains significantly below its December 2024 high of $0.06845, leaving substantial room for upside if bullish momentum continues.

Key Takeaways: A Chinese FTX creditor is challenging a plan that could block payouts in 49 jurisdictions. Ji, representing over 300 creditors, claims $15 million across four verified FTX accounts. He argues China should not be restricted, citing legal property status and Hong Kong access. In a filing submitted to the Delaware Bankruptcy Court , Weiwei Ji objected to the plan on behalf of over 300 Chinese creditors. Ji, a tax resident of Singapore, said FTX classified him as a Chinese creditor due to his passport, despite his residency. FTX Creditor Claims $15M Across Four KYC-Verified Accounts He stated that his family holds four Know Your Customer (KYC)-verified FTX accounts with combined claims exceeding $15 million. “We have fully complied with every procedural requirement under the plan. The proposed motion now jeopardizes our right to distribution in an arbitrary and inequitable manner,” Ji wrote. The objection follows a motion filed by the FTX Recovery Trust seeking to evaluate claims across 49 jurisdictions flagged as “potentially restricted.” These include China, Russia, and Pakistan. The proposal involves engaging local legal experts to determine whether compliant distributions are possible. If not, the jurisdiction could be designated as restricted, and FTX could then reallocate those claims back to the trust. Claims from the 49 jurisdictions total roughly $800 million, with China accounting for the vast majority, 82%, according to figures cited by The Block. FTX Claim Distribution Restricted Jurisdictions: $470m Chinese are the largest holder of FTX claims: $380m (82% of restricted) KYC not completed- Bahamas: $290m Disputed -multiple claims: $660m Total – awaiting solution: $1.4bn Total Estimated Allowed claims: $11bn pic.twitter.com/3BKpIkA3PW — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) July 7, 2025 Ji argued that the inclusion of China as a restricted jurisdiction “is unsupported by either fact or law.” He pointed to existing distribution mechanisms, including Hong Kong-based accounts, and referenced the Celsius Network case as precedent. He further noted that while mainland China bans crypto trading, digital assets are still considered legal property, and Hong Kong’s regulatory stance has become increasingly open to crypto. “Distributing claims to Chinese creditors poses no legal risk to the Trustee or its agents and constitutes a required step under the bankruptcy process,” Ji stated, urging the court to reject the motion’s proposed restrictions. Sam Bankman-Fried’s Release Date Set for 2044 FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now projected to be released from federal prison on December 14, 2044 , after serving less than 21 years of his 25-year sentence for fraud tied to the FTX collapse. He was also fined over $11 billion. Federal records confirm that Bankman-Fried has been moved from New York to a transfer facility in Oklahoma following nearly two years behind bars. The move comes after Bankman-Fried was reportedly placed in solitary confinement earlier this month for giving an unauthorized interview to Tucker Carlson. His incarceration began in August 2023, after Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his bail due to allegations of witness tampering involving leaked diary entries from former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, who was a key witness in the case.

The familiar reign of Software as a Service (SaaS) is being challenged, with a bold vision emerging where AI agents become the central operating force, fundamentally altering how businesses and individuals interact with technology. The Revolutionary Shift to AI Agents Dave Park, co-founder and CEO of Narada AI, states, “SaaS is going away.” This isn’t just a provocative statement; it’s a declaration of a fundamental shift in how we conceive and utilize digital tools. Park, speaking on Bitcoin World’s flagship podcast, Equity, envisions a future where the traditional reliance on numerous SaaS applications becomes obsolete. He highlights a critical inefficiency: “The typical knowledge worker today deals with anywhere from 17 to 25 different SaaS tools and portals every day, wasting two and a half hours just manually looking up or updating these systems.” The solution, according to Park, lies in a simplified ecosystem: “We believe in a future where it’ll just be the data, the databases, and AI agents or agentic models that take your request and operate across those silos to get the job done.” This isn’t merely an incremental upgrade; it’s a complete re-imagining of the digital workspace, driven by intelligent automation that understands intent and executes complex tasks autonomously. Understanding Agentic AI: Beyond Traditional Automation What exactly is agentic AI , and how does it differ from the automation we’ve grown accustomed to? Traditional automation typically involves scripting predefined rules or workflows. If a condition is met, a specific action is triggered. Agentic AI, however, goes much further. It involves intelligent software entities that can reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks across various systems, even when explicit APIs or integrations are missing. They learn and adapt, much like a human assistant would. Narada AI, emerging from UC Berkeley research, has developed what they call “large action models” (LAMs). These are a powerful evolution of large language models (LLMs), designed not just to understand and generate text, but to reason through and complete complex, multi-step tasks across different work tools. The key differentiator is their ability to operate effectively even when direct API connections aren’t available, navigating systems in a more human-like, adaptive manner. To better illustrate the distinction, consider the following comparison: Feature Traditional Automation Agentic AI (e.g., Narada AI) Task Execution Pre-defined, rule-based, rigid workflows. Reasoning, dynamic, adaptive to new situations and goals. Integration Relies heavily on robust APIs; breaks if APIs change. Operates across silos even with missing APIs; learns to navigate interfaces. Problem Solving Limited to known scenarios and explicit instructions. Handles novel, multi-step, complex problems; infers intent. Learning & Adaptation Minimal to none; requires manual updates or re-scripting. Continuously learns and improves from interactions and feedback. User Interaction Requires users to manage multiple interfaces and trigger workflows. Operates autonomously based on high-level requests; user provides goals. The End of SaaS as We Know It? The vision presented by Narada AI suggests a future where the concept of “using” individual apps might become outdated. Instead of opening a CRM, then an email client, then a project management tool, an AI agent could simply receive a high-level request – for example, “Follow up with all leads from last week’s conference who opened the introductory email but haven’t replied, and schedule a call.” The agent would then autonomously navigate across your CRM, email platform, and calendar, executing the necessary steps without direct human intervention across each application. This shift has profound implications for enterprise software . Companies might move away from licensing dozens of distinct SaaS products, instead focusing on robust data infrastructure that AI agents can access and orchestrate. The value proposition shifts from features within an app to the seamless flow of information and execution of tasks across an entire digital ecosystem. Narada AI’s Vision: Powering the Future of Productivity Narada AI is not just talking about this future; they are building it. Their debut at Bitcoin World Disrupt 2024 showcased their large action models, demonstrating a tangible path to overcoming the inefficiencies of current enterprise environments. By enabling agents to reason and act across disparate systems, even those lacking modern APIs, Narada AI directly addresses the “two and a half hours wasted” problem Park identified. While the initial focus might be on large enterprises, the benefits are expected to cascade. Park believes that tools like Narada could eventually empower solopreneurs and smaller teams, leveling the playing field by providing sophisticated automation capabilities previously exclusive to large organizations with dedicated IT departments. Imagine a small business owner able to manage sales, marketing, and customer service with a single intelligent assistant, rather than juggling a dozen subscriptions. Navigating the Agentic AI Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities The timing for this conversation is crucial. Y Combinator’s most recent batch included over 70 agentic startups, signaling a strong belief in this emerging sector. Major players like Grammarly are also investing heavily, building comprehensive AI work stacks through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. This indicates a broad industry recognition of the potential of agentic AI . However, the transition won’t be without its challenges. There are common misunderstandings about automation and the hype surrounding AI. Enterprises need to prepare their data infrastructure, ensure data quality, and establish robust security protocols to safely deploy AI agents at scale. Trust and transparency will be paramount as these agents gain more autonomy. For businesses looking to embrace this future, key actionable insights include: Assess Your Data Landscape: Understand where your data resides and how accessible it is. Clean, well-organized data is the fuel for effective AI agents. Start Small, Think Big: Begin with pilot projects in specific, high-value areas to understand the impact and refine deployment strategies. Invest in AI Literacy: Educate your workforce on the capabilities and limitations of agentic AI, fostering a culture of collaboration with these new digital assistants. Prioritize Security and Governance: As agents gain access to sensitive information and critical systems, robust security frameworks and clear governance policies are essential. The move from SaaS to AI agents represents more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a philosophical shift in how we approach productivity and digital interaction. It promises a future where technology adapts to us, rather than us adapting to technology, freeing up valuable human time for creativity, strategy, and complex problem-solving that only humans can perform.

According to data from Lookonchain, wallet address 0xCB92 opened a 50,000 ETH short position on Hyperliquid, which at one point showed an unrealized profit of over $26 million. But rather than closing the transaction, the trader held on — even adding another 10,000 ETH to the short position even as the price rose. A short position is, in effect, a bet the price will fall . If it rises, the trader loses out. The decision turned out to be costly. As ETH surged, the position was stopped out, and Lookonchain reported the trader realized a loss of $716,000 as of Thursday. The position might have been a hedge against a long position as part of a broader strategy, though the tracked wallet held only a short position. The moves are reminiscent of infamous trader ‘James Wynn,’ whose on-chain antics drew eyes to Hyperliquid among mainstream circles. In May, Wynn built a record-setting $1.25 billion notional long position in bitcoin (BTC) at an average price of $108,243, only to see it collapse as the fell below $105,000 after U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on EU exports . Multiple liquidations, including a 527 BTC position worth over $55 million and a 421 BTC position worth nearly $44 million, wiped out more than $100 million of Wynn’s holdings over a few days, leaving many wondering if they were witnessing a full-blown gambling addiction. Wynn has since not opened any trades similar to his May one.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-traded-funds-etfs-cross-a-critical-threshold-as-institutional-demand-rises-here-are-the-details/,"US-traded spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached a historic milestone on Wednesday, surpassing $50 billion in total net inflows. This achievement is being considered a critical step in Bitcoin's institutionalization process. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Surpass $50 Billion Net Inflow Threshold on Surge of Institutional Demand According to data provider SoSoValue, 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total of $218 million in net inflows on Wednesday, bringing the total net inflow to $50.16 billion. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong momentum in April, May and June, with billions of dollars in uninterrupted capital inflows. BlackRock's IBIT product saw the most inflows of the day, with $125.5 million. Ark & 21Shares' ARKB fund saw net inflows of $56.96 million, while Grayscale's Mini Bitcoin Trust saw net inflows of $15.8 million. Other major providers such as Fidelity, Bitwise, Valkyrie, and Invesco also reported positive inflows. BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas commented on this milestone with these words: “Spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassing $50 billion is a defining moment in the institutionalization of Bitcoin. This is not a retail investor frenzy; this is a steady flow of capital from asset managers, corporate treasuries, and wealth management platforms.” According to Lucas, demand for Bitcoin is rising due to both geopolitical tensions and former President Donald Trump's promises of aggressive interest rate cuts. Bitcoin's stable supply and global liquidity make it a prominent asset during this period. However, the real disruptor is the ETF format. “These ETF products are regulated and transparent, making them easily accessible to investors through stock and bond infrastructures. They make participation easy.” On the same day, Bitcoin broke new all-time highs, reaching $112,152. The leading cryptocurrency, which was trading at $110,990 at press time, has gained 2% in the last 24 hours. Spot Ethereum ETFs are also continuing their upward trend. Ether ETFs saw net inflows of $211.32 million on Wednesday, bringing their total net inflows to $4.72 billion so far. *This is not investment advice.

Held on June 26-27, 2025 at the Hilton Istanbul Bomonti Hotel, the two-day event brought together thousands of global Web3 leaders for high-level discussions, major announcements, and networking – cementing Türkiye’s rising role in the future of blockchain innovation. From keynote sessions and panel discussions to roundtables and workshops, this year’s edition was packed with proactive engagement and meaningful dialogue on topics such as stablecoins, real world assets, exchanges, investments, AI Agents, gaming, regulations, and more. Key speakers included Mehmet Çamır, Chairman at OKX TR, Justin Sun, CEO of Tron, Daniele Sestagalli, CEO of HeyAnon and WAGMI, Onur Güven, CEO of Garanti BBVA Digital Assets, John Linden, CEO of Mythical Games, Aaron Teng, CEO of Igloo Asia (Pudgy Penguins), Marco Dal Lago, VP of Global Expansion at Tether, among others.

There are some really strong companies coming up here. We have a new FIFA game and the Turkish market is quite strong for that too. There are mobile game fans, and a few football fans out here. So it is a green market. “At Istanbul Blockchain Week, the energy is high. It is packed. It is really well done. The stage is gorgeous. We are very happy to be part of it.” Kostas Chalkias, Co-founder and Chief Cryptographer at Mysten Labs showcased new use cases such as misinformation detection, AI-powered smart contract auditing, and blockchain-verified identity systems, that are at the intersection of AI and blockchain. Daniele Sestagalli, CEO of HeyAnon and WAGMI, presented how HeyAnon – an AI agent for DeFi automation disrupts the traditional ways in which people interact with decentralised ecosystems, empowering users to execute complex DeFi strategies. Daniele elaborated on HUD, an AI-powered trading assistant that is designed to deliver real-time wallet behavior insights, automated technical analysis, entry and exit strategies based on user context.

A little-known DeFi token called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gaining serious momentum ahead of altcoin summer and Solana (SOL). The 5th round of Mutuum Finance presale has already sold out over 60%. The amount raised so far is over the $12 million barrier with over 13,000 owners. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) continues to show strength as a layer-1 staple, but if you’re looking for top tokens with massive upside, this under-the-radar Mutuum Finance could be your golden ticket. Solana (SOL) Sees Renewed Momentum as On-Chain Activity Surges Solana (SOL) has been ruling this stump at the intervals of $151.69 as it carries on being the leader of activity blockchain wise. Solana also recorded more than $23 million active addresses in the final week of June as compared to the likes of BNB Chain among its competitors. Its TVL has increased significantly as well by almost doubling since the beginning of the year, which was around $6 billion, to over $8.6 billion now due to increased DeFi, meme coins and games usage. The interest of institutions is heating up as well with the launch of U.S based SOL staking ETFs and active buying of SOL by companies like DeFi Development Corp who recently purchased an additional $2.7 million in SOL to their portfolio. Analysts are looking at the possibility of moving towards the $200 level in the instance that the current market structure is maintained. Meanwhile investors are relocating focus to the next potential genuine breakout of this cycle: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Surges Past $12M in Presale Round More than $12 million has been raised and over 13,000 investors have invested early in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This shows investor confidence in the project during its early stages is increasing. MUTM is priced at $0.03, minimum price before a 17% spike in phase 6. CertiK-Audited with a $50,000 Bug Bounty for Maximum Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar (USD) on the Ethereum network. Besides, the project is audited by CertiK blockchain security company. This type of audit provides evidence of the readiness of the platform to become reliable and be institutional-graded transparent. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. The bounty will be rewarded on the basis of four levels of severity: critical, major, minor and low. Two-Tier Lending System Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a double-sided lending platform that will serve active as well as passive users of DeFi. Users will receive passive income from lending their USDT through stable passive income-generating smart contract pools providing stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system. Additionally, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model permits lenders and borrowers to be as active as they like when it comes to swapping a term of an exchange and does not require a third party for the same. The trend is more prevalent among customers of less secure assets. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance values its new investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will give 10 lucky winners $10,000 MUTM as a gesture of gratitude for the investors’ initial trust in the project. Solana (SOL) remains strong with rising TVL and institutional interest, but it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s catching fire. With $12M+ raised, 13,000+ holders, and a CertiK audit, MUTM’s dual lending model and upcoming 17% price hike make it one of the hottest altcoins of 2025.

Just as the blockchain community values transparency and authenticity, major platforms like YouTube are now taking decisive steps to ensure the content viewers consume is genuine and adds real value. This move comes as AI Content generation becomes increasingly sophisticated, raising concerns about the proliferation of low-quality, mass-produced media. Understanding the New YouTube Policy Update On July 15, YouTube is set to implement significant updates to its YouTube Partner Program (YPP) Monetization policies. While YouTube describes this as a ‘minor update,’ the implications for creators and the broader digital landscape are substantial. The core of the change revolves around tightening guidelines on what constitutes ‘inauthentic’ and ‘repetitive’ content—material that has become remarkably easier to churn out with the aid of artificial intelligence. Clarity on ‘Inauthentic’ Content: The updated YouTube Policy aims to provide clearer definitions of content that cannot be monetized. While specific language is pending, it reinforces YouTube’s longstanding requirement for ‘original’ and ‘authentic’ uploads. Targeting Mass Production: The primary focus is on content that is mass-produced, repetitive, or lacks significant editorial value, often referred to as ‘spam’ by viewers. Not Against All Repurposed Content: Importantly, YouTube has clarified that this update is not intended to penalize legitimate uses of repurposed content, such as well-edited reaction videos or critical commentary that adds substantial value. The concern is specifically about content that is auto-generated or stitched together without genuine human insight or effort. The Alarming Rise of AI Content and ‘AI Slop’ The term ‘ AI Slop ‘ has entered the digital lexicon to describe the deluge of low-quality, often nonsensical media created using generative AI tools. This phenomenon poses a direct threat to the quality and trustworthiness of online platforms. The ease with which AI can now generate voices, images, and even full video narratives has led to an explosion of such content, designed primarily to capture views without offering genuine engagement or information. Consider these compelling examples of AI slop that have already permeated the platform: Automated Voice-Overs: Channels frequently overlay AI-generated voices onto static images, repurposed video clips, or unoriginal text, creating ‘content’ with minimal human input. AI-Generated Music: Entire channels dedicated to AI-composed music have amassed millions of subscribers, blurring the lines between human creativity and algorithmic generation. Fake News and Deepfakes: AI-generated videos purporting to be news about high-profile events, such as the Diddy trial, have garnered millions of views, sowing disinformation. Similarly, AI-generated phishing scams have even used the likeness of YouTube’s CEO, Neal Mohan, highlighting the serious security and ethical challenges. Automated Series: A viral true crime series was exposed as entirely AI-generated, demonstrating the advanced capabilities of these tools to mimic human storytelling without genuine human effort. While these tools offer immense potential, their misuse for rapid, low-effort content creation undermines the platform’s integrity and devalues the work of genuine creators. Protecting Creator Monetization and Platform Integrity For many, YouTube is not just a platform for sharing videos; it’s a livelihood. The Creator Monetization ecosystem relies on fair play and the reward of original, engaging content. When AI slop floods the platform, it directly impacts the discoverability and earning potential of authentic creators. This policy update is YouTube’s strategic move to protect its ecosystem. Why is this crackdown essential for monetization? Fair Competition: It levels the playing field, ensuring that creators who invest time, effort, and creativity are not overshadowed by automated content farms. Advertiser Trust: Brands are increasingly wary of associating their ads with low-quality or potentially misleading content. By cleaning up the platform, YouTube maintains advertiser confidence, which is vital for its revenue model and, by extension, creator earnings. Viewer Experience: A platform inundated with spammy content quickly loses its audience. By prioritizing quality, YouTube ensures a better viewing experience, encouraging continued engagement and growth for legitimate channels. Championing Digital Authenticity in a Changing Landscape The push for Digital Authenticity extends beyond just YouTube. It reflects a growing industry-wide concern about the impact of generative AI on information integrity and trust. Platforms are grappling with the ethical implications of AI-generated content, especially when it is designed to deceive or merely exist as digital noise. YouTube’s clear stance signals a commitment to maintaining its reputation as a hub for valuable, human-created content. While some might downplay these changes as ‘minor,’ the reality is that unchecked growth of AI slop could severely damage YouTube’s brand and long-term value. This proactive measure allows the company to implement mass bans of creators who exploit AI for inauthentic monetization, safeguarding the platform’s future. The Ongoing Battle Against AI Slop: A Call to Action for Creators The fight against AI Slop is an ongoing one, requiring vigilance from platforms and a commitment to quality from creators. For those aspiring to build a sustainable presence on YouTube, understanding and adhering to these updated policies is paramount. Here are some actionable insights for creators: Focus on Originality: Prioritize creating content that showcases your unique perspective, skills, or insights. Even if you use AI tools, ensure they enhance, rather than replace, your creative input. Add Unique Value: Ask yourself: Does this content offer a new angle, deeper analysis, unique entertainment, or genuine human connection? If not, it might fall under the ‘repetitive’ category. Understand Policy Nuances: Stay informed about YouTube’s guidelines. What might seem like a small tweak can have significant implications for monetization. Engage Authentically: Build a community around genuine interaction, not just views. This fosters loyalty and differentiates your channel from automated content. This policy update is a necessary step in the evolution of online content. It reinforces the idea that true value lies in human creativity, authenticity, and the effort put into crafting meaningful experiences. As AI technology continues to advance, the distinction between genuine content and automated ‘slop’ will become increasingly important for both platforms and audiences.

On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA ) announced a new trial to explore how digital money could improve Australia’s wholesale tokenised asset markets. Project Acacia is a joint effort between the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC). It is also backed by ASIC, APRA, and the Australian Treasury. Project Acacia Enters Next Phase As part of the project, the RBA will test stablecoins, digital bank deposits, and a trial version of CBDCs. The project started last November with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, and it aims to explore how new technology can make finance faster, safer, and more efficient. Project Acacia is entering its next phase with 24 use cases selected from a mix of participants, including fintech startups and major banks. Of these, 19 will involve real money and asset transactions, while 5 will be proof-of-concept trials using simulated transactions. Brad Jones, Assistant Governor (Financial System) at the RBA, said- “The use cases selected in this project will help us to better understand how innovations in central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, might help to uplift the functioning of wholesale financial markets in Australia.” Trials to Run on Multiple Blockchain Platforms The use cases cover various asset types, including bonds, private markets, trade receivables, and carbon credits. They will explore the use of stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, a pilot wholesale CBDC, and new ways of using banks’ existing exchange settlement accounts at the RBA.

ASIC Offers Regulatory Relief ASIC is also making it easier for companies to join Project Acacia by offering regulatory relief. Similar support was given in earlier RBA digital money projects. CBA is partnering with the RBA and DFCRC in Project Acacia to explore how digital assets can improve efficiency, liquidity, and reduce risk in Australia’s $350 billion repo market. Alongside J.P. Morgan, ASX, HQLAX, and Deutsche Börse Group, the project will test the use of digital currencies and tokenized collateral. The repo market is a critical and growing component of the Australian financial system. “The repo market, with its critical role in liquidity management and monetary policy implementation, represents an ideal starting point for this exploration,” said Sophie Gilder, CBA’s managing director of blockchain and digital assets. What’s Next for Project Acacia? Testing will run over the next six months. A final report is expected in Q1 2026 and will help shape the RBA’s thinking on how digital finance can support Australia’s economy. Australia’s major banks – the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and Westpac Banking Corporation are taking part in the Project Acacia pilot. The Global Shift Notably, several countries are testing or exploring CBDCs. The Bank of Japan is stepping up its work on a digital yen. It began testing a pilot programme for CBDC in 2023 and is now working with private companies and the government on its design. President Trump recently banned the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar, backing cryptocurrencies instead. The European Central Bank (ECB) is also pushing for a digital euro to reduce reliance on U.S. payment providers and keep up in the global shift to digital money.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 07:31:06

Enthusiasts remain confident in its long-term potential, with some pointing to its underlying technology and expanding use cases in cross-border payments. However, short-term signals are pointing to caution, according to crypto analyst Levi Rietveld. Rietveld, speaking in a video shared on X, acknowledged the enthusiasm surrounding XRP but offered a more tempered analysis of the current price movement. While he believes the digital asset can do amazing things, he emphasized the importance of understanding the short-term technical picture and broader economic landscape. Overbought Territory and Historical Patterns XRP has been trading in what Rietveld describes as “very clearly… overbought for an extended period of time” on the daily charts. In his view, this is a significant red flag, as previous instances of similar technical setups were followed by swift corrections. Technical indicators such as the FBB on the 15-minute chart show XRP very close to resistance levels. While breaking above resistance levels traditionally leads to price surges , Rietveld notes that historically, when XRP approaches or breaks above this particular FBB resistance line, it is often followed by substantial corrections. XRP Bull Run Prediction! #XRP pic.twitter.com/dwntVMFGh4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 8, 2025 Macroeconomic Headwinds Remain Beyond the charts, the broader environment also plays a critical role in Rietveld’s analysis. He cautions that conditions such as geopolitical instability, Federal Reserve policy , and interest rates do not currently support a surge in market liquidity. According to him, the backdrop is not aligned for a major upward move in assets like XRP. “These things are not really aligning with the fact that we could have a huge swarm of liquidity coming in,” he said, pointing to the low probability of strong, sustained inflows under current conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Whales and Market Psychology Another point of concern is the possibility of manipulation in the current market structure. Whales have been making record-breaking moves , and Rietveld believes they may be using the recent momentum to bait retail traders into long positions, only to liquidate them during a sudden reversal. XRP is currently trading at $2.32, up over 6% from last week, but he believes this positive momentum won’t last. “This to me looks like a very short-term move,” he explained, warning that this setup could trap less experienced participants in unfavorable positions. While some experts expect a major breakout soon , Rietveld is not convinced. He anticipates major moves for the asset in the future, but is not confident that it can sustain this momentum in the short term.

Max Luck, the Head of Ecosystem at Flare, had the following to say about the merger: “We’re thrilled to bring TrustSwap and Team Finance into the Flare ecosystem. By partnering with a trusted platform that has successfully supported over 100 public launches and raised more than $100 million, we’re giving builders and users on Flare access to one of the most reputable token launch infrastructures in Web3.” The Flare blockchain is a full-stack Layer-1 (L1) solution designed for data-intensive use cases. It is currently the only EVM-compatible chain optimized for creating intelligent decentralized applications (DApps) that integrate DeFi, AI, and traditional finance (TradFi). The network is supported by two protocols: the State Connector, which enables the use of external blockchain data, and the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO), which serves as a source of reliable off-chain data for use on the network. TrustSwap is a launchpad that provides DeFi tools for token holders and businesses to buy, trade, create, and secure crypto assets with confidence, boasting the aforementioned track record. At the time of printing, over 30,000 projects are currently utilizing the protocol, and it is now live on the Flare blockchain. Team Finance is the launch platform’s token management suite, already embedded into SparkDEX, providing a stable backend for tokens on Flare. They also offer self-service minting of tokens, liquidity/token locks, vesting schedules, and multisending for token distribution. The three-company conglomerate will also receive support from The Crypto App, a known portfolio tracker and news hub for Web3. Alongside it, liquidity will be provided by the Amplifi Fund, with automated management to support DEX trading volume for future token launches.

Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data.

According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,108.65 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325.

For those deeply invested in the future of decentralized systems and cutting-edge tech, the news of OpenAI reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks signals a significant shift. This isn’t just another web browser; it’s a bold move by the creators of ChatGPT to redefine our entire web browsing experience, potentially challenging established giants and opening new avenues for user interaction and data handling. What is an AI Browser and Why is OpenAI Leading the Charge? The concept of an AI browser goes beyond simple search functionality or content rendering. Unlike traditional browsers that merely display information, an AI-powered browser aims to understand, summarize, and even interact with web content on your behalf. Imagine a browser that doesn’t just show you links but actively processes information, answers questions directly, and anticipates your needs without requiring you to navigate through multiple pages. This is the promise of the new wave of AI browsers, and OpenAI, with its formidable advancements in conversational AI, is uniquely positioned to lead this charge. The timing of this rumored launch is particularly interesting, coming hot on the heels of Perplexity’s Comet launch and alongside other innovative projects like The Browser Company’s Dia. These initiatives collectively point towards a paradigm shift where the browser becomes less of a window to the internet and more of an intelligent agent assisting your online journey. OpenAI’s move into this space is a natural extension of its mission to make AI more accessible and integrated into daily life, transforming the very interface through which we access information. OpenAI’s Vision: Redefining Your Digital Experience with ChatGPT Integration The core of OpenAI’s rumored AI browser lies in its ambition to fundamentally rethink how users browse the web. A key aspect reportedly involves keeping some user interactions directly within ChatGPT itself, rather than consistently linking out to external websites. This could mean a more seamless and integrated experience where answers and information are delivered conversationally, curated by AI, directly within the browser interface. Consider these potential aspects that could redefine your digital experience : Direct AI Summarization: Instead of opening multiple tabs to research a topic, the browser could provide concise summaries of web pages or even entire topics, generated by AI, saving significant time and effort. Integrated Question Answering: Users might be able to ask questions directly within the browser, and the AI would pull information from across the web to provide a direct answer, much like ChatGPT does, but with real-time web access. Personalized Content Curation: The browser could learn user preferences and proactively suggest relevant content, filter out noise, or highlight key information based on individual browsing habits and stated interests. Enhanced Productivity: Features like automated form filling, smart content extraction, and even AI-powered writing assistance could be integrated directly into the browsing flow, making online tasks more efficient. Furthermore, reports suggest that OpenAI’s browser may integrate ‘Operator,’ the company’s web-browsing AI agent, as a key feature. This could empower the browser with advanced capabilities to navigate complex websites, extract specific data, or perform multi-step tasks on behalf of the user, moving beyond passive information consumption to active web agency. Challenging the Giants: OpenAI vs. Google Chrome and the Battle for Data OpenAI’s foray into the browser market is a direct challenge to incumbents, most notably Google Chrome , which currently dominates the global browser landscape. This isn’t merely about market share; it’s about control over the primary gateway to the internet and, crucially, access to user data. For years, Google’s business model has relied heavily on intermediating user interactions with the web, primarily through search and advertising, fueled by vast amounts of user data. OpenAI, much like Perplexity, likely seeks to: Gain Direct Access to User Data: By controlling the browser, OpenAI can gather valuable insights into user behavior, preferences, and information consumption patterns. This data is critical for refining their AI models, understanding user needs, and developing more effective AI services. Foster Novel User Experiences: Being unencumbered by the legacy architecture and business models of traditional browsers, OpenAI has the freedom to innovate and create entirely new ways for users to interact with the web, experiences that aren’t intermediated or limited by Google’s ecosystem. Diversify Revenue Streams: A successful browser could provide OpenAI with a new platform for delivering its AI services, potentially leading to new revenue models beyond API access or direct subscriptions to models like ChatGPT. The competition will be fierce. Google has already begun integrating AI features into Chrome and its search products. However, OpenAI’s approach, focusing on a more integrated and conversational AI experience from the ground up, could offer a distinct advantage, appealing to users seeking a more intelligent and less fragmented online journey. The Broader Implications for Web Browsing and Digital Ownership The emergence of an AI browser from a company like OpenAI has far-reaching implications for the future of web browsing and the broader digital ecosystem. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, this development is particularly noteworthy. Consider the following: Data Ownership and Privacy: As AI browsers become more central to our online lives, questions around data privacy and ownership will intensify. Will OpenAI’s browser offer more transparent or user-controlled data practices compared to traditional models? This aligns with the decentralized ethos of Web3, where users have greater control over their digital identities and data. Impact on Content Creation: If AI browsers summarize and deliver information directly, what does this mean for websites and content creators who rely on traffic and ad revenue? This could push for new models of content monetization and discovery, potentially favoring high-quality, unique content that AI struggles to replicate or summarize perfectly. The Future of Search: The traditional search engine model could be disrupted. If an AI browser can answer complex queries directly, the need to navigate through pages of search results might diminish, leading to a more efficient, but potentially less diverse, information landscape. Accessibility and Inclusivity: An AI browser could make the internet more accessible for individuals with disabilities or those who struggle with traditional interfaces, by simplifying navigation and content consumption through AI-powered assistance. The shift towards AI-powered browsing represents a fundamental re-evaluation of the internet’s architecture. It moves from a pull-based system, where users actively seek information, to a push-based system, where information is intelligently delivered. This evolution will undoubtedly spur innovation across various sectors, including those building the decentralized web. Potential Benefits and Challenges of OpenAI’s AI Browser While the prospect of an AI browser from OpenAI is exciting, it comes with both significant advantages and potential hurdles. Key Benefits: Enhanced Efficiency: Save time by getting direct answers and summaries without extensive browsing. Personalized Experience: A browser that truly understands your needs and preferences. Streamlined Interactions: Reduced need to switch between applications or tabs for information. Innovation Driver: Pushes the entire browser industry to innovate and improve user experiences. New Digital Interfaces: Potential for entirely new ways to interact with online content and services. Potential Challenges: Data Privacy Concerns: Centralized control over browsing data by a single AI company. Information Bias: The AI’s summarization and curation could introduce biases or limit exposure to diverse viewpoints. Adoption Hurdles: Convincing users to switch from deeply entrenched browsers like Google Chrome. Monetization Models: How will content creators be compensated if traffic is reduced by AI summarization? Technical Complexity: Ensuring reliability, speed, and security for an AI-powered browsing experience. The Dawn of a New Digital Experience OpenAI’s reported entry into the browser market with an AI browser marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the internet. It signifies a future where our online interactions are no longer passive but actively intelligent, personalized, and deeply integrated with advanced AI capabilities. This move by OpenAI is not just about launching a new product; it’s about setting a new standard for the digital experience , challenging the status quo, and pushing the boundaries of what a browser can be. As we anticipate its release, the tech world watches to see how this revolutionary step will reshape our daily engagement with the vast expanse of the world wide web.

The suspension, announced on July 7, has halted all crypto trading and related services for users in the country. Following the freeze of crypto accounts and investments, Hungarian Revolut users were unable to conduct any cryptocurrency transactions. The abrupt move led to a surge in customer inquiries. On July 9, Revolut issued an official update, confirming the suspension and addressing concerns from affected users. The company said that it is closely monitoring the situation and will provide further guidance as legal and regulatory developments unfold. Revolut Response on Frozen Crypto Accounts in Hungary Revolut stated that due to changes in European Union ( EU) regulation , the company has temporarily paused signing up new crypto customers in some countries. The company is aligning its standards with the Market in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) standards under EU regulations, which is currently in progress. While Revolut has paused new sign-ups to manage regulatory risks and align with local requirements during this transition, existing crypto service providers must meet new licensing and compliance standards. When Will Revolut Continue its Services? Any existing account in Revolut will not be affected by this change, as its users can continue using their usual accounts. All the money and crypto assets saved in existing accounts will remain safe and secure, as promised by Revolut. However, for new crypto accounts, Revolut has not mentioned any specific date. It stated– “We plan to take on new crypto customers as soon as we receive our MiCA licence. Although we can’t give an exact date yet, we’re working closely with regulators to complete the process as quickly as possible.” Revolut Progress in MiCA License To continue its operations with high regulatory expectations — Revolut’s EEA crypto asset provider and Revolut Digital Assets Europe Ltd (RDAEL), a company registered with the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) — are actively working to obtain a MiCA license. The company assures to notify the customers about regular updates and further information, if they receive any from MiCA. Final Thought When Revolut first notified the customers about frozen accounts and pausing new sign-ups, it created chaos in Hungary. Industry leaders predicted their own answers and resolutions for the situation.

Arkham Intelligence data shows that the government moved 213 BTC across multiple transactions, with the largest single transfer, worth $23.18 millio n , occurring just two hours before the market close. The latest sales bring Bhutan’s remaining Bitcoin holdings to 11,711 BTC worth $1.3 billion, maintaining its position as the sixth-largest government Bitcoin holder globally. Source: BitcoinTreasuries The timing coincides with Bitcoin’s breakthrough above previous resistance levels, suggesting strategic market analysis drives the nation’s trading decisions rather than random liquidation events. Bhutan has consistently demonstrated superior market timing compared to other sovereign Bitcoin holders, particularly in contrast with Germany’s costly liquidation strategy. The German government’s decision to sell 49,858 BTC at $53,000 per coin in July resulted in an estimated $2.015 billion opportunity loss , as those holdings would now be worth $4.57 billion at current prices. The Himalayan kingdom’s approach differs significantly from El Salvador’s buy-and-hold strategy, with President Nayib Bukele pledging never to sell Bitcoin reserves. El Salvador currently holds 6,233 BTC, worth approximately $693 million, while Bhutan maintains nearly double the holdings, despite periodically making strategic sales during favorable market conditions.

The country began mining Bitcoin in April 2019 when prices traded around $5,000, building reserves through energy-efficient operations that account for over 25% of the nation’s GDP. Druk Holdings and Investments, Bhutan’s sovereign investment arm, has mined 13,011 BTC since its inception, while also diversifying into Ethereum, BNB, and Polygon holdings. The investment vehicle oversees the country’s flagship airline, hydroelectric plants, and various industrial operations beyond cryptocurrency activities. Partnership with Singaporean mining giant Bitdeer expanded Bhutan’s capacity through a 600-megawatt facility in Gedu, positioning the nation among the world’s largest sustainable Bitcoin mining operations.

In this assessment, we look at two very exceptional properties—PEPE Coin, a meme-pushed token inspired by the internet way of life, and Ozak AI, a presale -stage project grounded in artificial intelligence and decentralized analytics. The debate in 2025 facilities around which of these tokens offers the more potent upside in both returns and relevance. PEPE Coin: Viral Momentum and Meme Appeal PEPE Coin has quickly come to be one of the most recognizable meme coins, riding the success of projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It thrives on the internet way of life, rapid-fire trading, and a community-first technique. Priced in fractions of a cent, PEPE keeps to draw speculative buyers hoping to copy past meme coin success memories. In preceding cycles, cash like PEPE noticed exponential gains in brief durations—largely because of viral tweets, influencer mentions, and short-term hype. However, the number one venture for PEPE in 2025 lies in its lack of a stable utility base. It stays in basic terms driven by using sentiment. While this can bring about speedy rallies, it often results in similarly sharp crashes. Its long-term boom capability depends heavily on whether the meme narrative can live applicable and whether or not the community can preserve momentum in an unexpectedly evolving crypto market. The coin may additionally hit higher short-term price goals like $0.00001, but sustaining those levels may be hard without real use cases. Ozak AI: Real-World Utility Meets AI Technology Ozak AI , on the other hand, represents a new breed of crypto projects that combine artificial intelligence with blockchain infrastructure. At its core, Ozak AI aims to disrupt data analytics in decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional sectors by offering real-time predictive tools, AI-powered agents, and secure data processing through decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). Still in Ozak AI presale phase at $0.005, the project has already gained attention for its forward-looking roadmap and focus on solving real-world problems. What sets Ozak AI apart is the fact that it isn’t built on hype—it’s built on innovation. With features like Ozak Stream Network for low-latency processing and customizable AI Forecast Agents, the platform positions itself as more than a token. It’s an ecosystem. If it can successfully transition from presale to mainstream adoption, its $1 target price represents a massive 200x upside. For investors seeking long-term value over short-term thrill, Ozak AI provides a compelling narrative. While PEPE Coin may continue to excite traders with short-term meme hype, its future remains tied to market sentiment. Ozak AI , in contrast, offers a structured path toward adoption and scalability. For those aiming to maximize gains in the next crypto cycle, the smarter bet may lie in AI-driven utility over viral unpredictability. In the battle between meme power and AI utility, Ozak AI may not just win—it could redefine what success looks like in 2025. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

If so, you’re not alone. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again captured headlines, this time with a pivotal decision regarding BlackRock’s ambitious proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF . This isn’t just another regulatory hiccup; it’s a moment that could significantly shape the future of institutional investment in digital assets. The financial world held its breath as news broke: the SEC has officially delayed its decision on BlackRock’s application to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA). This move, while not entirely unexpected given the SEC’s cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, introduces a fresh wave of uncertainty into a market eagerly awaiting clearer regulatory pathways. But what exactly does this delay signify, and why is the ‘in-kind’ mechanism so important? What Exactly is an Ethereum ETF , and Why Does “In-Kind” Matter So Much? Before diving deeper into the implications of the SEC’s latest move, let’s clarify what an Ethereum ETF is and why the specific ‘in-kind’ mechanism is a focal point of discussion. An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like a stock. A crypto ETF, like the proposed Ethereum ETF, would allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. This offers a regulated, accessible, and often more secure way for traditional investors to participate in the crypto market. Now, let’s talk about the ‘in-kind’ creation and redemption mechanism, which is at the heart of BlackRock’s proposal and the SEC’s current deliberation. This mechanism contrasts sharply with ‘cash’ creation and redemption: In-Kind Creation: Authorized Participants (APs) – typically large financial institutions – would deliver actual Ethereum to the ETF issuer in exchange for new ETF shares. This means they are trading the underlying asset directly for fund shares. In-Kind Redemption: Conversely, when APs want to redeem ETF shares, they would receive actual Ethereum from the fund’s reserves. Why is this important? The ‘in-kind’ model is generally preferred by ETF issuers and institutional investors because it can offer several benefits: Tax Efficiency: In-kind transfers typically do not trigger taxable events for the fund, potentially leading to better long-term performance for investors. Lower Costs: It can reduce transaction costs and operational complexities compared to cash models, as the fund doesn’t need to buy or sell the underlying asset with fiat currency. Reduced Market Impact: Direct transfers of crypto assets can potentially minimize market impact compared to large cash trades, especially in volatile markets. Conversely, a ‘cash’ creation/redemption model would involve APs exchanging cash for ETF shares, and vice-versa, with the ETF issuer then buying or selling the underlying Ethereum on the open market. The SEC has historically preferred cash-creation models for crypto ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection, as it keeps the fund’s direct interaction with the crypto markets limited. The SEC Delay : A Familiar Roadblock or a New Hurdle? The news of the SEC delay on BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a broader pattern of regulatory caution concerning cryptocurrency products. For years, the SEC has been hesitant to approve spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns ranging from market manipulation and liquidity issues to investor protection and the nascent nature of the digital asset market. Let’s look at the historical context: Product Type SEC Stance (Historically) Current Status (General) Bitcoin Futures ETF Approved relatively early (e.g., ProShares BITO in 2021) due to regulation of underlying futures market. Several approved and trading. Spot Bitcoin ETF Repeatedly rejected for years, citing market manipulation concerns and lack of surveillance sharing agreements. Approved in January 2024 after court rulings and significant pressure. Spot Ethereum ETF Under review; similar concerns as Bitcoin, plus debate over ETH’s classification (security vs. commodity). Currently facing delays, no approvals yet. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 set a precedent, largely due to a court mandate that the SEC re-evaluate its stance. Many in the industry hoped this would pave the way for a smoother approval process for Ethereum ETFs. However, the SEC’s current delay suggests they are taking a deliberate, cautious approach, possibly waiting for more clarity on Ethereum’s regulatory classification. Is Ethereum a commodity, like Bitcoin, or a security? This fundamental question continues to loom large over any ETF application. Furthermore, the SEC’s concerns often revolve around the underlying spot market’s susceptibility to manipulation, the adequacy of surveillance-sharing agreements with exchanges, and ensuring robust investor protection. While the crypto market has matured significantly, these concerns remain a primary hurdle for new product approvals. What Does This Mean for BlackRock Ethereum ‘s Ambitions? When a financial titan like BlackRock, with trillions of dollars under management, enters the crypto ETF arena, it sends ripples across both traditional finance and the digital asset space. BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin spot ETF market was a game-changer, lending immense credibility and institutional weight to the asset class. Their subsequent application for a spot BlackRock Ethereum ETF signaled a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential and its role in the evolving digital economy. For BlackRock, this delay is likely a strategic pause rather than a complete roadblock. They are known for their meticulous approach and deep understanding of regulatory landscapes. While the delay means their proposed ETHA product won’t launch as quickly as some hoped, BlackRock has the resources and expertise to navigate complex regulatory environments. Their persistence in pursuing both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs underscores their conviction that digital assets will become a significant part of mainstream investment portfolios. The impact on BlackRock’s immediate strategy might involve: Continued Engagement: BlackRock will likely continue discussions and provide additional information to the SEC to address any outstanding concerns. Patience and Adaptation: They are prepared for a lengthy process, having seen the protracted battle for Bitcoin spot ETF approvals. Market Signal: Despite the delay, BlackRock’s continued pursuit of an Ethereum ETF sends a powerful signal to other institutional players that Ethereum is a serious contender for broad investment adoption. This delay doesn’t diminish BlackRock’s long-term vision; instead, it highlights the inherent challenges of introducing innovative financial products into a highly regulated space. Understanding the Implications for the Spot Ethereum ETF Market The SEC’s decision to delay BlackRock’s application has broader implications for the entire Spot Ethereum ETF market. Several other prominent asset managers, including Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK 21Shares, also have spot Ethereum ETF applications pending with the SEC. The fate of BlackRock’s application often sets a precedent or indicates the SEC’s general sentiment towards similar proposals. Here’s how this delay impacts the wider spot Ethereum ETF landscape: Industry-Wide Uncertainty: The delay creates a cloud of uncertainty for all applicants. If BlackRock, with its vast resources and influence, faces a delay, it suggests that other applications will likely encounter similar scrutiny and timelines. Extended Timelines: Investors and issuers should now anticipate a longer wait for any spot Ethereum ETF approvals. Initial hopes for approvals by mid-2024 might be pushed further into the year or even into 2025. Market Reaction: While the market reaction to this specific delay has been relatively subdued compared to past regulatory news, prolonged uncertainty could temper investor enthusiasm for Ethereum in the short term. However, the long-term bullish case for institutional adoption remains intact. Focus on Regulatory Clarity: The delay underscores the critical need for clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Without definitive guidance on how digital assets are classified and regulated, the approval process for new financial products will remain arduous. Ultimately, the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF is seen as a significant catalyst for mainstream adoption, potentially unlocking billions in institutional capital. Each delay, while frustrating, is a step in a complex dance between innovation and regulation. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Opportunities of In-Kind Redemption The core of BlackRock’s proposal, and a key point of contention for the SEC, revolves around the in-kind redemption mechanism. While beneficial for tax efficiency and operational costs, it also presents unique challenges in the context of cryptocurrency regulation. Challenges of In-Kind Redemption: Custody and Security: Managing direct custody of large amounts of Ethereum for an ETF requires extremely robust security protocols. The SEC needs assurance that these digital assets are protected from hacks, theft, and loss. Valuation and Pricing: Ensuring accurate and fair valuation of Ethereum during in-kind creations and redemptions, especially given crypto market volatility, can be complex. Regulatory Oversight: The SEC’s primary concern is investor protection. They need to be confident that the in-kind mechanism doesn’t expose investors to undue risks, particularly concerning market manipulation or illicit activities on the underlying crypto exchanges. Compliance: Ensuring that all aspects of the in-kind process comply with existing securities laws and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations is a monumental task for both the issuer and the regulator. Opportunities Presented by In-Kind Redemption: Enhanced Market Efficiency: By allowing direct transfers of ETH, the in-kind model can facilitate more efficient arbitrage, helping to keep the ETF’s price closely aligned with its Net Asset Value (NAV). Broader Institutional Access: For institutions that are comfortable with direct crypto exposure but prefer the ETF wrapper for regulatory or operational reasons, the in-kind model offers a more direct link to the underlying asset. Tax Advantages for Investors: As mentioned, the tax efficiency of in-kind transfers can translate into better after-tax returns for investors, making the product more attractive. Legitimization of Crypto: An in-kind spot Ethereum ETF would represent a significant milestone in the legitimization of Ethereum as a mainstream asset class, paving the way for more sophisticated financial products. The SEC’s delay likely stems from a need to thoroughly vet these challenges and ensure that BlackRock’s proposed solutions meet their stringent requirements for investor protection and market integrity. The dialogue between the regulator and the applicant will be crucial in addressing these concerns. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Ethereum ETFs? The immediate future for spot Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock’s ETHA, now involves a waiting game. The SEC typically has several deadlines for these applications, allowing for extensions and public comment periods. While a delay can be frustrating, it’s a standard part of the regulatory review process, especially for novel financial products. Key factors that could influence the eventual decision include: Clarity on Ethereum’s Classification: A definitive statement from the SEC or other U.S. regulators on whether Ethereum is classified as a commodity or a security would significantly impact the approval process. Political and Legal Pressure: Similar to the Bitcoin spot ETFs, potential political pressure or further legal challenges could influence the SEC’s timeline and ultimate decision. Market Maturity: The continued growth and increasing sophistication of the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market might eventually ease some of the SEC’s concerns. Industry Dialogue: Ongoing engagement between ETF applicants, crypto exchanges, and the SEC to address surveillance sharing and market manipulation concerns will be vital. While an approval might not happen in the immediate future, the fact that major players like BlackRock are relentlessly pursuing these products indicates a strong belief in their eventual success. The trajectory points towards eventual approval, but the path is undoubtedly winding. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors keenly following the development of Ethereum ETFs, the SEC’s delay offers a moment for reflection and strategic planning: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official SEC announcements and reputable financial news sources. Regulatory updates can significantly impact market sentiment. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional adoption of crypto is a long game. While short-term delays can cause fluctuations, the underlying trend of traditional finance embracing digital assets remains strong. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. The crypto market is inherently volatile. A diversified portfolio, considering both direct crypto holdings and traditional investments, is often a wise approach. Understand the Risks: Even with an ETF, investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks. Do your own research (DYOR) and understand the technology, market dynamics, and regulatory landscape. Consider Alternatives (for now): If you’re eager for Ethereum exposure through a regulated product, consider existing Ethereum futures ETFs or regulated crypto trusts (if available in your jurisdiction) while awaiting spot ETF approvals. Conclusion: A Steely Resolve in the Face of Regulatory Winds The SEC’s decision to delay BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF application, particularly concerning its in-kind creation and redemption mechanism, is a significant moment in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation. It underscores the U.S. regulator’s cautious, deliberate approach to integrating digital assets into mainstream financial products. While frustrating for those eager for immediate institutional adoption, this delay is a testament to the rigorous scrutiny required for products of this magnitude. BlackRock’s unwavering pursuit, alongside other major asset managers, signals a profound long-term commitment to Ethereum and the broader crypto market. The challenges of regulatory clarity, market integrity, and investor protection are formidable, but the opportunities for unlocking vast institutional capital and legitimizing digital assets are equally immense. As the financial world watches, the dialogue between innovation and regulation continues, promising an eventual, albeit protracted, integration of cryptocurrencies into the global investment landscape. The path to a fully regulated and widely accessible spot Ethereum ETF may be longer than anticipated, but the journey continues with unwavering institutional resolve.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $107,296.38 and $109,142.23 today. Table of Contents Story Highlights Bitcoin Price Today CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin Crypto Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 BTC Price Forecast 2026 BTC Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Predictions 2028 BTC Price 2029 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Bitcoin Prediction: Analysts and Influencer’s BTC Price Target FAQs Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $ 111,273.90247609 2.34% Market cap $ 2,213,264,625,986.07 Circulating Supply 19,890,240.00 Trading Volume $ 61,159,707,776.9076 All-time high $109,114.88 on 20th January 2025 All-time low $0.04865 on 15th July 2010 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Firstly, at CoinPedia, we feel optimistic about Bitcoin’s price increase. Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s performance in Q1 2025 was notably lackluster due to tariff-related concerns alongside the rise in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Yet, it made a remarkable comeback in Q2, particularly during April and May. Driven by easing tensions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000 by the third week of May. But, In early June, BTC attempted to hold support near the previous swing low from May after pulling back from its $112K peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and renewed U.S.-China trade talks sparked a brief bounce from the dynamic support of the 50-day EMA. Yet, by June 10th, the momentum began to wane, with increased selling pressure linked to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran. The situation escalated on June 17th when President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Following a defiant response from Iran, the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June, further worsening the geopolitical landscape. Consequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to around $98,000 but rebounded after a ceasefire announcement on June 23rd. As of the fourth week of June onwards, Bitcoin’s price has advanced significantly, despite dormant wallet addresses for years resurfacing, showcasing strength in BTC’s rise. The price action throughout June had resembled a continuation pattern known as a “flag pattern”, with the upper border aligning with this supply block. By the second week of July, whale transactions count (>1m USD), whale transactions count (>100K USD), weighted sentiment, and addresses holding coins (10,000 – 100,000) have seen increases. As a result, the border of the flag is breached on the upside and has broken through June’s swing high of $110K. If BTC price holds for a few days above June’s high, then another push would conquer $112K and enter price discovery mode. With several experts suggesting a round-number target of $120,000 next before July ends. Conversely, if bearish pressure mounts and the price reverses below June’s swing high, then the consolidation between the flag upper border and June’s swing high could continue. But, if it slips $107K then it could return to the critical May swing low support zone around $101K. Should this level also fail, then Bitcoin could fall to the flag’s lower border, dragging the price down to the $100,000 to $95,000 range in the near term. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

For some time, the tech giant has accrued several critics and company complaints over its supposed market monopolization. Travel companies like Skyscanner, Booking.com, and Kelkoo have accused Google of prioritizing its offerings, such as Google Flights, Hotels, and Shopping, in search results . At a European workshop on July 7-8, Google sought to settle its grievances, presenting its proposals to the companies in attendance. However, the firm’s efforts fell short of reassuring its competitors. Google’s critics and competitors are not satisfied with its proposals Google suggested two alternatives that would place a dedicated section for vertical search services like Skyscanner and Kelkoo at the top of its results pages. At the same time, hotels, restaurants, and airlines appear below. However, competitors rejected the options, arguing that Google’s revisions will not level the playing field. Skyscanner CEO Bryan Batista even believes the proposed layouts could mislead users and further entrench Google’s dominance in search rankings, adding that the “box” solution ghettoizes them. Other critics have also argued that the new designs for rivals’ boxes lack core functionalities such as real-time price updates, while most airlines are dissatisfied with their listing below third-party booking sites. Moreover, lawyer Thomas Hoppner, the complainants’ legal counsel, claimed Google is deflecting scrutiny from its own regulatory violations by amplifying disputes between hotels and online booking services. He commented, “Google is shifting the focus to alleged tensions between direct suppliers and intermediaries, diverting attention from the root issue: its own non-compliance, which created these tensions in the first place.” However, Oliver Bethell, the lead in Google’s legal team, claimed that competing interests pulled them in different directions. He argues that any path forward must strike a balance for all European consumers, not just certain corporate players. Google could face fines of up to 10% of its global revenue In March, the European Commission issued two preliminary findings to Alphabet, citing non-compliance with the Digital Markets Act. Per its findings, the commission found certain features and functionalities of Google Search favor Alphabet’s offerings at the expense of its competitors. They also found Google Play to violate the DMA, noting that app developers are restricted from directing users to other channels with better deals. With Google’s proposals on the table, the European Commission is expected to decide on their compliance with DMA in the next few months. The company would be obliged to pay its first DMA penalty if it finds the changes lacking. If a fine is imposed, it could surpass the Android antitrust fine. Based on last year’s earnings, Google is looking at fines of up to 10% of its global revenue, roughly $30.7 billion. In 2018, the EU imposed a €4.34 billion fine , almost $5 billion, on Google for violating antitrust laws. The agency argued that Google had placed illegal restrictions on Android device makers and mobile carriers for years, to reinforce its dominance in general internet search. It added that Google practices hindered competitiveness and stifled innovation, denying European consumers the benefits. Before the penalty, Google required manufacturers to install its search and browser apps as a prerequisite for licensing its Google Play Store. It also paid manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search app exclusively on their devices and blocked its rivals.

Despite a brief surge that brought it within range of its $111,000 peak, the asset has struggled to establish a breakout. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,927, representing a 0.2% increase over the past 24 hours. The persistence of this consolidation phase comes amid growing market discussions around spot and derivatives behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut—What You Need To Know Binance Spot-Perpetual Delta Reflects Cautious Leverage One of the more notable on-chain observations comes from CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, who analyzed the prolonged negative delta between spot and perpetual prices on Binance. According to the analyst, this delta has remained in negative territory since December 2024. That means the spot price of Bitcoin has consistently traded above the perpetual futures price on Binance, an unusual structure during what appears to be a bullish market trend. “When the delta flipped negative last December, Bitcoin had just marked a then-ATH,” BorisVest noted. He explained that this divergence signaled an aggressive buildup of long positions in the perpetual market, just before Bitcoin corrected to $74,000. Despite Bitcoin reaching new highs recently, the delta still hasn’t reversed. “The sustained gap shows that leveraged traders have yet to commit to the rally in full,” he added. This trend could indicate a phase of accumulation in the spot market, which historically precedes stronger price movements. The analyst also warned that when perpetual prices eventually flip above spot prices, it may signal a shift toward a more speculative environment. In such scenarios, sudden price corrections could occur if long positions are unwound rapidly. Traders monitoring the spot-perpetual relationship can potentially use this as a signal to adjust their risk exposure. Dollar Weakness May Signal Tailwinds for Bitcoin Another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a macroeconomic trend that could further influence Bitcoin’s trajectory, the weakening US dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the value of the dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies, is currently trading at its most significant deviation below its 200-day moving average in over two decades. This decline coincides with rising US debt levels and has historically aligned with strength in risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Darkfost pointed out that when the dollar loses its traditional safe-haven appeal, capital often flows toward alternative assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $92,000 Or New ATHs?

47948357,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=176371,1752134454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/47948357.jpeg,Bitcoin: CZ’s Bold Insight – Why Now Might Be the Perfect Time to Buy the Dip,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-cz-buy-dip/,"In the fast-paced world of digital assets, every word from a prominent figure can send ripples across the global crypto market . Recently, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ , once again captured the attention of investors with a simple yet powerful message: “Hope you bought the dip.” This statement, delivered via his active X account, came as Bitcoin saw a modest 2% uptick within 24 hours, reminding the community of his consistent bullish outlook, previously articulated on June 23rd: “everything before the next ATH [all-time-high] is a dip.” But what does this mean for the average investor, and is CZ’s optimism a sign to seize the moment? Understanding CZ’s Perspective on Bitcoin and Market Cycles CZ has long been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. His recent comments are not isolated but rather echo a consistent philosophy he has shared with millions of followers over the years. When he suggests that ‘everything before the next ATH is a dip,’ he’s articulating a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term upward trajectory, implying that current price levels, regardless of minor fluctuations, are ultimately low points when viewed against future potential all-time highs. This perspective encourages a long-term investment horizon, rather than short-term trading based on daily volatility. His influence on the crypto market cannot be overstated. Despite stepping down from Binance, CZ remains a highly respected and watched figure. His simple tweets often ignite conversations and can even influence market sentiment, especially among retail investors who look to experienced voices for guidance. His ‘buy the dip’ mantra isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a reflection of a seasoned investor’s strategy for accumulating assets in a volatile market. What Does it Mean to ‘Buy the Dip’ in the Crypto Market? The phrase ‘ buy the dip ‘ is a common investment strategy, particularly prevalent in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. It essentially means purchasing an asset after its price has fallen, with the expectation that the price will rebound and eventually surpass its previous levels. For Bitcoin , this strategy has historically proven effective, given its cyclical nature and consistent recovery from significant downturns. However, it’s not without its risks. Identifying a true ‘dip’ versus a sustained downturn can be challenging. A ‘dip’ implies a temporary correction before a recovery, while a ‘downturn’ could indicate a longer bear market. CZ’s broader definition—’everything before the next ATH is a dip’—suggests a confidence that Bitcoin will always reach new all-time highs, making any current price point an opportunity for accumulation. Key aspects of the ‘buy the dip’ strategy include: Risk Assessment: Understanding that prices can always fall further than anticipated. Long-Term Vision: This strategy is best suited for investors with a long-term outlook, not those seeking quick profits. Capital Allocation: Only investing capital you can afford to lose, as market recovery is never guaranteed. Market Context: Analyzing the broader market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and fundamental developments of the asset. Strategies for Navigating Bitcoin’s Volatility Towards the Next ATH For those looking to act on CZ’s advice or simply navigate the volatile waters of Bitcoin investment, several strategies can be employed. While CZ’s tweet is a general sentiment, a disciplined approach is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Strategy Description Benefits Challenges Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly), regardless of the asset’s price. Reduces risk of buying at peak prices; averages out purchase price over time. May miss out on significant gains if prices surge quickly; requires discipline. Value Averaging Adjusting investment amounts to reach a specific target value for your portfolio at regular intervals. More aggressive ‘buy the dip’ approach; potentially higher returns in volatile markets. Requires more active management; can lead to larger investments during dips. Technical Analysis Using charts and indicators to identify support levels where prices might bounce. Helps in timing entries for ‘dips’; provides data-driven insights. Not foolproof; can be subjective; requires learning complex charting patterns. The ultimate goal for many investors following CZ’s sentiment is to position themselves favorably for the next ATH . This requires not just buying during dips, but also holding through periods of stagnation or further declines, trusting in the long-term growth of the asset. The Broader Crypto Market: Beyond Bitcoin and CZ’s Influence While CZ ‘s comments primarily focus on Bitcoin , his optimism often spills over into the wider crypto market . Bitcoin’s performance typically sets the tone for altcoins, and a bullish outlook on Bitcoin often signals potential for growth across the entire digital asset space. However, it’s crucial to remember that altcoins carry their own unique risks and rewards, often exhibiting higher volatility than Bitcoin. The current market environment is complex, influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the blockchain space. Investor sentiment, while often buoyed by influential figures, also reacts to these external forces. Understanding the interplay between these elements is key to making informed investment decisions. A dip in one asset might be a buying opportunity, while a dip in another might signal deeper underlying issues. Diversification and thorough research remain paramount. Is the Next All-Time High (ATH) Inevitable for Bitcoin? The question on many investors’ minds is whether Bitcoin ‘s next ATH is truly inevitable, as CZ’s comments suggest. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience, recovering from multiple significant drawdowns to reach new peaks. This track record is a major reason for the strong belief among long-term holders and figures like CZ. Factors that could drive Bitcoin to a new ATH include: Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s supply-reducing halving events have historically preceded bull runs. Institutional Adoption: Increasing interest and investment from traditional financial institutions. Global Macroeconomics: Bitcoin’s role as a potential hedge against inflation or traditional market instability. Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements to the Bitcoin network and its ecosystem. However, no asset’s future is guaranteed. Regulatory crackdowns, unforeseen technological issues, or significant shifts in global finance could impact its trajectory. CZ’s ‘everything before the next ATH is a dip’ should be viewed as a strong statement of confidence based on historical performance and future potential, rather than a guarantee. Conclusion: Seizing Opportunity in the Crypto Market CZ ‘s recent remarks serve as a powerful reminder of the long-term bullish sentiment that permeates much of the cryptocurrency community. His ‘hope you bought the dip’ message, coupled with his belief that ‘everything before the next ATH is a dip,’ encapsulates a strategy focused on accumulation and patience in the face of market volatility. While his words carry significant weight, investors should always combine such insights with their own diligent research, risk assessment, and a clear understanding of their financial goals. The crypto market offers unparalleled opportunities, but navigating it successfully requires a blend of optimism, strategy, and prudence. Whether the current price action constitutes the ‘dip’ before the next major surge, only time will tell, but the conversation ignited by CZ certainly highlights the ongoing potential in the digital asset space.

Open interest surges past $176M, suggesting strong trader conviction behind PENGU’s latest breakout. Resistance levels at $0.032 and $0.044 may act as stepping stones toward the $0.060 target. PENGU Price Rallies Following Spot ETF Filing Acknowledgement The price of PENGU, a Solana-based memecoin, surged nearly 29% in the past 24 hours. The move followed the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) acknowledgment of a filing for the Canary Spot PENGU ETF. At the time of writing, the popular meme coin was exchanging hands at $0.01902 with a 24-hour trading volume of $431 million. Meanwhile, this development sparked renewed interest in the token, with many traders reacting to the ETF filing as a possible catalyst for broader adoption. Over the past 7 days, PENGU has gained over 16%, building on strong momentum as anticipation grows over potential ETF approval. Chart Signals Support for Higher Targets Crypto analyst Ali shared a chart showing that PENGU recently completed a textbook bullish retest near $0.013. The price has since rebounded and is now targeting $0.060 by August, according to the projection. Slap yourself if you are sleeping on $PENGU .

This sharp increase in OI reflects a flood of new positions being opened during the rally. Source: Coinalyze Rising OI along with price often points to bullish positioning from traders rather than short covering. However, elevated OI also carries risk, as rapid liquidation could occur if momentum fades. According to our recent analysis, PENGU may be preparing for a larger move. Analyst Martinez noted that the token could soon test the $0.044 level, which would represent a 200% gain from earlier trading levels.

Experts have shared bullish predictions about July for months, and to see if the digital asset will maintain this momentum for the rest of the year, we consulted Elon Musk’s AI system, Grok . After analyzing predictions from market experts and the current state of the market, Grok offered a detailed analysis of XRP’s potential price by the end of 2025, with multiple bullish targets. Grok Mentioned Regulatory and Institutional Developments A major turning point for XRP came in March when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreed to withdraw its appeal against Ripple . While the court recently rejected their joint motion, both parties will dismiss their appeals , cementing XRP’s status as a non-security asset. This would provide greater regulatory clarity, and Grok highlighted it as a critical driver of market confidence. Grok also highlighted that Ripple’s partnerships with leading financial institutions such as Santander, SBI Holdings , and Bank of America are increasing XRP’s utility in cross-border payments. The company’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service continues to attract interest from payment processors and banks, enhancing XRP’s real-world application. Grok referenced a prediction of an 88% chance of spot XRP ETF approval by the end of 2025. Bloomberg analysts recently raised the ETF approval probability to 95% , and this development could significantly boost institutional investment. The anticipation surrounding this development mirrors previous rallies triggered by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Grok’s XRP Price Prediction Technical analysts have also identified bullish patterns, including a cup-and-handle formation and an ascending channel. Grok noted that if XRP breaks resistance levels between $2.40 and $3.40, it could initiate a substantial upward movement. Grok compiled a range of predictions from web sources and analysts. Conservative estimates range from $1.05 to $2.50, citing market volatility and regulatory delays. Moderate forecasts, including those from Cryptomus and InvestingHaven, suggest prices between $2.50 and $5.00. Bullish projections, such as those from Standard Chartered, extend to $5.81 and $5.50, respectively. Some speculative forecasts on social media even suggest values exceeding $15 or $100 , but Grok cautions these are “highly speculative” and imply “unprecedented adoption.” Grok’s Final Estimate Weighing various market drivers and risks, Grok predicts XRP will trade in the $3 to $7 range by the end of 2025, with a likely value near $5. It notes that this estimate balances optimism from potential ETF approval and institutional growth with risks such as market volatility and competition.

U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent voice for fiscal conservatism and a known advocate for digital assets, has made a stunning and direct demand: for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to step down. This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a serious accusation from a sitting senator, amplified by Watcher Guru on X, that Powell is “unfit to run the Fed.” This bold declaration raises critical questions about the future of monetary policy, the fight against inflation, and what it all means for your investments, especially in the digital asset space. The Unprecedented Call: Why is Senator Lummis Demanding Jerome Powell’s Resignation? Senator Lummis’s call for Jerome Powell’s resignation isn’t a casual remark; it’s a profound statement rooted in her assessment of the current economic climate and the Fed’s handling of it. While the specific reasons cited by Lummis in the Watcher Guru report were succinct (“unfit to run the Fed”), her broader public statements and policy positions offer more context. Lummis has consistently voiced deep concerns over the Federal Reserve’s response to surging inflation, arguing that the central bank was too slow to react, leading to significant erosion of purchasing power for American families and businesses. Her criticism often centers on the perception that the Fed, under Powell’s leadership, allowed inflation to become entrenched by maintaining ultra-low interest rates and engaging in aggressive quantitative easing for too long. When the Fed finally began hiking rates, Lummis and others argued it was a belated and overly aggressive move that risked tipping the economy into recession. This delicate balancing act – controlling inflation without stifling economic growth – is at the heart of the debate. For Senator Lummis, the balance has been mismanaged, leading her to believe that a change in leadership is necessary to restore confidence and steer the nation’s economy more effectively. The sentiment from Senator Lummis reflects a growing frustration among some policymakers and the public regarding the Fed’s performance. The post-pandemic economic boom, coupled with supply chain disruptions and geopolitical events, created a perfect storm for inflation. While the Fed initially characterized inflation as “transitory,” it proved to be far more persistent, leading to a scramble to tighten monetary policy. This shift, from a dovish stance to an aggressive hawkish one, has drawn both praise for its decisiveness and sharp criticism for its perceived delay and potential overcorrection. Understanding the Federal Reserve’s Crucial Role and Federal Reserve Policy Impact To fully grasp the weight of Senator Lummis’s demand, it’s essential to understand the immense power and responsibility vested in the Federal Reserve. As the central bank of the United States, the Fed has a dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability. These two goals, while seemingly straightforward, often present complex trade-offs, especially in dynamic economic environments. The tools at its disposal include setting the federal funds rate, conducting open market operations (like quantitative easing or tightening), and regulating banks. The impact of Federal Reserve policy impact on daily life is profound. When the Fed raises interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive, cooling down economic activity and theoretically taming inflation. Conversely, lowering rates encourages borrowing and spending, stimulating growth. These decisions ripple through every sector, affecting mortgage rates, business investments, consumer loans, and even the valuation of assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Under Jerome Powell, the Fed navigated unprecedented economic challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent recovery. His tenure has been marked by: Aggressive Stimulus: Initially, the Fed implemented massive stimulus measures to prevent a deeper economic collapse during the pandemic, including near-zero interest rates and large-scale asset purchases. Inflation Surge: Following the stimulus, inflation surged to multi-decade highs, prompting a significant shift in monetary policy. Rapid Rate Hikes: The Fed embarked on one of the fastest rate-hiking cycles in decades to combat inflation, raising the federal funds rate from near zero to over 5%. Balance Sheet Reduction: Alongside rate hikes, the Fed began quantitative tightening, allowing its massive balance sheet to shrink, further removing liquidity from the financial system. These actions, while aimed at achieving the Fed’s mandate, have not been without controversy. Critics like Senator Lummis argue that the initial stimulus was excessive, leading directly to the inflation problem, and that the subsequent tightening was either too late or too severe, risking a recession. Navigating the Storm: How Do US Inflation Concerns Drive Political Scrutiny? The rising cost of living has become a dominant issue for American households, and these US inflation concerns are a major catalyst for political scrutiny directed at the Federal Reserve. When prices for everyday goods and services—from groceries and gasoline to housing and healthcare—rise significantly, it directly impacts the financial well-being of millions. This tangible pain point translates into immense political pressure on elected officials, who in turn look for accountability from institutions like the Fed. Consider the following impacts of persistent inflation: Economic Impact Description Reduced Purchasing Power Each dollar buys less, eroding savings and real wages. Uncertainty for Businesses Difficulty in planning future investments and pricing strategies. Increased Cost of Borrowing Higher interest rates make loans more expensive for consumers and businesses. Social Discontent Frustration among the public over stagnant wages and rising costs. It’s within this context that calls for leadership changes, such as Senator Lummis’s demand for Jerome Powell’s resignation , gain traction. Lawmakers, responding to their constituents’ struggles, often question whether the Fed is acting swiftly and effectively enough to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. The debate isn’t just about economic theory; it’s about the lived experiences of ordinary Americans and the perceived competence of those in charge of the nation’s economic levers. While the Fed is designed to operate independently of political influence to make objective decisions, its actions inherently have political consequences. When inflation runs hot, the Fed becomes a natural target for criticism, regardless of the underlying causes, which can include global supply chain issues, geopolitical conflicts, or fiscal policy. This dynamic ensures that Fed leadership will always be under intense public and political scrutiny, especially during periods of economic turbulence. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Stability? The intersection of traditional monetary policy and the burgeoning digital asset space is a crucial one, and any significant shake-up at the Federal Reserve, such as a potential change in leadership, could have notable implications for crypto market stability . Cryptocurrencies, while often seen as an alternative to traditional finance, are not entirely insulated from macroeconomic forces driven by central banks. Here’s how Fed policy and leadership changes can influence the crypto market: Interest Rates and Liquidity: Higher interest rates, a direct result of Fed tightening, tend to make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive. As the cost of borrowing increases, investors may pull capital from speculative assets to less volatile, yield-bearing traditional investments. Conversely, a more dovish Fed (lower rates, more liquidity) generally bodes well for crypto, as capital seeks higher returns. Investor Sentiment: Uncertainty at the Fed or about the direction of monetary policy can lead to increased volatility across all markets, including crypto. Investors prefer clarity, and a potential change in Fed leadership, particularly under contentious circumstances, would introduce a period of significant uncertainty. Inflation Hedge Narrative: For some, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. If the market perceives that a new Fed chair or a change in policy is more likely to lead to uncontrolled inflation, this narrative could strengthen, potentially boosting crypto prices. Conversely, if a new leader is seen as highly effective in taming inflation, the “inflation hedge” argument might weaken. Regulatory Outlook: While not directly tied to monetary policy, the broader economic philosophy of a new Fed chair could indirectly influence the regulatory environment for digital assets. A leader more open to innovation or, conversely, more inclined towards strict oversight, could shape future discussions around crypto regulation. The current economic environment, with high inflation and aggressive rate hikes, has undeniably put pressure on the crypto market, contributing to the “crypto winter” experienced recently. A call for Jerome Powell’s resignation , therefore, is not just a political headline; it’s a potential signal of future shifts in monetary policy that crypto investors need to monitor closely. Any pivot in the Fed’s strategy, whether it’s a continuation of tightening or a shift towards easing, will likely send ripples through Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader altcoin ecosystem. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the Fed and the US Economy? The call from Senator Lummis Fed Criticism highlights the intense pressure on the Federal Reserve as it navigates complex economic currents. While a senator’s call for resignation is significant, it’s important to remember that the Fed Chair is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, serving a four-year term. A resignation would typically occur under extreme pressure or personal choice, and such public demands, while impactful, do not automatically trigger a change in leadership. However, the ongoing scrutiny means that every decision made by the Federal Reserve will be met with heightened anticipation and analysis. The path forward involves several key considerations: Inflation Trajectory: The primary focus will remain on whether inflation continues its downward trend towards the Fed’s 2% target. Economic data, particularly the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, will be critical. Interest Rate Decisions: Will the Fed continue to hold rates steady, or are further hikes or cuts on the horizon? This will depend heavily on inflation data and labor market conditions. Economic Growth: The Fed aims for a “soft landing” – bringing down inflation without causing a severe recession. The balance between fighting inflation and sustaining economic growth will be delicate. Political Landscape: As the 2024 election cycle heats up, the Fed’s actions will inevitably become a political talking point, adding another layer of complexity to its decision-making process. The current climate demands astute leadership at the Federal Reserve. Whether Jerome Powell remains at the helm or not, the challenges of managing inflation, maintaining employment, and ensuring financial stability will persist. The economic narrative is continuously evolving, and the decisions made in the coming months will shape the financial futures of millions, influencing everything from the cost of your mortgage to the volatility of your crypto portfolio. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Monetary Policy and Markets Senator Cynthia Lummis’s unequivocal call for Jerome Powell’s resignation underscores a moment of intense scrutiny for the Federal Reserve and its leadership. Her criticism, rooted in deep US inflation concerns and a perceived mismanagement of Federal Reserve policy impact , reflects a broader public and political frustration with the rising cost of living. While the immediate outcome of such a call remains uncertain, it highlights the immense pressure on the Fed to navigate a complex economic landscape. For investors, particularly those in the digital asset space, understanding these dynamics is paramount. The stability of the crypto market stability is inextricably linked to the broader macroeconomic environment shaped by central bank actions. As the debate over monetary policy continues, vigilance and informed decision-making will be key to navigating the opportunities and challenges ahead.

In a new interview with CNBC, Lee predicts the leading stock index could surge to 6,800 in the next few months, fueled by rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve. “People always find quibbles with new highs, but we also know that for an institutional asset manager, it is not really excusable to be bearish when the market makes a new all-time high. So in other words, the institutions now have to start adding risk if we’re making all-time highs, because it’s a new bull market.” Lee says the FOMO (fear of missing out) trade is a component of the current market environment. “It’s merely a reorientation of perception, because the market’s only at 5% year-to-date, but we could be up 10%, so only half of the full-year gains have been realized, so if someone had fresh eyes on the market and knows the Fed’s being dovish and tariff risks are abating and multiples could expand, I think people could find many stocks to buy.” The S&P 500 set a new all-time high last week and is trading at 6,263.26 at time of writing. The index is up more than 0.6% in the past day and more than 1% in the past 5 days.

Many altcoins have produced even more impressive price pumps in the past 24 hours, led by PENGU, WIF, and FARTCOIN. BTC’s Latest Peak Liqudates Massive Whale Recall that the primary cryptocurrency began the month with stagnation and even a brief correction that drove it to just over $105,000. However, it reacted well at this point, erased all losses, and even jumped past $110,000 a day later. It couldn’t maintain its run and returned to $108,000, where it spent most of the weekend. Monday started with another breakout attempt, but to no avail as the bears emerged at $109,600 and pushed it south. After another day of consolidation on Tuesday and most of Wednesday, the cryptocurrency finally shot up on Wednesday evening. Perhaps due to Donald Trump’s call for lower interest rates, BTC skyrocketed past $110,000 and continued climbing to break its previous all-time high, setting a new one at $112,000 (on most exchanges). Although it has retraced by about a grand since then, its move to the upside caused a painful liquidation for a certain whale.

Source: TradingView Alts in Green The declining BTC dominance in times of price pumps means that alts have performed better, a lot better. This is evident from many larger-cap ones, such as ETH, which tapped $2,800 for the first time in weeks. DOGE, ADA, HYPE, SUI, XLM, AVAX, HBAR, and SHIB are also well in the green, with gains of up to 10-11%. The biggest increases come from some lower-cap alts, such as PENGU, which has skyrocketed by over 34% amid rumors of a spot ETF. WIF (15%) and FARTCOIN (13%) follow suit.

The exchange has gone live with an initial set of 10 trading pairs, claiming broader support than other centralized platforms. More pairs are expected to be introduced soon. Bitrue also said that WLFI will be added for trading and staking once it becomes available. The assets now tradable directly with USD1 are BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, TRX, XDC, ADA, BNB, DOGE, and SUI. Additionally, USD1 is available for trading against USDT. Bitrue said the new listings reflect its ongoing efforts to expand trading options and support a broader range of investment strategies. The exchange described the move as part of its push to lead in stablecoin innovation, aiming to enhance market efficiency and offer early access to emerging tokens like USD1. Trump family-linked token World Liberty Financial, the issuer of USD1, is a relatively new entity with ties to the Trump family. Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump hold management roles at the organisation. The firm has launched two tokens to date: USD1, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, and WLFI, a governance token. Bitrue said both tokens are drawing growing interest from investors, with USD1 reportedly surpassing Circle’s USDC in daily trading volume, reaching over $4 billion. The exchange noted that USD1 is fully backed 1:1 with real-world assets and supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Chain, and Tron. “These tokens are highly emblematic of the rapid expansion of the crypto industry in 2025, given that they have such close ties to the President of the USA and the significant steps his office is taking to legitimize crypto worldwide.“ said Adam O’Neill, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitrue. USD1 has already secured partnerships with platforms such as Pancakeswap and Plume Network, helping to establish its presence across both decentralized (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) sectors, Bitrue said. The exchange also announced plans to list the WLFI governance token for trading in the coming weeks. WLFI will be supported through Bitrue’s Power Piggy earning product, enabling holders to earn additional WLFI through daily passive income payouts. Bitrue added that more tokens will be paired with USD1 in the weeks ahead, based on community feedback.

A new entity, The BNB Treasury Company , is poised to make significant waves, backed by influential players in the industry. This venture signals a strategic shift, aiming to bridge the gap between the dynamic cryptocurrency market and established financial structures. It’s a development that warrants close attention from anyone invested in the future of digital assets. What is The BNB Treasury Company and Its Core Mission? At its heart, The BNB Treasury Company is being launched with a clear and singular purpose: to acquire and hold a substantial amount of BNB, the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain. This isn’t just another investment fund; it’s a strategic play designed to provide a new avenue for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to the BNB token without directly managing the complexities of cryptocurrency exchanges or private wallets. Direct Exposure: The company aims to offer a regulated pathway for investors to participate in the BNB ecosystem. Long-Term Holding: Its strategy is centered on buying and holding, which could potentially contribute to the stability and demand for the BNB token over time. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: By targeting a U.S. IPO, the company seeks to bring a traditional finance wrapper to a prominent digital asset. This model is reminiscent of Bitcoin or Ethereum trusts that allow investors to gain exposure through traditional brokerage accounts, but with a specific focus on BNB. Such initiatives are crucial for fostering broader adoption and legitimizing cryptocurrencies in the eyes of mainstream investors. The Powerhouses Behind the Vision: YZi Labs and 10X Capital The backing for The BNB Treasury Company comes from two significant entities: YZi Labs and investment firm 10X Capital. YZi Labs is particularly notable as the family office of Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ Binance , the former CEO of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This connection immediately lends credibility and a deep understanding of the crypto market to the new venture. CZ Binance ‘s continued involvement, even through his family office, underscores a long-term commitment to the BNB ecosystem and its growth. His strategic foresight has historically been a driving force in the crypto space, and his family office’s support suggests a strong belief in the potential of this new company. 10X Capital, on the other hand, brings extensive experience in traditional finance and capital markets. Their involvement is crucial for navigating the intricacies of a public listing, especially within the stringent regulatory environment of the United States. This partnership combines deep crypto expertise with seasoned financial market acumen, creating a formidable team poised for success. The collaboration between a crypto-native entity like YZi Labs and a traditional investment firm like 10X Capital highlights a growing trend: the convergence of the old and new financial worlds. This synergy is vital for ventures seeking to operate at the intersection of blockchain and regulated markets. Why a U.S. IPO? Navigating the Regulatory Landscape for a Crypto IPO The decision to pursue a U.S. IPO is perhaps the most ambitious and strategic aspect of The BNB Treasury Company ‘s plan. A Crypto IPO in the United States offers several compelling advantages, despite the well-known regulatory hurdles: Enhanced Legitimacy and Trust: Listing on a major U.S. exchange confers a high level of legitimacy and regulatory oversight, which can significantly boost investor confidence compared to private placements or listings in less regulated jurisdictions. Access to Deep Capital Markets: The U.S. stock market represents the largest and most liquid capital market globally. A successful IPO would open doors to a vast pool of institutional and retail investors who might otherwise be hesitant to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. Increased Transparency: Public companies are subject to rigorous reporting and disclosure requirements, providing greater transparency to investors. This level of scrutiny can help demystify digital assets for traditional investors. However, the path to a Crypto IPO in the U.S. is not without its challenges. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious about cryptocurrency-related products, particularly those involving direct exposure to digital assets. The company will need to navigate complex securities laws, demonstrate robust compliance frameworks, and potentially overcome skepticism from regulators and traditional investors. The success of this IPO could set a precedent for future crypto-backed ventures seeking public listings, further integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Implications for the BNB Ecosystem and Digital Asset Investment The launch of The BNB Treasury Company and its potential U.S. IPO carries significant implications for the broader BNB ecosystem and the landscape of digital asset investment . For the BNB token itself, a successful public company dedicated to holding BNB could: Increase Demand and Stability: Consistent buying by a publicly traded entity could provide a steady demand floor for BNB, potentially reducing price volatility. Boost Institutional Adoption: By offering a regulated, publicly traded vehicle, the company could attract significant institutional capital that has previously been on the sidelines due to regulatory or operational concerns. Enhance Brand Recognition: A U.S. IPO would bring considerable mainstream attention to BNB and the BNB Chain, elevating its profile beyond the crypto-native community. More broadly, for digital asset investment , this initiative represents a maturation of the market. As more traditional financial structures embrace cryptocurrencies, it paves the way for greater capital inflows, improved liquidity, and a more robust regulatory framework. It signals a growing confidence in digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles, moving them beyond speculative instruments to recognized assets within diversified portfolios. This move could inspire other major cryptocurrencies to explore similar pathways to public markets, leading to a more integrated and accessible digital asset investment landscape. It also highlights the increasing sophistication of investment strategies within the crypto space, moving beyond simple spot trading to more complex, institutionally-driven models. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead: A Balanced Perspective While the prospect of The BNB Treasury Company ‘s U.S. IPO is exciting, it’s essential to consider both the opportunities and the inherent challenges. Opportunities: Broader Investor Base: Access to traditional investors, including pension funds and institutional endowments, who typically cannot invest directly in crypto. Increased Liquidity: A public listing can create more liquidity for BNB, as shares in the company can be traded easily on exchanges. Regulatory Clarity: The process of an IPO forces a company to achieve a high level of regulatory compliance, which can provide a clearer operating framework. Price Discovery: A publicly traded vehicle can contribute to more efficient price discovery for the underlying asset, the BNB token . Challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Securing SEC approval for a crypto-holding company will be a significant challenge, potentially involving lengthy review processes and strict requirements. Market Volatility: The value of the company’s shares will inherently be tied to the volatile price of BNB, which could impact investor sentiment and stock performance. Competition: As the crypto market matures, more traditional investment vehicles might emerge, increasing competition for investor capital. Investor Education: Despite the traditional wrapper, educating mainstream investors about the nuances and risks of a crypto-backed company will be crucial. The success of this venture will largely depend on its ability to effectively communicate its value proposition, demonstrate robust risk management, and navigate the evolving regulatory landscape with agility. The Road Ahead: What to Watch For in This Ambitious Venture As The BNB Treasury Company embarks on its journey towards a U.S. IPO, several key milestones and developments will be crucial to watch: The immediate focus will be on completing its fundraising within weeks. The success of this initial capital raise will be a strong indicator of investor appetite and confidence in the venture. Following this, the regulatory approval process with the U.S. SEC will be paramount. This phase could be protracted and will require meticulous adherence to all legal and financial requirements. Furthermore, market reception to the offering will be telling. How traditional investors, often more conservative, react to a publicly traded company solely focused on holding a single cryptocurrency will provide valuable insights into the broader acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. This initiative, backed by figures like CZ Binance and firms like 10X Capital, represents a significant step in the ongoing integration of cryptocurrency into global financial markets. It’s a testament to the enduring belief in the long-term value of digital assets and the innovative spirit driving the industry forward. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Digital Asset Investment The emergence of The BNB Treasury Company , with the formidable backing of YZi Labs and 10X Capital, marks a pivotal moment for the BNB token and the broader world of digital asset investment . By aiming for a U.S. IPO, this venture is not just seeking capital; it’s seeking legitimacy, broader adoption, and a new pathway for traditional investors to engage with the crypto economy. While challenges abound, the potential benefits—from enhanced liquidity and institutional participation to greater market transparency—are substantial. This bold move by a company focused on a specific BNB token strategy, spearheaded by the vision of CZ Binance ‘s family office, could indeed pave the way for a new era of crypto-related public offerings, forever changing how we perceive and invest in digital assets.

On Thursday, Australia’s top bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), unveiled the second phase of its digital currency pilot, Project Acacia. This phase lasts six months and is centered on wholesale use cases. The trial will cover 24 scenarios with digital currencies, including stablecoins, bank-issued deposit tokens, and a pilot central bank digital currency (CBDC). Of these, 19 will be based on real financial transactions and five will be structured as virtual simulations. These use cases span assets from a range of sectors, including fixed income, private markets, carbon credits, trade receivables, and new applications for accounts at the RBA. The idea is to experiment with how digital currencies and tokenization can make financial systems more efficient, secure, and transparent. The RBA spearheads the initiative with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC), which was made public last November. A verdict in the trial is not anticipated until early 2026. Major banks lead digital currency pilot Australia’s biggest banks are in the spotlight of the digital currency trial. Three of the ‘big four’ banks, the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), ANZ, and Westpac, are all participating, focusing on specific use cases relevant to their experience and skills. In partnership with JPMorgan, CBA is running a pilot on the repo market, which involves short-term loans backed by government securities. The transactions are a key part of liquidity management and the execution of monetary policy. According to Sophie Gilder, CBA’s Head of Blockchain and Digital Assets, “The repo market , with its critical role in liquidity management and monetary policy implementation, represents an ideal starting point for this exploration.” The objective is to test whether blockchain-based tokens can reduce friction, decrease risk, and foster market liquidity. ANZ, meanwhile, is trialling tokenized trade payables and looking to solve long-term problems associated with working capital and cash flow within supply chains. By transforming invoices into negotiable digital tokens, businesses — particularly small suppliers — could get paid more quickly and cleanly. ANZ is also experimenting with how a wholesale CBDC can enable real-time and secure settlement in the fixed-income market. This could save much time and money on bonds and other trading. Westpac is also participating in the trial, but the details of their involvement are not yet known. But the bank has consistently contributed to and participated in blockchain pilots—it is keen on the space. Regulators loosen rules to support innovation The trial has been made possible thanks to temporary relief from certain legal and regulatory obligations provided to the Australian authorities. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has also worked with the RBA and DFCRC to approve participants to experiment with testing transactions for other digital assets not currently regulated under financial regulations. ASIC Commissioner Kate O’Rourke said the regulator sees strong potential in distributed ledger technology (DLT), especially its ability to streamline financial market infrastructure and remove inefficiencies. She explained that the regulatory flexibility would allow these technologies to be tested safely, enabling participants to explore new opportunities while identifying and addressing potential risks. This sandbox is a wing of a developer’s imagination to play about and experiment without breaking any laws. It also gives important information that will influence how Australia will respond to digital asset regulations in the future. The project is being introduced as part of the continued push by the Australian government to police the crypto space more generally. In March 2025, the Labour-led government published a consultation to introduce crypto exchanges and service providers under the current financial service laws regime to increase consumer protection and promote financial stability. Australia has also experienced de-banking , which happens when traditional banks cease providing services to firms in the crypto sector. The government has promised to consult with banks to understand better the matter and how to respond, focusing on finding a balance between innovation and controlling risk.

Accordingly, Markus Thielen stated that Bitcoin could reach $133,000 by September. Bitcoin (BTC) is in an Uptrend! Thielen said Bitcoin could climb to $133,000 by September thanks to renewed bullish momentum and strong demand for call options. Thielen noted that 10X Research's trend models turned bullish on June 29, and according to this model, there is a 60% probability that the rise will continue over the next two months. At this point, Thielen stated that historical data linked to the model indicates a 20% increase from current levels near $111,000, which would take BTC to around $133,000. “We remain constructive on Bitcoin’s upside. Our trading signals suggest that the current short-term breakout carries a 60% probability of further upside over the next two months, while historical data suggests gains of around 20%. This means Bitcoin could reach $133,000 in September.” Finally, Thielen believes that while Q3 is generally a weak period for BTC, this cycle could challenge that trend. *This is not investment advice.

Despite the wave of bullish corporate adoption, with public companies adding bitcoin to their balance sheets . On-chain data suggests that bitcoin has more room to run when compared to previous cycle highs. One useful metric in this analysis is the MVRV Z-Score, which helps evaluate whether bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to what could be considered its fair value. Unlike a traditional z-score, the MVRV Z-Score uniquely compares the market value to the realized value. When the market value, calculated as the network’s valuation based on the spot price multiplied by supply, sits significantly above the realized value, which reflects the cumulative capital inflow into the asset, this has historically signaled market tops [red zone]. Conversely, when the market value is well below the realized value, it has often indicated market bottoms [green zone]. The MVRV Z-Score is defined as the ratio between the difference of market cap and realized cap, and the standard deviation of market cap, expressed as [market cap minus realized cap] divided by the standard deviation of market cap. The standard deviation is calculated cumulatively from the first available data point to the present day, making it a long-term measure. Currently, the MVRV Z-Score sits at 2.4. In past bear market lows, bitcoin has registered scores below zero, as seen in 2015, 2019, and 2022. Meanwhile, cycle tops have historically occurred when the score reaches 7 or higher, as was the case in 2017 and 2021, according to Glassnode data. Although this is just one data point, it indicates that bitcoin still has significant potential for further upside compared to previous cycles.

The rollout will start once U.S. regulators certify the dollar-pegged token under the new federal rules, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the deal. The move would give USDC a link to a network that processed more than $1 trillion in global payments last year, a third of them settled on-chain. That scale could make Ant the largest overseas corporate user of a U.S.-issued stablecoin. Ant International is also applying for stablecoin licenses in Singapore, Hong Kong and Luxembourg, according to the report. The group wants regulated digital dollars, central bank digital currencies and tokenized bank deposits to sit side by side on its platform.

Key Takeaways: Spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $50 billion in net inflows just 18 months after launch. BlackRock’s IBIT leads the market, now holding over 700,000 BTC. Analysts expect SEC approval for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs soon. On July 9 alone, the market saw $218 million in net inflows, marking the fifth consecutive day of positive momentum, according to SoSoValue data . Over the past five trading days, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in nearly $1.52 billion. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Accelerate in July After Brief Setback Inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have steadily accelerated throughout July following a brief setback After a $342 million net outflow on July 1, institutional appetite rebounded sharply, with daily inflows peaking at $601.94 million on July 3. Total net assets under management across all funds now sit at $139.39 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to dominate the landscape, amassing a net inflow of $53 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC follows with $12.29 billion. In contrast, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) remains the only fund with net outflows, losing $23.34 billion since its conversion. IBIT’s dominance was further cemented this week when it became the first ETF to hold over 700,000 BTC, now accounting for over 55% of all BTC held in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Remarkably, BlackRock is now reportedly earning more from IBIT than from its long-established iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. Commenting on IBIT’s explosive growth, Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said recently that it has already become BlackRock’s third-highest revenue-generating ETF out of 1,197 products, surpassing even some of the firm’s flagship traditional funds. The nearly $75bil iShares Bitcoin ETF has only one month of outflows since Jan 2024 launch… Now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares S&P 500 ETF. Simply a machine. I offer a few thoughts here. via @isabelletanlee https://t.co/uDv6eiVb4b pic.twitter.com/pPwMQbfplW — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2025 As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. Institutional Bitcoin Demand Shifts From ETFs to Corporate Treasuries Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. Japan’s Metaplanet recently bought $237 million worth of BTC , becoming the fifth-largest corporate holder with a stack exceeding 15,500 BTC. France’s The Blockchain Group and the UK’s Smarter Web Company also made new BTC treasury allocations this week, purchasing $12.5 million and $24.3 million worth of Bitcoin respectively. Remixpoint, a Tokyo-listed firm, raised $215 million to fund a planned accumulation of 3,000 BTC. Meanwhile, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $112,000 on Wednesday, triggering nearly $200 million in short liquidations. Ether followed closely behind, climbing 6.6% in 24 hours to trade at $2,778, with analysts predicting a potential breakout past $3,000 in the coming days.

It compromised sensitive customer data including names, driver’s license numbers, and contact information. This incident now adds to a growing list of major hacks in 2025, including the recent $40 million GMX V1 exploit and the $1.4 billion Bybit hack earlier this year. Meanwhile, regulators are cracking down on crypto ATMs globally. In fact, New Zealand became the latest country to ban them entirely to combat money laundering. The city of Spokane in Washington State also enacted a full ban on crypto ATMs due to their use in defrauding vulnerable populations. Crypto ATM Giant Discloses 2024 Breach Bitcoin Depot, one of the largest crypto ATM operators in the United States, confirmed a data breach that compromised the personal information of almost 27,000 customers. The incident took place on June 23, 2024, but was only disclosed this week after the company received clearance from law enforcement. According to a notice that was filed with the attorneys general in Maine and Massachusetts, the breach affected 26,732 people and involved sensitive data, including names, phone numbers, driver's license numbers, and potentially addresses, birth dates, and email addresses. Part of the notice that was sent out to affected customers A Bitcoin Depot spokesperson shared that the notification delay was due to instructions from federal law enforcement, which were conducting an investigation into the breach. The company was only advised on June 13, 2025, that the investigation concluded and that it could begin notifying those affected. The breach was first detected in June of 2024, when the company noticed some unusual activity on its network. Bitcoin Depot immediately launched an investigation with a top cybersecurity firm, which confirmed on July 18, 2024, that an unauthorized party accessed files containing customer information. While the company claims there is no evidence that the stolen information was misused, it is urging customers to monitor their credit reports and consider placing fraud alerts or security freezes with major credit agencies. Bitcoin Depot says it has since taken steps to improve its cybersecurity infrastructure, including enhanced monitoring, increased internal awareness around data protection, and cooperation with law enforcement. This incident happened amid a series of high-profile data breaches in the crypto sector, including a December 2024 attack on Byte Federal that affected up to 58,000 users and a May 2025 breach at Coinbase, where hackers bribed third-party contractors and later demanded a $20 million ransom . Recent reports also indicate that more than 16 billion login credentials have been exposed this year alone, thanks to hackers targeting digital platforms with valuable user data. GMX V1 Hit by $40M Exploit Bitcoin Depot is certainly not alone in its struggles against crypto criminals. The GMX protocol halted trading on its GMX V1 platform after a major exploit that resulted in the theft of $40 million in digital assets. The breach affected a liquidity pool on the Arbitrum network that underpins the GMX V1 exchange. This pool included assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. The stolen funds were then transferred to an unknown wallet. In response, the GMX team suspended minting and redemption of GLP tokens on both the Arbitrum and Avalanche networks as a precautionary measure. Users were advised to disable leverage trading and adjust their settings to stop minting GLP tokens. According to the GMX team, the exploit was isolated to GMX V1 and does not impact GMX V2, its associated markets, or the GMX token itself. Blockchain security firm SlowMist attributed the incident to a design flaw in the GLP token's pricing mechanism, which allowed attackers to manipulate the total assets under management and execute the exploit. This latest attack now only adds to the growing list of cybersecurity breaches in the crypto. Space, which already led to billions in losses. In the first half of 2025 alone, crypto hacks caused an estimated $2.5 billion in damages . A big portion of that, approximately $1.4 billion, stemmed from the Bybit hack in February. In another recent incident, Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex suffered over $81 million in losses due to a cyberattack by a group known as Gonjeshke Darande, forcing a temporary pause in services. To complicate things even more for the security landscape, the United States Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced sanctions on North Korean hacker Song Kum Hyok. The hacker is tied to state-affiliated cyber operations, and is accused of infiltrating cryptocurrency firms and defense contractors using social engineering and advanced breach tactics. New Zealand Bans Crypto ATMs Nationwide While exploits are causing problems for the crypto industry, crypto ATM’s are also starting to frustrate regulators. New Zealand even recently introduced a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and imposed a $5,000 limit on international cash transfers as part of sweeping reforms that are specifically aimed at combating money laundering and organized financial crime. The measures were announced by Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee, who explained that the government is very committed to targeting criminal activity while minimizing regulatory burdens for legitimate businesses. McKee stated that banning crypto ATMs will make it much harder for criminals to convert cash into high-risk digital assets, which are often used to conceal illicit transactions. Crypto ATMs The crackdown is part of the broader overhaul of New Zealand’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism regime. The reform package also grants the Financial Intelligence Unit expanded authority to request ongoing information from financial institutions about individuals flagged for suspicious activity. Two new legislative bills supporting these reforms are currently in parliament and are expected to pass by the end of the year. The goals of these laws are to reduce compliance complexity for honest businesses while also maintaining robust financial oversight. The government’s approach is informed by an April report from New Zealand’s Ministerial Advisory Group on Transnational, Serious and Organised Crime, which shed some light on the increasing use of crypto ATMs to launder money, particularly for drug trafficking and fraud. According to Coin ATM Radar , over 220 crypto kiosks are currently operating across the country, but all will be removed under the new rules. Bitcoin ATMs in New Zealand (Source: Coin ATM Radar ) New Zealand’s move is similar to the global trend of tightening controls around crypto ATMs. In Australia, the financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC recently introduced new restrictions on crypto ATM operations, including caps on cash deposits and stricter compliance requirements. Similarly, the city of Spokane in Washington State enacted a full ban on crypto ATMs, due to their use in defrauding vulnerable populations, particularly in low-income communities.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MX|ARB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-10 09:30:00

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is dominating early buzz as the best crypto to buy in 2025. With July unfolding fast, its momentum is undeniable, positioning itself as the unexpected breakout that could claim a seat in the crypto top 10. At its current price of $0.03 MUTM is flying fast during presale stage. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 60% has been sold out following investor frenzy. The project is at its lowest possible value of $0.03 and will never be lower. A 16.7% price surge will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12 million has been raised to date and over 13,000 investors have subscribed to presale. While mainstays coins maintain their course, Mutuum Finance is setting the pace, and smart money is moving before the month ends. Dogecoin: Steady Gains with Eyes on the Next Move Dogecoin is trading a bit above significant levels at the price of $0.17, and the market trend in general is being shifted towards bullish positions. Over the past week, DOGE has begun to show its new power, and analysts have offered it the potential of a breakout so long as it manages to break resistance above the price of $0.18. Renewed increase and strong two-bottom platform on the charts adjudges a submission that amassing is in practice. Speculation involving the likelihood of an ETF based on Dogecoin has further contributed to the short-term price targets being drawn further upwards as some traders now have the $0.25 price as being in their sights should the present momentum continue. As Dogecoin does its best to maintain a role in the list of the most influential assets, in the background, a new propulsive asset by Mutuum Finance represents a novice on the field attracting the interest of new investors. $12M Raised, Mutuum Finance Presale Breaks New Ground Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has taken over 2025 as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in 2025. With over $12 million raised and over 13,000 investors already in, the presale is gaining real traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors are already on a 100% profit. MUTM can skyrocket to as high as $3 after launch. That is a 9900% ROI for current purchasers. Game-Changing Lending Model Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and thus gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets where there exists a necessity for flexibility and tailored terms. Mutuum Finance Giveaway to Reward Early Token Holders Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 people will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a new leaderboard where top 50 token holders will be rewarded with bonus tokens. The mechanism introduces fun and loyalty and bootstraps high-gear ecosystem growth.

In a development that has captured the attention of market analysts and investors alike, the London-based investment manager recently executed a massive Ethereum withdrawal , pulling 29,741 ETH—valued at an astounding $81 million—from major crypto exchanges like Binance and Kraken. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a powerful signal in the volatile digital asset landscape, often interpreted as a strong indication of an intention for long-term holding . What does this bold move by Abraxas Capital truly signify for the future of Ethereum and the broader market? What’s Behind Abraxas Capital’s Latest Ethereum Withdrawal? When an entity like Abraxas Capital , a sophisticated investment manager, decides to move such a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH) off centralized crypto exchanges , it sends ripples through the market. This isn’t a retail investor making a small transfer; it’s a strategic maneuver by a professional fund. Historically, large-scale withdrawals from exchanges are viewed as a bullish indicator because they typically reduce the immediate selling pressure on the asset. If ETH is sitting in an exchange wallet, it’s readily available to be sold. When it moves to cold storage or private wallets, it suggests the holder has no immediate plans to liquidate. For Abraxas Capital , this latest Ethereum withdrawal builds upon a pattern. While specific details of their portfolio strategy remain private, such actions often point to a conviction in the asset’s future price appreciation. It implies they are not looking to trade short-term fluctuations but rather accumulate and hold for a significant period, anticipating growth. This kind of move can be seen as a vote of confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem, its ongoing development (like the Dencun upgrade and future scalability improvements), and its fundamental value proposition as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. Consider the immediate implications: Reduced Supply on Exchanges: Less ETH available for immediate sale, potentially leading to upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Strategic Accumulation: Indicates a belief in Ethereum’s long-term value, moving beyond speculative trading. Security Focus: Moving funds off exchanges into private, self-custodied wallets enhances security, mitigating risks associated with exchange hacks or regulatory uncertainties. The Significance of Institutional ETH Movements from Crypto Exchanges The involvement of institutional players like Abraxas Capital in the crypto space, particularly their strategic movements of assets like institutional ETH , is a game-changer. For years, the crypto market was primarily driven by retail investors. However, as the asset class matures, more traditional financial institutions are entering, bringing with them significant capital, sophisticated strategies, and a different risk appetite. Their moves are closely watched because they often reflect a deeper analysis of market fundamentals and long-term trends. When large amounts of institutional ETH are pulled from crypto exchanges , it sends a clear message: smart money is accumulating. This trend is not isolated to Abraxas Capital. We’ve seen similar patterns from other funds, signaling a growing comfort level and strategic commitment to digital assets. This institutional embrace lends legitimacy to the crypto market, potentially attracting even more mainstream investment and reducing its perceived volatility. Let’s look at the broader picture: Aspect Implication of Institutional Withdrawals Market Liquidity Decreases available supply on exchanges, potentially tightening liquidity for large sell orders. Price Discovery Suggests strong conviction, which can support price floors and contribute to upward momentum. Market Maturity Indicates growing institutional acceptance and integration of crypto into traditional portfolios. Investor Confidence Boosts confidence among retail investors, who often look to institutional movements for cues. The flow of institutional ETH off crypto exchanges isn’t just about supply and demand; it’s about the evolving narrative of cryptocurrency as a legitimate and valuable asset class for serious investors. Why Long-Term Holding Matters: A Deeper Dive The concept of long-term holding , often referred to as “HODLing” in crypto parlance, is a core strategy for many investors, but it carries particular weight when adopted by institutions. For Abraxas Capital to commit $81 million to this strategy for Ethereum signifies a belief that ETH’s intrinsic value will appreciate significantly over an extended period, outweighing short-term market fluctuations. Why is long-term holding such a powerful strategy, especially for an asset like Ethereum? Mitigating Volatility: Crypto markets are notoriously volatile. By holding long-term, investors aim to ride out the inevitable dips and corrections, focusing on the asset’s overall growth trajectory. Capitalizing on Fundamental Growth: Ethereum is not just a digital currency; it’s a decentralized computing platform with a vast ecosystem of dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFTs. Long-term holding allows investors to benefit from the network’s continuous development, adoption, and utility growth. Reduced Transaction Costs & Taxes: Frequent trading incurs transaction fees and can lead to more complex tax implications. A buy-and-hold strategy simplifies both. Conviction in the Asset’s Future: It signals strong conviction in Ethereum’s role in the future of finance and technology. This isn’t speculative gambling; it’s a calculated bet on a foundational technology. However, long-term holding isn’t without its challenges. It requires patience, conviction, and the ability to withstand significant paper losses during bear markets. It also necessitates a deep understanding of the asset’s fundamentals and a belief in its ability to adapt and thrive in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. For institutions, this strategy is often backed by extensive research, risk management frameworks, and a clear investment thesis. Challenges and Opportunities in the Wake of Large-Scale Ethereum Withdrawals While a large-scale Ethereum withdrawal like the one executed by Abraxas Capital is generally seen as bullish, it’s important to consider both the challenges and opportunities it presents for the broader market and individual investors. The immediate impact might be positive sentiment, but the long-term ramifications can be complex. Challenges: Reduced Liquidity: If too much ETH moves off exchanges, it could lead to thinner order books, making large buy or sell orders more difficult to execute without significant price impact. Increased Centralization Risk (paradoxically): While self-custody reduces exchange risk, if a few large institutions hold a disproportionate amount of ETH, it could raise concerns about whale influence on market dynamics, although Ethereum’s decentralized nature mitigates this somewhat. Market Volatility: While long-term holding aims to reduce individual exposure to volatility, a sudden large withdrawal can still trigger short-term price movements as the market reacts to the news. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional activity often attracts more attention from regulators, which can introduce new uncertainties for the market. Opportunities: Price Appreciation: The most direct opportunity is potential price appreciation due to reduced supply and increased institutional demand. Validation of Asset Class: Each major institutional move further validates cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class, attracting more diverse investors and capital. Ecosystem Growth: Institutional confidence in Ethereum often translates into more investment in its underlying ecosystem, fostering innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications. Educational Moments: Such events provide valuable learning opportunities for retail investors to understand institutional strategies and market signals. For investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial. A large Ethereum withdrawal can be a signal to reassess one’s own portfolio strategy, potentially aligning more with a long-term perspective if the fundamentals align with their own research. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Institutional Crypto Landscape The actions of institutional giants like Abraxas Capital provide valuable insights, but how can individual investors translate this into actionable strategies? It’s not about blindly following; it’s about understanding the underlying rationale and applying it to your own investment framework. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While institutional moves are informative, they should supplement, not replace, your own due diligence. Understand Ethereum’s technology, its roadmap, its competitors, and its adoption rate. Understand Market Signals: Learn to interpret on-chain data and institutional flows. Withdrawals from crypto exchanges are generally bullish, while deposits can signal potential selling pressure. Consider a Long-Term Perspective: If you believe in the fundamental value of Ethereum, adopting a long-term holding strategy can help you ride out market cycles and potentially benefit from significant growth. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Ethereum is a strong asset, a diversified portfolio across different crypto sectors and traditional assets can help manage risk. Security First: If you plan for long-term holding , learn about self-custody solutions like hardware wallets to protect your assets from exchange-related risks. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and analysts to stay updated on major institutional moves, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. The increasing presence of institutions in the crypto space is a testament to its growing maturity and potential. By understanding their strategies and the signals they send, investors can better navigate this exciting yet complex landscape. Abraxas Capital’s substantial Ethereum withdrawal of $81 million from leading crypto exchanges is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful statement of conviction in Ethereum’s enduring value and future potential. This move underscores a broader trend of institutional adoption and a strategic shift towards long-term holding of digital assets. As more sophisticated players enter the market, their actions provide crucial insights into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment. For both seasoned and new investors, understanding these institutional flows is key to deciphering market sentiment and making informed decisions in the dynamic world of digital finance. The signal is clear: major players are not just dabbling; they are deeply committing to the future of decentralized technology.

However, while Ripple has seen a lot of positives, XRP has continued to struggle when it comes to price. Amid the selling, bulls have put up an impressive fight to hold the support above $2.2 for the time being. This has led to the formation of a new inverse head and shoulders pattern that could signal a reversal is coming. Analyst Highlights Bullish Formation For XRP Price Crypto analyst TheSignalyst, in a new analysis, showed that the XRP price has begun another bullish formation. This time around, it is the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern that often precedes a surge for an asset. Not only has this formation come at a critical junction, it happened while bulls have maintained strong support levels. Related Reading: Altcoins Reclaim Trendline That Led To 2021 Explosion, Will History Repeat Itself? Through the market downtrend, the XRP price has been able to hold above $1.75 and $2, which the analyst points out as a major level. The return to this support level has brought a fresh wave of bullishness, and the XRP price could be ready for another uptrend from here. Presently, all eyes are on this support level, and TheSignalyst revealed that if XRP is able to hold this level, then the rally could be in motion. They point to the green neckline, which is shown in the chart as sitting just above $2.3, and this is the resistance that needs to be broken for the price to rally in the short term. For the long term, the analyst suggests that a clean break above the $2.66 level is needed. This is what would provide confirmation for a bullish continuation. If the setup holds, then the analyst puts the top of formation as high as $3.3 in the long term. Analysts Predict Higher Prices The calls for higher prices for XRP have grown louder, especially as investors have begun to make their bets once again. Analyst Crypto Virtuos pointed out that the XRP trading volume saw a notable uptick of 125% in a 24-hour period as interest ballooned once again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $92,000 Or New ATHs? Analyst Explains The 2 Options Amid this rise in momentum, the crypto analyst, just like TheSignalyst, also explained that $2.3 is the hurdle that is holding the XRP price back now. Therefore, the cryptocurrency does need to overtake this level if it is to see a continuation of the uptrend. At the time of writing, the XRP price is still trending below $2.3, with sellers showing signs of exhaustion. Once the selling stops, then the bulls could trigger another upward wave to retest the resistance at $2.3 once again.

Yes, according to a Bloomberg report, Ant’s international arm is partnering with Circle to bring the popular stablecoin onto its blockchain platform. The move reflects a broader shift for the Chinese fintech giant, which is now focused on regulated digital assets and cross-border payments. The integration will begin once USDC clears U.S. compliance requirements. A timeline hasn’t been announced yet, but the partnership is already drawing attention. Circle shares rose 3.8% in pre-market trading following the news. A Big Win for Circle For Circle, this deal adds another major name to its growing list of global partners. It comes just days after the company announced a new integration with OKX, one of the world’s largest exchanges, giving over 60 million users easier access to USDC across 12 different blockchains. Circle has been pushing hard to expand its stablecoin in regulated markets, especially after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act – the first major bill focused on stablecoin regulation.

With Ant Group on board, Circle’s push into Asia is getting a serious boost. Ant’s New Global Game Plan This is a strategic step for Ant, whose global unit, Ant International, is being groomed for a spinoff and future IPO. In 2024, the division brought in nearly $3 billion in revenue, and analysts estimate a potential IPO valuation between $8 billion and $24 billion. Now, the company is actively preparing to apply for stablecoin licenses in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg. After years of regulatory pressure in China and the suspension of its 2020 IPO, Ant is rebuilding – this time with a focus on digital currencies, tokenized bank deposits, and central bank digital currencies. Why Circle Is Betting on Regulation USDC may still be smaller than Tether in market cap, but Circle is betting on regulation. While Tether faces ongoing scrutiny in Europe and Asia, Circle is leaning into compliance and forming partnerships that open up new markets. The stablecoin race is heating up and this is an interesting move for sure.",News,EN,0,0,USDC|BLOCKCHAIN|ASIA|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 09:36:35

Now, imagine that bet paying off in a truly spectacular fashion. This isn’t a fantasy; it’s the compelling reality unfolding in El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele recently unveiled an astounding nearly $400 million in unrealized profit from the country’s El Salvador Bitcoin holdings. This revelation isn’t just a headline; it’s a testament to a bold vision and a fascinating journey that continues to capture the world’s attention. Are you ready to dive into the story of how a small Central American nation is reshaping its financial destiny with Bitcoin? A Bold Vision Pays Off: The Astounding Bitcoin Profit President Nayib Bukele, a figure synonymous with El Salvador’s pioneering embrace of Bitcoin, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a screenshot that sent ripples across the global financial landscape. The image proudly displayed an unrealized profit nearing $400 million from the nation’s substantial Bitcoin profit portfolio. As of the announcement, El Salvador held a remarkable 6,233.18 BTC, a digital treasure chest valued at approximately $692 million. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the vindication of a highly unconventional economic policy that faced widespread skepticism. But what exactly does “unrealized profit” mean? In simple terms, it refers to the gain in value of an investment that has not yet been sold. While the funds aren’t liquid cash in hand, they represent a significant increase in the original investment’s worth. For El Salvador, this signifies a powerful validation of their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s potential. It’s a clear signal that their strategic accumulation, often during market dips, has yielded substantial returns. El Salvador’s Pioneering Journey: How Did They Get Here? The story of El Salvador Bitcoin adoption began in September 2021, when the nation made history by becoming the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. This audacious move, spearheaded by President Bukele, was met with a mix of excitement from crypto enthusiasts and grave warnings from international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Critics predicted economic instability, financial risk, and potential money laundering issues. Yet, El Salvador pressed on, driven by a vision of financial inclusion, reduced remittance fees for its citizens living abroad, and increased tourism and foreign investment. The government embarked on a strategy of accumulating Bitcoin, often buying the dip during periods of market downturn. This dollar-cost averaging approach, a common strategy among long-term investors, has evidently paid dividends. Their initial purchases were made at various price points, and while the exact average cost isn’t publicly disclosed, the current valuation clearly indicates a significant positive swing. Key Milestones in El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey: September 2021: Bitcoin officially becomes legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Chivo Wallet Launch: A government-backed digital wallet introduced to facilitate Bitcoin transactions and adoption. Bitcoin City Concept: Plans announced for a tax-free “Bitcoin City” powered by geothermal energy from a volcano, funded by “Volcano Bonds.” Strategic Accumulation: Consistent purchases of Bitcoin, often during market corrections, demonstrating a long-term investment philosophy. The “Nayib Bukele Bitcoin” Effect: Leadership and Conviction At the heart of El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment lies President Nayib Bukele. His charismatic and often unconventional leadership style has been instrumental in driving this bold policy. The “ Nayib Bukele Bitcoin ” strategy isn’t just about economic policy; it’s deeply intertwined with his personal conviction in the cryptocurrency’s transformative power. He has frequently used social media to announce Bitcoin purchases, celebrate price rallies, and engage directly with the global crypto community. This direct communication and unwavering belief have fostered a unique narrative around El Salvador’s journey. Bukele’s approach has been characterized by: Unwavering Conviction: Despite significant external pressure and internal skepticism, Bukele has consistently defended and promoted the Bitcoin initiative. Transparency (to an extent): While specific investment details remain private, Bukele’s public announcements of purchases and now, profits, have kept the world informed. Strategic Timing: The decision to buy during market downturns, often when fear was high, showcases a shrewd understanding of long-term market cycles. This leadership has not only put El Salvador on the global financial map but has also ignited debates about national sovereignty in monetary policy and the future of traditional finance. Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Impact of El Salvador Crypto The profit announcement is certainly impressive, but the impact of El Salvador Crypto adoption extends far beyond just the balance sheet. For ordinary Salvadorans, the journey has been one of adaptation and, for many, newfound financial access. The Chivo wallet, despite its initial teething problems, has facilitated remittances, allowing citizens to receive funds from abroad instantly and without hefty fees. This is a significant benefit for a country heavily reliant on remittances. Moreover, the Bitcoin initiative has positioned El Salvador as a hub for innovation and a destination for crypto enthusiasts and investors. Conferences, blockchain developers, and digital nomads are increasingly looking towards the Central American nation. This influx of interest, while still nascent, holds the potential for long-term economic diversification and growth, moving beyond traditional industries. Potential Benefits of National Crypto Adoption: Financial Inclusion: Providing banking services to the unbanked population. Reduced Remittance Costs: Saving millions annually for families receiving money from abroad. Increased Tourism & Investment: Attracting crypto-savvy individuals and businesses. Technological Innovation: Fostering a local blockchain and tech ecosystem. Monetary Sovereignty: Less reliance on traditional financial systems and foreign currencies. Navigating the Volatility: The National Bitcoin Strategy Moving Forward While the current news celebrates significant Bitcoin profit , it’s crucial to remember that the path has not been without its challenges. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have experienced significant dips, particularly during the 2022 bear market. At one point, the country’s portfolio was reportedly underwater, leading to renewed criticism and doubts. This latest announcement, however, underscores the importance of a long-term perspective and a robust national Bitcoin strategy . It highlights that short-term price fluctuations, while nerve-wracking, do not necessarily dictate the ultimate success or failure of a long-term investment. El Salvador’s commitment to holding its Bitcoin, rather than panic selling during downturns, has proven to be a key factor in reaching this profitable milestone. What does this mean for the future of El Salvador’s pioneering economic model? Continued Accumulation? It’s likely El Salvador will continue its dollar-cost averaging strategy, perhaps even accelerating purchases during future dips. Volcano Bonds: The successful realization of profits could bolster confidence in the planned “Volcano Bonds,” which aim to fund Bitcoin City. International Relations: The positive financial news might soften the stance of international financial bodies, or at least open new avenues for dialogue. Blueprint for Others? Other nations, particularly those in developing economies, will be watching El Salvador’s journey even more closely. Could this success story inspire similar initiatives? The true test of this national experiment will be its sustained impact on the lives of ordinary Salvadorans and its ability to weather future market cycles. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from El Salvador’s Triumph? El Salvador’s experience offers valuable lessons, not just for governments, but for individual investors and anyone interested in the future of finance. The core takeaways from this remarkable display of Bitcoin profit include: For Governments and Policymakers: Vision and Conviction: Pioneering new financial models requires strong leadership and a clear, unwavering vision, even in the face of significant opposition. Long-Term Perspective: Embracing volatile assets like Bitcoin necessitates a strategy that looks beyond short-term fluctuations and focuses on long-term growth potential. Financial Inclusion as a Driver: Leveraging new technologies to address existing socio-economic challenges can yield unexpected benefits. For Individual Investors: Dollar-Cost Averaging: El Salvador’s success reinforces the power of consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of price, to mitigate volatility. Holding Through Volatility: Panic selling during bear markets often leads to missed opportunities. Conviction and patience can be richly rewarded. Research and Understanding: Before making significant investments, especially in nascent asset classes, thorough research is paramount. A Resounding Success Story: El Salvador’s Bitcoin Legacy The announcement of nearly $400 million in unrealized profit from El Salvador Bitcoin holdings is more than just a financial update; it’s a powerful narrative of courage, conviction, and a pioneering spirit. President Nayib Bukele’s audacious gamble has, for now, paid off handsomely, offering a compelling counter-narrative to the skepticism that initially surrounded El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender. This success story not only vindicates their unique national Bitcoin strategy but also provides a fascinating case study for nations worldwide grappling with economic challenges and exploring innovative solutions. As the world continues to watch, El Salvador stands as a beacon of what’s possible when a nation dares to chart its own course in the evolving landscape of global finance. The journey is far from over, and future challenges will undoubtedly arise, but for now, El Salvador can celebrate a significant and truly remarkable milestone in its Bitcoin adventure.

The recent rally arrives after PENGU managed to outperform other assets in Q2, driven by increased demand on South Korean markets. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) was the top performer even during a day when the whole crypto market turned green. The near-vertical daily spike followed a gradual climb for the whole of Q2, as PENGU recovered from its lows. PENGU expanded to a three-month peak, with a vertical climb in the past day. | Source: Coingecko PENGU rallied by 27.2% in the past 24 hours, returning to $0.019, its highest price in three months. The asset started Q2 closer to $0.004, achieving over 400% growth. The short-term strength of PENGU also surprised traders, leading to around $2.8M in short liquidations for the past few hours. The rally also sparks hopes of PENGU returning as a leading meme asset and a community-based token. The recent rally follows the addition of PENGU to one of the upcoming ETF , currently in the process of approval. PENGU was picked as one of the few meme tokens to create the basis for an ETF. The latest rally coincided with a statement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, acknowledging the Canary Capital filing for a PENGU ETF. The success of the token did not help the underlying NFT collection, which retained a relatively low floor price of 9.38 ETH. The Pudgy Penguins community is still relatively active, adding to the hype for the token and setting up bullish expectations of a hike to $1. PENGU boosted by KRW trading Since June, PENGU has seen increasing volumes against the South Korean won. The fiat currency is the second biggest source of liquidity for PENGU, creating a trading anomaly.

The collection, powered by the TON blockchain, featured around 996,000 NFTs “inspired by Snoop’s iconic style” and generated $12 million in sales, according to Telegram founder Pavel Durov. “Blockchain minting and the secondary market go live in 21 days. It’s going to be wild,” Durov shared on X, hinting at further activity and trading to follow. The collection featured a variety of digital items, including vintage cars, swag bags, marijuana-themed objects, and digital dogs. These Telegram Gifts are animated images users can display on their profiles or convert into Telegram’s in-app currency, Stars. The launch also included a new track titled “Gifts” and a music video from Snoop Dogg, showcasing the full lineup of collectibles. A Glimmer of Hope for the NFT Market Snoop Dogg’s successful drop arrives at a time when the NFT market has been experiencing a notable slowdown . Data from CryptoSlam shows NFT sales volumes dropped 61% in the first quarter of 2025 to $1.5 billion, compared to $4.1 billion a year earlier. Over the past 30 days, sales have fallen another 41% to $403 million, with transactions also declining by more than 55%. Despite these figures, social media platforms were quick to celebrate the collection’s success, with many calling it “legendary” and a bullish signal for the NFT market . An X user, Zenith, who leads NFT projects at TON, suggested that the positive reception to Snoop’s collection could mark “the start of a new NFT narrative,” although they also acknowledged it may not fundamentally change the market’s direction. Zenith highlighted that Telegram Gifts’ unique feature is allowing owners to wear them on their profiles, a utility that could attract other Web3 brands and IPs to explore similar launches on the platform. Snoop Dogg Continues His NFT Presence Snoop Dogg is no stranger to NFTs , having actively participated in the space since 2021. In June 2023, he launched the Snoop Dogg Passport Series, an NFT collection offering holders exclusive behind-the-scenes content. Earlier, in February 2022, he released the Doggies NFT collection in collaboration with The Sandbox metaverse, expanding his creative ventures into the digital asset landscape. As Snoop Dogg’s latest collection demonstrates, mainstream personalities continue to hold the potential to inject energy into the NFT space , even amid a broader market cooldown, offering a glimpse of possible rejuvenation within the sector.

This explosive rally comes amid growing global interest in promising altcoins and highlights the immense influence of South Korean exchanges in shaping digital asset trends. The Upbit and Bithumb listing On July 10, 2025, both Upbit and Bithumb made back-to-back announcements confirming the listing of Hyperlane (HYPER) on their platforms. Upbit announced it will list HYPER cryptocurrency on its Korean Won (KRW) trading market, and Bithumb mirrored the move with its own KRW listing , fueling intense buying pressure across the region. Upbit also revealed that trading for HYPER would begin at 17:00 KST, with deposits available via the Ethereum network only, cautioning users against using unsupported networks. These dual listings mark a significant development for HYPER, which had previously been available only in BTC and USDT trading pairs on Upbit since late May. Now that the asset is paired directly with KRW on both exchanges, local investors have greater accessibility, which naturally boosts liquidity and demand. Hyperlane (HYPER) price jump comes with a volatility surge Hyperlane’s price reacted sharply and almost instantly following the exchange listings, soaring from $0.151 to a peak of $0.348, representing a dramatic 130% gain. Although some price correction followed, Hyperlane (HYPER) still maintained a triple-digit rise, stabilising near $0.31 at the time of writing with a 102.59% net increase. This rally wasn’t driven by speculation alone, as the token’s core use case — blockchain interoperability and decentralised governance — resonated strongly with a market hungry for utility-based assets. At the same time, Upbit reminded investors of the risks involved, implementing brief trading restrictions including a five-minute buy order delay and a limit order-only policy for the first two hours. Despite these safety checks, trading volume surged to over $293 million in just 24 hours, signalling strong confidence from both retail and institutional players. Hyperlane fundamentals back the bullish momentum Beyond its recent price surge, Hyperlane’s fundamentals remain solid, offering staking and governance features for users across Ethereum-compatible chains. Its circulating supply currently stands at 175.2 million tokens, with a total supply capped at 1 billion, indicating plenty of room for future allocation without immediate dilution. The fully diluted valuation now sits at $208 million, while the project’s market cap hovers around $45 million, suggesting that investors may still see room for growth. Furthermore, the asset’s all-time low of $0.0874, recorded just 18 days prior, highlights how rapidly sentiment has shifted following the South Korean listings. For traders and investors, the Hyperlane listing underscores the critical role that regional exchanges play in driving market momentum and exposure. While short-term volatility may persist, the strong fundamentals and early adoption of HYPER position it as a project worth watching. With additional listings or feature rollouts likely on the horizon, investors will be closely monitoring whether HYPER can maintain its momentum or spark the next big altcoin wave.

Weiwei Ji, a Singaporean tax resident, has filed an objection in Delaware Bankruptcy Court against FTX’s latest plan, representing over 300 Chinese creditors. He argues that he was unfairly labeled a “Chinese creditor” by FTX based solely on his passport, despite living in Singapore. USD Payouts Are Legal The objection notes that FTX is paying in U.S. dollars, which is legal, and crypto payouts are allowed in China as digital assets are treated as personal property. Ji says that his family has four verified FTX accounts, with claims worth over $15 million. He argues that despite meeting all the requirements, the proposed plans put their payouts at risk in an unfair way. “We have fully complied with every procedural requirement under the plan. The proposed motion now jeopardizes our right to distribution in an arbitrary and inequitable manner,” he said. This comes after the FTX Estate, on July 2, asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware to pause payouts to people in 49 countries with unclear or strict crypto laws. Notably, China makes up 82% of the total claims. FTX Claim Distribution Restricted Jurisdictions: $470m Chinese are the largest holder of FTX claims: $380m (82% of restricted) KYC not completed- Bahamas: $290m Disputed -multiple claims: $660m Total – awaiting solution: $1.4bn Total Estimated Allowed claims: $11bn pic.twitter.com/3BKpIkA3PW — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) July 7, 2025 Along with China, the list includes countries like Russia, Egypt, Afghanistan, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, Ukraine, and Moldova. The FTX creditor trust says sending money to these regions could break local laws and lead to legal trouble, putting funds for other creditors at risk. This freeze impacts 5% of all approved claims. To resolve the issue, FTX has asked a U.S. court for permission to hire local lawyers to check if payments can legally go through. Local experts will check if payouts are legally allowed. If not, the claims may be canceled and returned to the trust. Chinese Creditors Call For Fairness Ji argued that labeling China as a restricted jurisdiction has no legal basis. He explained that payouts can still happen through Hong Kong and pointed to the Celsius case as an example. While China bans crypto trading, digital assets are still legal property, and Hong Kong is becoming more crypto-friendly. He also urged the court to reject the proposed restrictions, saying that there is no legal risk in paying Chinese creditors and it’s a part of the bankruptcy process. Over 500 Chinese creditors are challenging FTX’s request to delay the payouta. Individuals object that FTX is breaking earlier promises and unfairly targeting creditors based on nationality. They argue that this is not just about money, but its about fairness, trust, and being treated equally.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 09:44:59

Tokens with strong narratives and real use cases are outperforming, especially in the meme and DeFi sectors. With institutional interest in crypto rebounding and Bitcoin consolidating above $100K, retail capital is rotating toward altcoins that can deliver engagement and innovation. FloppyPEPE , Trump Token, and HyperLiquid exemplify this new trend. Each offers a different flavor—political virality, meme-fi utility, and DeFi efficiency—capturing various segments of a rapidly evolving market. Let’s dive into what makes them key tokens this month. Trump Token: Riding Political Momentum Trump Token has surged again amid renewed attention on Trump’s pro-crypto policies and ongoing campaign influence. Political narratives continue to be a powerful force in crypto, and this token thrives on controversy and attention. Recent activity on X and Telegram shows a wave of new holders joining post-policy speeches. Analysts see Trump Token as a high-risk, high-reward trade during election cycles. Its volatility is a draw for speculative traders chasing news-driven pumps. The coin’s popularity reflects how narrative coins are staging a comeback in 2025. FloppyPEPE Hits $2.7M Milestone in Presale FloppyPEPE (FPPE) is gaining investor momentum with a presale raise of over $2.7 million. Its meme-fi edge is powered by actual tools like FloppyAI and Meme-o-matic . This makes FPPE more than just a hype coin—it’s a meme productivity platform. The FLOPPY100 code boosts token bonuses for early buyers, adding gamified investment incentives. Its roadmap includes staking, governance, and a gasless exchange called FloppyX. FPPE is increasingly being viewed as the evolution of meme tokens into meme-fi. HyperLiquid: Zero-Gas DeFi Trading Grows HyperLiquid is redefining the DEX experience with zero-gas trading and institutional-grade infrastructure. Its new LayerZero integration enhances cross-chain swaps, and liquidity pools are growing. DeFi veterans are taking notice of this quiet but powerful protocol. Compared to other DEXes, HyperLiquid focuses on speed, analytics, and deep liquidity. It’s now onboarding pro traders and aggregators from centralized exchanges. As gas costs remain a barrier elsewhere, HyperLiquid’s zero-gas edge is proving valuable. Altcoin Comparison: Narrative vs Utility vs Infrastructure Token Sector Core Strength 2025 Momentum Risk Profile Notable Features Trump Token Narrative Political virality High during campaigns High Community-driven, media-powered FloppyPEPE Meme-Fi Creator tools Presale surge Moderate FloppyAI, Meme-o-matic, FloppyX HyperLiquid DeFi Zero-gas trading Growing liquidity Low-Moderate LayerZero, pro-grade analytics This table highlights how each token serves a different role in the market. While Trump Token delivers fast-moving hype, FPPE and HyperLiquid are building out long-term frameworks. Capital Is Rotating: News to Utility Q2 and Q3 have shown a clear trend—while narrative coins like Trump Token attract spikes, utility tokens like FPPE and HyperLiquid are sustaining growth. Traders are rotating from quick pump coins to tokens with ecosystem depth. This rotation suggests maturity in market behavior. With meme-fi and DeFi tools gaining favor, coins that build beyond speculation are getting rewarded. FPPE’s creator tools and HyperLiquid’s trading stack represent this evolution. Why FloppyPEPE May Outlast the Cycle FloppyPEPE isn’t just a meme coin—it’s emerging as the meme-fi blueprint.

Currently trading at $2.40, XRP is up 5% over the past day and has recorded 7% gain over the last week. Over the past year, however, XRP has risen over 440%, demonstrating its long-term potential. This article focuses on a scenario where XRP grows steadily at a rate of 2% per month through 2035, exploring what that trajectory could mean for its valuation over the next decade. Ripple has made notable progress recently, which many believe could eventually support higher XRP prices. The company announced the conclusion of its long-running lawsuit and revealed plans to obtain a U.S. banking license and a Federal Reserve master account. Despite this progress, XRP’s price has yet to reflect these advancements in a meaningful way. Some analysts argue that the market may still be adjusting to the implications of these developments. Projected XRP Price with 2% Monthly Growth Assuming XRP’s current price of $2.4 grows by 2% every month, the next twelve months would see the coin gradually rise to about $2.95 by mid-2026. In the short term, such steady growth appears modest. However, compounding over time significantly increases the valuation. By the end of 2025, XRP could be trading at around $2.6 under this scenario. Looking further ahead, consistent 2% monthly gains would push XRP to approximately $7.50 by 2030, surpassing its previous all-time highs. At that level, XRP’s market capitalization would be close to $500 billion, with its fully diluted valuation nearing $1 trillion. Continuing this growth trend, XRP could reach about $24.37 by 2035. At that price point, its market cap would approach $1.5 trillion, positioning it among the world’s most valuable companies, such as Broadcom, TSMC, and Berkshire Hathaway. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Alternative Forecasts Suggest Higher Prices Are Possible Although a 2% monthly increase offers a plausible path to significant gains by 2035, some market participants anticipate a much faster appreciation. Many in the XRP community argue that the token could surpass $24 well before 2035, with some predictions placing it above $30 as early as 2025. External forecasts also point to even higher valuations. According to Telegaon , XRP could reach as high as $87 by 2035. Likewise, Changelly projects XRP may hit $92.88 by December 2034, suggesting that its 2035 price could exceed even that figure. These forecasts reflect expectations of a more accelerated growth trajectory than the steady 2% monthly increase analyzed in this article. Outlook and Considerations While XRP’s recent price action has been subdued despite Ripple’s strategic progress, long-term projections based on consistent growth highlight its potential for significant appreciation. A sustained monthly gain of 2% through 2035 would place XRP at levels that make it one of the largest assets in the global financial landscape. At the same time, more optimistic forecasts from industry sources point to the possibility of even greater gains if market conditions and adoption trends accelerate beyond the steady pace modeled here. By considering both the conservative and more aggressive scenarios, investors and observers can better appreciate the range of potential outcomes for XRP over the coming decade.

In a development that has sent ripples across the crypto community, the GMX hacker , responsible for a multi-million dollar exploit, has reportedly converted the vast majority of the pilfered assets into Ethereum (ETH). This strategic maneuver, first highlighted by on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, signals a likely rejection of GMX’s good-faith offer for a white-hat bounty, raising serious questions about the future of recovery efforts in the wake of DeFi exploits . The Audacious ETH Conversion: What Happened? In a move that underscores the brazen nature of the attack, the individual behind the GMX V1 pool exploit systematically liquidated the stolen crypto assets. The process, excluding a portion held in FRAX, saw the bulk of the illicit gains transformed into a substantial amount of ETH. This conversion isn’t just a technical step; it’s a statement. Asset Conversion: Most of the assets, excluding 10.495 million FRAX, were converted. ETH Accumulation: A staggering 11,700 ETH, valued at approximately $32.33 million, was amassed. Wallet Distribution: These funds were strategically distributed across four distinct wallets, complicating tracking efforts. Total Holdings: Including the FRAX, the hacker now controls a formidable $42.8 million spread across five wallets. This ETH conversion makes the funds significantly more liquid and potentially harder to trace or freeze, a common tactic employed by those looking to evade recovery attempts. The distribution across multiple wallets further suggests a sophisticated understanding of on-chain forensics and an attempt to obfuscate the trail. Why Did the GMX Hacker Snub the Bounty Offer? The decision by the GMX hacker to proceed with the conversion and distribution of funds strongly indicates a rejection of GMX’s 10% white-hat bounty offer. Such bounties are a common strategy in the DeFi space, designed to incentivize hackers to return stolen funds in exchange for a percentage, often framed as a ‘bug bounty’ or ‘ethical hacking’ reward. GMX’s offer was an attempt to mitigate losses and perhaps even learn from the exploit without resorting to prolonged legal battles or on-chain recovery efforts. The hacker’s snub could stem from several factors: Perceived Value: The 10% offer might have been deemed insufficient given the total value of the stolen assets. Anonymity Preference: Accepting a bounty often requires some form of communication or identification, which the hacker might want to avoid to maintain anonymity. Lack of Trust: The hacker might not trust GMX to honor the bounty or fear subsequent legal action even after returning funds. Criminal Intent: Simply put, the intent was to steal and retain the funds, not to act as a ‘white hat’ researcher. This rejection is a blow to the DeFi community’s efforts to foster a more cooperative environment for security breaches and highlights the ongoing challenges in recovering stolen crypto assets when perpetrators choose to remain uncooperative. Implications for Blockchain Security and DeFi Exploits This incident, like many before it, underscores the persistent vulnerabilities within the DeFi ecosystem and the critical need for robust blockchain security measures. While GMX is a prominent decentralized exchange, even established protocols are not immune to sophisticated attacks. The hacker’s ability to convert and distribute such a large sum without immediate intervention raises alarms about the effectiveness of current tracking and prevention mechanisms. The broader implications include: Trust Erosion: Each major exploit erodes user trust in DeFi platforms, potentially slowing mainstream adoption. Regulatory Scrutiny: Repeated incidents could invite stricter regulatory oversight, which might stifle innovation in the decentralized space. Enhanced Security Measures: Protocols are pushed to invest more heavily in audits, bug bounties, and real-time monitoring. On-Chain Forensics: The incident highlights the growing importance of advanced on-chain analysis tools and experts to track illicit funds. The nature of decentralized systems means that once funds are moved on-chain, their recovery often depends on the cooperation of centralized exchanges or service providers, which can freeze funds if they pass through their platforms. However, direct peer-to-peer transfers or conversions to highly liquid assets like ETH make this process incredibly challenging. What’s Next for the Stolen Crypto? With the ETH conversion complete and funds spread across multiple wallets, the immediate next steps for the hacker are likely to involve further attempts at obfuscation or ‘cashing out’ through various methods, including mixers, privacy coins, or smaller, less scrutinized exchanges. For GMX and the broader community, the focus will shift to continued tracking and potential collaboration with law enforcement or centralized entities to flag and freeze funds if they ever hit a centralized touchpoint. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between protocol developers and malicious actors. It emphasizes the need for continuous innovation in security, not just in preventing exploits but also in improving post-breach recovery strategies and fostering a more resilient DeFi landscape. Summary: A Bold Move in the Crypto Underbelly The GMX hacker’s calculated decision to convert millions in stolen crypto into ETH and spurn a white-hat bounty offer is a significant event in the ongoing narrative of DeFi exploits . It showcases the cunning of sophisticated attackers and poses a fresh challenge to the blockchain security paradigm. While the community grapples with the implications, this incident reinforces the critical need for vigilance, advanced security protocols, and robust recovery mechanisms to safeguard the integrity and trust in the decentralized finance ecosystem. The pursuit of these ill-gotten gains will undoubtedly continue, serving as a high-stakes lesson for all involved in the dynamic world of crypto.

But legendary trader Peter Brandt says the rally isn’t guaranteed just yet. While he’s still holding a long position on BTC, Brandt warns that a drop below $107,000 could flip the script entirely. This is something you want to know. Read on! Breakout Pattern Spotted but It’s Not Without Risk Brandt’s latest chart shows Bitcoin breaking out from an expanding triangle, also called a broadening wedge. This pattern is marked by a rising lower trendline and an upper line that doesn’t converge. Basically, the price swings are getting wider, and so is the risk. While the breakout is encouraging, Brandt points out that expanding triangles often fail. That means there’s still a chance this move turns into a fakeout if support doesn’t hold. There is nothing special about this chart. An expanding inverted triangle has a higher rate of morphing or mortality than a pattern such a horizontal pennant. Nevertheless I am long BTC.

Now that level has flipped into support – a solid win for the bulls. But Brandt says the real line in the sand is $107,000. If Bitcoin dips below that, the current bullish pattern could fall apart. In his words, it might “morph” into something else entirely, likely a more bearish setup that could lead to a sharp pullback. Targets Ahead: $120K and $134K If Bulls Stay in Control Despite the warning, Brandt still sees upside if support holds. Based on the pattern’s range, he’s watching for price targets around $120,958 and $134,886. He previously predicted Bitcoin could climb as high as $118,000 in the near term, and that scenario is still in play. Right now, Bitcoin is trading around $112,288, holding above key levels, but not in the clear just yet. Bottom Line With over five decades of trading experience, Brandt knows how quickly markets can flip. He’s still bullish, but the message is clear: $107K is the must-hold level for this rally to continue. If it holds, Bitcoin could be gearing up for another leg higher.

The hearing , which took place yesterday at 10:15 a.m. (ET), saw Garlinghouse and other crypto stakeholders, such as Summer Mersinger of the Blockchain Association and Dan Robinson of Paradigm, testify before Congress.For context, the hearing focused on market structure legislation, which aims to provide regulatory clarity and end the longstanding confusion over which tokens constitute securities or commodities.Garlinghouse RemarksDuring the hearing, Garlinghouse provided a comprehensive overview of Ripple's operations, XRP’s functions, and why U.S. lawmakers should enact clear legislation for the industry.Ripple’s OperationsHe began by introducing himself as the CEO of Ripple, a company with over 900 employees across 15 global offices. Garlinghouse emphasized that Ripple was launched over a decade ago with the aim of “enabling the internet of value, a world where money moves like information does today.”According to him, Ripple builds software products for custody, stablecoins, and cross-border payments. Through these products, Ripple has helped financial institutions serve their customers better by speeding up and lowering the cost of money transfers. “These are not abstract concepts. We work every day with banks that rely on our technology to deliver real results in the global economy,” Garlinghouse said.XRP FunctionalitiesNotably, Garlinghouse emphasized that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is the technology that powers Ripple’s software products. He stated that Ripple leverages the XRPL and its native token, XRP, for facilitating cross-border payments. He described XRP as a token designed to enable low-cost, fast, and highly scalable transactions.Ripple Compliance-First ApproachGarlinghouse also highlighted Ripple’s compliance-first approach, noting that the company has worked with global policymakers since day one.This commitment has led to Ripple obtaining over 60 licenses from regulators in the United States and abroad. These licenses cover various sectors, including payments, money transmission, and crypto operations.Core Principles of Smart LegislationAddressing the main topic of the hearing, Garlinghouse outlined what he considers the core principles of smart legislation.In his view, such legislation should focus on protecting consumers from scams and fraud, establishing proper market oversight, holding bad actors accountable, and fostering innovation.He believes that establishing a framework for digital assets and stablecoins that meets these objectives will broaden access to financial markets, generate jobs, strengthen the economy, and position the U.S. as a global leader in blockchain and cryptocurrency.Ripple Victimized By Lack of Clear RulesFurthermore, Garlinghouse reflected on how the lack of clear rules has hindered the U.S. crypto industry from making meaningful progress. He stated that Ripple experienced firsthand how regulatory uncertainty can be weaponized against good actors.He acknowledged that Ripple was the first leading U.S. crypto company to be sued by the SEC. The lawsuit, filed in December 2020, alleged that Ripple violated securities laws through its offering and sale of XRP.According to Garlinghouse, Ripple and other crypto companies understood that losing the lawsuit could have been a “death knell” for the U.S. crypto industry. This motivated Ripple to defend itself. After a four-year legal battle, Ripple “won in everything” that mattered. “Our victory cleared the path for other market participants to fight back,” he asserted.For context, a federal court ruled that XRP is not a security in itself. The court also found that XRP sales on digital exchanges did not constitute investment contracts. However, it determined that certain institutional sales did violate securities laws.Although both parties initially appealed the verdict, they have since agreed to drop the lawsuits and end the multi-year legal dispute.Notably, Garlinghouse said Ripple has been engaging with policymakers despite the headwinds to ensure the industry gets the much-needed clarity.Need for Smart LegislationFurthermore, the Ripple CEO emphasized the need for principled and smart legislation. He outlined three legislative priorities that Congress should consider when passing effective legislation.First, Garlinghouse recommended that Congress set clear jurisdictional boundaries for U.S. financial regulators, such as the CFTC and the SEC.Second, he opined that policymakers should prioritize establishing pathways for companies to build without compromising investor protections.Lastly, Garlinghouse said Congress should pass smart legislation that guarantees America's leadership in the crypto sector. He suggested that the U.S. could establish its leadership by leveraging the benefits and efficiencies of digital assets.Why the US Deserves to be the Leader of CryptoWith over 55 Americans currently participating in the crypto economy, Garlinghouse stressed that the U.S. should be the undisputed leader of the industry.He stated that the U.S. is home to the deepest capital markets and a spirit of innovation that has driven the nation since its inception.He concluded by urging the Banking Committee and the full Senate to pass market structure legislation that would establish clear rules and solidify America’s leadership in the sector. “Once market structure legislation for digital assets becomes law in the U.S., it will catalyze a new era of U.S. competitiveness and unlock efficiencies in financial transactions—dramatically helping consumers and businesses alike,” he asserted.",Market|Latest Brad Garlinghouse News Insights|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|XRP|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-07-10 09:51:16

According to the press release sent to crypto.news, MemeScan is designed with pro-level traders in mind, offering performance and insight for traders interested in high-volume and early stage meme coins . The Bitget ( BGB ) Wallet platform is meant to accommodate mobile-first users who wish to trade on-chain without having to switch to a desktop or browser-adapted interface. Unlike platforms designed for desktops and browsers, MemeScan is a mobile-first app that offers a unified, app-native interface, allowing users to scan for tokens, assess risks and narratives, and trade instantly on one screen. Traders can filter through tokens by theme, market cap, launch stage, or price momentum. In addition, MemeScan also features one-tap execution and claims to have one of the lowest trading fees in the category. MemeScan offers millisecond-level K-line chart updates, AI -generated token summaries, among others. It also comes with a risk detection system that flags suspicious trading activity such as wallet concentration and developer movements in real-time. Pump.fun becomes the first meme coin launchpad to integrate itself with MemeScan. Therefore in anticipation for its highly-anticipated native token launch for PUMP , MemeScan has prepared a campaign tied to the TGE.

The campaign offers traders early access to the token event that it can trade using Bitget Wallet’s new meme coin-focused product. Aside from Pump.fun, Bitget Wallet has also begun integrating with the LetsBonkFun ecosystem. With the support for BonkFun, Bitget Wallet is able to provide traders with a dedicated list for BonkFun tokens. CMO of Bitget Wallet, Jamie Elkaleh, said that meme coins have become a key entry point for many traders in the crypto market. However, the space has yet to accommodate easy trading for meme coin enthusiasts through a mobile-first perspective. “We’re combining pro-level performance with mobile-first usability, giving traders the speed, insight, and execution power they need to act on opportunities anywhere, anytime. It’s the trading experience we believe mobile-first users have been waiting for,” said Elkaleh. The Solana ( SOL )-based meme coin launchpad Pump.fun plans to launch its official token, PUMP with an initial coin offering on July 12. The ICO will offer 15% of the total token supply, totaling 150 billion out of a 1 trillion maximum. Each PUMP token will be valued at an initial price of $0.004.

In 2027, it will range between $128.38 and $152.46, with an average price of $140.42. In 2031, it will range between $288.87 and $312.94, with an average price of $300.90. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

From a larger picture, the HYPE price increased to $41.89, gaining 6.47% of its total value in the last few hours as it is still trending near its ATH. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does not justify predicting a $50 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by June 2025. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2026. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $112.34. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $312.94, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading a bit lower than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $312.94 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved significantly during this period, reaching above $8 billion, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached an all-time high of $45.57 and is trading near the $40 range at the start of July.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ETH|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-10 10:00:00

On July 9, these investment vehicles recorded a substantial $214.5 million in total net inflows, marking an extraordinary fifth consecutive trading day of positive flows, according to insights shared by Trader T on X. This sustained momentum signals a growing appetite among institutional and retail investors for regulated exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Driving the Surge in Spot Bitcoin ETFs ? The recent performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs highlights a critical shift in how investors are approaching the cryptocurrency market. Unlike futures-based ETFs, spot ETFs directly hold Bitcoin, offering a more direct and often preferred method for gaining exposure without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. The consistent inflows suggest a confluence of factors at play: Increased Institutional Confidence: Major financial players are becoming more comfortable with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of these ETFs by the SEC has provided a stamp of legitimacy, reducing perceived risks for traditional investors. Accessibility and Ease: Investing in Bitcoin through an ETF is as simple as buying a stock, making it accessible to a broader audience. Diversification Benefits: Investors are increasingly looking to digital assets as a way to diversify traditional portfolios. Breaking Down the Latest Crypto Inflows : Who’s Leading the Pack? The $214.5 million in net crypto inflows on July 9 was not evenly distributed, with several key players leading the charge. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) once again demonstrated its dominance, attracting the lion’s share of new capital. Here’s a snapshot of the leading performers for the day: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflows (USD) IBIT BlackRock $124.38 million ARKB ARK Invest / 21Shares $56.96 million BTC (mini) Grayscale $15.83 million BTCO Invesco $9.48 million FBTC Fidelity $4.84 million BITB Bitwise $3.01 million The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating a focused concentration of capital towards these top-performing funds, yet contributing to the overall positive sentiment. How is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Shaping the Market? The consistent inflows into institutional Bitcoin products are not just a daily statistic; they represent a fundamental shift in the market’s structure. As more large-scale investors allocate capital to Bitcoin via ETFs, several impacts become apparent: Increased Liquidity: Greater participation from institutions enhances market liquidity, potentially reducing volatility. Price Stability: While Bitcoin remains volatile, institutional presence can contribute to more stable price discovery over the long term. Mainstream Acceptance: The involvement of established financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity lends significant credibility to Bitcoin, paving the way for broader public acceptance. Evolving Investment Strategies: Fund managers are integrating Bitcoin into diversified portfolios, recognizing its unique characteristics as a store of value and growth asset. This trend suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond its niche as a speculative asset and cementing its place as a legitimate component of modern investment portfolios. What Does This Mean for Your Digital Asset Investment Strategy? For individuals and smaller investors, the sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs offer valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and future trends in digital asset investment . Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Institutional Activity: Large inflows often precede or accompany significant price movements. Keeping an eye on ETF data can provide a pulse on institutional sentiment. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin is a cornerstone, explore other digital assets that are gaining institutional traction or have strong fundamentals. Understand the Risks: Despite institutional adoption, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Always conduct thorough research and invest only what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: The consistent inflows suggest a long-term bullish outlook from significant players, encouraging a patient, long-term approach to digital asset holdings. This growing embrace by traditional finance signifies a maturation of the cryptocurrency market, opening new avenues for strategic digital asset investment. The Future Trajectory for Bitcoin ETFs The positive momentum seen in Bitcoin ETFs is expected to continue, albeit with potential fluctuations. As the market matures and more regulatory frameworks solidify, we might see even greater innovation in crypto-related financial products. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. could also pave the way for similar products in other major global markets, further expanding the reach of institutional Bitcoin investment. While challenges such as market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and global economic shifts will always be factors, the underlying trend points towards continued integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. In conclusion, the consistent and significant net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, culminating in five consecutive days of positive flows and $214.5 million on July 9, underscore a profound shift in the investment world. This trend reflects increasing institutional confidence, regulatory clarity, and a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a valuable asset. As major players like BlackRock and ARK Invest continue to attract substantial capital, the impact on market liquidity, stability, and mainstream adoption of digital assets is undeniable. This ongoing institutional embrace is not merely a fleeting trend but a testament to Bitcoin’s growing prominence in the global financial landscape, offering a compelling narrative for both seasoned and new investors.

A bullish engulfing candle and $407M in ETF inflows, led by Fidelity’s $183.96M, signal a potential 1.3x rally to $140K. However, a hotter-than-expected jobs report, adding 147,000 nonfarm jobs, reduced rate cut odds to 4.7%, with resistance at $110,900 risking a drop to $105K. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and a weakening U.S. dollar further bolster sentiment, but volatility from macroeconomic data persists. With markets now increasingly confident about a Federal Reserve rate cut this July, momentum is pouring into digital assets across the board. Analysts remain bullish on BTC, but many investors are beginning to explore newer opportunities—especially those with more room to grow. And that’s exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to attract serious attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) With over $12.00 million already raised and more than 68% of Phase 5 tokens sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining fast among early-stage DeFi plays. The current token price sits at $0.03, but Phase 6 is set to raise it to $0.035—around 20% increase that marks an important shift toward its $0.06 listing. In a market where timing matters, this is shaping up to be one of the most critical entry windows for retail and institutional players alike. What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from countless other altcoins is its focus on delivering real, usable DeFi mechanics—not just speculation. The platform is structured around two powerful lending engines: P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer). In the P2C model, users deposit well-known assets (e.g., ETH, AVAX, USDC, DAI) into decentralized smart-contract pools. Borrowers can then take out overcollateralized loans—typically up to 70% LTV on ETH, 60% on AVAX, and lower for volatility-sensitive assets—with dynamic interest rates adjusted based on how much of the pool is in use. Lenders receive mtTokens, which represent their share of the pool and automatically accrue interest over time. Meanwhile, for volatile or niche tokens like DOGE, PEPE, SHIBA, and other similar assets, the P2P model provides flexibility: lenders and borrowers negotiate custom terms directly—collateral, loan amount, interest rate, duration—outside of pooled funds. This strategy isolates riskier assets from the main pools while allowing risk-tolerant participants to seek higher returns. Both models maintain non-custodial architecture, require overcollateralization, and employ smart contracts to enforce terms and trigger liquidations as needed, preserving systemic safety. Security Backed by CertiK, Whales, and Smart Forecasts Security and transparency have become essential in decentralized finance—and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking both seriously. The team has partnered with CertiK, one of the most trusted blockchain auditing firms in the industry. Their $50,000 Bug Bounty Program is now live, with rewards distributed across four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. This proactive initiative signals to both developers and investors that safety is not just a checkbox—it’s a long-term priority. This trust-driven approach is already drawing attention from major crypto holders. In late June, a prominent Ethereum (ETH) whale moved $150,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), marking a clear shift from holding legacy assets into backing promising early-stage protocols. With over 13,000 current holders and rising, Mutuum is building a growing community of investors looking for scalable, yield-driven opportunities in DeFi. The market is also taking note. One respected crypto analyst—who accurately predicted Bitcoin (BTC)’s 2020 bull run—has now forecasted a post-listing price target of $0.70 for MUTM. That implies a 23x return from today’s price and highlights the momentum Mutuum is building ahead of its exchange debut. The team is also moving toward its beta launch, with a functional testnet experience expected to go live around the time the token lists. Coupled with a $100,000 giveaway and the platform’s integration with Layer-2 scaling, the user experience is being fine-tuned for lower costs, faster execution, and maximum access. As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its climb past $109K, long-term investors are now looking beyond the majors. In a market full of expensive bluechips, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one of the few protocols under $0.04 with a working product, institutional-grade audit backing, and real lending mechanics ready to launch. Phase 6 is just around the corner—and it’s not waiting for anyone.

Some believe XRP's season has now begun.However, with the renewed energy, we recently assessed how long it would take XRP to reach $100 if it grew 3% every month from here. To evaluate this, we ran a projection based on this steady monthly gain. XRP Journey Through a 3% Steady Monthly GrowthStarting at $2.42 in July 2025, XRP would rise gradually over time. By the end of this year, December 2025, the price would climb to about $2.81. Meanwhile, one year later in June 2026, XRP would reach $3.35. This might not sound like much at first glance, but compound growth builds up over time.Notably, month by month, XRP would continue pushing higher. If it sticks to the 3% pace, it will hit the $10 mark by July 2029. Two years later, by July 2031, it would climb to around $20. In May 2032, the price would break past $27. Then, in February 2034, it would cross the $50 level. Interestingly, several analysts and market pundits have persistently championed these targets, but the timelines vary. For instance, in May, analyst DK64Trades said he was confident XRP would breach $10 this cycle. Also, last November, CryptoBull suggested an XRP run to $20 is possible if it follows its 2017 fractal. Meanwhile, for the $27 price level, market watcher EGRAG has consistently suggested XRP is on track to reach the target. Further, Cryptominder projects that XRP may reach $50 over the next five years, in 2030.When Will XRP Finally Reach $100?Notably, the timelines presented by these analysts are more optimistic than what our assessment arrives it. According to our assessment, XRP would reach $100 by January 2036, ending a ten-and-a-half-year run from its current price. Overall, the entire journey would take 126 months for XRP to reach $100. However, this kind of smooth, uninterrupted climb doesn't show how XRP, or any crypto, for that matter, actually behaves. History shows a different pattern. Specifically, XRP has never managed to pull off long streaks of green months. Its best years, 2017 and 2023, only saw eight monthly gains each. Even then, those gains never came back-to-back for more than four months in a row. In most other years, XRP posted even fewer green months. XRP Monthly Performances Cryptorank XRP Monthly Performances | Cryptorank So far in 2025, it has split the year evenly with three positive and three negative months. That track record makes it clear: the crypto market rarely follows a neat pattern.Crypto prices don't grow on a set schedule. Notably, several forces will likely impact XRP price continuously without warning. So, expecting a steady 3% monthly climb for more than a decade doesn't line up with how the market works.Still, the idea of XRP reaching $100 dominates the community. Many investors believe it could get there, just not through slow and steady growth. They expect it to surge more quickly in response to major catalysts like adoption for payments.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-07-10 10:03:39

Bithumb , one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, has officially announced the upcoming listing of the HYPER/KRW spot trading pair. This highly anticipated move is set to open new avenues for investors and solidify Hyperlane’s presence in a key Asian market. The listing, scheduled for July 10 at 08:00 UTC, marks a pivotal moment for both the Hyperlane ecosystem and Korean crypto enthusiasts. Bithumb Unlocks New Potential: The HYPER/KRW Trading Pair Arrives The digital asset world is constantly evolving, and Bithumb continues to be at the forefront of innovation, especially within the highly regulated South Korean market. Their latest announcement regarding the HYPER/KRW spot trading pair is more than just another listing; it represents increased accessibility and liquidity for a promising cross-chain solution. For traders in South Korea, the ability to directly trade HYPER against the Korean Won (KRW) simplifies the investment process, removing the need for intermediary stablecoins or other fiat conversions. Here are the key details surrounding this significant launch: Exchange: Bithumb Trading Pair: HYPER/KRW Listing Date: July 10 Listing Time: 08:00 UTC Asset: HYPER (Native token of Hyperlane) This direct pairing on a major crypto exchange like Bithumb is crucial for market depth and price discovery. It signifies a strong vote of confidence in Hyperlane’s technology and its long-term potential. What is Hyperlane ? Diving into Cross-Chain Interoperability Before diving deeper into the implications of the Bithumb listing, it’s essential to understand the project behind the HYPER token: Hyperlane . In today’s fragmented blockchain ecosystem, different networks often operate in silos, making it challenging for applications and assets to move seamlessly between them. Hyperlane aims to solve this fundamental problem. Hyperlane is an interoperability layer designed to connect various blockchains, enabling secure and permissionless communication between them. Think of it as a universal messaging layer for the blockchain world. Its core mission is to empower developers to build truly interchain applications, allowing users to interact with dApps and transfer assets across multiple chains without friction. Key aspects of Hyperlane ‘s technology include: Modular Architecture: Hyperlane’s design is flexible, allowing it to adapt to different blockchain environments and security models. Permissionless Deployment: Anyone can deploy Hyperlane on their blockchain, fostering decentralization and broad adoption. Secure Messaging: It focuses on secure cross-chain message passing, which is vital for the integrity of interchain applications. Universal Application Layer: By abstracting away the complexities of cross-chain communication, Hyperlane enables developers to build powerful applications that span multiple ecosystems. The HYPER token is integral to the Hyperlane ecosystem, likely serving functions such as governance, network security, and potentially transaction fees within its framework. Its increasing availability on prominent exchanges like Bithumb is vital for its growth and adoption. Why Does a KRW Pair Matter? Accessibility for Korean Crypto Investors The addition of a direct KRW trading pair for HYPER on Bithumb holds immense significance, particularly for the vibrant South Korean crypto market. South Korea has a highly engaged and sophisticated crypto community, but regulatory hurdles often dictate which assets are easily accessible. A direct KRW pair means: Reduced Friction: Korean investors can directly deposit Korean Won and purchase HYPER, eliminating the need to first buy stablecoins like USDT or USDC, which can incur additional fees and conversion steps. Enhanced Liquidity: Direct fiat pairs typically bring greater liquidity to a trading pair, making it easier for both large and small orders to be filled without significant price slippage. Increased Market Exposure: Listing with a direct KRW pair on a top-tier crypto exchange like Bithumb exposes HYPER to a massive pool of potential investors who prefer or are limited to fiat-to-crypto gateways. Regulatory Compliance: Operating with direct KRW pairs requires stringent regulatory compliance in South Korea, indicating that HYPER has met Bithumb’s due diligence requirements, which can instill greater confidence among investors. For Hyperlane , this move significantly broadens its reach into one of Asia’s most active crypto economies, potentially leading to increased adoption and network participation from Korean users and developers. Navigating the Bithumb Crypto Exchange : Getting Ready for HYPER For those new to Bithumb or looking to trade HYPER once it goes live, understanding the basics of this prominent crypto exchange is key. Bithumb is known for its user-friendly interface, robust security measures, and a wide array of trading options. As a regulated entity in South Korea, it adheres to strict ‘real-name’ account policies, ensuring a secure trading environment. To prepare for the HYPER/KRW launch on July 10, consider these actionable steps: Account Verification: Ensure your Bithumb account is fully verified. This typically involves identity verification (KYC) and linking a bank account for KRW deposits and withdrawals. Fund Your Account: Deposit KRW into your Bithumb account well in advance of the listing time. This will allow you to react quickly once trading begins. Understand Trading Fees: Familiarize yourself with Bithumb ‘s trading fees for spot pairs. While generally competitive, knowing the fee structure helps in planning your trades. Research HYPER: Beyond this article, conduct your own thorough research into Hyperlane . Understand its whitepaper, roadmap, team, and community to make informed investment decisions. Risk Management: Crypto markets are volatile. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders once trading is active to manage potential downside. The platform’s intuitive design makes it relatively easy to navigate, whether you are a seasoned trader or just starting out. The availability of a direct KRW pair simplifies the entry point significantly. The Broader Impact: How This Listing Shapes the Crypto Exchange Landscape The decision by Bithumb to list HYPER/KRW is not just an isolated event; it sends ripples across the broader crypto exchange landscape and the interoperability narrative. Firstly, it highlights the growing recognition of cross-chain solutions as critical infrastructure for the future of Web3. As more chains emerge, the need for seamless communication between them becomes paramount, and projects like Hyperlane are at the forefront of this movement. Secondly, it underscores the strategic importance of regional fiat gateways. While global exchanges dominate in terms of volume, local exchanges with direct fiat pairs, especially in highly active markets like South Korea, play a crucial role in mainstream adoption. This listing could encourage other regional exchanges to consider similar interoperability tokens, expanding their offerings and catering to local demand. Finally, it reflects a maturing market where exchanges are increasingly vetting projects based on fundamental utility and technological innovation, rather than just hype. For Hyperlane , gaining a direct fiat listing on a major regulated crypto exchange like Bithumb adds a significant layer of legitimacy and trust, which is invaluable in attracting institutional interest and broader user adoption. Conclusion: A New Chapter for HYPER and Korean Crypto The impending launch of the HYPER/KRW spot trading pair on Bithumb on July 10 is undoubtedly a landmark event for the Hyperlane ecosystem and the South Korean crypto community. It provides direct, convenient access to a token powering essential cross-chain interoperability, enhancing liquidity and market exposure for HYPER . As Bithumb continues to expand its offerings, this listing reinforces its position as a key player in the global digital asset space, committed to bringing innovative projects to its user base. For investors, it represents a fresh opportunity to engage with a project at the cutting edge of blockchain technology, potentially unlocking new growth and possibilities within the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

Despite optimistic predictions from multiple analysts, technical indicators such as a near-overbought RSI suggest that the asset’s rally might face short-term resistance. Watch Out for This Level Several hours ago, bitcoin (BTC) made history by tapping a new all-time high price of over $112,000. One prominent figure in the crypto industry who has commented on the asset’s recent performance is Peter Brandt. The veteran trader spotted the formation of an expanding inverted triangle on BTC’s price chart, arguing that it has “a higher rate of morphing or mortality” than a pattern like the horizontal pennant. Nonetheless, Brandt remains long on the asset, setting short-term targets of $120,958 and $134,886. Investors, though, should be cautious because, according to the trader, a decline under $107,000 “would suggest morphology.” An expanding inverted triangle is a pattern where price fluctuations become wider over time, forming higher highs and lower lows in a megaphone shape. It’s generally considered bearish, as it signals market instability and could result in a breakdown. On the contrary, a horizontal pennant is a consolidation pattern where the asset’s valuation drifts sideways after a significant move. It’s usually viewed as a bullish signal, assuming it follows an upward trend. Brandt is known as a proponent of the primary cryptocurrency. Just a few weeks ago, he recommended that people make monthly investments and allocate 80% of the capital to SPY (the ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index) and the remaining 20% to BTC. Other Forecasts The X user CRYPTOWZRD is also optimistic that BTC could post additional gains in the near future , envisioning a rally to $132,500 based on the potential formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.

Jack Ma-backed Ant Group Co. is preparing to integrate Circle Internet Group Inc.’s USD Coin ( USDC ) stablecoin into its global blockchain platform, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The exact timeline hasn’t been determined, but the sources said that Ant’s international arm plans to adopt USDC once the stablecoin achieves full compliance under U.S. regulatory frameworks. The stablecoin is expected to be used to enhance Ant’s cross-border payment and treasury management services, enabling faster and more regulated transactions for businesses worldwide. The development also complements Circle’s own efforts by extending USDC’s reach through external platforms like Ant’s, alongside Circle’s plans to launch i ts own payments network aimed at helping financial institutions settle cross-border transactions using stablecoins.

In response, Ant has doubled down on global fintech infrastructure through its international arm Ant International , which generated nearly $3 billion in revenue in 2024 and processed over $1 trillion in global transactions last year, with a third of those routed through its proprietary blockchain. Integrating USDC fits into this vision by enabling Ant to offer faster, compliant, and stablecoin-powered cross-border payments and treasury services, while expanding its blockchain platform that already accommodates a variety of tokenized assets issued by banks and financial institutions worldwide. Meanwhile, Ant is actively pursuing licenses to issue its own fiat-backed stablecoins in jurisdictions including Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg, aiming to operate under newly established regulatory frameworks. A company spokesperson recently confirmed that Ant plans to apply for a fiat-referenced stablecoin issuer license in Hong Kong once the city’s new Stablecoins Ordinance takes effect on August 1 .

Recently, the Asia FX market has found itself in a precarious position, seemingly treading water amidst significant global headwinds. This uncertainty stems primarily from two powerful forces: renewed threats of Trump tariffs and the cautious stance adopted by the Federal Reserve . For investors and market watchers alike, comprehending these dynamics is not just about traditional finance; it is about recognizing the ripple effects that can influence sentiment and liquidity across all asset classes, including digital currencies. The Delicate Balance of Asia FX Amidst Uncertainty Asian currencies, often seen as bellwethers for global economic health, are currently experiencing a period of significant pressure. From the Japanese Yen to the Chinese Yuan and the Korean Won, various factors are contributing to this delicate balance. The strength of the U.S. dollar, driven by perceived safety and interest rate differentials, naturally puts downward pressure on Asian counterparts. However, the current environment adds layers of complexity. Export Dependence: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on exports, making them particularly vulnerable to global trade disruptions. Capital Flows: Uncertainty often leads to capital flight from emerging markets, impacting local currency valuations. Domestic Policies: Local central bank policies, while aiming for stability, must contend with external pressures. This “treading water” phenomenon suggests a lack of clear direction, with currencies holding relatively steady but facing significant underlying stress that could lead to sudden movements. The resilience of Asia FX will be tested by the evolving geopolitical and monetary landscapes. Unpacking the Renewed Threat of Trump Tariffs The specter of Trump tariffs has once again cast a long shadow over global trade. While the initial rounds of tariffs under the previous administration caused considerable disruption, the possibility of their reintroduction or expansion under a new presidency creates fresh anxieties. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, are designed to protect domestic industries but often result in retaliatory measures from trading partners, escalating into full-blown trade wars. The potential implications are vast: Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses may need to re-evaluate their global supply chains, leading to increased costs and inefficiencies. Reduced Global Trade Volumes: Higher tariffs can reduce the overall volume of goods exchanged internationally, impacting economic growth. Increased Inflation: Tariffs can raise the cost of imported goods, contributing to inflationary pressures in consumer prices. Investment Uncertainty: Companies may delay investment decisions due to unpredictable trade policies, slowing economic expansion. The mere threat of Trump tariffs can be enough to trigger market apprehension, as investors anticipate the potential economic fallout and adjust their portfolios accordingly, impacting currency valuations and investor confidence. The Federal Reserve’s Cautious Stance and Global Impact At the heart of global monetary policy is the Federal Reserve , whose decisions reverberate across financial markets worldwide. The Fed’s current cautious stance, particularly regarding interest rate adjustments, plays a significant role in the performance of the U.S. dollar and, consequently, other major currencies, including those in Asia. Why is the Fed being cautious? Inflation Targets: The Fed aims to bring inflation down to its target while avoiding a severe economic downturn. Economic Data: Decisions are data-dependent, with the Fed closely monitoring employment, inflation, and growth figures. Global Spillovers: U.S. monetary policy has profound effects on global capital flows, debt servicing costs for other nations, and currency stability. A dovish pivot, or even just a prolonged period of holding rates steady, could ease pressure on Asian currencies by reducing the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Conversely, any hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve could strengthen the dollar further, putting renewed strain on Asia FX and emerging markets. Navigating Broader Global Trade Tensions Beyond specific tariffs, the broader landscape of global trade tensions continues to shape economic outlooks. Geopolitical rivalries, disputes over intellectual property, and competition for technological dominance all contribute to an environment of heightened uncertainty. These tensions are not isolated incidents but rather interconnected challenges that can exacerbate existing economic vulnerabilities. Consider the ripple effects: Reduced Investment: Companies may be hesitant to invest in regions perceived as high-risk due to trade disputes. Supply Chain Reshoring/Diversification: Businesses are increasingly looking to de-risk their supply chains, moving production closer to home or diversifying across multiple countries. This can be costly and impact efficiency. Economic Nationalism: A rise in protectionist policies can hinder international cooperation and lead to fragmented global markets. The health of global trade is intrinsically linked to currency stability. When trade flows are disrupted, demand for certain currencies can fluctuate wildly, leading to increased volatility and unpredictable market movements. Understanding Volatility in the Currency Market The confluence of Trump tariffs, Federal Reserve caution, and broader global trade tensions inevitably leads to increased volatility in the currency market . For traders and investors, understanding and adapting to this environment is paramount. Volatility presents both risks and opportunities. Key characteristics of a volatile currency market: Wider Price Swings: Currencies can experience larger daily or weekly movements. Increased Uncertainty: Economic data releases, political statements, and geopolitical events can trigger sharp reactions. Liquidity Challenges: In extreme volatility, market liquidity can sometimes dry up, making it harder to execute trades at desired prices. For those involved in the digital asset space, understanding the traditional currency market is vital. When major fiat currencies experience significant shifts, it can influence capital flows into and out of cryptocurrencies, impacting their valuations and overall market sentiment. A stronger dollar, for instance, can sometimes draw liquidity away from riskier assets, including crypto. Challenges and Opportunities for Investors The current environment presents unique challenges for investors: Forecasting Difficulty: Predicting currency movements becomes more complex with multiple unpredictable variables. Risk Management: Enhanced risk management strategies are crucial to mitigate potential losses from sudden market shifts. Diversification: Diversifying portfolios across different asset classes and geographies can help cushion against regional or specific currency shocks. However, opportunities also arise: Arbitrage: Discrepancies in valuations across different markets can create arbitrage opportunities for agile traders. Hedging: Businesses with international operations can use currency derivatives to hedge against adverse movements. Strategic Positioning: Long-term investors can strategically position themselves in currencies or assets expected to benefit from evolving global dynamics. Actionable Insights for Navigating Uncertainty In such a dynamic landscape, staying informed and adopting a flexible approach is key. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Geopolitical Developments: Keep a close eye on trade negotiations, election outcomes, and international relations, as these can directly impact currency movements. Follow Central Bank Communications: Pay attention to statements and minutes from the Federal Reserve and other major central banks for clues on future monetary policy. Analyze Economic Indicators: Understand how key economic data (e.g., GDP, inflation, employment) from major economies influences currency valuations. Assess Risk Appetite: Be aware of the broader market’s risk appetite, as this often dictates capital flows between safe-haven and riskier assets. Consider Hedging Strategies: For businesses or individuals with significant foreign currency exposure, explore hedging options to mitigate exchange rate risk. Diversify Portfolios: Spread investments across various asset classes, including a thoughtful allocation to digital assets, to balance risk. A Compelling Conclusion: Charting the Path Ahead The current state of Asia FX , caught between the renewed possibility of Trump tariffs and the cautious hand of the Federal Reserve , underscores the intricate web of global finance. These powerful forces, alongside broader global trade tensions, are creating an environment of heightened uncertainty and increased currency market volatility. For investors, including those keenly observing the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro trends is not merely academic; it is fundamental to making informed decisions and navigating the choppy waters ahead. While challenges abound, a proactive and well-informed approach, coupled with robust risk management, can transform potential pitfalls into strategic opportunities. The global financial landscape is constantly evolving, and staying ahead of the curve requires continuous vigilance and adaptability.

With its price breaking above a critical resistance zone near $3, SUI appears poised to validate a significant upside move. This could potentially reach the $4 to $4.3 range, over a 30% upswing from the current levels. Backed by growing ecosystem adoption and favorable technical patterns, the current momentum suggests this month could be crucial for the token’s market trajectory. SUI Breaks Key Resistance—Aims for $4.12 SUI recently breached the $3 resistance level, marking a confirmed breakout from a descending channel that had previously capped its gains. This breakout has been undervalued by rising open interest and increasing spot volume. The 4-hour chart reflects strong bullish momentum, with RSI maintaining a level above 50, signaling continued buying pressure. As seen in the above chart, the latest rise has placed the levels between the 50-day & 200-day MA, which points towards a bullish trajectory. The RSI is incremental and hence supports the bullish thesis. As a result, the price is believed to rise above the pivotal 200-day MA at $3.27 which could form a strong base, substantiating the next bullish action. Ecosystem Growth and Social Buzz Amplify the Rally Beyond the technicals, SUI’s growing ecosystem is helping reinforce investor confidence. Key DeFi integrations, rising developer activity, and partnerships within the Web3 space are adding fuel to the bullish fire. The surge in DEX volume and wallet activity suggests user participation, which often precedes sustained price movements. Social sentiment around SUI has also spiked significantly over the last week, highlighting its potential breakout pattern. Despite the bullish outlook, rising above the levels between $3.2 and $3.38 may offer a strong resistance to the rally. Additionally, the upcoming token unlocks could introduce short-term sell pressure, even though recent unlocks have had a minimal impact on price stability. Hence, a decisive close above this range may only unlock a new phase of growth for the token, which may push the SUI price above $4.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SUI|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 11:40:36

JUST IN: Bitcoin chart is ""coiled like a spring"" with upside to $170,000. pic.twitter.com/c7emsBEOQT — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 10, 2025 Bullish momentum was sparked in part by geopolitical events, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping new tariffs. The administration is set to implement up to 40% tariffs on imports from Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Myanmar, and Laos, and raise Japan’s tariff rate to 25% starting August 1. As trade tensions rise, Bitcoin continues to solidify its role as a macro hedge and digital store of value. Key BTC technical breakout confirmed Market structure has supported the rally. As noted by analyst Michael van de Poppe in a July 10 chart update, Bitcoin’s price action accelerated sharply after breaking above the $106,500 resistance level, a move that opened the door for price action to reach $108,000 and beyond. Liquidity clusters between $105,000 and $106,500 have been cleared, and the next leg of upward momentum hinges on maintaining support above that zone. https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1943210330487951416 “Liquidity has been taken, slight pullback before the big breakout to ATH,” van de Poppe observed, highlighting the $105,797 region as a key threshold. He also marked sub-$100K as a potential reaccumulation zone in the event of a deeper correction, but overall market sentiment remains strongly bullish. Bitcoin long-term bullish setup This latest all-time high also puts Bitcoin up nearly 90% year-over-year. Notably, while Bitcoin price has reached a new high, the overall crypto market cap remains under its previous peak of $3.73 trillion set in December 2024. Institutional demand remains a major tailwind. Spot ETF flows have continued to rise, and investor appetite shows no signs of slowing. In parallel, the U.S. macro environment, including inflation concerns, rate cut expectations, and now tariff shocks is creating ideal conditions for further Bitcoin strength. As BTC continues to consolidate above $110,000, traders and analysts are watching closely for confirmation of a clean breakout toward $120,000 and beyond.

The transfer occurred at around 6:00 AM UTC on July 10. At the moment, the internally-linked address holds as much as 14,000 ETH or nearly $40 million in value. Earlier in June, the Ethereum Foundation announced that it would be implementing a new treasury policy designed to ensure long-term sustainability while supporting the ecosystem’s continued growth. Although EF has historically relied on holding its own ETH, the new strategy would see the foundation executing more regular ETH sales to maintain a fiat reserve and expanding its staking and DeFi deployments. On July 30, 2015, Ethereum made its debut in the crypto space by launching its first decentralized blockchain. Officially named Frontier at the time, it became the project’s first live mainnet which included Genesis block mining. Since that first launch, Ethereum has evolved through many upgrades and innovations, with its latest Pectra upgrade going live recently on May 7, 2025.

Com-backed Cronos Chain has experienced a significant price surge, with 24-hour gains of 20% extending the momentum seen on July 7, 2025. Cronos price reached highs of $0.099 on Wednesday morning, with the token also gaining as on-chain transactions rose 37%. Notably, trading volume was up more than 2,200% as buying pressure rose amid anticipation surrounding a high-profile exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing. As of writing on July 9, 2025, the CRO token continues to draw attention from investors amid a broader positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Cronos price surges 20% – Why is CRO up today? The price of Cronos (CRO) hovers around $0.095, up double-digits over the past 24 hours, which also has a weekly uptick at 18%. According to CoinMarketCap data, this performance positions CRO among the top performers in the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Cronos is outpacing SPX6900, FLOKI, and Raydium, with its 20% gain putting its current market cap at $2.94 billion. The surge is largely attributed to heightened investor enthusiasm following Trump Media & Technology Group’s proposal for the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are the major assets in the ETF. However, it also seeks to include an allocation of 5% to CRO, a move that investors have reacted to positively.

CRO price prediction The technical outlook for CRO is optimistic, with the daily chart showing the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 68. While it’s near the overbought territory, it’s not extended to suggest bulls have room to explore more gains. CRO price chart by TradingView Cronos’ daily chart also shows the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) with a bullish crossover, which suggests potential for further upside. If CRO sees another leg up, it could break above $0.10 and target $0.16 and $0.21. Long-term forecasts include a surge to the all-time high of $0.96 and the psychological $1 level. On the flipside, Crono’s price may give up gains and pull back to support around $0.087 and then $0.079. On the possible pullback, analysts at Santiment say : “Bitcoin traders are leaning very bullish once again with crypto’s top coin’s market value sitting just above $108.5K.

According to a recent filing with the Maine Attorney General’s office, the breach was first detected on June 23, 2024, when Bitcoin Depot identified suspicious activity on its information systems. The firm deployed an investigation in response, engaging third-party security experts to determine the extent of the breach. On July 18, 2024, the investigation confirmed that a hacker had accessed documents containing the personal data of 26,732 customers. The stolen information included names, phone numbers, and driver’s license numbers. In some cases, it also included home addresses, birth dates, and email addresses. Bitcoin Depot said it was unable to notify affected users earlier due to an ongoing federal investigation. The disclosure hold was only lifted on June 13, 2025, when law enforcement confirmed that their investigation had concluded.

It has also implemented new security measures, improved system monitoring, and increased internal awareness to help prevent future incidents. Users are advised to stay vigilant over the next 12 to 24 months and urged to monitor financial accounts, review credit reports, and report any suspicious activity or signs of identity theft immediately. The breach comes amid a wave of targeted attacks on crypto service providers, as threat actors continue to evolve their tactics to prey on unsuspecting individuals and entities. It echoes a similar December 2024 breach on rival crypto ATM operator Byte Federal, which exposed personal data of more than 58,000 users.

On July 9, RCADE was officially listed on Binance Alpha, Binance’s early-access listing portal, marking the token’s TGE. It was quickly followed by spot listings on Gate.io, KuCoin, Bithumb, and Bitget. Despite the high-profile rollout, RCADE faced sharp downward pressure in the immediate aftermath. Following its TGE, RCADE opened at an initial price of $0.0029 but declined by more than 30%, hitting an intraday low of $0.0018 on July 10. The sharp sell-off is consistent with a broader pattern seen in early-stage token launches, where airdrop recipients and early unlocks trigger short-term selling pressure. Notably, 19.38% of RCADE’s total 40 billion token supply was designated for community initiatives, such as airdrops and incentive programs, most of which were fully unlocked at launch, increasing circulating supply and likely contributing to the immediate price drop. Despite the initial decline, RCADE has since shown signs of recovery. As of the latest available data, the token rebounded to $0.0020, suggesting that market participants with long-term confidence in the project’s fundamentals are beginning to accumulate.

The decentralized prediction platform Kalshi says that based on the price of recent trades, the US national debt is now forecasted to grow from about $36 trillion to $46 trillion by 2029. The site has also added a live US debt tracker to its website. “Both Democrats and Republicans have failed to curb government spending… Now you can watch the national debt grow live on Kalshi.” The Kobeissi Letter, a newsletter about global markets, says that if the US debt reaches $46 trillion, it would be “officially up +100% since 2020” and warns of dire consequences. “On our current fiscal path, US bankruptcy is simply a matter of time. Something must change.” Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, has also been warning of severe economic and financial consequences as the US national debt is now on pace to rise from about $230,000 per American household to $425,000 per American household over the next decade. Dalio believes the remedy is to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. “This printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what’s bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Just moments ago, the Royal Government of Bhutan executed a significant Bitcoin transfer, moving 212.31 BTC, valued at an astonishing $23.61 million, to the global exchange giant Binance. This isn’t an isolated incident; over the past ten days, Bhutan has consistently channeled its digital assets, depositing a total of 350.74 BTC worth approximately $38.5 million into the exchange. This latest move by the Himalayan kingdom spotlights a unique approach to digital asset management and prompts us to delve deeper into Bhutan’s fascinating Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy . Unpacking Bhutan’s Unique Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy For many, the idea of a sovereign nation actively managing a substantial Bitcoin portfolio might seem surprising. Yet, Bhutan, a country often associated with its Gross National Happiness philosophy and pristine natural beauty, has quietly emerged as a pioneering force in the realm of state-sponsored cryptocurrency adoption. Their journey into Bitcoin isn’t new; reports suggest they began mining Bitcoin as early as 2019, leveraging their abundant hydropower resources – a clean, sustainable energy source perfectly suited for energy-intensive mining operations. The nation’s digital asset ventures are primarily managed by Druk Holdings and Investments (DHI), the commercial arm of the Royal Government. DHI acts as a sovereign wealth fund, holding and managing the government’s assets across various sectors, including energy, communication, and now, digital currencies. This strategic diversification into Bitcoin is seen not just as an investment but as a long-term play to future-proof the nation’s economy and explore new revenue streams. Sustainable Mining: Utilizing surplus hydropower for eco-friendly Bitcoin mining. Sovereign Wealth Management: DHI integrates Bitcoin into its diversified portfolio. Long-Term Vision: A forward-thinking approach to national economic resilience. Understanding the Broader Landscape of Government Crypto Holdings Bhutan is not alone in its exploration of digital assets, though its quiet, strategic approach sets it apart. The concept of government crypto holdings has gained significant traction globally, driven by various motivations: Country/Entity Motivation for Crypto Holdings Examples El Salvador National Currency, Remittances, Tourism Made Bitcoin legal tender, launched Volcano Bonds. Ukraine War Funding, Humanitarian Aid Accepted crypto donations during conflict. United States Seized Assets, Law Enforcement Holds large amounts of BTC from illicit activities. Various Nations Innovation, Reserves, Diversification Exploring CBDCs, holding small amounts for research. While some nations, like El Salvador, have made bold public statements about their Bitcoin adoption, others, like Bhutan, have preferred a more discreet, calculated path. This highlights a growing trend where governments are no longer just regulating crypto but are actively participating in the digital asset ecosystem, albeit with varying degrees of transparency and strategic intent. However, holding significant amounts of volatile assets like Bitcoin comes with its own set of challenges. These include: Price Volatility: The inherent price swings of Bitcoin can impact portfolio value. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large digital holdings from hacks and cyber threats. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Public Perception: Managing public and international opinion on state-backed crypto ventures. The Implications of a Large Bitcoin Exchange Transfer to Binance The recent movement of 212.31 BTC, following previous deposits, directly to Binance, a major centralized exchange, is a particularly noteworthy aspect of Bhutan’s recent activity. A large Bitcoin exchange transfer like this can signal several possibilities: Liquidity Needs: The government might be preparing to sell a portion of its holdings to fund national projects, diversify into other assets, or manage its treasury. Moving funds to an exchange makes them readily available for trading. Portfolio Rebalancing: DHI might be rebalancing its portfolio, perhaps reducing its Bitcoin exposure or shifting funds to other digital assets supported by Binance. Custodial Services: While less likely for such large amounts if the intent is long-term holding, it could indicate a shift in custodial strategy, though self-custody is often preferred for sovereign entities. Market Signal: Large transfers to exchanges are often watched by traders as they can precede selling pressure, though the overall market impact from Bhutan’s moves might be limited given Bitcoin’s vast liquidity. Binance, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, offers deep liquidity and a wide range of trading pairs, making it a logical choice for executing large transactions. The decision to use a centralized exchange rather than over-the-counter (OTC) desks could imply a need for immediate liquidity or a preference for the exchange’s specific features. Leveraging On-chain Analytics to Track Bhutan’s BTC Movement The ability to track such significant transactions stems from the inherent transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is where on-chain analytics plays a crucial role. Tools and platforms, like Onchain Lens on X (formerly Twitter), analyze publicly available blockchain data to identify and interpret large movements of digital assets. How do on-chain analysts track these movements? Public Ledger: Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public, immutable ledger. Address Tracing: Analysts identify wallets associated with known entities (like governments or large institutions) and track funds moving from these addresses. Exchange Wallets: Major exchanges have identifiable “hot” and “cold” wallets. When funds move into these, it’s often a precursor to trading activity. Volume and Frequency: Large, frequent transfers to exchanges are flagged as significant events, indicating potential market-moving actions. This transparency is a double-edged sword for governments. While it allows for public accountability and verifiable transactions, it also exposes their financial movements to global scrutiny. For Bhutan, this means their strategic decisions in the crypto space are open for interpretation by the wider market and crypto community. What’s Next for Bhutan’s Digital Asset Journey? The recent Bhutan BTC movement to Binance raises questions about the kingdom’s future plans for its digital assets. Will we see further divestment, or is this merely a tactical repositioning? Given Bhutan’s measured approach, it’s unlikely to be a hasty decision. Instead, it likely reflects a calculated step within their broader economic strategy. Possible future scenarios include: Continued Portfolio Management: Regular rebalancing and optimization of their digital asset holdings based on market conditions and national needs. Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: Exploring other cryptocurrencies or blockchain-based investments that align with their sustainable development goals. Integration into National Economy: Potentially using blockchain technology for land records, supply chain management, or even a national digital currency (CBDC) in the future. Increased Transparency: As Bhutan gains more experience, they might opt for greater transparency regarding their crypto strategy, potentially inspiring other nations. Bhutan’s journey serves as a compelling case study for how a small nation can strategically engage with the rapidly evolving world of digital finance. Their blend of environmental consciousness with technological foresight offers valuable lessons for other governments considering similar ventures. Conclusion: Bhutan’s Bold Digital Horizon The Royal Government of Bhutan’s recent significant Bitcoin transfers to Binance underscore its pioneering role in state-level crypto adoption. Far from a fleeting experiment, Bhutan’s Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy , rooted in sustainable energy and long-term vision, positions it as a quiet leader in the digital asset space. These movements, meticulously tracked through on-chain analytics , highlight the growing importance of government crypto holdings and the strategic implications of a large Bitcoin exchange transfer . As the world watches, Bhutan continues to navigate the complexities of digital finance with a unique blend of prudence and innovation, setting a compelling precedent for sovereign engagement with the future of money.

The trade signals a shift in sentiment, breaking the streak of ETH being considered an underperforming asset. Trader focus is shifting toward Ethereum, as ETH futures volumes overtook Bitcoin. BTC returned to its spot as the leader soon after, but the increased trading signals a shift for ETH sentiment and a possible trader rotation. #Ethereum just flipped #Bitcoin in 24h futures volume: $62.1B vs $61.7B! That’s rare – and it signals a potential rotation in trader focus and positioning ahead of possible $ETH -specific catalysts. pic.twitter.com/34XlbZgimQ — glassnode (@glassnode) July 10, 2025 Based on Glassnode data , ETH futures expanded to $62.1B for 24-hour volumes, while BTC achieved $61.7B. ETH volumes soon slowed down to $61.7B for the day, still close behind BTC. Liquidations were also more active for Ethereum based on the current trader positioning. Spot volumes for ETH are at around $28B per day, with $40B for BTC. The leading coin still dominates the market, with over $34B in open interest and around $18B for ETH. While BTC open interest remained largely unchanged, ETH positions nearly doubled from recent lows, showing traders have not capitulated. ETH recovers $2,800, still unable to make a bigger move The next step for Ethereum may include factors specific to the chain, especially DeFi growth and stablecoin traffic. For now, ETH managed to break above $2,800, but is yet to show additional strength to recover above $3,000. ETH traded at $2,777.40, after taking a step backward. In the past week, ETH recovered against BTC, rising to 0.025 BTC. However, for the year to date, ETH lost 29% of its value against BTC. A shift in sentiment may anticipate a trend reversal, where ETH activity increases to tap a more dramatic price move. One of the potential scenarios includes gaining against BTC, or a hike to the $3,000 or $4,000 level. However, ETH currently sees most of its derivative liquidity in long positions, starting at around $2,600. The recent rally may reverse to liquidate those positions. Based on trader positioning on Binance, ETH has mostly finished liquidating the long positions. In the past 24 hours, traders were liquidated for $157.9M in short positions. Following the large daily liquidation event, traders turned to attacking long positions. Ethereum may see renewed buying pressure Until recently, ETH fell due to combined selling pressure from whales and from the reserves of Grayscale . Recently, Grayscale started re-accumulating ETH, along with other funds. ETH is also accumulating in whale wallets with 10,000 or more tokens. Mega-whale wallets now hold over 41M ETH, after months of slow and mostly invisible accumulation. Around 30% of the ETH supply is staked in the Beacon Chain contract. Ethereum is also getting accumulated in corporate treasuries, following a similar path to BTC. In any case, ETH is seen as valuable and as the central chain for decentralized finance and stablecoins. The expectations for an ETH rally may also reawaken altcoins , leading to a breakout season in the second half of 2025. The Ethereum narrative is also abandoning the recent capitulation and the expectations that the chain will be useless and abandoned.

Key Takeaways: Ben Armstrong was arrested in Georgia on six counts of harassing phone calls and released on bond. He has remained silent publicly, with his X account inactive and managed by others since early June. Armstrong faces multiple legal battles, including a federal defamation lawsuit from Kevin O’Leary. He was released the following day after posting bond. A newly released mugshot from the Georgia Gazette shows Armstrong looking noticeably more disheveled than in previous run-ins with law enforcement. Details about the alleged phone calls have not been made public, and the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office has yet to issue a formal statement. Armstrong Remains Silent on Social Media Following Arrest Armstrong, who has been largely silent on social media, hasn’t addressed the arrest. His X account, inactive since June 7, appears to be managed by others. In one reply, the account confirmed he was still in custody at that time. Indeed — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) June 6, 2025 Armstrong’s latest arrest adds to a growing list of legal entanglements. In March, he was arrested in Florida on a fugitive warrant from Georgia, related to emails he allegedly sent to Cobb County Superior Court Judge Kimberly Childs in connection with an ongoing defamation case. Representing himself in court, Armstrong later confirmed the arrest stemmed from those communications. The influencer is also facing a federal defamation lawsuit from “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary. The suit accuses Armstrong of spreading false claims, including calling O’Leary “a real-life murderer” over a 2019 boating accident that resulted in two deaths. O’Leary, who was never charged, is seeking more than $75,000 in damages. The case remains active in Florida federal court, where a motion for default judgment was recently filed. I called it from the start and honestly tried to tell him this was the path. That is not cocaine that is a crystal meth addiction. He needs a 36 month prison sentence, would help him more than anything else. pic.twitter.com/k2nRmuVYEZ — Melted (@MeltedMindz) July 9, 2025 Armstrong’s personal and legal troubles accelerated after he was removed from HIT Network , the crypto media company he co-founded. The company cited alleged substance abuse, financial misconduct, and erratic behavior as reasons for the separation. Armstrong Arrested While on Live-Stream In September 2023, Armstrong was arrested by the police while live-streaming on YouTube . He was on his way to confront a former colleague Carlos Diaz in a quest to retrieve his Lamborghini, but the police detained him midway. The police had also found illegal narcotics in his vehicle. In April 2023, when Armstrong was part of a class-action lawsuit, he was called in by the judge to address his harassment of the plaintiffs’ counsel. The plaintiff’s lawyer had claimed that Armstrong harassed the legal team with vulgar phone calls, voicemails, text messages and social media posts suggesting threats.

This move has reignited bullish sentiment among traders. Experts closely monitoring now believe, after witnessing this surge, that another surge could propel the price of XRP to higher levels. This optimism is supported as its parent company, Ripple, enjoys a series of positive developments, and experts now believe that its price action has led to the emergence of a new inverse head and shoulders pattern, which may indicate a long-term potential reversal in the near future. Moreover, the investor sentiment has also shifted to a more bullish outlook, with many anticipating that XRP would continue its upward trajectory and aim for a higher target by the end of July. Analyst Targets $3.30 In XRP Price Crypto analyst TheSignalyst recently highlighted that the XRP price has entered an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. This formation has emerged at a crucial moment, coinciding with strong support levels which were maintained by bullish traders for several months. As of now, Bitcoin has also surpassed its June high, and XRP crypto is riding on that momentum, having climbed to $2.45. The analyst notes that in the short term, the price could reach between $2.62 and $2.66. Looking ahead, TheSignalyst displays that a decisive break above the $2.66 level is essential for confirming a bullish continuation. If this setup holds, the analyst projects that the XRP price could potentially reach as high as $3.30 in the long term. Indicators Analysis Shows Bullish Strength The XRP price is demonstrating notable bullish strength, with today’s momentum highlighted by several bullish indicators. The MACD has revealed a golden cross, with the histogram rising at 0.0277. Currently, the MACD line sits at 0.0440, while the signal line is at 0.0164. In addition, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) supports this bullish sentiment, as its histogram has also climbed at 0.1196. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also indicates positive trends, currently jumping from 0 line to 0.11, reflecting an increase in money inflows. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the rise, inching closer to overbought territory at 67.48. This suggests a strong likelihood of another price spike in the short-term before the market becomes overheated.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-10 11:51:51

The team is building new tools, improving migration, and making noise about ecosystem progress. But beneath the surface, a major problem is gaining attention. Over 370 million Pi tokens are now sitting on exchanges, while most users still don’t have access to their own tokens. That’s a serious concern. If the majority of users are still waiting on technical fixes and KYC approvals, who exactly is trading these tokens? Why Pi’s Token Access Feels Rigged To move Pi tokens to the mainnet, users first need to pass KYC. Then they can begin migration but even then, only a portion of their Pi is unlocked. The rest stays locked under a vesting schedule, depending on how active the user has been. For many, the process has been frustrating. Technical issues like 2FA errors and missing balances have only made it worse. Some users have been stuck in the queue for months. Meanwhile, exchange balances have jumped from 244 million in March to over 370 million in July. That means more tokens are appearing on public markets, even though regular users are still locked out. $PI new ATH. . The selling pressure continues to increase. 370million $PI in exchanges. .

But while developers build and apps launch, most users still can’t use their tokens outside Pi’s ecosystem. Trust Issues Are Now Front and Center Pi Network says it wants to build a fair, open ecosystem. But with over 5.1 billion Pi still locked, and a growing number of tokens moving onto exchanges, users are asking: Is this really as decentralized as promised?

By 2028, the price is projected to reach $10.21. By 2031, FIL may reach $32.88 Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity’s most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

Price is hovering near the middle of the Bollinger Band, suggesting an attempt to recover from extended downside pressure. The RSI stands at approximately 54, indicating moderate strength with room for upward momentum. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, showing a bullish crossover, though the histogram remains shallow. A confirmed breakout above $2.50 could validate bullish continuation, potentially targeting $2.85 or higher. However, failure to maintain momentum could lead to a fallback toward the lower band support near $2.10. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FILUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart for Filecoin (FIL), the token is exhibiting signs of a gradual recovery after a prolonged bearish phase. The price is consolidating slightly above the middle Bollinger Band, which may act as dynamic support. The MACD line is trending above the signal line, indicating mild bullish momentum, though the histogram reflects a weakening trend. The Balance of Power indicator is positive, suggesting buyers are slowly regaining control. However, overall volatility remains low, and upside potential hinges on a breakout above the upper band near $2.47. A failure to maintain momentum could see support revisited near $2.33.

On the 4-hour chart, price action is stabilizing above $2.44, supported by a positive MACD crossover and mild strength in the Balance of Power, suggesting short-term buyer interest. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, indicating a possible volatility expansion soon. On the 1-day chart, FIL remains below the 20-day moving average, but the RSI is climbing near 47, and the MACD has crossed into positive territory, signaling potential for a slow trend reversal. A break above $2.50 may open room for upside, while failure to hold $2.30 risks further decline. Is Filecoin a good investment? Filecoin is a decentralized storage network aiming to revolutionize data storage. Its investment potential depends on market adoption and competition. Like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant risks due to volatility. Investors should carefully research and assess their risk tolerance before considering investing. What will Filecoin be worth in 2025? Filecoin is predicted to reach a high of $3.18, with an average price of $2.97 by 2025. How high can Filecoin go? Filecoin (FIL) has the potential for significant price appreciation, especially if adoption increases within the decentralized storage sector. Historically, FIL reached an all-time high of $236.84 in 2021, but its price has since retraced significantly. Looking forward, realistic long-term projections depend on market conditions, demand for decentralized storage, and crypto adoption. In a bullish scenario, FIL could reach $5 by 2025 if institutional interest and on-chain activity increase. More optimistic forecasts suggest $50+ in the next major bull run. However, market risks remain, and sustained growth depends on ecosystem developments and competitive advantages over traditional cloud storage solutions. Can Filecoin reach 100 dollars? Filecoin (FIL) reaching $100 is possible, but it would require significant market momentum, adoption, and favorable conditions in the broader crypto space. The token hit an all-time high of $236.84 in 2021, proving that such price levels are achievable during bullish cycles. For FIL to reach $100 again, it would need strong institutional adoption, increased demand for decentralized storage solutions, and a broader crypto bull market. However, competition from traditional cloud providers and other blockchain-based storage networks could limit growth. While possible, it would require a massive market resurgence and sustained network adoption to materialize. What is the all-time high price of Filecoin? For FIL to reach $100 again, it would need strong institutional adoption, increased demand for decentralized storage solutions, and a broader crypto bull market. However, competition from traditional cloud providers and other blockchain-based storage networks could limit growth.

This powerful iteration arrives alongside a premium, eye-watering $300 monthly subscription plan, aptly named SuperGrok Heavy. This audacious move positions xAI directly against established giants like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, signaling a new era of intense competition in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence. For anyone tracking the intersection of cutting-edge technology and digital innovation, understanding these shifts is crucial as AI’s influence continues to expand across all sectors, potentially impacting everything from financial markets to daily digital interactions. What is Grok 4 and How Does it Stack Up? Grok 4 represents xAI’s ambitious answer to the leading generative AI models currently dominating the market. Designed to be a versatile and powerful tool, Grok can analyze images, respond to complex questions, and engage in conversational interactions. Its integration into Musk’s social network, X (formerly Twitter), has been deepening in recent months, making Grok’s capabilities and, at times, its misbehavior, visible to millions of users globally. The expectations surrounding Grok 4 are exceptionally high, particularly as it prepares to contend with OpenAI’s forthcoming GPT-5, anticipated to launch later this summer. Elon Musk himself has touted Grok 4’s academic prowess, stating during a recent livestream, “With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions.” While acknowledging that it may occasionally lack common sense and has yet to invent new technologies or discover new physics, Musk optimistically believes these are merely “a matter of time.” The launch includes two primary models: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, with the latter being a “multi-agent version” promising increased performance and advanced capabilities. The Bold Price Tag: Exploring SuperGrok Heavy One of the most striking announcements accompanying the launch of Grok 4 is the introduction of xAI’s most expensive AI subscription plan to date: the $300-per-month SuperGrok Heavy. This premium tier is designed for early adopters and power users, offering an early preview to Grok 4 Heavy and exclusive access to upcoming features. This pricing strategy places xAI ’s offering at the top end of the market, surpassing the ultra-premium tiers offered by competitors such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The SuperGrok Heavy subscription aims to provide an exclusive gateway to xAI’s future innovations. Subscribers to this plan are promised early access to new products that xAI plans to roll out in the coming months, including an AI model focused on coding expected in August, a multi-modal agent in September, and a video generation model slated for October. This tiered approach is a clear indication of xAI’s intent to monetize its advanced AI capabilities aggressively and attract a dedicated user base willing to invest significantly in cutting-edge AI tools. Navigating Challenges: Elon Musk ‘s AI Vision Amidst Controversy The launch of Grok 4 unfolds amidst a tumultuous period for Elon Musk ’s various ventures, particularly his social media platform, X, and his AI company, xAI. Just days before the Grok 4 unveiling, Linda Yaccarino stepped down from her role as CEO of X after approximately two years with the company, leaving her successor yet to be announced. This departure followed closely on the heels of a significant controversy involving Grok itself. An automated X account linked to Grok responded to users with antisemitic remarks, criticizing Hollywood’s “Jewish executives” and praising Hitler. This incident forced xAI to temporarily limit Grok’s account and delete the offensive posts. In the aftermath, xAI reportedly removed a section from Grok’s public system prompt that had instructed the AI chatbot not to shy away from making “politically incorrect” claims. Despite the gravity of these incidents, Musk and xAI’s leadership largely sidestepped discussing them during the Grok 4 launch event, choosing instead to focus almost exclusively on the new model’s performance and advanced capabilities. This approach highlights the challenge xAI faces in pitching Grok to businesses as a serious contender against established and more stable rivals like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, especially when grappling with public trust and ethical concerns. Benchmarking Brilliance: The Performance of the New AI Model Despite the recent controversies, xAI has presented compelling data regarding Grok 4 ’s performance, particularly on challenging benchmarks designed to test advanced AI capabilities. The company claims that Grok 4 demonstrates “frontier-level performance” across several critical assessments. One notable benchmark is Humanity’s Last Exam, a rigorous test that evaluates an AI’s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions spanning subjects like mathematics, humanities, and natural science. According to xAI, Grok 4 scored 25.4% on this exam without the aid of external “tools,” outperforming Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which achieved 21.6%, and OpenAI’s o3 (high), which scored 21%. The performance gap widened even further with Grok 4 Heavy, the multi-agent version, which, when utilizing “tools,” achieved an impressive score of 44.4%. This significantly surpassed Gemini 2.5 Pro with tools, which scored 26.9%. Furthermore, the nonprofit Arc Prize reported that Grok achieved a new state-of-the-art score on its ARC-AGI-2 test. This difficult benchmark involves puzzle-like problems where an AI must identify complex visual patterns. Grok scored 16.2%, nearly double the score of the next best commercial AI model , Claude Opus 4. These benchmark results, if independently verified, position Grok 4 as a formidable player in the high-stakes AI development race, showcasing its potential for advanced problem-solving and reasoning. xAI ‘s Strategic Play: Enterprise Ambitions and Future Models Beyond the impressive benchmark scores and the high-priced subscription, xAI is clearly setting its sights on the enterprise sector. The company is actively releasing Grok 4 through its API, a strategic move aimed at encouraging developers to integrate and build applications utilizing the new model. While xAI’s enterprise division is still nascent, having been established only two months prior to this launch, the company has ambitious plans to collaborate with hyperscalers. The goal is to make Grok widely available through major cloud platforms, broadening its reach and accessibility for businesses looking to leverage advanced AI. This strategy is crucial for xAI to move beyond individual users and establish itself as a serious contender in the B2B AI market, where reliability, scalability, and ethical considerations are paramount. The roadmap for future products, including a dedicated AI coding model in August, a multi-modal agent in September, and a video generation model in October, underscores xAI’s commitment to building a comprehensive suite of AI tools. However, the ultimate success of this enterprise push will hinge on whether businesses are prepared to adopt Grok, acknowledging its frontier-level performance while also navigating the public relations challenges and potential ethical concerns that have recently surfaced. Conclusion: The Ambitious Path Ahead for Grok 4 The launch of Grok 4 and the SuperGrok Heavy subscription marks a pivotal moment for Elon Musk ’s xAI . The company has introduced an AI model that, on paper, boasts impressive benchmark performances, outshining rivals in specific, challenging tests. This technical prowess, combined with an aggressive premium pricing strategy, signals xAI’s serious intent to carve out a significant share of the rapidly expanding AI market. However, the path forward is not without its considerable hurdles. The recent controversies surrounding Grok’s behavior and the departure of X’s CEO cast a shadow over an otherwise technologically significant announcement. For businesses and developers, the decision to adopt Grok will likely weigh its advanced capabilities against the public perception and ethical considerations that have recently come to light. As the AI arms race intensifies, xAI’s ability to build trust, maintain consistent performance, and effectively address its public image will be just as critical as its technical innovation. The coming months will reveal whether Grok 4 can truly live up to its ambitious claims and establish itself as a dominant force in the global AI landscape.

A prominent chart analyst recently identified a rare and powerful technical pattern on XRP’s monthly chart, indicating a potential massive price surge. Technical Formation: Pennant Breakout Could Trigger Parabolic Move XRPunkie’s prediction is rooted in months of bullish technical structure. After successfully breaking out of a long-term descending wedge pattern, XRP in late 2024 surged from below $0.60 to a recent high above $3.00 before consolidating earlier this year. The current consolidation, XRPunkie notes, is forming a bullish pennant, a classic continuation pattern that often precedes significant upward movement. XRP is positioning for a potential major breakout, backed by key support from its 21-period EMA and 33-period SMA. If this pattern resolves to the upside, as XRPunkie expects, the result could be a towering green monthly candle—what he calls the “God candle”—that initiates the next leg of a full-scale rally. $XRP God Candle incoming soon. I hope you are ready. pic.twitter.com/zJRMK1nt0R — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 9, 2025 Price Targets and Fibonacci Guidance XRPunkie outlines a clear roadmap based on Fibonacci extension levels, which serve as potential resistance zones and profit-taking points. His initial targets include the 1.618 extension at $6.45, followed by $8.90 and $13.42 at the 1.786 and 2.0 extensions, respectively. These levels, he suggests, align with previous cycles and represent critical thresholds on the path to a much larger move. Beyond these calculated targets, XRPunkie sees the possibility of a more dramatic rise to $50 if market conditions align and momentum is sustained. While the $50 level may appear ambitious, he emphasizes that these early Fibonacci zones offer critical checkpoints. Should they be breached with high volume and bullish sentiment, the doors could open for an extraordinary move. Market Context and Fundamentals Align XRP’s current technical posture is reinforced by positive developments within the broader ecosystem. Momentum indicators such as the Guppy Multiple Moving Averages have turned bullish on the daily chart, confirming strength among short-term traders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At the same time, Ripple’s ongoing advancements, including its RLUSD stablecoin, progress toward U.S. banking integration, and increased tokenization activity on the XRP Ledger—are adding fundamental support to the bullish thesis. Institutional interest is also growing, with speculation surrounding potential XRP ETF filings and renewed optimism following the resolution of key regulatory challenges. Can XRP Hit $50? While a move to the $6–$13 range seems attainable within a breakout scenario, a $50 price point would require an extraordinary surge in XRP’s value, driven by widespread adoption, increased global liquidity, and clearer regulations. Still, XRPunkie isn’t alone in holding such a view. Other respected analysts, including those following Elliot Wave Theory, have forecast similar upside potential under optimal conditions. Whether XRP merely reaches the $6–$13 range or explodes toward $50, the coming weeks could be pivotal. As the market watches closely for confirmation, all eyes are on XRP’s next candle—one that might just make crypto history.

Just 18 months after their launch in January 2024, these investment products have now attracted over $50 billion in net inflows. The strong demand reflects growing confidence from big-money players, and the rally shows no signs of slowing down. $218M Inflows in a Day On July 9 alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $218 million in net inflows, marking the fifth straight day of gains. According to SoSoValue data , nearly $1.52 billion has poured into these funds over the past five trading days. This follows a brief setback at the start of the month, when outflows hit $342 million on July 1. Since then, investor appetite has surged, with daily inflows peaking at $601.94 million on July 3. BlackRock Leads the Pack With Over 700K BTC BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains the dominant player, holding over 700,000 BTC, more than 55% of all Bitcoin held in U.S. spot ETFs. The fund has attracted $53 billion in net inflows, far ahead of Fidelity’s FBTC, which holds $12.29 billion. In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC continues to see outflows, losing $23.34 billion since its conversion. IBIT has even become BlackRock’s third-largest revenue-generating ETF, surpassing some of its long-standing traditional products, according to NovaDius Wealth Management’s Nate Geraci. The nearly $75bil iShares Bitcoin ETF has only one month of outflows since Jan 2024 launch… Now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares S&P 500 ETF.

A broader crypto index ETF could also be approved soon, offering more access to altcoins for traditional investors. Meanwhile, apart from Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum also saw momentum, with its ETFs pulling in over $211 million in a single day, pushing their total net inflows to nearly $5 billion. These flows suggest a broader appetite for crypto exposure among traditional investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum ETF Inflows Cross $320M, Is a Major ETH Price Rally Ahead? , Why Are Institutions Investing? Crypto analyst Rachael Lucas says this is not your typical retail hype cycle. Instead, it’s large-scale investors, asset managers, corporate treasuries, and wealth platforms moving in. The consistency of inflows across recent months (April, May, June) supports the view that Bitcoin is being taken seriously as a long-term investment. Lucas says global tensions and Trump’s push for rate cuts are making Bitcoin more attractive. According to him, the timing is different now because ETFs make it easier and safer to invest, just like buying stocks. Plus, the delay in Trump’s tariffs is also helping crypto prices rise. Bitcoin Enters Corporate Treasuries Beyond ETFs, companies are also jumping in. Japan’s Metaplanet added $237 million in BTC, while other firms in France and the UK made multi-million-dollar purchases. Tokyo-listed Remixpoint raised $215 million to buy 3,000 BTC. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $112,000 , and Ether surged 6.6% to $2,778, with analysts eyeing a breakout past $3,000. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Australia’s central bank, in partnership with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, has unveiled the next phase of Project Acacia, selecting 24 use cases to test how digital money and tokenized settlement models could reshape wholesale financial markets. Announced on July 10, this stage will involve 19 pilot use cases using real assets and transactions, along with five proofs-of-concept using simulated data. Specifically, the trials will examine how stablecoins, tokenized bank deposits, and a pilot wholesale CBDC could be used for settling various asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables, and carbon credits. “The use cases selected in this project will help us to better understand how innovations in central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, might help to uplift the functioning of wholesale financial markets in Australia,” said Brad Jones, Assistant Governor (Financial System) at the RBA. You might also like: Crypto tax clarity in Australia: What online gambling players need to know in 2025 As part of the project, the RBA will issue pilot CBDCs across a range of distributed ledger platforms such as Redbelly Network, Hedera, R3 Corda, and other EVM-compatible chains. Participants include a mix of fintech startups and major financial institutions, such as ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, and Westpac. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has granted regulatory relief to allow pilot participants to conduct transactions that may not yet fall under existing frameworks. This second phase of the project will run for six months, with findings to be published in the first quarter of 2026. Officials say the results will inform how public and private sector innovations could enhance the efficiency and resilience of Australia ’s financial markets. For context, Project Acacia was launched in late 2024 to explore how emerging forms of digital money and tokenized assets can modernize Australia’s wholesale financial infrastructure. It also aligns with the federal government’s broader digital asset strategy, outlined in a March 2025 policy statement aiming to foster innovation in Australia’s financial system.

This comes as the memecoin market sees a surge in trading volume. Investor confidence is rising again as PENGU’s funding rate has also turned positive. Whales have also increased their holdings, which shows renewed interest. Looking Ahead to 2025 The token is holding strong above key moving averages, and with RSI above 60 and support forming near $0.015, signs point to a continued bullish trend, if trading volume rises. The price is expected to climb 15–20%, possibly reaching $0.0185 to $0.0192 by the end of July. If momentum builds further, the next target is $0.0225.

(POPMART) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil (USOIL). These additions further extend BTCC’s portfolio of real-world asset trading options. With the inclusion of POPMART and USOIL, BTCC now offers access to over 370 tokenized futures contracts. Since launching in June, the platform’s newest offerings have collectively exceeded $1 million in trading volume, reflecting growing interest in diversified asset exposure among its users. In tandem with the expansion, BTCC has integrated TradingView’s technical analysis tools into its web platform. The integration equips traders with a comprehensive suite of tools, including support for a wide array of technical indicators. Notable features include the ability to set Take Profit and Stop Loss levels directly on charts, multi-chart viewing (split screen), and the combination of indicators such as Fibonacci retracement levels with Bollinger Bands. BTCC’s tokenized futures now cover 49 traditional market assets across four primary categories, all traded against USDT. These categories include: Stocks: Including companies like Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft, with leverage up to 50x. Commodities: Such as gold and silver, with leverage up to 150x. Forex: Including currency pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD, with leverage up to 200x. Indices: Such as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones. “As one of the first crypto platforms to offer tokenized futures, we were quick to identify the potential for blockchain technology to transform access to traditional markets. The expansion of tokenized assets BTCC now supports gives crypto natives access to diverse markets through a single platform,” said Alex Hung, Head of Operations at BTCC. The growing adoption of tokenized futures reflects increasing demand for exposure to traditional financial instruments within the crypto ecosystem. BTCC’s offering enables users to engage in leveraged trading of conventional assets while transacting entirely in cryptocurrency. The exchange plans to continue expanding its tokenized futures catalog throughout 2025, regularly adding new assets to meet evolving market demand.

Will Binance Coin (BNB) Rise Further?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-burns-1-billion-amid-market-rising-will-binance-coin-bnb-rise-further/,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has made a new announcement regarding the traditional burn of its native token, Binance Coin (BNB). According to Binance's statement, 1,595,599.78 BNB were burned in the 32nd burn today. The approximate market value of these BNBs is reported to be around $1.024 billion. After the burn, the total supply of BNB reached 139,289,513.94. Binance made the following statement in its statement: BNB Chain has completed its 32nd BNB burn and the second quarterly burn of 2025. This burn is part of a commitment to remove 100 million BNB (half of its total supply) from circulation through the burn when BNB is released, ultimately leaving only 100 million BNB in circulation. This commitment is automatically fulfilled every three months. The burn amount is adjusted based on the price of BNB and the number of blocks produced on BSC during a quarter, providing transparency and predictability. As millions of BNB are removed from circulation with each burn, this situation is expected to have a positive impact on the BNB price and contribute to preventing increases in the BNB price. BNB continues to trade at $672.7 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Binance Burns $1 Billion Amid Market Rising!

Appearing on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday, Garlinghouse highlighted the sector’s momentum and said that many expect stablecoins to reach a combined market capitalization of $1 trillion to $2 trillion, up from around $260 billion today. The exec added that the current growth rate is “profound,” while explaining that Ripple’s late entry into the stablecoin sector was a result of using stablecoins in its institutional payment flows prior to launching its own USD-backed asset. BNY Mellon Backs Ripple’s RLUSD Garlinghouse’s comments came as Ripple announced that the Bank of New York Mellon will now handle the USD cash and Treasury bills that back its RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, the partnership, which was disclosed on Wednesday, secures RLUSD a reputable banking partner as it scales further. As one of the largest custody banks in the US, BNY Mellon will safeguard and manage the liquidity of the reserves backing every RLUSD issued. It has been tasked with ensuring that holders can redeem the stablecoin for USD on a 1-to-1 basis under standards similar to money-market fund controls. BNY’s support for RLUSD aligns with its gradual expansion into crypto services since establishing a digital asset unit in 2021 and welcoming institutional crypto clients in 2022. Ripple’s RLUSD, which launched in December 2024 on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger, has grown rapidly within the $260 billion stablecoin market. RLUSD is designed to align with upcoming bipartisan legislation in the US, the GENIUS Act, which will introduce federal standards for reserve disclosures and backing. The stablecoin industry continues to attract interest from major corporations like Amazon and Walmart, alongside top-tier banks exploring entry into this expanding ecosystem. J.P. Morgan Throws Cold Water on Hype Apart from Ripple’s outlook, Standard Chartered anticipates the stablecoin sector could expand to $2 trillion by 2028, while Bernstein expects supply to climb toward $4 trillion within ten years. J.P. Morgan, however, remains skeptical. The investment banking behemoth estimated growth to just $500 billion by 2028, and argued that trillion-dollar expectations are premature amid the lack of widespread use of stablecoins.

One of the most powerful indicators for gauging this sentiment, especially for the flagship digital asset, is the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio. This ratio provides a snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves – whether they expect Bitcoin’s price to rise (long) or fall (short). Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour data and uncover what these crucial numbers tell us about the current state of Bitcoin trading . What Are Long-Short Ratios and Why Do They Matter? Before we dissect the latest figures, it’s essential to grasp what long-short ratios represent. Simply put, this ratio compares the number of long positions (bets on price increase) to short positions (bets on price decrease) on perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, making them highly popular in the crypto space. Why is this data so vital for your crypto market analysis ? Here are a few reasons: Sentiment Indicator: A high long ratio suggests bullish sentiment, while a high short ratio indicates bearishness. Potential Reversals: Extreme imbalances in the ratio can sometimes signal a potential market reversal. For instance, an overwhelmingly long position might lead to a cascade of liquidations if the price unexpectedly drops. Liquidity and Open Interest: These ratios are often viewed in conjunction with open interest (the total number of outstanding derivative contracts) to get a fuller picture of market depth and potential volatility. Deep Dive into 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Data Over the past 24 hours, the overall sentiment across various cryptocurrency exchanges shows a slight lean towards long positions for BTC perpetual futures . This indicates that more traders are currently betting on a price increase for Bitcoin than a decrease. Let’s look at the aggregated data and then break it down by top exchanges: Total Market Overview (Past 24 Hours): Position Type Percentage Long 51.56% Short 48.44% This marginal preference for long positions suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook among the broader trading community. It’s not an overwhelming bullish sentiment, but rather a slight tilt that could be interpreted in various ways, depending on other market factors. Exchange-Specific Insights: What Do Top Platforms Reveal About Bitcoin Trading ? While the aggregated data gives us a general idea, examining individual exchange data provides a more nuanced understanding of where specific trading activity and sentiment are concentrated. The top three exchanges in terms of volume and open interest often dictate broader market trends. Top Three Exchanges – 24-Hour Long-Short Ratios: Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Binance 52.67% 47.33% Bybit 50.34% 49.66% Gate.io 51.62% 48.38% Binance: Leading the Charge with a Bullish Bias Binance, being the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, often sets the tone for the market. Its long-short ratio of 52.67% long to 47.33% short indicates a slightly stronger bullish sentiment among its user base compared to the overall market average. This suggests that a significant portion of active traders on Binance are anticipating a positive price movement for Bitcoin. Bybit: A More Balanced Perspective Bybit’s figures show a much more balanced distribution, with 50.34% long and 49.66% short. This near 50/50 split indicates a more cautious or indecisive stance among Bybit traders. It could mean that while some are going long, an almost equal number are hedging their bets or actively shorting, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty or consolidation within that platform’s trading community. Gate.io: Mirroring the Market Average Gate.io’s ratio of 51.62% long to 48.38% short closely mirrors the overall market average. This suggests that traders on Gate.io are largely aligned with the broader sentiment observed across all exchanges, indicating a moderate bullish lean but not an aggressive one. Interpreting the Futures Trading Data : What Does It All Mean? The consistent slight bias towards long positions across these major exchanges, with none showing an overwhelming majority in either direction, paints a picture of cautious optimism. It suggests that while there’s underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s future price action, traders are not blindly rushing into long positions. This measured approach can be healthy for the market, preventing extreme overleveraging that could lead to sharp corrections. Key takeaways from this futures trading data : No Extreme Imbalance: The ratios are not heavily skewed, which is generally a good sign. Extreme long or short positions can often precede liquidations and rapid price movements. Slight Bullish Edge: The slight dominance of long positions suggests that the market believes in a positive trajectory for Bitcoin in the short term, albeit with reservations. Divergence in Sentiment: While the overall trend is similar, the slight differences between exchanges highlight that different trading communities might have varying levels of conviction. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Market Analysis How can you use this information to refine your trading strategies? While long-short ratios are powerful, they should always be considered alongside other indicators like funding rates, open interest, volume, and technical analysis. Here are some actionable insights: Confirmation Tool: Use these ratios to confirm your existing biases. If your analysis suggests a bullish move and the long-short ratio supports it, it adds conviction to your trade. Warning Signal: If you see extreme long ratios (e.g., 70%+) without significant price movement, it might be a sign of overleveraging. A sudden price drop could trigger a cascade of liquidations, pushing the price down further. Contrarian Play: Sometimes, going against the crowd can be profitable. If the ratio is overwhelmingly long, a contrarian trader might look for signs of a short squeeze or a sudden reversal. Exchange-Specific Strategies: If you trade predominantly on one exchange, pay closer attention to its specific long-short ratio. The sentiment on Binance might differ slightly from Bybit, influencing your short-term decisions on that platform. Remember, no single indicator provides a complete picture. Integrating BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios into a broader analytical framework will yield the best results for your Bitcoin trading decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Nuances of Bitcoin Trading Sentiment The 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures offer a fascinating glimpse into the collective psyche of Bitcoin traders. The current data points to a moderately bullish, yet cautious, sentiment across major exchanges. While the slight lean towards long positions suggests underlying confidence, the absence of extreme imbalance indicates a healthy market that is not overly leveraged in one direction. For anyone engaged in futures trading data analysis, these ratios are an indispensable tool for understanding market sentiment and potential price movements. By monitoring these figures alongside other technical and fundamental indicators, traders can make more informed decisions, navigate market volatility with greater confidence, and potentially unlock significant opportunities in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

Volume and open interest surged, signaling aggressive long positions and growing trader confidence. The Fibonacci zone between $0.8550–$0.8776 forms a new demand zone for a possible retest and support. Dogwifhat Gains Amid Market Rebound Dogwifhat (WIF) was trading at $0.97 at press time, up 13.17% in the past 24 hours. The move follows Bitcoin’s new all-time high, which has improved overall market sentiment. Meme coins such as WIF, PENGU , and SPX6900 have all seen price increases as a result. WIF has also posted a 4.41% gain in the past week, with daily trading volume at $570 million. The price has fluctuated within a 24-hour range of $0.855 to $0.98 and a 7-day range of $0.82 to $0.98. The current trend shows WIF continuing its recovery, supported by bullish technical signals and increased trading activity. Cup and Handle Breakout Signals Strength Chart data confirms a breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern, a structure that often precedes upward price continuation. This breakout is supported by a golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, a signal that may reflect a shift toward sustained bullish pressure. Source: TradingView WIF is now approaching resistance at $1.031. Immediate support is visible around $0.9, and traders are watching whether the asset can maintain momentum above this level. The breakout from the descending handle pattern marks a strong shift in the short-term trend. Demand Zone Forms at Fibonacci Support Levels According to analyst Crypto Chiefs, the breakout leaves behind a strong demand zone between $0.8550 and $0.8776. This area coincides with the 0.618–0.75 Fibonacci retracement range. The price may revisit this zone in the event of a pullback, where buyers could step in again. $WIF – bullish break to the upside.

As long as WIF holds above this support area, the outlook remains favorable for further upside. Data from Coinglass shows that WIF futures open interest has increased by 18%, reaching $480 million. At the same time, trading volume surged 85% to $2.41 billion. The rise in open interest alongside price movement suggests new long positions are entering the market.

According to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, the firm’s Bitcoin trend model flipped bullish on June 29. The model now places a 60% probability of BTC continuing its upward market price move over the next two months. Thielen’s analysis mentions a potential 20% gain during this period, which would see Bitcoin tread upwards to $130,000 at current prices. “Bitcoin is breaking out, fueled by relentless ETF demand and a series of policy catalysts on the horizon,” Thielen wrote in a market update released Wednesday. He reiterated that many traders are underpositioned following the previous month’s option expiry, leading to a “significant exposure roll-off.” “We remain constructive,” he jotted down, explaining that current trading signals support the continuation of this bullish trend. Call option buying: Traders eyeing an upside move According to the 10x Research head, Bitcoin traders are now predominantly buying calls, which could mean there is a sentiment of being “underexposed to further upside.” Market participants may be racing to catch up with Bitcoin’s rally rather than driving it through spot buying. He also explained that the current market bull run will likely extend into September, especially if upcoming macroeconomic events become favorable. Bitcoin ETF flows – $15 billion net buying since mid-April. Source: 10xResearch In the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report scheduled for release on July 15, economists expect a “benign” CPI print to push people towards buying positions. The third quarter hasn’t always been Bitcoin’s most favorable time of the year, with an average return of just 5.84% since 2013, according to data from CoinGlass. Still, Thielen is confident this year could be an exception, citing US pro-crypto policy changes and green ETF flows. “Traders on the sidelines risk missing the move that could define this quarter,” he concluded. ETF inflows show bulls in control Even during weeks of consolidation, there was approximately $15 billion in silent accumulation through the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs . On Wednesday alone, these ETFs attracted $215.7 million in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. Traders previously sitting on the sidelines are seemingly being forced to re-enter the market, potentially at much higher prices. 10x Research revealed that it has entered a long position in Bitcoin at $104,000, hedged with a $115,000 call option. The core position is up by $7,000, but the option has only gained $450 because of the market’s reduced implied volatility and time decay. Still, Thielen said the trade was performing as expected and will soon transition into a higher trading range. Ethereum ETFs on a market run Ethereum surged over 5% on Wednesday, outperforming Bitcoin, Ripple, and Solana. The rally was accompanied by record trading activity in BlackRock’s spot ether ETF, ETHA, listed on Nasdaq. More than 43 million shares of ETHA changed hands on Wednesday, the highest daily volume since the fund’s debut a year ago. According to Yahoo Finance, that figure nearly doubled the previous day’s volume of 24 million. TradingView data also shows that ETHA’s 30-day average trading volume is up by 18.83 million shares, up from 12.97 million in the first week of June. Investor interest has translated into robust capital inflows, with over $1.2 billion added to the fund since June. On Tuesday alone, net inflows reached $159 million, the largest single-day total since June 11, based on SoSoValue data.

As the stock of the AI chipmaker rose to record highs, traders and analysts are parsing whether Bitcoin is once more riding tech tailwinds—or crypto is finally going solo. Nvidia's shares hit an all-time high of $164.32, temporarily becoming the world's first $4 trillion company. The rally has been fueled by insatiable demand for AI chips, with investors seeing Nvidia as the bedrock of the artificial intelligence revolution that is now unfolding. The company's valuation is the same as the GDP of the world's most significant economies, showing the scale of the AI boom. Bitcoin and Nvidia: Correlation Data Tells a Nuanced Story For the majority of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, Bitcoin and Nvidia moved together, having correlation factors as high as 0.80 or higher—a very unusual level between disparate sectors' assets. This tight linkage reflected a broader ”risk-on” environment in which money entered crypto and AI stocks as proxies for growth and innovation. But newer figures show that the correlation is starting to weaken. While the three-month average remains reasonably healthy at 0.69, the newer figures have dropped back to around 0.36, indicating decoupling as investor interest waxes elsewhere. Of interest is the fact that Bitcoin's new all-time high of over $111,900 occurred roughly around the time of Nvidia's $4T mark, but analysts caution that this may be indicative of overall market euphoria and not a sustained trend. 2023-2024: Rolling 90-day correlation between BTC and NVDA was between 0.45-0.6, indicating moderate positive correlation. Q2 2025: Correlation has fallen below 0.3, with some weeks of near-zero or even negative readings, as Bitcoin lagged despite Nvidia moving relentlessly upwards. “Nvidia’s rally to $4 trillion might have helped BTC, but correlation is waning as macro factors and crypto-specific catalysts take over,” notes a leading digital asset strategist. The changing relationship between Nvidia and Bitcoin reflects diverging market drivers. Nvidia’s surge is powered by relentless AI demand and enterprise tech investment, while Bitcoin’s price action is increasingly shaped by macroeconomic uncertainty and crypto-specific events. As AI stocks become crowded trades, investors are rotating funds, but Bitcoin is now moving more on its own fundamentals—like halving cycles and regulatory news—than on Big Tech momentum. This marks a clear shift: Bitcoin is decoupling from the tech rally and forging an independent path. AI Chip Supply Chains: Indirect Impact on Crypto Mining Nvidia's leadership in AI chips' market share has spill-over benefits across the digital asset world, especially across crypto mining: ASIC Supply Chain Restriction: With demand for AI surging, semiconductor manufacturing facilities like TSMC and Samsung are prioritizing orders for AI chips, restricting supply chains for Bitcoin mining devices. This can lead to increased costs and longer lead times for ASIC miners, restricting profitability. Geopolitical Shifts: Tariffs and trade tensions are leading top ASIC manufacturers to set up production in the US, reshaping the global mining supply chain and even driving up miner expenses. AI-Blockchain Convergence: Mining operators are utilizing AI-driven analytics to optimize operations and supply chains, with blockchain offering transparency and traceability of hardware origins. Nvidia's $4T milestone is a testiment to the robustness of the AI bubble, but the era of Bitcoin keeping pace with Big Tech is likely behind us. As macro dynamics and crypto-native forces come into relief, investors must look for a less overt and more uncertain alignment between the world's leading AI chipmaker and the digital currency monarch.",News|Business,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-10 12:16:44

The cartel now says global oil demand will hit 123 million barrels a day by 2050, up nearly 19% from today’s levels. That number is 3 million more than what the group said just last September. It dropped this projection in the latest World Oil Outlook , published Thursday. It says India will be the biggest driver of that demand, and President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord is part of the reason why fossil fuel use will keep rising. In the report, OPEC says: “The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will impact climate change negotiations and would most likely result in higher demand for hydrocarbons in general, and oil and gas in particular.” The group also claims that even a small increase in U.S. oil demand should be expected in the short term. Despite growing global pressure to phase out fossil fuels, the group is doubling down. It’s not considering a pivot to clean energy. It’s saying: more oil, for longer. OPEC fights the tide while forecasts tighten This view from OPEC puts it at odds with nearly every major energy forecaster. BP, Bank of America, the International Energy Agency, and Wood Mackenzie all say oil demand will peak in the next ten years. That’s mostly because China , which has been the world’s largest oil importer, is already cooling off. These forecasters believe slowing economic growth, improved fuel efficiency, and the global shift to renewables will cap demand. But OPEC’s not buying it. Despite being isolated in its position, it recently started boosting crude supply again. On July 5, the group announced it would return 548,000 barrels a day of idled supply in August. That’s four times what it originally planned. The markets didn’t panic. Brent crude stayed near $70 per barrel in London this week, giving the cartel some fuel for its bullish call. Still, this wouldn’t be the first time it has missed. Its Vienna-based secretariat had predicted much higher oil demand in 2024, only to cut forecasts by 32% over six straight months. In 2023, it imposed deeper output cuts, insisting inventories were tight, but the squeeze never happened. Now, it is projecting oil consumption to rise 9% between 2024 and 2030. That’s the same estimate as last year. But this time, it is backing it with more long-term figures. The report says the growth will come mostly from road transport, petrochemicals, and aviation. And India is expected to take the lead, adding 8.2 million barrels a day by 2050. India and OPEC+ expected to dominate the growth While demand is expected to rise, OPEC says its influence will too. The OPEC+ alliance, which includes Russia, Kazakhstan, and other partners, will go from controlling 48% of the global oil market today to 52% by 2050. The shift is expected as production growth from other countries slows down. Meanwhile, outside OPEC’s report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that U.S. crude stocks rose last week, but gasoline and distillate inventories dropped. Gasoline demand shot up 6%, reaching 9.2 million barrels a day, a sign that American drivers aren’t going electric just yet. There’s more: oil prices slipped Thursday after President Trump announced new tariffs . Traders are worried this could slow the global economy and drag down demand. By 0052 GMT, Brent crude futures were down 22 cents to $69.97 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate lost 27 cents, landing at $68.11 a barrel. But one area where demand isn’t slowing is the sky. J.P. Morgan, in a client note, said that global flight activity hit an all-time high during the first eight days of July, with 107,600 flights per day. Flights in China are back to levels not seen in five months. And freight traffic? Still growing, with ports and cargo hubs showing what J.P. Morgan called “sustained expansion” over last year’s numbers. OPEC is pushing against a wall of doubt, but it’s not blinking. It believes oil isn’t going anywhere, and the bloc is planning for a future where it’s needed even more than today. The rest of the world might call it denial. OPEC calls it a strategy.

After weeks of sideways action and uncertainty, this move marks a small but significant breakout, reigniting bullish sentiment among investors and traders. The breakout comes as Bitcoin continues to consolidate below its all-time highs, allowing ETH and other altcoins to take the lead. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops – Bullish Setup Takes Shape Market participants are closely watching Ethereum’s price action, as its movements often set the tone for the broader altcoin space. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical view highlighting that ETH is once again trading at the top of its recent range. A breakout above this level could confirm the beginning of a larger expansion phase for altcoins. With bullish momentum building and Ethereum holding strong above reclaimed support levels, traders are becoming increasingly confident that the altcoin market may be on the verge of a broader breakout. However, key resistance still lies ahead, and the next few days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum has the strength to continue higher and lead a new leg up in the crypto cycle. Ethereum Trades at Range Highs: Breakout Looms Ethereum has spent the past several weeks consolidating in a well-defined range between approximately $2,400 and $2,800, a structure that began forming in early May. Despite short-term volatility, ETH has held key support levels, suggesting that bulls remain in control. Now, with price action pushing toward the upper boundary of the range once again, the market is watching closely to see whether Ethereum can break through resistance and initiate a sustained rally. The broader macroeconomic backdrop has shifted in favor of risk assets. In the US, strong labor market data and wage growth have helped ease concerns of an economic slowdown. Meanwhile, the resolution of several global geopolitical tensions has reduced uncertainty, allowing markets to stabilize. This supportive environment could give Ethereum the fuel it needs to attempt a breakout. Ted Pillows recently highlighted that Ethereum is now trading at the range highs again — a level that has repeatedly capped price advances in recent months. According to Pillow, a confirmed breakout above the $2,800 resistance would likely trigger renewed momentum for ETH and potentially spark a broader move across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves $2,800 Resistance Now In Sight Ethereum is showing renewed strength as it breaks out of a multi-week consolidation range, with the latest 12-hour candle closing above $2,760. The price action has decisively reclaimed the $2,700 level and is now testing the critical $2,800 resistance zone. This breakout is supported by a clear surge in volume, confirming bullish momentum. The 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages are all trending upwards and currently sit well below the current price, a strong technical sign of sustained momentum. ETH has moved above all three key SMAs, confirming that bulls are in control in the short to medium term. Notably, this is the highest ETH has traded since early June, and the candle structure resembles a classic continuation breakout setup.

However, the key now lies in whether buyers can sustain this move without immediate rejection at resistance. If ETH can hold above $2,700 and build support, the breakout could serve as a launchpad for altcoins, especially as Ethereum often leads broader market moves.

Mid-2025: exchange stats that matter. – Binance tops spot, perps, and USDT flows – Coinbase stays reserve-heavy – OKX, Bybit, and Bitget chase in derivatives pic.twitter.com/w9um78RkCN — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 10, 2025 While Coinbase maintains a strong institutional presence, and competitors like OKX, Bybit, and Bitget continue to capture derivatives users, Binance’s dominance spans both retail and institutional user bases. Exchange Leaders: Binance and Coinbase CryptoQuant’s analysis identifies Binance and Coinbase as the top-performing exchanges in their respective categories. Binance leads in spot volume, futures trading, stablecoin reserves, capital inflows, and on-chain user activity. It is the only platform showing consistent strength across all verticals. In contrast, Coinbase retains its edge as a primary institutional exchange, especially notable in reserve holdings and usage on the Ethereum network. However, Coinbase’s trading activity and market breadth remain more conservative compared to Binance and some mid-tier exchanges. Mid-tier players such as Bybit, OKX, and Bitget maintain competitive momentum in the derivatives space and Ethereum-based stablecoin flows. Their overall capital inflows, reserve growth, and on-chain user activity remain significantly below those of Binance and Coinbase. On-Chain Metrics Reinforce Binance’s User Preference The report highlights that on-chain behavior is increasingly favoring Binance, especially during high-volatility periods. Binance recorded the highest altcoin deposit and withdrawal activity, a signal of active user rotation and engagement during market rallies. On the TRON network, Binance also led in USDT transaction volume, reflecting the platform’s stronghold in low-fee, high-frequency stablecoin trading — a critical function for both retail users and market makers in 2025. While platforms like OKX and Bybit show steady growth in user traffic and niche asset trading, they have not matched Binance’s scale in terms of on-chain dominance or reserve inflow volume. As of mid-2025, Binance’s multi-layered dominance — spanning spot, futures, stablecoins, and on-chain metrics — positions it as the central force in the global crypto exchange landscape, according to CryptoQuant’s dashboard analysis. Coinbase remains a well-capitalized and stable alternative, especially for institutional participants, while other exchanges remain in competitive pursuit but with notable gaps in scale and user engagement.

A groundbreaking initiative, spearheaded by key players in South Korea crypto and Hong Kong crypto , is setting the stage for an unprecedented level of regional collaboration. Imagine a future where digital assets flow seamlessly across borders, powered by a unified vision for innovation and growth. This isn’t just a dream; it’s rapidly becoming a reality with the formation of a preparatory committee for an Asia-wide digital asset consortium. A Historic Alliance: South Korea Crypto Leaders Forge Ahead In a move that signals a profound commitment to advancing the digital economy, the Korea Digital Assets Association (KDAA), a leading South Korean group dedicated to crypto industry development, has joined forces with Jack Kong Jianping, a prominent member of the Hong Kong government’s Task Force on Promoting Web3 Development. This powerful alliance marks the genesis of a preparatory committee for a comprehensive digital asset consortium spanning the entire Asian continent. The announcement, initially reported by The Dong-A Ilbo, has sent ripples of excitement through the global crypto community. The significance of this collaboration cannot be overstated. Both South Korea and Hong Kong are pivotal financial hubs with rapidly evolving regulatory frameworks for digital assets. By uniting their efforts, they aim to create a robust and interconnected ecosystem that can address the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the burgeoning digital asset space in Asia. This proactive step underscores a shared vision for leadership in the global digital finance arena. Hong Kong Crypto Vision: Catalyzing the Asia Crypto Market Hong Kong’s strategic position as an international financial center, coupled with its forward-thinking approach to Web3 and digital assets, makes it an ideal partner in this ambitious endeavor. Jack Kong Jianping’s involvement, representing the Hong Kong government’s dedicated task force, highlights the official backing and serious intent behind this initiative. The collaboration seeks to not only foster innovation but also establish clear guidelines and frameworks that can instill confidence and stability in the burgeoning Asia crypto market . A recent roundtable held in Seoul on July 8 provided a crucial platform for discussing the initial roadmap. Participants delved into various critical topics, showcasing the breadth and depth of the consortium’s ambitions. Key discussions included: Potential Issuance of Stablecoins: Exploring the feasibility and utility of stablecoins backed by major regional currencies such as the Korean won, Hong Kong dollar (HKD), and offshore Chinese yuan (CNH). Multinational Digital Asset Exchange: A proposal to establish a public-private digital asset exchange that operates across multiple Asian jurisdictions, facilitating seamless cross-border transactions. Regional Cooperation Framework: Developing a structured framework to support multilateral agreements in the digital asset space, ensuring harmonized regulations and operational standards. These discussions lay the groundwork for a truly integrated digital asset ecosystem, promising to unlock unprecedented liquidity and efficiency across Asia. Unpacking the Digital Asset Consortium: What Does It Mean? The concept of a digital asset consortium is a powerful one. It signifies a collective effort by various stakeholders – governments, industry associations, private companies, and innovators – to build a shared infrastructure and set common standards for digital assets. For the Asia region, this means: Enhanced Interoperability: Creating seamless connections between different blockchain networks and digital asset platforms, reducing friction in cross-border transactions. Regulatory Clarity: Working towards harmonized regulatory approaches that can provide legal certainty for businesses and investors operating within the region. Innovation Hub: Fostering an environment ripe for new digital asset products, services, and applications, attracting top talent and investment. Risk Mitigation: Implementing robust security measures and compliance protocols to protect users and maintain the integrity of the financial system. The involvement of prominent Hong Kong-based Web3 companies like Nano Labs and MAP Protocol (MAPO) at the Seoul roundtable further underscores the industry’s keen interest and active participation in shaping this future. Their expertise in blockchain technology and Web3 development will be instrumental in building the technical backbone of this ambitious consortium. The Stablecoin Development Frontier: Korean Won, HKD, CNH One of the most exciting prospects discussed was the potential for multi-currency stablecoin development . Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to the value of traditional fiat currencies, are crucial for facilitating stable transactions in the volatile crypto market. The idea of stablecoins backed by the Korean won, Hong Kong dollar, and offshore Chinese yuan presents several compelling advantages: Reduced Volatility: Provides a stable medium of exchange for cross-border trade and remittances within Asia, mitigating the risks associated with cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Enhanced Liquidity: Increases the efficiency of capital flows between these major economies, supporting economic integration. Financial Inclusion: Potentially lowers transaction costs and increases access to financial services for individuals and businesses across the region. Regulatory Oversight: Offers a more transparent and auditable digital currency option, appealing to regulators and traditional financial institutions. The successful implementation of such stablecoins could revolutionize regional trade, investment, and even tourism, making digital payments a seamless part of everyday life across Asia. Driving Web3 Development and Beyond This initiative is not just about digital assets; it’s about driving comprehensive Web3 development across Asia. The collaborative framework aims to create an environment where decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and the metaverse can thrive, supported by robust infrastructure and a clear regulatory landscape. By fostering multilateral agreements, the consortium can ensure that technological advancements are matched by appropriate legal and ethical considerations, building a sustainable and secure digital future. The convergence of public and private sector efforts, exemplified by the KDAA and Hong Kong government’s task force, provides a powerful model for regional cooperation. This collective approach is vital for navigating the complexities of digital asset regulation, ensuring consumer protection, and harnessing the full economic potential of blockchain technology. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the prospects are incredibly exciting, the journey to a fully integrated Asian digital asset ecosystem will undoubtedly face challenges. These include harmonizing diverse regulatory frameworks, ensuring technological interoperability, and building widespread public trust. However, the proactive formation of this preparatory committee demonstrates a strong commitment to overcoming these hurdles through dialogue, collaboration, and innovation. The opportunities, conversely, are immense. A unified Asia crypto market could become a global leader in digital finance, setting new standards for efficiency, security, and accessibility. It could unlock trillions in economic value, empower businesses, and provide unprecedented financial freedom to individuals across the continent. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Asia’s Digital Future The launch of the preparatory committee for an Asia-wide digital asset consortium by South Korea and Hong Kong marks a truly historic moment. This visionary collaboration, focused on everything from multi-currency stablecoins to a multinational digital asset exchange and a regional cooperation framework, is poised to redefine the future of finance in Asia. By uniting the strengths of two leading financial and technological hubs, this initiative promises to unlock immense potential, driving innovation, fostering economic growth, and firmly establishing Asia as a global powerhouse in the digital asset space. The future of the Asia crypto market looks brighter than ever.

47965919,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=763515,1752154219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47965919.jpeg,Binance-backed YZi Labs and 10X Capital to launch publicly listed BNB Treasury Company,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/10x-capital-yzi-lab-take-bnb-treasury-public/,"10X Capital and Binance co-founders’ family office YZi Labs is setting up an investment fund to offer US investors direct exposure to Binance’s native token, BNB. The two financial institutions are collaborating to launch a publicly traded entity called the BNB Treasury Company, which will focus exclusively on acquiring and holding BNB, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. According to a press statement released Thursday, YZi Labs will support 10X Capital in its pursuit of a listing on a US stock exchange. The new fund will reportedly provide both institutional and retail investors in the United States with a regulatory compliant way to invest in the BNB Chain. Backing from Binance founders’ family office YZi Labs, which manages around $10 billion in assets, is the family office of Binance co-founders Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and Yi He. The firm confirmed it will “support” the establishment of the BNB Treasury Company but did not disclose further details of its financial or operational involvement. 10X Capital has assembled a leadership team with years of experience in digital asset management and institutional finance. David Namdar, a senior partner at 10X and co-founder of Galaxy Digital , will co-lead the initiative. Joining him is Russell Read, Chief Investment Officer at 10X Capital and a former CIO at several institutions including CalPERS, the Alaska Permanent Fund, and Deutsche Asset Management. Former Kraken product leader and director Saad Naja will be part of the executive board. Naja sits on the board of Exinity, a global retail brokerage firm. Capital raised to fund initial BNB acquisition 10X Capital has partnered with Cohen & Company Capital Markets and Clear Street LLC to raise funds for the initial purchase of BNB. The investment firm will also manage the treasury company. It has experience in launching digital asset treasury firms, including Nakamoto (Nasdaq: NAKA). The capital raise is almost similar to the iteration of the publicly traded crypto treasury model used by business intelligence firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) to buy Bitcoin under the leadership of Michael Saylor. “BNB is the gas, the glue, and the governance layer for a scalable, decentralized future, powered by builders, for builders,” Ella Zhang, Head of YZi Labs said, speaking on the partnership. Zhang mentioned that the initiative would combine the strengths of BNB’s ecosystem with 10X Capital’s asset management and capital markets capabilities. She reiterated that YZi Labs is still “choosy” with its formal partnerships and would only announce official collaborations via its own channels. Hans Thomas, CEO of 10X Capital, said BNB Chain ’s adoption and technical performance made it the best candidate for US investment exposure. “ BNB Chain powers hundreds of millions of users, yet U.S. investors still lack access to its growth ,” he surmised. “ The time is right for a well-capitalized, institutionally managed treasury company focused solely on BNB .” Institutions move to BNB accumulation in search of gains 10X Capital is among several entities that have made the decision to add BNB to their portfolio. Last week, Chinese Web3 infrastructure company Nano Labs Ltd ., publicly traded on NASDAQ, recently disclosed a $50 million purchase of BNB. The company acquired 74,315 BNB tokens at an average price of $672.45 per coin. Separately, Bloomberg reported on June 23 that a team of former Coral Capital Holdings executives is seeking to raise $100 million to acquire BNB through a Nasdaq-listed firm. Led by Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Johnathan Pasch, the group wants to rename the company Build & Build Corporation and begin accumulating BNB after completing fundraising this month. Aside from its BNB treasury ambitions, YZi Labs is backing one of its affiliates, BounceBit, to offer tokenized stock trading by the fourth quarter of 2025. In a July 2 post on X, BounceBit said it plans to make securities from the US, Europe, Hong Kong, and Japan available on-chain. “ The idea is simple: take real-world public market assets and make them instantly accessible onchain, ” the post read.

However, these two leading meme coins seem to have grown too big for investors’ appetites, leading investors to smaller meme coins for better gains. One such meme coin, FLOKI, has been gaining ground as one of the top meme coins that could see a major rally soon as the stars begin to align. FLOKI Gearing Up For 300% Surge To ATHs In an X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst $SHIB KNIGHT pointed out an interesting formation on the FLOKI price chart. According to the analyst, the meme coin is already setting up for a major move after forming a Bullish Falling Wedge pattern on its weekly chart. Historically, the formation of this bullish falling wedge pattern signals that a bottom has been reached and it’s time for a move up. In addition to this bullish formation on the FLOKI price chart, there is also the fact that the meme coin has been putting in higher lows lately. This began after it hit a low just above $0.00006 following the price crash that rocked the crypto market over the last month. Since then, there have been some pullbacks, but the meme coin has not fallen below this bottom. If this bullish pattern holds and the crypto market maintains its uptrend, then the analyst predicts an over 300% rally for the FLOKI price . At the time of writing, the meme coin’s price is still trending just above $0.00008, but the crypto analyst sees it exploding to as high as $0.0004 once the breakout is complete. The FLOKI price all-time high is $0.0003462, reached back in June 2024, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Therefore, a rise to $0.0004 would mean a new all-time high, making it one of the best candidates among the leading meme coins in terms of returns. The Meme Coin For Max Gains Just like $SHIB KNIGHT, another crypto analyst, The Crypto Express, has called out FLOKI as a meme coin that could start rallying soon. The analysis pointed to a breakout of the descending broadening wedge pattern with significant volume, showing a lot of interest in the meme coin. With this newfound bullish momentum and the 50-day Moving Average (MA) providing support for the meme coin, FLOKI looks ready to explode . The analyst explained that if a successful retest of this breakout level above $0.000084 is confirmed, then it could signal a continuation of the breakout. In the same vein, another analyst, Cryptorphic, paints a bullish rally to $0.00011533 following the breakout of a falling wedge structure. Once reached, this target would form the next resistance to beat in the campaign for new all-time highs.",meme coins|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Floki|FLOKI news|FLOKI price|FLOKIUSD|FLOKIUSDT|meme coin|Meme coin news|Meme coins news|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-10 13:30:49

Analyst Matthew (@OneBasedMoney) suggests it follows a power law model , doubling roughly every 12.7% of its lifespan—indicating exponential, not linear, growth. Currently, Bitcoin is in a quiet phase, often a precursor to major bullish runs. Macro Outlook & Scarcity Matthew compares Bitcoin to fiat money supply (~$26T), which is expected to rise due to future monetary easing. As fiat is devalued, scarce assets like Bitcoin (21M cap) become more attractive, reinforcing its role as a hedge against inflation. Price Target: $250K–$350K by End of 2025 Based on his model, Bitcoin could reach $250,000–$350,000 by late 2025 / early 2026 , aligning with previous cycle peaks. Matthew believes Bitcoin’s value is now driven 95% by internal adoption trends—not macro events—highlighting a maturing market led by users, tech, and institutions. Final Surge Likely While long-term growth may slow, a euphoric end-of-cycle rally remains probable, fueled by rising spot ETF interest and institutional flows. However, questions linger about Bitcoin’s role as fiat expands and markets evolve. Conclusion: Bullish Outlook Despite uncertainties, Bitcoin’s fundamentals—fixed supply, growing adoption, and institutional interest—support a strong bullish case.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. WhiteBIT’s native token WBT hits an all-time high, surging over 60% in five days and solidifying its role as a top utility token in the growing web3 ecosystem. WhiteBIT , the largest European cryptocurrency exchange by traffic has had a major milestone for its native token, WBT . The token has demonstrated long-term strength and growing utility, reaching new price highs and reinforcing its role as a core asset in the evolving web3 landscape. WBT demonstrates strong market performance Amid ongoing volatility across the crypto sector, WBT recorded a more than 60% price surge in just five days (June 2025), peaking at an all-time high of $52.27. Currently trading around 14% below its ATH, WBT is showing strong consolidation above $45,03, supported by active user demand and favorable technical indicators. WBT now boasts a market capitalization of $6.48 billion and is among the top 30 cryptocurrencies on CoinGecko as of July 2025. On-chain activity has also surged, with a 580% increase in daily active addresses, alongside notable whale accumulation patterns tracked by Santiment. Technical indicators such as Aroon and MACD confirm strong upward momentum. A token of trust and utility Since its launch in 2022, WBT has become a core element of WhiteBIT’s ecosystem. It provides users with exclusive features, reduced fees, access to loyalty programs, and will soon be part of additional staking and cross-platform features. Despite recent global tensions affecting most major assets, WBT remained one of the few tokens showing consistent positive momentum, backed by strategic exchange initiatives and a transparent roadmap. “WBT’s continued momentum reflects our focus on long-term value creation, product utility, and community engagement,” said Volodymyr Nosov, Founder and President of WhiteBIT Group. “WBT is a true utility token, tightly integrated across our infrastructure of over 12 WhiteBIT products, from exchange services to blockchain tools. As this ecosystem grows, so does the demand and value of WBT. We’re building not just a token, but a scalable digital economy aligned with transparency and innovation.” Smart tokenomics driving sustainable growth WBT has a total supply of 400 million tokens, with 200 million allocated as treasury tokens. These are being gradually unlocked over a three-year period, helping to stabilize market dynamics and avoid excessive inflation. WhiteBIT also regularly conducts token burns as part of its long-term deflationary strategy, managing circulating supply and supporting potential value appreciation. Strategic partnerships fueling ecosystem expansion The growth of WBT is further supported by WhiteBIT’s recently announced partnership with Juventus , one of Europe’s most iconic football clubs. This collaboration amplifies brand visibility and user adoption across key regions, aligning with WhiteBIT’s broader expansion efforts and community outreach. Looking ahead With several major campaigns, integrations, and strategic announcements on the horizon, including a new cross-industry partnership, WBT is positioned for sustained growth. Its resilience during periods of global market uncertainty reinforces its reputation as a stable, utility-focused asset. WhiteBIT remains committed to transparency and sustainability in the crypto space, building trust through responsible development and data-driven strategies. About WhiteBIT WhiteBIT is the largest European cryptocurrency exchange by traffic, offering over 820 trading pairs, 330+ assets, and supporting 9 fiat currencies.

Recently, a significant piece of news emerged that has captured the attention of investors, innovators, and policymakers alike: Ant Group, the Chinese fintech giant, is reportedly planning to support Circle’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, on its blockchain platform. This revelation, initially reported by JinSe Finance, is far more than just a technical integration; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine the landscape of digital transactions, especially within China’s complex regulatory environment. If confirmed and implemented, this move by Ant Group to embrace Ant Group USDC support could signify a monumental shift, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of stablecoins. What is Ant Group’s Blockchain Platform, and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into the implications of USDC support, it’s crucial to understand the foundation upon which this integration is proposed: Ant Group’s blockchain platform. Often referred to as AntChain, this enterprise-grade blockchain service is not a decentralized public ledger in the vein of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it is a highly scalable, secure, and permissioned blockchain network designed for business applications. AntChain has been instrumental in various sectors within China, powering everything from supply chain finance and digital copyright protection to cross-border trade and smart city initiatives. Why is AntChain a significant Blockchain Platform? Scale and Reach: AntChain boasts impressive transaction capabilities, handling billions of transactions daily, making it one of the largest commercial blockchain platforms globally. Its integration into Ant Group’s vast ecosystem, which includes Alipay, gives it unparalleled reach within China’s digital economy. Enterprise Focus: Unlike public blockchains, AntChain is built to meet the stringent requirements of enterprises, offering enhanced privacy, security, and regulatory compliance features. This makes it an ideal candidate for facilitating sensitive financial transactions. Government Alignment: While private, AntChain operates within the regulatory frameworks set by the Chinese government, often aligning with national strategies for digital infrastructure and innovation. This context is vital when considering the support for a foreign stablecoin like USDC. The very nature of AntChain as a robust, enterprise-focused Blockchain Platform makes it a powerful conduit for new financial services, and its potential to host a widely adopted stablecoin like USDC is a testament to its capabilities and strategic importance. Understanding USDC: The Global Stablecoin Set to Make Waves in China Circle’s USDC, or USD Coin, is one of the most widely used and regulated stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market. Pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, USDC is fully backed by reserves consisting of cash and short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds, held in segregated accounts with regulated U.S. financial institutions. This transparency and regulatory compliance have made USDC a preferred choice for institutional adoption and cross-border transactions. Key characteristics of USDC: Stability: Its 1:1 peg to the US dollar offers price stability, making it a reliable medium of exchange in the volatile crypto market. Transparency and Auditability: Circle, the issuer of USDC, provides monthly attestations of its reserves, ensuring transparency and building trust among users and regulators. Programmability: As a digital asset on various blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, etc.), USDC is programmable, enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to leverage its stable value. Global Reach: USDC is used worldwide for remittances, trading, payments, and DeFi activities, making it a truly Global Stablecoin . The prospect of Ant Group USDC support is significant because it brings a highly regulated and widely accepted dollar-pegged stablecoin into an ecosystem with massive user adoption and established financial infrastructure. This could unlock new avenues for international commerce and digital finance that were previously difficult to navigate. The Strategic Alliance: Why Ant Group is Embracing Global Stablecoins The news of Ant Group considering USDC support raises a critical question: why would a Chinese fintech giant, operating under strict capital controls and a robust digital yuan initiative, embrace a foreign dollar-pegged stablecoin? The answer likely lies in the strategic advantages and the evolving global financial landscape. Potential Motivations for Ant Group’s USDC Support: Facilitating Cross-Border Transactions: Despite the digital yuan’s push, there’s a clear need for efficient, transparent, and low-cost cross-border payments, especially for businesses engaged in international trade. USDC could serve as a neutral, stable bridge for these transactions, reducing reliance on traditional, slower, and more expensive banking rails. This aligns perfectly with the need for a seamless Global Stablecoin solution. Enhancing Service Offerings: Integrating a stablecoin like USDC could allow Ant Group to offer new financial products and services to its vast user base, particularly those involved in international business. This could include faster settlement for trade finance, easier access to global markets, or even innovative digital asset management solutions. Maintaining Competitive Edge: As other global fintechs and blockchain platforms explore stablecoin integrations, Ant Group’s move ensures it remains at the forefront of digital finance innovation. It’s a proactive step to adapt to the changing demands of global commerce. Exploring Digital Asset Utility: While China has a strict stance on cryptocurrencies, the utility of stable digital assets for specific enterprise and cross-border use cases is undeniable. This could be a controlled exploration of how such assets can complement existing financial infrastructure without undermining monetary sovereignty. This strategic alliance underscores a pragmatic approach from Ant Group, recognizing the utility of stablecoins in a globalized digital economy, even as China develops its own central bank digital currency. China’s Evolving Digital Landscape: A New Era for Fintech Innovation? China’s relationship with cryptocurrencies has historically been complex, characterized by strict bans on trading and mining. However, the country has simultaneously been a pioneer in central bank digital currency (CBDC) development with the e-CNY (digital yuan). The potential support for USDC by Ant Group, a company with deep ties to the Chinese financial system, adds another fascinating layer to this narrative, hinting at a nuanced approach to Fintech Innovation . Navigating the Nuances: Distinction from Speculative Crypto: It’s crucial to understand that supporting a stablecoin like USDC, especially within a permissioned enterprise blockchain, is fundamentally different from allowing speculative cryptocurrency trading. The focus here is on utility, efficiency, and controlled financial flows rather than decentralized, anonymous transactions. Complementing the Digital Yuan: Rather than competing directly, USDC could potentially complement the e-CNY. While the digital yuan aims to digitize domestic cash and enhance monetary control, USDC could serve specific international business needs where a dollar-pegged asset is more suitable. Regulatory Sandbox: This move might be seen as a form of a controlled regulatory sandbox, allowing Ant Group to explore the benefits of stablecoin technology for specific use cases under close supervision, without opening the floodgates to broader crypto adoption. This measured approach could foster further Fintech Innovation within defined boundaries. This development suggests that while China remains cautious about decentralized cryptocurrencies, it is open to leveraging the underlying technology of digital assets for strategic economic benefits, particularly in areas like cross-border trade and supply chain finance. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for China Stablecoin Adoption While the prospect of Ant Group supporting USDC is exciting, it’s not without its challenges. The path to widespread China Stablecoin adoption, especially for a foreign-pegged asset, will require careful navigation of regulatory, economic, and geopolitical complexities. Key Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Clarity: The biggest hurdle will be obtaining explicit regulatory approval from Chinese authorities. Given China’s strict stance on capital controls and its push for the digital yuan, the terms and conditions under which USDC can operate on AntChain will be critical. Will it be limited to specific enterprise use cases, or could it see broader application? Competition with the Digital Yuan: While potentially complementary, there will inevitably be questions about how a dollar-pegged stablecoin coexists with China’s sovereign digital currency. The government will likely ensure the e-CNY remains the primary digital medium for domestic transactions. Data Privacy and Control: Any integration will need to comply with China’s stringent data privacy and security laws. How data related to USDC transactions on AntChain will be handled, stored, and potentially accessed by authorities will be a key concern for both users and Circle. Geopolitical Tensions: The broader geopolitical relationship between the U.S. and China could influence the long-term viability of such a collaboration. A dollar-pegged stablecoin operating within a major Chinese financial platform could become a point of contention. Despite these challenges, the opportunities for a legitimate China Stablecoin solution are immense. It could significantly enhance the efficiency of international trade, reduce friction in cross-border payments for Chinese businesses, and potentially set a precedent for how other nations approach the integration of private stablecoins into their digital economies. What Does This Mean for the Global Digital Asset Market? The ripple effects of Ant Group’s potential USDC support extend far beyond China’s borders. This development could have profound implications for the broader global digital asset market. Legitimization of Stablecoins: A major fintech player like Ant Group embracing USDC would further legitimize stablecoins as a crucial component of the global financial infrastructure, moving them beyond purely speculative assets. Precedent for Enterprise Adoption: This could encourage other large enterprises and traditional financial institutions worldwide to explore similar integrations, accelerating the adoption of blockchain and stablecoin technology for real-world use cases. Increased Interoperability: If successful, it could foster greater interoperability between different blockchain networks and traditional financial systems, paving the way for a more connected and efficient global financial ecosystem. Focus on Compliance and Regulation: The complexities involved in this integration will highlight the critical importance of regulatory compliance, transparency, and robust governance frameworks for stablecoin issuers and users alike. This move, if it materializes fully, will serve as a powerful case study for the future of digital finance, demonstrating how large, established players can integrate innovative blockchain solutions while navigating complex regulatory landscapes. Conclusion: A Pivotal Step Towards a Connected Digital Future The news of Ant Group’s plans to support USDC on its blockchain platform is a truly monumental development in the world of digital finance. It represents a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of stablecoins, particularly within a highly regulated and strategically important market like China. While challenges related to regulation, competition with the digital yuan, and geopolitical factors remain, the potential benefits—from enhanced cross-border payments to fostering new forms of Fintech Innovation —are undeniable. This move by Ant Group could redefine the utility of a Global Stablecoin within an enterprise Blockchain Platform , offering a glimpse into a future where digital assets seamlessly facilitate international commerce. As the world watches how Ant Group USDC integration unfolds, it will undoubtedly provide valuable insights into the delicate balance between innovation, regulation, and national economic interests in the rapidly evolving digital economy. It’s a testament to the transformative power of blockchain technology and stablecoins in shaping our financial future.

After closing 0.6% higher on Wednesday, the S&P 500 opened near the flatline and is hugging its record high zone. The S&P 500, the benchmark index, was up 0.06%, benefiting from the upbeat sentiment around Nvidia (NVDA), a company that has rode the overall bullish outlook for stocks to storm to the $4 trillion valuation.

The VC fund and gaming startup will contribute up to $100M for its treasury strategy. Anomica Brands struck a partnership with DDC Enterprise, with the goal of injecting $100M for BTC treasury expansion. With this move, Animoca Brands shifts its attention from Web3 startups and games, aiming to allocate a part of its assets back to BTC. So far, Animoca Brands has raised $825.9M, which have been used for its own games, as well as for startups. The company started its fundraising efforts in 2015, and continued through several bull markets, building up a significant ETH and BTC treasury. The exact BTC holdings are not specified, but the company has an extensive crypto portfolio, accrued over the years. “ Our partnership with DDC enables Animoca Brands to enhance the value of our blockchain technologies and maximize the value of our Bitcoin holdings,” added Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands. Animoca Brands joined the BTC treasury trend after slowing down its VC investments into riskier early-stage projects. Animoca Brands to advice on BTC yield strategies DDC Enterprise Limited (DDC) signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Animoca Brands. The fund will help DDC to develop and implement yield strategy for the current BTC treasury. Animoca Brands will extend help and allocate up to $100M in BTC toward yield enhancement strategies operated by DDC. The move will accelerate the DDC accumulation strategy, in addition to its recent $528M financing package. The fundraising is split between PIPE raises, a $300M convertible note, $200M equity line, and a $2M equity private placement. Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, will join DDC’s Bitcoin Visionary Council, providing guidance on the company’s Bitcoin treasury operations. DDC has a relatively small treasury of 138 BTC, starting out in May this year. The company’s BTC treasury is part of the latest wave of companies pivoting into BTC and planning larger purchases with the help of credit facilities. Animoca Brands is also involved with DigitalX, an Australian treasury company. The fund invested just $20.7M into DigitalX, as a precursor to its largest deal to date. DDC trades near a six-month high DDC is one of the treasury companies that benefitted from its BTC purchases in the short term. The stock is trading near its highest level for the year to date period, recovering to $11. However, DDC is still far from its peak from November 2023, when the stock traded above $155. Unlike other treasury companies, DDC will continue expanding its food business, retaining BTC as its core reserve asset. DDC has promised an aggressive accumulation strategy, while still retaining a portfolio of food brands. Despite the sliding stock price, the DDC portfolio of brands is on the verge of being cash-positive, making for a viable combination of real-world business and a BTC treasury. Previously, DDC has stated it intends to build a treasury of 5,000 BTC, turning into a medium-sized corporate holder. The company is one of the first to mix financing deals for acquiring BTC, while tapping a partner that may have coins on hand for an OTC deal.

For investors holding Quiztok (QTCON) , a recent announcement from two of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb , has sent ripples through the community. Both platforms officially declared QTCON as a closely monitored asset , a decision made under the purview of the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance ( DAXA ). This development isn’t just a routine update; it signals a critical period for QTCON and its holders, prompting a deeper look into what such a designation entails and its potential ramifications. What Does ‘Closely Monitored Asset’ Really Mean for Your Holdings? When a cryptocurrency exchange designates an asset as ‘closely monitored,’ it’s essentially a yellow flag, a formal warning that the asset is under intense scrutiny. This isn’t a direct delisting notice, but it’s often the precursor to one if underlying issues are not addressed. For Quiztok (QTCON) , this means the project and its token will be subject to heightened review by Upbit and Bithumb , along with other DAXA members. The reasons for such a designation can vary widely, but they typically revolve around concerns regarding the project’s viability, operational stability, market integrity, or regulatory compliance. Increased Scrutiny: Exchanges will thoroughly examine the project’s development roadmap, financial health, team activities, community engagement, and most importantly, its tokenomics and market behavior. Risk to Liquidity: Such announcements often lead to a significant drop in trading volume and liquidity as investors become cautious or move to exit their positions. This can make it harder for holders to sell their QTCON at desirable prices. Price Volatility: Negative news of this nature almost invariably triggers price depreciation. The asset may experience sharp declines as panic selling ensues, further impacting investor confidence. Potential Delisting: While not immediate, the ultimate consequence of failing to resolve the issues leading to monitoring is delisting. If QTCON cannot meet the exchanges’ criteria within the designated monitoring period, it risks being removed from these major trading platforms, severely limiting its accessibility and potentially rendering it illiquid. Who is DAXA and Why Does Their Decision Impact Upbit and Bithumb? The Digital Asset eXchange Alliance ( DAXA ) is a consultative group formed by South Korea’s top cryptocurrency exchanges, including industry giants like Upbit , Bithumb , Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax. Established in the wake of significant market volatility and a need for enhanced investor protection, DAXA aims to foster a safer and more transparent digital asset environment. Its primary objectives include: Joint Market Monitoring: Collaboratively monitoring digital assets for suspicious activities, market manipulation, or project instability. Investor Protection: Implementing common standards and guidelines to protect investors from fraudulent projects or sudden collapses. Self-Regulation: Providing a framework for self-regulation among member exchanges to preempt potential regulatory interventions and ensure market integrity. Information Sharing: Facilitating the sharing of critical information regarding asset risks, delisting criteria, and market trends among its members. When DAXA collectively decides to designate an asset like Quiztok (QTCON) as ‘closely monitored,’ it carries significant weight. This is not just one exchange making a decision; it’s a coordinated effort by the leading players in the South Korean market. This collective action ensures a unified approach to risk management and investor protection, making the impact of such a designation far-reaching and difficult for the project to mitigate without substantial changes. What are the Possible Reasons Behind QTCON’s Scrutiny? While the exact reasons for Quiztok (QTCON) being designated a closely monitored asset are not always fully disclosed by exchanges, common factors that lead to such decisions include: Low Trading Volume and Liquidity: A consistent lack of trading activity can indicate waning interest, a small user base, or even market manipulation. Exchanges prefer assets with healthy liquidity to ensure fair price discovery and ease of trading. Project Development Concerns: If the project team fails to meet its roadmap milestones, provides insufficient updates, or shows signs of inactivity, it raises red flags about its long-term viability. Team Transparency and Communication: Lack of clear communication from the project team, especially regarding significant developments or challenges, can erode trust among investors and exchanges. Regulatory Compliance Issues: Changes in regulatory landscapes or concerns about a project’s adherence to financial regulations can trigger scrutiny. This is particularly relevant in South Korea’s increasingly stringent crypto environment. Technical Issues or Security Vulnerabilities: Any major bugs, network instability, or security breaches can lead to an asset being flagged for review. For Quiztok (QTCON) , the coming weeks will be crucial. The project team will likely need to engage proactively with Upbit , Bithumb , and DAXA to provide reassurances and demonstrate a clear path forward. Failure to do so could lead to more severe consequences, including delisting. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for QTCON Holders If you are holding Quiztok (QTCON) , this news undoubtedly brings uncertainty. Here are some actionable insights to consider during this critical period: Stay Informed: Closely monitor official announcements from Upbit , Bithumb , and the Quiztok project team. Official channels are the most reliable source of information. Avoid relying solely on social media rumors. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that the value of your QTCON holdings is now at a significantly higher risk. Determine if you are comfortable with this elevated risk profile. Review Your Portfolio: Consider the proportion of QTCON in your overall crypto portfolio. Over-exposure to a high-risk asset can have disproportionate impacts. Prepare for Volatility: Expect significant price swings. If you decide to hold, be prepared for potential further depreciation or sudden surges based on news. Consider Your Options: You have a few choices: Hold: If you believe the project can overcome the challenges and the team can address the exchanges’ concerns, you might choose to hold, accepting the high risk. Sell: If you are risk-averse or believe the project is unlikely to recover, selling your QTCON now, even at a loss, might be a strategy to preserve capital. Reduce Exposure: You could sell a portion of your holdings to mitigate some risk while still retaining some exposure if the project recovers. Diversify: This situation underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio. Spreading your investments across various assets reduces the impact of a single asset’s poor performance. The Broader Impact: South Korea’s Stricter Crypto Landscape The designation of Quiztok (QTCON) as a closely monitored asset by major players like Upbit and Bithumb is not an isolated incident. It reflects a broader trend in South Korea’s evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The country has been at the forefront of implementing stricter regulations to protect investors and prevent illicit activities within the crypto space. The formation and active role of DAXA itself is a testament to this commitment. Regulators and exchanges are increasingly focused on: Investor Protection: Ensuring that retail investors are protected from highly speculative or fraudulent projects. Market Integrity: Preventing market manipulation, wash trading, and other activities that distort fair price discovery. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF): Implementing robust systems to comply with global financial standards. Project Due Diligence: Holding projects accountable for their stated goals, technical developments, and financial stability. This stringent approach, while sometimes seen as restrictive by some in the crypto community, aims to foster a more mature and sustainable market. For projects operating in South Korea, meeting these elevated standards is no longer optional but a necessity for survival and growth. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Quiztok (QTCON) The designation of Quiztok (QTCON) as a closely monitored asset by Upbit and Bithumb , under the guidance of DAXA , marks a significant turning point for the project. It highlights the increasing vigilance of major exchanges and regulatory bodies in safeguarding market integrity and investor interests. For QTCON holders, this news demands immediate attention and careful consideration of their investment strategy. While the future of QTCON remains uncertain, this situation serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in the crypto market and the paramount importance of thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, such monitoring and self-regulatory actions are likely to become more common, shaping a safer, albeit more scrutinized, environment for digital assets.

According to the project’s tokenomics, the total issuance will amount to 1 trillion PUMP. During the ICO, the ”meme-token factory” plans to sell 33% of the tokens at $0.004 per coin—18% in private rounds to institutional buyers and 15% in public offerings. The sale will last until July 15 or until all assets are sold. U.S. and U.K. residents cannot participate in the public sale. The initial offering will take place on the centralized exchanges Bybit, Kraken, Bitget, and MEXC. Token Distribution The remaining tokens will be allocated as follows: 24% to community and ecosystem initiatives 20% to the team 13% to investors 4.4% to project funds 3% for streaming 2.6% for liquidity The Pump.fun team did not disclose additional information about an airdrop or other incentive initiatives for the community. According to DeFi Llama , the meme-token platform has generated nearly $715 million in revenue since launching in January 2024. Pump.fun earned more than $35 million in the last month. However, the project has a competitor on the Solana network—LetsBonk. On July 8, LetsBonk’s launchpad overtook Pump.fun in terms of daily revenue and the number of tokens launched. Experts Warn of Pump.fun’s Waning Influence Among Token Launch Platforms Pump.fun's dominance among Solana-launchpads may shake as new players experiment with income distribution settings, ”binding curves,” and other mechanics. Blockworks Research writes that. According to experts, such platforms have become the ”basic primitive” of public marketplaces. Pump.fun currently holds the lead with over 200,000 tokens created per week, and the exit rate on the DEX is approaching 2%. The pace has halved since January, but relative to the summer of 2024 has increased by more than 100%.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|AIRDROP|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-10 13:52:14

The launch, developed in collaboration with the Apex Fusion Foundation, will create a Cardano-native asset that provides access to the Apex Fusion ecosystem. The wrapped utility token will operate natively on Cardano ( ADA ), enabling interoperability between the Cardano and Apex Fusion networks. Users will be able to engage in cross-chain value transfers between the two blockchain ecosystems. Token integration and trading The cAP3X token will be compatible with Cardano wallets and DeFi protocols, with plans to establish an ADA/cAP3X trading pair and provide initial liquidity for Cardano-based decentralized exchanges. After deployment in July, users can transfer cAP3X from Cardano to PRIME Chain, Apex Fusion’s UTXO Layer 1 blockchain, using the Skyline Bridge. Once bridged to PRIME, cAP3X converts to native AP3X at a 1:1 ratio for use across Apex Fusion protocols. Staking rewards The native AP3X tokens on PRIME Chain can be staked in Apex staking pools, offering up to 10% APY rewards through liquid staking mechanisms currently active on the network. PRIME Chain combines Bitcoin’s UTXO security model with Ethereum’s ( ETH ) smart contract functionality, utilizing the Ouroboros consensus mechanism for staking operations. The network aims to address blockchain fragmentation by integrating existing networks. Following the token deployment and liquidity setup, bridge activation and staking features will become available on PRIME Chain. Technical documentation and integration guides will be released prior to the wrapped token launch to support developers and users. Featured image via Shutterstock.

In a parallel development, Tron founder Justin Sun has committed $100 million to Trump’s TRUMP meme coin and is facilitating its launch on the Tron blockchain, further tightening the ties between the Tron network and Trump-aligned crypto initiatives. Trump-Backed World Liberty Financial Nears Key Milestone as Community Backs Proposal to Make WLFI Token Tradable In a decisive move that could reshape the political and economic dynamics of the crypto industry, World Liberty Financial (WLF) — the controversial digital asset platform backed by President Donald Trump and his sons — has opened voting on a pivotal proposal to make its governance token, WLFI, tradable. The proposal had received over 99% support from community members, positioning the platform for a historic transformation if the vote passes before its July 16 deadline. The initiative marks a significant shift in the evolution of the World Liberty ecosystem, aiming to unlock wider participation in the protocol by allowing users to freely trade the WLFI token on secondary markets. However, the proposal clarifies that “founders, team, and advisor tokens” — which include the substantial holdings of Trump and his family — will remain locked for the time being, likely in an effort to mitigate criticism surrounding potential insider advantage or manipulation. “This would mark a major milestone in the development of the World Liberty Financial ecosystem and opens the door for broader community participation, access, and protocol development,” the official proposal states. Founded in 2024, World Liberty Financial quickly became one of the most high-profile projects in the crypto space, not least due to the direct involvement of President Trump and his sons — Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Barron Trump — alongside co-founders Chase Herro and Zak Folkman. The platform’s mission has been to create a decentralized financial infrastructure rooted in American exceptionalism and “freedom-centric” values. However, its rapid growth has come with intense scrutiny. The president’s active participation in crypto — particularly through World Liberty — has raised red flags among ethics watchdogs and political opponents. Critics argue that Trump is using his political position to drive regulatory outcomes favorable to his own investments, a charge he and his allies have denied. According to Bloomberg, the president’s crypto ventures have added at least $620 million to his personal portfolio in the past several months. In June, Trump reported $57.4 million in income from World Liberty alone and disclosed personal holdings of over 15.75 billion WLFI tokens. Despite this, the Trump family has reportedly been reducing its stake in the company, which currently stands at 40% as of June 2025, down from a majority position in late 2024. WLFI Trading Vote: What It Means for Token Holders Tokenholders have already cast more than five billion votes, with the overwhelming majority in favor of enabling trading for WLFI. If passed, the proposal could immediately enhance the utility and liquidity of the token, potentially making it a centerpiece in the burgeoning ecosystem that includes decentralized apps, a stablecoin (USD1), and governance protocols. Still, concerns linger about centralization and insider control. While the proposal maintains that Trump family-held tokens will remain non-tradable for now, questions remain about how future governance decisions will be shaped, especially as Trump’s political influence continues to intersect with crypto regulation. The move to make WLFI tradable comes at a politically sensitive moment. Starting this week, Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives are expected to advance three major crypto-related bills, including the much-debated GENIUS Act — short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins. The legislation aims to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins in the US. The bill initially stalled in the Senate due to concerns over Trump’s ties to World Liberty and its USD1 stablecoin, which has been positioned as a potential US dollar-backed competitor to USDC and USDT. The controversy was reignited in May, when Eric Trump announced that an Abu Dhabi-based investment group would use USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance. Despite Democratic opposition, the bill eventually passed after a second Senate vote in June, aided by shifting alliances and lobbying from pro-crypto groups within the Republican Party. Future Outlook: Trading Approval Could Set Off Ripple Effects If the WLFI proposal is approved as expected, it would mark a turning point not only for World Liberty Financial but also for the broader relationship between US politics and digital assets. With the president and his family still holding massive influence in both realms, any development within the WLFI ecosystem is likely to have political reverberations — particularly as Trump eyes a second term and deepens his pro-crypto policy agenda. Analysts say the token becoming tradable could lead to a surge in market speculation, increased institutional interest, and deeper integration of WLFI into DeFi protocols. However, others warn of potential volatility and manipulation risks if governance mechanisms aren't further decentralized in tandem. With voting scheduled to conclude on July 16, all eyes are now on the WLFI community and the broader crypto market’s reaction. If approved, the tradability of the token could trigger a new phase of market engagement — and raise fresh questions about how political figures should navigate their dual roles as policymakers and market participants. Justin Sun Commits $100 Million to Trump Meme Coin as Tron-TRUMP Alliance Deepens In related news, the world of crypto and politics continues to intertwine as Tron founder Justin Sun announced a staggering $100 million investment in President Donald Trump’s TRUMP meme coin, signaling a bold new phase in the alliance between two of the most controversial figures in their respective domains. The announcement came just two days after Tron DAO confirmed that the Solana-born meme coin would be launching on the Tron blockchain, further strengthening the partnership between Sun’s Tron ecosystem and Trump’s growing influence in digital assets. Sun and Trump: From Memes to Millions Sun’s backing of the TRUMP token isn’t new—but the size of his commitment and the growing list of personal and financial ties to Trump’s ecosystem mark a striking evolution in the relationship. Earlier this year, Sun was spotted at a VIP gala dinner hosted by President Trump, where he was reportedly the largest individual holder of TRUMP tokens, with $19 million worth of the meme coin on Solana, according to CNBC . Now, with the token expanding to Tron and a nine-figure investment on the table, Sun appears to be doubling down on Trump-aligned crypto initiatives that have captivated MAGA-aligned traders and retail investors alike. Sun’s relationship with Trump’s crypto empire predates this week’s $100 million commitment. In late 2024, shortly after Trump’s re-election, Sun invested $30 million into World Liberty Financial (WLF). By early 2025, Sun had increased that stake to $75 million, later accepting a formal advisory role at World Liberty. The project, which runs a USD-backed stablecoin and governance token (WLFI), has quickly become a flagship for crypto-leaning nationalists and decentralization advocates. In a twist that speaks to the strength of the alliance, World Liberty also made a reciprocal investment in Sun’s own project, purchasing millions of dollars worth of TRX tokens in January 2025. The circular funding model suggests a shared interest in building parallel crypto financial infrastructure that operates outside the confines of traditional systems—and increasingly outside the reach of politically adversarial regulators. A Calculated Political Bet Amid Legal Turmoil While Sun’s aggressive support for Trump’s crypto ventures may appear to be purely strategic or ideological, there may also be legal incentives at play. In March 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Sun and three of his companies—including Tron Foundation Limited—for allegedly offering and selling TRX and BitTorrent Token (BTT) through unregistered bounty programs that allegedly violated securities laws. But the regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically under the Trump administration. The SEC, now headed by Paul Atkins, has softened its stance on many crypto-related cases—particularly those involving key figures or projects aligned with the current political leadership. This week, a joint “motion to stay” was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York by lawyers representing both Sun and the SEC. The motion signals that negotiations may be underway to settle or delay further action in the case—potentially paving the way for Sun’s full return to the US crypto scene. Ecosystem Expansion: TRUMP Moves to Tron The expansion of the TRUMP meme coin to Tron’s blockchain marks a critical step in its evolution beyond a viral meme. With the Tron network’s low transaction costs and high throughput, the move is expected to facilitate broader retail adoption and enable smart contract integrations for DeFi use cases, NFTs, and more. The official X account for the meme coin, @GetTrumpMemes, confirmed the launch with a celebratory post praising the move as a “natural progression” for a token that began as a cultural movement but has now drawn attention from crypto whales and political elites alike.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BTT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-10 14:00:00

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) stated on Thursday that it will work with partners to test stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and a pilot wholesale CBDC under the second phase of Project Acacia. Project Acacia, launched with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre last November, will run its phase two trials over the next six months, with results expected in early 2026. The pilot will test 24 use cases, including 19 with real funds and five proofs-of-concept using simulated transactions, covering asset classes such as fixed income, private markets, trade receivables, and carbon credits. Major Banks and Global Partners Join Trials Three of Australia’s “Big Four” banks—Commonwealth Bank (CBA), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and Westpac—will participate in the trial, alongside local fintechs and global players. CBA will partner with JPMorgan to explore the potential of digital currencies and tokenized collateral in the repo market, which is critical for liquidity management and monetary policy. “The repo market represents an ideal starting point for this exploration,” said Sophie Gilder, CBA’s managing director of blockchain and digital assets. ANZ, meanwhile, will test tokenized trade payables to help suppliers improve working capital and cash flow management, and will conduct trials on tokenized fixed-income instruments using a wholesale CBDC to enable risk-free credit and liquidity settlement. These trials aim to assess how digital assets could bring efficiency, transparency, and liquidity to financial markets while reducing counterparty risk, with the pilot also examining the potential for banks to hold accounts at the RBA under new frameworks. Regulatory Support for Digital Asset Innovation in Australia The Australia Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has granted regulatory relief to trial participants, allowing them to test digital assets that currently fall outside existing legal frameworks. ASIC Commissioner Kate O’Rourke said the regulator sees “useful applications for the technologies underlying digital assets in wholesale markets” and emphasized the importance of “sensible testing to explore opportunities and identify and tackle risks.” Australia’s regulatory landscape for crypto is gradually evolving. Earlier this year, the government proposed a framework to regulate crypto exchanges under existing financial services laws and has pledged to work with major banks to better understand de-banking concerns.

While American Express does not directly hold XRP, it benefits from RippleNet—a network that leverages XRP behind the scenes to facilitate faster, more transparent international transactions. The infographic states, “A well-known company that uses XRP is American Express, which leverages RippleNet to enable real-time cross-border payments for corporate clients. Through its partnership with Ripple, American Express uses XRP indirectly via Ripple’s infrastructure to facilitate faster and more transparent transactions between the U.S. and international markets, helping businesses move money efficiently and reduce settlement times from days to seconds.” JUNE 2025: XRP ETF INFOGRAPHIC REVEALS AMERICAN EXPRESS UTILIZES XRP “A well-known company that uses XRP is American Express, which leverages RippleNet to enable realtime cross-border payments for corporate clients. Through its partnership with Ripple, American Express uses… pic.twitter.com/S5E9TcXxvd — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 9, 2025 This revelation is significant. By relying on RippleNet and its associated On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, American Express can sidestep the delays and high costs of traditional correspondent banking. ODL uses XRP as a bridge currency , allowing funds to be converted into XRP and sent instantly across borders before being converted into the destination currency, eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts and enabling near-instant settlement. XRP’s Role in Revolutionizing Global Payments XRP’s greatest strength lies in its ability to serve as a neutral, highly liquid bridge asset for international payments. It processes transactions in just a few seconds, with near-zero fees and no dependency on legacy banking infrastructure. This gives it a major advantage over traditional systems like SWIFT, which can take days to settle payments. Over the years, Ripple has formed partnerships with more than 300 financial institutions globally, including Santander, SBI Holdings, Tranglo, and many others. These entities use RippleNet and XRP-powered ODL to overcome liquidity challenges and expand their global reach, particularly in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is limited or inefficient. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 American Express, as a major player in the global financial landscape, brings further credibility to this growing list of adopters. Its use of Ripple’s infrastructure reflects a broader trend among traditional institutions moving toward blockchain-based solutions to enhance speed, efficiency, and transparency in money movement. Growing Momentum for XRP and ETF Interest The infographic comes at a pivotal time. Interest in XRP is rising, driven by growing speculation around the potential launch of an XRP spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). While an XRP ETF has yet to be approved, several filings are reportedly underway . The legal clarity following the 2023 ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, which declared that XRP is not a security in secondary market sales, has further bolstered investor and institutional confidence. In this context, American Express’ quiet but strategic use of RippleNet is a powerful signal. It underscores XRP’s growing relevance in real-world finance and its potential to become a global standard for instant, low-cost cross-border payments. As institutions continue to adopt Ripple’s solutions and regulatory barriers fall, XRP appears well-positioned for broader mainstream integration—both as a bridge currency and a potential ETF asset.

Its presale crossed big milestones, fueling chatter in meme coin circles. The Bitcoin Pepe price keeps climbing as meme-powered energy builds in the community. It has all the signs of typical meme momentum: fast moves, social chatter, and a rush of short-term traders hoping for huge spikes. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) keeps stacking up real progress. Its ongoing presale has now raised over $335 million and isn’t just talking about plans; it’s putting out working tools, from its X1 mobile miner to low-code dev kits. In a crypto space crowded with empty promises, BlockDAG shows what actual delivery looks like. One project is pushing headlines. The other is setting new standards in blockchain. Bitcoin Pepe Faces Next Steps After CEX Listing The big Bitcoin Pepe CEX update went live on June 30, and the project is still working hard to stay visible. Its presale sparked plenty of interest, with the Bitcoin Pepe price moving up sharply and a meme-rich community plus staking perks pulling in fast-moving traders. Many are hoping to grab short-term profits from this fresh meme wave. The roadmap hints at token burns, listings, and community rewards to support growth later. But right now, the Bitcoin Pepe presale leans more on meme buzz than working features. There’s no live ecosystem yet, no real tools people can use. So this update could prove whether the excitement holds up after launch. The Bitcoin Pepe CEX update might be its chance to show it can back up the hype with real traction. BlockDAG Proves Tools, Miners, and Developer Community Work While Bitcoin Pepe talks up future updates, BlockDAG is already delivering at scale. It uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tech to process thousands of transactions at once without slowing down like old blockchain chains do. This means it’s designed for efficiency and to handle growth smoothly. BlockDAG’s massive $335 million presale has powered actual releases. Its X1 Miner app is already in use by more than 2 million people, letting anyone mine up to 20 BDAG daily with no fancy gear. The working testnet supports smart contracts, DeFi tools, and bridges, all made easy with its low-code, no-code builder kits. Security is tight too. CertiK and Halborn have both reviewed its system, and its modular smart contracts mean quick upgrades when needed. The BlockDAG Academy and dev grants also pull in more builders daily. On the coin performance side, it’s still gaining ground. Early batches offered BDAG at a fraction of the price; those early users now see a 2,660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29. The coin is set to launch at $0.05, but right now, it’s open for just $0.0016 until August 11. That means anyone who grabs it now could see a 3,025% gain at launch if all goes as planned. So while Bitcoin Pepe rides hype, BlockDAG shows how real blockchain delivery works. Bitcoin Pepe vs BlockDAG Short-Term Play or Real Ecosystem The Bitcoin Pepe price chart and recent CEX listing keep people excited. That June 30 moment was a big test. But just riding big moves doesn’t always mean long-term results. BlockDAG stands as a real example of how blockchain should look when it’s actually live. From a working miner app to testnet tools, real audits, and a growing community of builders, it’s not just hype, it’s real traction. Where Bitcoin Pepe gives meme vibes, BlockDAG builds systems. Short-term traders may run to Bitcoin Pepe, but those wanting something that can scale and deliver are picking BlockDAG instead. The Bottom Line Bitcoin Pepe has caught a lot of eyes with its presale hype and its recent June 30 CEX launch. The price action and meme factor have pulled in people who love the thrill of quick moves. Now that the listing is live, it might spike, but what happens when the early excitement fades? This is where BlockDAG clearly leads. Its presale has already crossed $335 million, the X1 mobile miner is live, and its smart contracts and dev tools are working today, not tomorrow. While Bitcoin Pepe stays in the spotlight for its hype, BlockDAG keeps delivering substance and an ecosystem built for the long haul. Anyone watching for real progress, daily use, and growth that goes beyond memes is keeping an eye on BlockDAG. It’s not just another promise, it’s a blockchain built to last.

In a post shared on 9 July 2025, the veteran technician noted that BTC/USD is “holding right at the pattern boundary.” The annotated chart he released—covering Bitstamp weekly prices back to mid-2022—shows the cryptocurrency compressing directly beneath a horizontal resistance band at $109,000, the neckline of what he labels a six-month head-and-shoulders (H&S) continuation formation. Bitcoin Poised For $141,300 Kibar’s chart first revisits the basing sequence that reversed the 2022 bear cycle. A textbook inverse head-and-shoulders bottom completed in early-2023, with troughs at roughly $17,600 (left shoulder), $15,500 (head) and $19,500 (right shoulder). The breakout above the neckline sent Bitcoin to $31,400. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? Immediately thereafter, price stalled in a six-month rectangle bounded by $25,000 support and $31,400 resistance. The eventual topside resolution propelled the market to the rectangle’s implied target of $38,000, validating two consecutive classical projections in less than a year. Afterwards, the BTC price grinded higher. Below $73,700, BTC consolidated in a falling wedge, ending with a breakout toward $109,000. From that point, the initial pullback bottomed at $91,200, creating what Kibar designates as the left shoulder. A deeper descent to $76,500 carved out the head. Then, the Bitcoin price formed the right shoulder at $101,500, echoed by the blue bowl-shaped arc on the chart. Throughout this structure the neckline at $109,000 remained intact, acting as a clear demarcation between consolidation and fresh highs. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern spans roughly half a year, matching the analyst’s “6-month-long” annotation. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating? Using the orthodox H&S continuation rule—adding the vertical distance from the head ($73,700) to the neckline ($109,000) to the breakout level—Kibar derives a price objective of $141,300. He notes in an X reply that this target is separate from the earlier $137,000 objective, which came from a larger cup-with-handle on the monthly scale. In other words, the shorter-term weekly pattern now projects modestly higher than the longer-term structure. At press time Bitcoin, Bitcoin traded near $111,000, surpassing the neckline. However, from a technician’s standpoint, the breakout still needs to confirm with the weekly close. Confirmation requires a decisive weekly settlement north of the $109,000 neckline. As Kibar notes: “Breakout needs to take place with a long white candle, similar to previous pattern completions. There should be no hesitation.” Invalidation would emerge on a weekly close back below the most recent swing-low support at $101,500; deeper failure beneath $91,2000 would unravel the pattern entirely. For now, Bitcoin sits at the fulcrum of its six-month equilibrium. A weekly candle or two should reveal whether the largest digital asset can convert yet another classical chart formation into a measured move—this time toward mid-six-figure territory.

The BNB Chain has just completed its 32nd quarterly BNB token burn, and the numbers are truly astonishing. We are talking about a staggering 1,595,599.78 BNB tokens, valued at approximately $1.024 billion at the time of the burn, permanently removed from circulation. This isn’t just a routine update; it’s a monumental event with far-reaching implications for everyone involved in the BNB ecosystem. Let’s dive deep into what this massive BNB Chain burn means for the future of your holdings and the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly is a BNB Token Burn , and Why Does it Matter? If you’re new to the concept, a token burn in the cryptocurrency world is similar to a company buying back and retiring its own shares. It’s a deliberate process where a specific amount of cryptocurrency tokens are sent to an inaccessible wallet address, effectively removing them from the total supply forever. Think of it as throwing money into a digital black hole – once it’s there, it can never be retrieved or used again. So, why would BNB Chain engage in such an activity? The primary reason is to manage the token’s supply and demand dynamics. By reducing the total number of BNB tokens available, the aim is to make the remaining tokens more scarce, which, in theory, can increase their value over time, assuming demand remains constant or grows. This mechanism is a cornerstone of BNB’s economic model, designed to benefit its community and ecosystem in the long run. Why Does BNB Chain Consistently Conduct These Burns? The BNB Chain’s commitment to regular token burns is part of a strategic, long-term vision to foster a healthy and sustainable ecosystem. These burns are not random; they are a pre-programmed feature of the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and BNB Beacon Chain. There are primarily two mechanisms at play: Auto-Burn: This method automatically adjusts the amount of BNB to be burned based on BNB’s price and the number of blocks produced on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). It’s designed to be objective and verifiable, ensuring transparency in the burn process. Real-Time Burn (BEP-95): Introduced later, this mechanism burns a portion of the gas fees collected on the BNB Smart Chain in real-time. This means that every transaction on BSC contributes to the BNB supply reduction, making the network’s activity directly linked to the token’s deflationary pressure. These consistent burns underscore BNB Chain’s dedication to its token holders and the overall health of its decentralized applications (dApps) and services. It’s a clear signal of their intent to maintain a robust economic framework. Diving Deep into the 32nd BNB Quarterly Burn The latest burn, the 32nd of its kind, saw a precise figure of 1,595,599.78 BNB tokens permanently removed from circulation. This substantial amount represents a significant chunk of the total BNB supply, making it one of the largest burns in terms of USD value to date. At the time of the burn, this quantity translated to an impressive $1.024 billion. The BNB Foundation announced this completion on its official website, providing transparency and verifying the transaction. This consistent adherence to their burn schedule reinforces trust and predictability within the BNB ecosystem. It’s not just about the number of tokens; it’s about the strategic execution of a core economic policy that has been in place for years. How Does This Impact BNB Price and Its Ecosystem? The immediate and long-term effects of a substantial BNB Chain burn are often a topic of intense discussion among investors and analysts. While no single event guarantees a specific price movement in the volatile crypto market, the principle behind token burns is rooted in basic economic theory: reduced supply, if demand remains constant or increases, tends to lead to higher prices. This creates a powerful BNB price impact . Increased Scarcity: With fewer tokens available, each remaining BNB token theoretically represents a larger share of the total network value. Investor Confidence: Regular, transparent burns signal a commitment from the BNB Chain team to enhance token value and manage supply, which can boost investor confidence. Deflationary Pressure: The burns contribute to BNB being a deflationary asset over time, contrasting with inflationary fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies with uncapped supplies. Ecosystem Health: A stronger BNB token can incentivize more users and developers to participate in the BNB Chain ecosystem, leading to more dApps, more transactions, and a more vibrant network. Historically, BNB burns have often been followed by positive price movements, though market conditions and broader crypto trends always play a significant role. It’s crucial for investors to understand that while burns create a deflationary force, they are one of many factors influencing market prices. The Broader Vision: Is BNB Deflationary by Design? Absolutely. The very design of BNB, coupled with its consistent burning mechanisms, positions it as a fundamentally BNB deflationary asset. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply, or Ethereum, which has undergone significant changes to its supply issuance model, BNB actively reduces its supply through these burns. This makes it an attractive asset for those who believe in the long-term value of scarcity in digital currencies. The goal is not just to reduce the supply, but to ensure that BNB remains a core utility token for the BNB Chain ecosystem. It’s used for transaction fees, staking, participating in initial coin offerings (ICOs) on the Launchpad, and powering various applications within the ecosystem. The deflationary nature aims to enhance the value proposition of holding and using BNB for these utilities. What Are the Key Takeaways for BNB Holders? For current and prospective BNB holders, this 32nd quarterly burn reinforces several key points: Long-Term Strategy: The burns are a consistent, planned part of BNB Chain’s economic model, indicating a long-term commitment to token value. Ecosystem Growth: The health of the BNB token is intrinsically linked to the growth and utility of the entire BNB Chain ecosystem. More adoption of BSC means more transactions, and potentially, more tokens burned via the Real-Time Burn mechanism. Not a Guaranteed Pump: While the deflationary nature is positive, remember that the crypto market is influenced by numerous factors, including global economic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. A burn doesn’t guarantee an immediate price surge. Stay Informed: Understanding the mechanics of token burns and their potential implications is vital for making informed investment decisions. This burn is a testament to BNB Chain’s proactive approach to managing its tokenomics and strengthening its position in the competitive blockchain landscape. It signals a continued effort to build a sustainable and valuable ecosystem for all participants. In conclusion, the completion of the 32nd quarterly BNB Chain burn, removing over $1 billion worth of BNB from circulation, is a significant milestone. It reinforces BNB’s deflationary model, potentially enhancing its long-term value and bolstering confidence in the BNB Chain ecosystem. As the crypto world continues to evolve, strategic moves like these play a crucial role in shaping the future of digital assets.

According to an official announcement posted on Truth Social, users who subscribe to the $9.99 per month Patriot Package will access ultra-fast streaming of selected “non-woke” news channels, a red verification checkmark, improved comment visibility, and access to a Truth+ badge. Patriot package subscribers to earn tokens through rewards program Per Truth Social’s post, the loyalty package subscribers will be eligible to participate in a beta test that allows them to accumulate digital “gems” through platform engagement. The gems will eventually be tied to a utility token usable across Truth Social and its affiliated Truth+ media service. Truth social token announcement. Source: Truth Social Though still in beta, the company asserted that under the Patriot Package, the more active a user is on the platform, the more future tokens they will accrue. Oddly, despite its $9.99 monthly cost, the Patriot Package has fewer news channels than the platform’s free tier. The premium service includes 12 curated channels, while the no-cost plan includes 27, among them international broadcasters such as Euronews and a Spanish-language outlet. Truth social files for crypto ETF A fortnight before this token teaser, Truth Social had also filed an S-1 registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new crypto exchange-traded fund, dubbed the “Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF.” The filing proposes that the ETF’s assets will list Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cronos (CRO). The preliminary allocation breakdown lists 70% in Bitcoin, 15% in Ethereum, 8% in Solana, 5% in Cronos, and 2% in Ripple. According to the prospectus, Yorkville America Digital is listed as the fund’s sponsor, while Foris DAX Trust Company will become the custodian of the digital assets. The ETF, if approved, is set to be offered on the New York Stock Exchange Arca. This application follows two prior filings by Truth Social, one for a standalone Bitcoin ETF in June and another combining both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trump media’s previous crypto plans Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), Truth Social’s parent company, has been involved in several blockchain-based initiatives since Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office in January. In April, TMTG disclosed to shareholders that it was considering a utility token as part of a digital wallet solution. The wallet would allow users to pay for Truth+ subscriptions and other services within the Truth ecosystem. In May, the company denied the “unauthorized and misleading” rumors that it planned to launch a Truth Social-themed meme coin. Earlier in the year, Trump Media signed a binding agreement with exchange giant Crypto.com and asset management firm Yorkville America Digital to roll out several crypto-based ETFs under a “Made in America” branding umbrella. Trump’s financial ties to crypto continue Donald Trump and his family have formed a number of financial relationships in the crypto world, including one with Dubai-based Aqua 1 Foundation in June. Aqua 1 pledged a $100 million investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a Web 3 firm tied to both Trump and real estate developer Steve Witkoff, the Middle East diplomatic envoy of the Trump administration. Under the agreement, Aqua 1 acquired $100 million worth of WLFI tokens. According to publicly disclosed terms, Trump personally receives 75% of all WLFI token sales, which could net him $75 million in revenue. The foundation was virtually unknown prior to the transaction, but now ranks among the largest contributors to Trump’s crypto-linked enterprises.

The funding will help Aspecta scale its network, enhance collaborations with major partners, and expand global adoption of its open economy framework for “alpha assets.” YZi Labs today announced its strategic investment in Aspecta (X: @aspecta_ai), a blockchain infrastructure building the foundation for an open economy around illiquid assets at trillion-dollar scale. This investment highlights YZi Labs’ commitment to support fair participation in emerging asset ecosystems through verifiable, on-chain frameworks. Announcement available on X.com via this link. Aspecta addresses a fundamental gap in capital markets: early-stage or locked assets often enter public markets without transparent pricing, creating volatility and mistrust. Its solution includes BuildKey , a framework that standardizes illiquid assets into ERC-20-like credentials allowing open on-chain price discovery, and Build Attestation (Aspecta ID), an AI-powered reputation protocol that helps developers and early projects build trust and signal credibility. Together, these tools enable illiquid assets to be represented, attested, and traded more openly – laying the groundwork for an open, inclusive market for “alpha assets.” YZi Labs first met the Aspecta team during BNB Chain’s MVB Season 7 in March 2024. At the time, Aspecta was scaling Aspecta ID and had become one of the largest platforms supporting developers and early-stage projects; they were also working with Google Developer Group and various L1/L2 chains to grow the builder ecosystem. A standout effort during that period was the launch of the BNB Chain Builder Economy , the first builder-community consensus with productivity tokenization. Fast forward to June 2025, Aspecta has supported over 650,000 users across Aspecta ID and BuildKey, with more than 54,000 GitHub-verified developers and projects onboarded. Its infrastructure underpins open price discovery for 25+ digital assets and facilitated over 50 million asset trades via Buildkey framework. The strategic funding from YZi Labs will help Aspecta deepen integrations with major partners, enabling new avenues for transparent, long-term asset growth. It will also scale its open economy framework and liquidity systems to support more illiquid assets—like private equities and other RWAs—within a permissionless, interoperable network, while advancing global adoption and open price discovery from the earliest stages. “We believe transparent, on-chain infrastructure for illiquid assets will be fundamental to the next chapter of blockchain adoption,” said Alex Odagiu , Investment Director at YZi Labs. “Aspecta’s vision for permissionless price discovery and lifecycle liquidity aligns with our belief that open, inclusive markets can drive innovation and accessibility.” “We’re thrilled to be backed by YZi Labs to scale the open economy for trillions in illiquid assets,” said Jack He , Co-Founder of Aspecta. “From pre-TGE shares to post-TGE locked tokens, Web2 private equities, RWAs, and non-standard OTC assets — our goal is to enable these assets to be attested, openly priced, freely traded, and supported from the earliest stages through collective effort.” About YZi Labs YZi Labs manages over $10 billion in assets globally.

Now, with YZi Labs’ backing, Aspecta is laying down the rails for price discovery in the world’s most elusive assets, from locked tokens to legacy equities. YZi Labs announced on July 10 that it has made a strategic investment in Aspecta, a blockchain infrastructure project focused on unlocking liquidity for illiquid assets like locked tokens, pre-TGE shares, and private equity. The deal marks a new chapter in YZi’s broader thesis around on-chain transparency and early-stage asset formation. Aspecta’s core product suite, BuildKey and Aspecta ID, offers tools to standardize, attest, and price assets that typically fall outside traditional market infrastructure. With over 650,000 users already onboarded, Aspecta has emerged as one of the most active players in the on-chain credentialing and asset discovery space. You might also like: Rumble teams up with MoonPay to power crypto-fiat wallet integration The infrastructure behind the illiquid asset revolution According to the announcement, YZi Labs first crossed paths with Aspecta during BNB Chain’s MVB Season 7 in early 2024, when the project was still cementing its reputation as a critical layer for developer identity and credentialing. Aspecta ID, its AI-powered attestation protocol, had already onboarded tens of thousands of GitHub-verified builders, a signal that the team understood something fundamental about trust in decentralized ecosystems. But what caught YZi’s attention wasn’t just the traction; it was Aspecta’s pivot toward solving a far thornier problem: the complete lack of price discovery for assets locked behind vesting schedules, private rounds, or regulatory limbo. Since then, Aspecta’s infrastructure has quietly become the backbone for a new class of asset markets. Its BuildKey framework, which wraps illiquid holdings into tradable ERC-20-like instruments, has facilitated over 50 million trades across 25+ digital assets, proof that demand exists, even for traditionally frozen capital. YZi Labs said the fresh investment will fuel two immediate priorities for Aspecta. First, deeper integrations with institutional partners, particularly those bridging real-world assets and private equities onto chains. Second, scaling BuildKey’s liquidity mechanisms to handle more complex assets, from pre-TGE startup equity to obscure OTC derivatives. “We believe transparent, on-chain infrastructure for illiquid assets will be fundamental to the next chapter of blockchain adoption,” said Alex Odagiu, Investment Director at YZi Labs. “Aspecta’s vision for permissionless price discovery and lifecycle liquidity aligns with our belief that open, inclusive markets can drive innovation and accessibility.” For YZi, the move reflects a broader strategic bet on the next evolution of blockchain infrastructure: one that doesn’t just tokenize assets, but contextualizes them. In a sector still prone to sudden unlock events and illiquid surprises, bringing transparency to the formation and valuation of non-standard assets is a structural pivot that could redefine the industry in many ways.

Ant Group's International Unit Prepares for USDC Stablecoin Integration by Partnering with Circle As part of this collaboration, Circle's digital currency, USDC, which is pegged one-to-one to the US dollar, will be integrated into Ant International's blockchain platform. While the initial integration process begins at the technical level, official use and adoption will be rolled out after Ant International achieves full compliance with US regulations. Ant Group is known for its leadership in digital payments and financial technologies, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This move is part of the company's global vision for stablecoins and blockchain. The partnership aims to provide more transparent, faster, and lower-cost solutions for international payments.

However, with notable resistance ahead, the price may enter a period of sideways consolidation before the next major move. XRP Analysis By Shayanmarkets The Daily Chart XRP has successfully broken out of a prolonged descending wedge pattern, a strong bullish signal. This breakout occurred at the critical $2.36 level, where the wedge’s upper boundary intersected with the 200-day moving average. This move marks a shift in market sentiment and opens the door for further upward momentum. However, XRP now faces significant resistance at the previous major swing high of $2.47, a zone where notable selling pressure is likely to emerge. As a result, the price is expected to consolidate in the short term between the $2.36 breakout level and the $2.47 resistance until a clear pullback is completed and buyers regain control. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ripple has broken decisively above the $2.3 resistance, a level that has repeatedly capped the price in recent months. This breakout has been accompanied by strong bullish momentum, with the formation of large bullish candles reinforcing the shift. However, XRP now approaches a key supply zone and bearish order block between $2.42 and $2.47, aligning with the previous swing high. This zone could serve as a short-term ceiling, potentially triggering a pullback or temporary rejection. At the same time, the buy-side liquidity resting above this area presents an attractive target for smart money. Therefore, Ripple’s behavior around this crucial level will likely determine the next move, either a bullish breakout and continuation toward higher resistance levels or a rejection and return to lower support zones.

According to a blog post by the organization, the latest burn event removed 1.595 million BNB from the asset’s circulating supply. The total includes the actual tokens burned and some coins removed via the Pioneer Burn Program, which helps users recover their lost BNB. BNB Chain Completes 32nd Burn The burned coins were worth approximately $1.024 billion at the time of completion. BNB now has a total supply of 139.2 million following the latest event. The last burn reported in mid-April totaled $916 million. BNB Chain initiated the auto-burn program in December 2021, aiming to reduce the total supply of BNB to 100 million. Initially, the network tied the burns to Binance’s quarterly profits and trading volume on the centralized exchange. However, this auto-burn mechanism determines the amount of BNB to burn by evaluating the number of blocks produced on the BNB Chain on a quarterly basis and the average price of the asset. This ensures transparency and predictability. After the BNB Foundation sends the burned tokens to a blackhole address, it reports the figures quarterly. The organization states that this quarter’s burn and future ones will be conducted directly on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) due to the BNB Chain Fusion. The Fusion is an initiative that seeks to streamline the BNB Chain ecosystem by migrating the BNB Beacon Chain’s functionalities to the BSC, thereby retiring the former. Will BNB Rally? Based on demand and supply laws, these quarterly burns could positively impact the price of BNB. With the aim of reducing the asset’s circulating supply, increased demand for BNB could trigger a significant and sustainable rally for the coin. Some institutions are already purchasing large amounts of BNB, with more likely to follow as crypto adoption expands. Last month, the Hong Kong-based, Nasdaq-listed crypto infrastructure company Nano Labs unveiled a $500 million convertible note offering, with the intention of using its proceeds to acquire BNB as a strategic treasury reserve. Just last week, Nano Labs revealed it had purchased 74,315 BNB for a total of $50 million. The company intends to buy up to $1 billion worth of BNB, owning a substantial portion of the asset’s circulating supply.

Truth Social Plans Utility Token Launch President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform is preparing to deepen its involvement in the digital economy with the upcoming launch of a utility token. The initiative, aimed at enhancing user engagement and loyalty, will integrate cryptocurrency-based rewards directly into the platform’s operations, positioning Truth Social among a growing number of social media networks experimenting with blockchain-based incentives. Utility Token to Power Loyalty Rewards Program In its latest announcement, Truth Social confirmed it will introduce a utility token linked to its new loyalty rewards scheme for subscribers of its Patriot Package. Currently priced at $9.99 per month, the Patriot Package grants users premium access to the platform and soon, an opportunity to earn rewards based on their activity. Subscribers will accumulate digital 'gems' through platform engagement, which will later be converted into a utility token usable across Truth Social and its upcoming streaming service, Truth+. This marks a significant step in the platform’s digital asset strategy, integrating blockchain technology not just for speculation, but for practical, in-platform utility. From Meme Tokens to Practical Digital Assets Truth Social’s planned token stands apart from conventional meme coins, often driven by speculative trading. Instead, the company aims to create a sustainable, utility-focused asset that provides tangible benefits to its subscriber base. The token is expected to facilitate payments for subscription services and potentially expand to other products and features within the Truth Social ecosystem. This measured approach signals a broader ambition to build a stable, value-driven digital environment for its users, offering practical applications for cryptocurrency rather than purely speculative appeal. Ongoing Crypto Ambitions at Trump Media The utility token initiative forms part of a wider digital asset strategy under Trump Media & Technology Group. The parent company has consistently signaled interest in blockchain ventures, most recently filing for a crypto blue-chip ETF featuring established digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cronos. Adding to this momentum, Donald Trump Jr. recently acquired $4 million worth of shares in Thumzup Media, a firm with crypto-focused growth plans and holdings in Ethereum, Solana, Ripple, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. This acquisition underlines the Trump family’s active involvement in the sector and signals a commitment to expanding their digital asset footprint.

The commentary follows Ripple’s long-term strategy to shift global banking infrastructure away from legacy systems to the blockchain-based XRP Ledger. Meanwhile, central banks are increasingly taking note, with recent reports revealing that the capacity of Ripple’s network is currently being studied alongside SWIFT’s systems in experiments. Garlinghouse Sets Sights On SWIFT’s Market Share Speaking at the APEX summit, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse declared that Ripple’s goal is not only to compete with SWIFT but to replace its role in moving money on the global scale. According to Garlinghouse, although SWIFT is very dominant in messaging, the most important thing is the liquidity that banks can provide. Related Reading: Ripple To Replace SWIFT? XRP Analyst Breaks Down Recent Developments “I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity,” he said. Ripple is targeting this deeper infrastructure among banks, which is the actual movement of value. Interestingly, Garlinghouse asserted that Ripple plans to capture up to 14% of SWIFT’s current cross-border volume within five years. That’s a bold number, especially considering the scale at which SWIFT currently operates. Recent estimates show that SWIFT currently facilitates more than 45 million financial messages and handles around $5 trillion in money transfers daily. Even a 14% share of that market would represent hundreds of billions of dollars in value flowing through Ripple’s ecosystem, which would create a significant demand for XRP in the process. Central Banks Are Tapping In Garlinghouse’s comments come at a time when institutional momentum appears to be shifting in Ripple’s favor. Interestingly, Ripple’s global push is not limited to private sector partnerships. A crypto enthusiast on the social media platform X known as Finance Bull recently drew attention to growing central bank interest in blockchain-based payment infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, Ripple’s technology is the key focus to this growing interest. Related Reading: Ripple Plans To Take 14% Of SWIFT Volume, USDC Lands On XRPL – What Does This Mean For XRP Price? Ripple’s xCurrent solution, which is built on the Interledger Protocol (ILP), was recently studied alongside SWIFT’s gpi system as part of Project Stella. Project Stella is a collaborative research initiative by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. Basically, what this means is that central banks are starting to look into Ripple’s technology, which says a lot about the ecosystem’s outlook in the coming years. The fact that two of the world’s most influential central banks reviewed Ripple’s infrastructure alongside SWIFT is a signal that XRP’s utility is now being evaluated at the core of global monetary policy discussions. These developments closely align with what many fervent XRP supporters have long believed. There have been recurring predictions among the community’s most confident voices that XRP’s price is destined to move far beyond its current all-time high of $3.40. Some technical analyses have predicted double-digit prices for XRP. Other predictions for the XRP price are as high as $1,000.

He shared his concerns during a press conference after the BOK’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to maintain the base interest rate at 2.50%. BOK Governor is worried about future confusion The topic of stablecoins has taken center stage in various countries, and South Korea is no different. However, despite the idea’s popularity, the Bank of Korea has often urged caution on the matter. As such, it did not surprise many when the BOK’s governor expressed concern at a press conference earlier today, June 10. According to him, if multiple non-banking institutions are allowed to issue won-denominated stablecoins, it could trigger confusion on a scale that has not been witnessed since the issuance of private currency in the 19th century. “In such a situation, it is difficult to implement monetary policy, and there will be the side effect of having to go through the process of returning to the central banking system again,” the governor said . He remains convinced that if they allow the issuance of won stablecoins indiscriminately, it could clash with the foreign exchange liberalization policy. But at the same time, if non-banks are allowed to handle payment settlements, it would significantly alter their profit structure. He has said the issue is not one the Bank of Korea can decide on alone, and that a direction can not be determined until the heads of the relevant ministries have made their decisions. The stablecoins debate is gathering pace in South Korea The governor’s position on the subject reflects ongoing tensions in the approach South Korea has taken to stablecoins. The BOK, in particular, has historically been cautious about stablecoins, seemingly preferring CBDCs or tokenized deposits, a stance that directly contrasts with the current political momentum under President Lee Jae-myung’s administration, which continues to push for won-based stablecoins to be legalized. In a bid to regulate stablecoin issuance and enhance transparency in the crypto industry, South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party proposed the Digital Asset Basic Act on June 10, 2025. However, it could also potentially allow non-bank entities to participate, and this is what has sparked debate about regulatory authority between the BOK and the FSC. The BOK has reportedly decided to try the regulatory sandbox approach, which will allow them to experiment with new financial products in a controlled environment, ensuring compliance with existing regulations without sacrificing innovation.

Technical charts indicate bullish formations, institutions continue to pile in, and whispers are growing that the token could soon surge past $4. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is flashing its own bullish signals, and a surprising under‑$0.0015 viral coin is attracting serious attention. On top of that, there’s a fresh buzz around Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , which has soared through early presale stages and now sits in stage four. With over $3.8 million raised so far, the meme magic is spreading quickly. Let’s unpack each of these stories—starting with XRP’s path to $4. XRP: Building Momentum Toward $4 XRP has built a good technical structure considering the analysis done by multiple experts. Latest XRP chart configurations, including some important technical indicators, suggest that XRP may soon surge. One of the most important indicators is the bullish flag which is a newer formed and technically it’s an indication for continuation for further upward progression or upward move. Should XRP break out above $2.50, it will have a real shot at hitting its $4 target. A well‑regarded analyst, recently highlighted a breakout from a bullish flag, expecting a run toward $4. Meanwhile, other analysts emphasize the importance of holding above $2.20; sustaining support here could serve as a springboard for a jump to the $3.20–$4.20 range. The sentiment is underpinned by institutional involvement, including ETF inflows across digital assets, which recently hit nearly $50 billion. That institutional interest matters. Increasing money flow, combined with XRP’s improving on‑chain metrics, paints a picture of real momentum. Dogecoin: A Comeback on the Cards Across the meme‑coin universe, DOGE is starting to show renewed life. After trading in bear territory for a long time, technical indicators are now showing bullish signs. A strong move to break the $0.25 mark could catapult DOGE toward $0.30 this July, provided volume supports the move. Furthermore, established analysts suggest the next narrative wave could send DOGE toward $0.50 or even $1.00 over time, fueled by renewed hype and adoption. The community is gearing up. If bitcoin and broader crypto sentiment remain healthy, Dogecoin often rides the second wave—after the initial big-cap rally. That Viral Underdog Under $0.0015 There’s more than just DOGE shining in the meme‑coin space right now. A newer token priced below $0.0015 has been gaining traction, driven by online buzz and momentum. Although still early, it has attracted attention from investors hoping to catch a big upside move. LILPEPE Stage 4: Meme Magic Meets Momentum Riding the same wave of meme enthusiasm, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is buffing up its credentials. After selling out the first three presale stages, LILPEPE has entered stage four, priced at $0.0013. To date, the project has amassed over $3.8 million in funding. This progress isn’t just about numbers. LILPEPE is positioning itself as a next-generation Layer-2 chain designed specifically around meme NFTs and ultra-low-cost, sniper-bot-resistant transactions. The roadmap hints at high-visibility launches, meme toolkits, and potential CEX listings on the horizon. If meme culture tightens its grip, there’s both narrative appeal and real network utility behind this frog-themed project. Why the Timing Makes Sense Markets often move in waves. Large-cap tokens like XRP and BTC can lead early—the rally out of a consolidation. Once the air is cleared and sentiment shifts, meme assets typically follow. That’s where DOGE, viral challengers, and LILPEPE come into play. Currently, XRP is gaining momentum, as evidenced by its chart and access to capital inflows. DOGE is flexing its potential for meme-fueled rebounds. And the under‑$0.0015 viral coins (including LILPEPE) are staking their claim as the next narrative winners. Taken together, this quartet forms a classic “ladder strategy”: first secure the foundation, then hit the momentum coins before the final blow‑off top. The Bottom Line Crypto never delivers smooth rides—but right now, it has all the classic technical signs: institutional inflows, chart formations, and renewed hype. XRP is at the vanguard with a breakout story toward $4. DOGE is ready to rally off its consolidation. Meme underdogs are stirring early chatter. And LILPEPE is gaining real funding momentum in its presale. If you believe this cycle is shifting from slow‑money accumulation to frenzy and narrative, the next few weeks could be pivotal. As always, risk management is key: define your entry, set targets, and monitor market tone. And yes, that viral underdog at $0.0013 just closed stage three and is stepping into stage four with nearly $4 million locked in. For those with a balanced strategy, this moment could be a breeding ground for outsized returns.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, a figure known for his audacious and often accurate market calls, has once again captured the crypto community’s attention. In a recent post on X, Hayes signaled an incredibly bullish outlook for Ethereum (ETH), forecasting a staggering potential rise to $10,000. This isn’t just another casual prediction; it comes from a voice that commands respect in the volatile world of digital assets, making his Ethereum price prediction a hot topic of discussion among investors and enthusiasts alike. Who is Arthur Hayes and Why Does His Ethereum Price Prediction Matter? Before diving into the specifics of his forecast, it’s crucial to understand why Arthur Hayes’s words carry significant weight. As the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, one of the pioneering and largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, Hayes has been at the forefront of the crypto industry for years. His insights are not merely speculative; they are often rooted in a deep understanding of market mechanics, macroeconomic factors, and the intricate dynamics of decentralized finance. He’s known for his provocative essays and candid commentary, which frequently offer a unique perspective on future market movements. Veteran Insight: Hayes possesses years of experience navigating bull and bear markets. Macro Perspective: He often ties crypto movements to broader global economic trends. Influential Voice: His predictions can influence market sentiment and investor behavior. Decoding the Bold ETH $10,000 Forecast: What’s Driving the Optimism? Hayes’s call for ETH $10,000 isn’t just a number pulled out of thin air. His recent post notably referenced the crypto meme “Arise Chikun,” a community-driven token inspired by the popular TV show Aqua Teen Hunger Force. This seemingly whimsical reference actually points to a deeper sentiment within the crypto community: the idea of a collective, grassroots resurgence and strength, often associated with tokens that gain viral traction and community support. But beyond the memes, what fundamental factors could underpin such a monumental leap for Ethereum? Several key developments and ongoing blockchain trends suggest that Ethereum’s ecosystem is maturing and expanding rapidly: Dencun Upgrade Impact: The recent Dencun upgrade significantly reduced transaction costs (gas fees) on Layer 2 networks built on Ethereum, making the ecosystem more scalable and accessible. This directly enhances Ethereum’s utility and appeal for dApps and users. Institutional Adoption: Growing institutional interest in Ethereum, particularly with discussions around potential spot Ethereum ETFs, could unlock massive capital inflows. DeFi and NFT Dominance: Ethereum remains the bedrock for the vast majority of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). As these sectors continue to innovate and expand, demand for ETH, which fuels these ecosystems, naturally increases. Supply Dynamics: With the implementation of EIP-1559 and the move to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge), Ethereum’s supply mechanics have become deflationary under certain network conditions, reducing the overall circulating supply and potentially increasing scarcity. Hayes’s bullish stance likely factors in a confluence of these technical improvements, network effects, and macro tailwinds that could propel Ethereum to unprecedented highs. Navigating the Broader Crypto Market Analysis in Light of Hayes’s Call An ETH $10,000 prediction doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s intricately linked to the broader crypto market analysis . Ethereum’s performance is often correlated with Bitcoin’s, but it also has its own unique drivers. While Bitcoin is seen as digital gold and a store of value, Ethereum is often referred to as ‘digital oil’ due to its utility as the foundational layer for countless decentralized applications. Consider the following market dynamics: Factor Impact on Ethereum Broader Market Relevance Bitcoin Halving Historically positive for altcoins post-halving Reduces new BTC supply, often a catalyst for bull runs Global Liquidity Increased risk appetite, flows into crypto Central bank policies, interest rates, economic growth Regulatory Clarity Attracts more institutional and retail investors Reduces uncertainty, legitimizes asset class Technological Advancements Improves scalability, security, and user experience Drives innovation across all blockchain ecosystems Hayes’s prediction suggests that Ethereum is not just riding Bitcoin’s coattails but is poised for an independent, utility-driven surge. This indicates a growing maturity in the crypto market where specific ecosystems like Ethereum can decouple or outperform based on their intrinsic value and development. Understanding Key Blockchain Trends Driving Ethereum’s Potential Beyond the immediate market dynamics, a deeper look at underlying blockchain trends reveals why Ethereum is so well-positioned for significant growth. Ethereum is at the epicenter of several transformative trends: Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: Projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon are massively expanding Ethereum’s transaction capacity and reducing costs, making it more competitive and user-friendly. This creates a powerful network effect, bringing more users and developers into the Ethereum orbit. Decentralized Applications (dApps): From decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to lending protocols and gaming platforms, Ethereum hosts the largest and most diverse array of dApps. As these applications gain mainstream adoption, the demand for ETH as gas and collateral increases. Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs): The burgeoning trend of tokenizing real-world assets – from real estate to fine art – on the blockchain often utilizes Ethereum’s robust infrastructure. This opens up massive new markets for the network. Enterprise Blockchain Solutions: Many large corporations are exploring or implementing blockchain solutions, often leveraging Ethereum’s enterprise-grade versions (like Hyperledger Besu) or public network for their needs. These trends collectively paint a picture of an ecosystem that is not just surviving but thriving and evolving, continually finding new use cases and attracting more participants. This fundamental growth is what gives weight to ambitious predictions like Hayes’s. What Does This Mean for Your Ethereum Investment Strategy? An Ethereum price prediction of $10,000 naturally prompts questions about investment strategy. While such a forecast is exciting, it’s crucial to approach it with a balanced perspective. No investment is without risk, and the crypto market is famously volatile. Here are some actionable insights for those considering their Ethereum investment strategy : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on one prediction. Understand the technology, the market, and your own risk tolerance. Long-Term Vision: Predictions like Hayes’s often imply a long-term horizon. Short-term price fluctuations are common. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, to mitigate volatility risks. Portfolio Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Balance your portfolio with other assets, both crypto and traditional. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of Ethereum’s development, regulatory changes, and broader market sentiment. While the prospect of a $10,000 ETH is thrilling, a prudent approach involves understanding the underlying fundamentals and aligning your investment decisions with your personal financial goals and risk appetite. If you’re interested in learning more about the technical aspects of Ethereum’s scalability, you might find resources on Layer 2 solutions particularly insightful. For instance, this guide on Ethereum Layer 2 scaling provides a deeper dive into how these technologies are making the network more efficient. Conclusion: Is Ethereum Destined for $10,000? Arthur Hayes’s bold Ethereum price prediction of $10,000 is more than just a headline; it’s a reflection of growing confidence in Ethereum’s fundamental strength, its evolving ecosystem, and its pivotal role in the future of decentralized technology. While the journey to $10,000 may be fraught with volatility and unforeseen challenges, the underlying blockchain trends , combined with increasing institutional interest and continuous innovation, certainly paint a compelling picture for Ethereum’s long-term potential. Whether ETH reaches this ambitious target, one thing is clear: Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto market, constantly adapting and expanding its utility. Investors should view Hayes’s prediction as a powerful signal of the immense possibilities that lie ahead, while always exercising caution and conducting thorough due diligence.

This lightning-fast sale, which generated a staggering $12 million, marks a significant milestone not just for Snoop Dogg but for the entire cryptocurrency and NFT space. If you’ve been following the crypto market, you know that celebrity involvement often creates a stir, but this particular event showcases the immense power of combining a global icon with an accessible platform like Telegram. Snoop Dogg NFT: A Digital Legacy Continues to Break Records? Snoop Dogg is no stranger to the world of digital assets. His journey into the blockchain realm has been well-documented, from acquiring Death Row Records as an NFT label to launching various collections. However, his latest venture, the Snoop Dogg NFT collection on Telegram, has elevated his status as a Web3 pioneer to new heights. According to Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, as cited by The Block, nearly 1 million digital collectibles were snapped up in just half an hour, leading to a remarkable $12 million in earnings. This isn’t just another celebrity endorsement; it’s a testament to Snoop’s genuine embrace of the technology and his ability to connect with a massive audience eager for unique digital experiences. The collection itself featured a range of items deeply rooted in Snoop’s iconic persona: vintage cars, exclusive ‘swag bags,’ a charming digital dog, and, of course, cannabis-themed collectibles. This curated selection resonated strongly with his fanbase, proving that authenticity and relevance are key ingredients for a successful NFT drop . Snoop Dogg’s consistent presence and innovative approach in the NFT space continue to push boundaries, setting new benchmarks for how artists and celebrities can engage with their communities in the digital age. Telegram NFT: Is This the Ultimate Launchpad for Mass Adoption? The choice of Telegram as the platform for this record-breaking NFT drop is arguably as significant as Snoop Dogg’s involvement itself. With its massive global user base, Telegram offers an unparalleled direct channel for reaching millions. Unlike traditional NFT marketplaces that might require users to navigate complex crypto wallets and blockchain interactions, Telegram’s integrated approach significantly lowers the barrier to entry for mainstream users. The ease with which users could participate in the sale highlights Telegram’s potential to become a powerhouse for future digital asset distributions. Consider the implications: a messaging app, primarily known for its secure communication, is now proving to be a highly effective portal for cryptocurrency transactions and crypto collectibles . This integration suggests a future where digital assets are not confined to niche crypto platforms but are readily accessible within everyday applications. The seamless experience provided by Telegram for this Telegram NFT drop could very well be a blueprint for how mass adoption of Web3 technologies unfolds, making it easier for new users to enter the space without needing extensive prior crypto knowledge. TON Blockchain: Powering the Next Wave of Crypto Collectibles? Underpinning this spectacular sale was the TON blockchain , or The Open Network. Originally conceived by Telegram itself, TON is designed for speed, scalability, and user-friendliness, making it an ideal infrastructure for high-volume transactions like a mass-market NFT sale. The fact that minting and secondary trading on the TON blockchain will begin in 21 days indicates a strategic rollout, likely aimed at ensuring network stability and managing demand effectively post-sale. Why is TON so crucial for crypto collectibles ? Its architecture allows for rapid transaction processing and low fees, which are vital for attracting a broad user base. Traditional blockchains can sometimes be bogged down by high gas fees and slow confirmation times, creating friction for users. TON’s efficiency played a critical role in facilitating the smooth and swift execution of Snoop Dogg’s NFT drop , demonstrating its capability to handle significant traffic and transactions. This event serves as a powerful validation of the TON blockchain ‘s robust capabilities and its potential to support a new generation of decentralized applications and digital assets. Beyond the Hype: What Do These Crypto Collectibles Offer? While the headlines focus on the incredible revenue and speed of the sell-out, it’s worth delving into what these crypto collectibles actually represent. For fans, they offer a unique piece of Snoop Dogg’s digital legacy, a tangible (or rather, intangible) connection to the artist. The items—vintage cars, swag bags, a digital dog, and cannabis-themed elements—are not just random digital images; they are curated extensions of Snoop’s brand and artistry. This thoughtful approach to collection design often fuels collector interest and perceived value. The success of these crypto collectibles also highlights a growing trend: the convergence of celebrity culture, digital ownership, and community building. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, these NFTs often come with potential future utility, access to exclusive content, or membership in a digital community. While the immediate utility of Snoop’s Telegram NFTs is yet to be fully revealed beyond ownership, their intrinsic value lies in their association with a global icon and their place in a rapidly evolving digital economy. This event underscores the power of branding and the desire for unique digital assets in the Web3 era. Lessons from a Lightning-Fast NFT Drop: What’s Next? The Snoop Dogg NFT drop on Telegram is more than just a successful sale; it’s a case study with significant implications for the future of digital assets and mainstream adoption. Here are some key takeaways: Mass Accessibility is King: Integrating NFT sales directly into widely used messaging apps like Telegram drastically lowers the barrier to entry for new users, paving the way for broader crypto adoption.

With its EU headquarters now operational in Vienna and a full MiCAR license issued by Austria’s Financial Market Authority (FMA), Bybit EU enters the European market with a clear mission: To deliver fast, secure, and intuitive crypto services built on a foundation of regulatory clarity, transparency, and local engagement. “Six years ago, we started with zero users and a bold vision. Today, we serve over 72 million users worldwide, and our mission continues. With Bybit EU, we’re combining innovation with regulation, building a secure and user-centric crypto ecosystem right here in the heart of Europe”, says Ben Zhou, Co-Founder and CEO of Bybit. Bybit EU is now fully operational and regulated under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), making it one of the first globally active crypto exchanges to obtain full authorization to serve all 29 countries within the European Economic Area. The license was granted earlier this year by Austria’s Financial Market Authority (FMA), widely regarded for its balanced and professional approach to digital finance regulation. With this license, Bybit EU becomes a regulated, passported entity equipped to operate across borders with legal certainty and uniform compliance. Vienna as a Strategic Base for European Growth The establishment of Bybit EU is more than a licensing milestone – it represents a structural commitment to building for the long term within Europe’s financial and regulatory ecosystem. “Vienna was deliberately chosen as the location for the company’s European headquarters due to its central geographic position, strong legal and financial infrastructure, and access to a highly educated, multilingual workforce. Austria’s progressive stance on innovation in finance, along with its evolving sandbox model for digital assets, has positioned it as an ideal launchpad for pan-European crypto services”, says Mazurka Zeng, CEO & Managing Director of Bybit EU, highlighting the strategic decision to base operations in Austria. Bybit EU is also investing directly in the local economy. The company is currently expanding its operations with the goal of hiring over 100 professionals in Vienna.

47971829,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800397-bito-as-a-complement-to-bitcoin-holdings?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1752162243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/47971829.jpeg,BITO As A Complement To Bitcoin Holdings,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800397-bito-as-a-complement-to-bitcoin-holdings?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary BITO offers indirect Bitcoin exposure via futures contracts, providing monthly income, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs or direct ownership. BITO's futures-based structure reduces risks like theft and adds yield, making it a strong complement to existing Bitcoin holdings. Performance may lag spot Bitcoin during rangebound periods or due to contango. With Bitcoin near all-time highs and poised for a potential breakout, BITO is positioned to deliver capital appreciation and substantial income. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) was the first U.S. exchange-traded fund to offer exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), and it continues to be an interesting allocation that can complement or supplement existing Bitcoin exposure. BITO does not directly hold any Bitcoin, but instead provides exposure through futures contracts that are rolled over, and which often allow its managers to distribute significant income on a monthly basis. This income generation feature makes BITO a strong addition to existing Bitcoin exposure that an investor is disinterested in selling, and which might not produce any yield. Unlike the multitude of ‘spot’ Bitcoin ETFs, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), which directly hold Bitcoin, BITO primarily invests in cash-settled, front-month Bitcoin futures that are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ). Such futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specified amount of Bitcoin at a predetermined price and future date. As a result, BITO tracks the price movements of those futures contracts. The fund actively manages its portfolio by rolling contracts, or selling expiring near-term contracts and replacing them with longer-term ones. BITO holdings (ProShares) This futures-based approach provides investors with indirect exposure to Bitcoin's price fluctuations without the complexities of directly owning, storing, or securing the digital asset. Moreover, since BITO does not hold Bitcoin, there is no risk that it might lose its Bitcoin to theft or accident. It also provides Bitcoin investors with monthly income, where directly holding the asset generally does not, and neither do most companies in the cryptocurrency business. BITO's 2025 distributions (ProShares) By rolling futures contracts, BITO maintains continuous exposure to Bitcoin, and also often realizes income that it distributes to investors. Of course, much of the income BITO might generate will come at the expense of capital appreciation. Therefore, BITO is likely to underperform when Bitcoin is rangebound for an especially long period of time, and especially if contango occurs. Much of this will depend upon the cost of futures contracts, which will vary along with volatility, as well as price and time. While the goal of BITO is to correspond to the performance of Bitcoin, it should not be expected to act as a perfect reflection of the spot price. When Bitcoin experiences a strong upward spike, BITO is likely to participate in that upside. The positive momentum in the underlying price of Bitcoin is also likely to outweigh the negative impact of contango (if present), or at least mitigate it. Nonetheless, it's still possible for BITO to slightly lag the spot price of Bitcoin during rapid upward moves due to contango. In some instances of extremely bullish sentiment, as well as the type of supply squeezes that are possible with Bitcoin, the Bitcoin futures market could slip into backwardation. If this happens during a strong rally, BITO could potentially outperform the spot price due to a positive roll yield, coupled with the appreciation from Bitcoin's price appreciation. This is uncommon, but possible. Therefore, it is generally more favorable to invest in BITO during periods when Bitcoin is expected to experience significant upward price movement. Given Bitcoin’s current valuation, which is close to its all time high after a period of rangebound consolidation, it appears highly possible that Bitcoin is preparing to make another strong move up the charts. If this is the case, BITO is likely to appreciate along with Bitcoin, while also providing substantial income in the near term. A significant portion of BITO's assets may not be directly invested in futures contracts, due to the rolling process and pending entering new contracts. Such cash is then held in short-term, U.S. Treasury securities and other high quality, investment grade cash instruments. The interest earned on such holdings also contributes to the fund's investment income. Risk BITO's performance may deviate from the spot price of Bitcoin due to various factors, including those affecting futures markets, such as contango and backwardation. It also has a significant management fee of 0.95 percent. Further, since Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures are highly volatile assets, BITO's valuation will be heavily influenced by price swings. BITO's performance is also clearly tethered to Bitcoin, so any significant decline to the price of the underlying asset would also be problematic for the fund. Since BITO is a futures-based ETF, it can have complex tax implications compared to holding spot Bitcoin or most other ETFs. Futures ETFs are often taxed as a Section 1256 contract, where 60% of gains are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate and 40% at the short-term capital gains rate, regardless of how long you hold the ETF. This issue would be sidestepped by in tax deferred or tax-free accounts, which would also shield the significant monthly distributions from tax. Conclusion BITO provides both exposure to Bitcoin and the potential for monthly income distributions. BITO has a dividend yield of about 53%, having paid approximately $11.19 per share over the past year. While Bitcoin is likely to slightly outperform BITO, the holding of futures contracts eliminates certain risks that could present themselves, including theft via hacking. Moreover, BITO's substantial income component makes it a compelling complement to existing Bitcoin holdings that an investor may not want to sell or expose to related risks that may arise through income generation. Given the potential for Bitcoin to spike higher in the near term, as well as later in 2025, BITO should be expected to continue to track Bitcoin reasonably closely and distribute above average income in the near term.",IBIT|FBTC|BTC-USD|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-10 15:44:03

And so it stands to reason that despite their current ubiquity, dominant operating systems like Windows and macOS have a natural expiration date. And AI operating systems may be about to call time on their hegemony. While traditional operating systems rely on predefined rules, forcing users to wrestle with syntax or sift through settings like digital archaeologists, their AI-powered descendents promise to turn clunkiness into cruise control. With large language models (LLMs) embedded at their core, AI OSes let users simply say what they want, whereafter their commands are executed. In short, they’re analogous to brainy computing butlers. We often hear that AI is coming for our jobs, evoking images from I, Robot and countless other dystopian flicks about the dangers of tech. It’s more accurate, though, to say that AI will automate and optimize, happily handling the mundane manual tasks we all despise. While autonomous agents take care of the grunt work, a dedicated AI OS will be the beating heart of the system, coordinating the efforts of thousands – even millions – of enterprising drones. From Rigid Rules to Fluid Intelligence Traditional OSes are like old-school librarians – they’ll get you the book you want, providing you know the exact call number. An AI OS, though, doesn’t need structured commands: it can understand your voice, anticipate your needs, and spring into action straightaway. The best way to think about the two is that regular operating systems execute, while their AI counterparts intuit. The former has no autonomy, its architecture based on compliance with strict rulesets, while the latter enables agents to prioritize tasks, manage resources, and streamline even complex workflows. Negative takes on AI abound, but a positive case is just as easy to make. By automating routine processes – scheduling, data sorting, inventory management, payroll – AI frees up budgets for innovation, empowering the strategists and big brains to devote their time to more dynamic matters. In a sense, AI represents a lifeline for businesses toiling to stay on top of their daily operational workload. The AI OS in Action AI-powered operating systems aren’t some far-fetched idea; they already exist in the wild, and they’re worth studying to determine just how soon we might be saying Adios to the likes of Windows and macOS. Case in point Steve, the internal AI OS of Walturn , a firm specializing in Product Engineering as a Service (PEaaS). Developed to help Walturn’s engineers coordinate client projects, allocate resources, and reduce manual effort, Steve has been a runaway success, with CEO Hashim Hayat crediting it with achieving “marked improvements in client satisfaction as a result of faster delivery times and enhanced solution accuracy.” Hayat added that such hearty feedback encouraged Walturn to “scale AI OS adoption throughout our broader operational structure.” Web3 project SpoonOS is another excellent example. Described as an Agentic Operating System, it establishes an environment in which autonomous agents can perceive, reason, and execute an assortment of tasks – including those leveraging smart contracts like DeFi dApps. It also provides a convenient framework for those seeking to create, deploy, and manage such agents. Powered by the open-source Neo blockchain, SpoonOS’s architecture includes privacy-preserving tools, multi-agent coordination, and vector storage, as well as an orchestration engine that lets developers create agent-based apps with built-in fault tolerance and automatic recovery. The project also stores all agent data permanently on-chain, meaning there’s an auditable trail to every AI decision. The AI x blockchain segment is red-hot right now. Since January, AI-related on-chain activity has surged by 86% , hitting 4.5 million daily unique active wallets. That amounts to 19% of Web3’s total – putting it neck-and-neck with gaming at 20%. AI agent projects have also raised $1.39B so far this year, up 9.4% on the total 2024 figure. Workflows Rewritten, Future Unlocked The emergence of AI OS isn’t about replacing long-established software, it’s about redefining work as we know it. By embedding human-like intelligence at the system level, these operating systems let small enterprises motor through their manual tasks and focus on sharpening their strategy. Done right, AI OS represents computing’s next frontier – predictive, human-friendly, and unstoppable. As for Windows and macOS, let’s enjoy them while they’re here.

While cryptocurrency enthusiasts often focus on digital asset charts, understanding the foundational shifts in traditional currencies, especially the US Dollar , is crucial. A stronger or weaker Dollar impacts everything from commodity prices to emerging market stability, indirectly influencing the liquidity and investor sentiment that flows into digital assets. The Dollar’s recent slip from its elevated highs marks a significant moment, prompting a deeper look into the underlying forces at play and how they are reshaping global financial narratives. This shift suggests a broader re-evaluation by market participants, moving away from past dominant themes towards new drivers of currency valuations. What’s Driving the US Dollar’s Recent Slip? For much of the recent past, the US Dollar strength was a defining characteristic of the global financial landscape. This strength was primarily fueled by a confluence of factors: the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes aimed at combating persistent inflation, the Dollar’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset amidst geopolitical uncertainties and economic slowdown fears, and a relatively resilient US economy compared to other major global counterparts. Investors flocked to Dollar-denominated assets, seeking higher yields and perceived safety. However, the narrative has begun to change. The recent slip in the US Dollar can be attributed to several evolving dynamics: Easing Inflation Concerns: Signs of cooling inflation in the United States have led markets to anticipate a less aggressive stance from the Federal Reserve regarding future rate hikes. When expectations for interest rate differentials narrow between the US and other major economies, the Dollar’s yield advantage diminishes, reducing its appeal. Potential Fed Pivot: The market is increasingly pricing in the possibility of the Federal Reserve slowing down or even pausing its rate hiking cycle sooner than previously expected. This ‘dovish’ shift, whether real or perceived, weakens the Dollar as the prospect of continued higher returns fades. Improving Global Growth Outlook: There’s a growing sentiment that global economic conditions, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia, might be improving or at least not deteriorating as rapidly as feared. This relative improvement makes other currencies more attractive and reduces the demand for the Dollar as a safe haven. Diminishing Safe-Haven Appeal: As global anxieties subside, or as investors become more accustomed to existing uncertainties, the reflexive rush into the Dollar as a safe harbor lessens. Capital begins to flow back into riskier assets or currencies of economies with improving fundamentals. These factors collectively explain why the Dollar, after a prolonged period of ascendancy, is now experiencing a significant pullback. This movement is not merely a correction but potentially a recalibration based on evolving macroeconomic realities. Unpacking Current Forex Market Trends: Beyond the Dollar While the US Dollar remains a central player, its movements ripple through the entire Forex market trends , influencing other major currency pairs. Understanding these broader trends is essential for a comprehensive market view. Currently, we are observing a diversification of drivers, with central bank policies, inflation differentials, and geopolitical stability playing increasingly prominent roles. Here’s a snapshot of how some major currency pairs are reacting to the shifting landscape: Currency Pair Recent Movement Primary Driver(s) EUR/USD Gaining (USD weakening) European Central Bank’s (ECB) hawkish stance on inflation, improved energy outlook in Europe, receding recession fears. USD/JPY Weakening USD Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) continued dovish policy, though market speculation about potential shifts occasionally provides support for JPY. GBP/USD Fluctuating, with some gains against USD UK’s persistent inflation challenges, Bank of England’s (BoE) rate decisions, and broader economic uncertainty. AUD/USD Gaining Commodity price stability, improving sentiment towards China’s economy, and the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) policy. The key takeaway is that the Forex market trends are becoming less about a singular narrative (like the Dollar’s dominance) and more about a complex interplay of relative economic performance, central bank divergence, and investor risk appetite across different regions. This necessitates a more nuanced approach to currency analysis. Is Global Trade Tensions Losing Impact on Currencies? For several years, headlines dominated by global trade tensions , particularly between the United States and China, were a primary catalyst for significant currency movements. Tariffs, trade deficits, and geopolitical rhetoric often led to immediate shifts in currency valuations, with the Dollar often benefiting from safe-haven flows during periods of heightened uncertainty. However, there’s a discernible shift in how the market reacts to trade-related news. While trade disputes have not entirely disappeared, their immediate impact on currency markets appears to be diminishing. Several reasons contribute to this: Market Fatigue and Pricing In: Much of the initial shock and uncertainty surrounding trade wars has been absorbed and priced into market expectations. Investors have become accustomed to the ebb and flow of trade rhetoric, making it less likely to trigger sharp, unexpected reactions. Shift in Focus: The global financial community’s attention has largely pivoted from trade disputes to more immediate and pressing macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation, interest rates, energy security, and the lingering effects of the pandemic on supply chains. These factors now exert a stronger gravitational pull on currency valuations. Less Escalation: While tensions persist, there haven’t been major new escalations in trade wars that would dramatically alter the economic outlook. Existing tariffs remain, but the threat of new, widespread protectionist measures seems to have receded slightly, at least for now. Supply Chain Resilience: Businesses have adapted to a more fragmented global trade environment, building more resilient supply chains or diversifying production away from single points of failure. This reduces the immediate economic shock of trade disruptions. This doesn’t mean global trade tensions are irrelevant, but their direct, immediate influence on daily currency fluctuations has lessened. The market is now more concerned with central bank commentary, inflation reports, and employment figures than with the latest trade negotiation updates. Navigating Increased Currency Volatility: What Does It Mean for Investors? In the current environment, currency volatility remains a significant feature of the global financial markets. While the immediate impact of trade news might be fading, other factors are contributing to pronounced swings in currency values. Volatility, by definition, refers to the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. High volatility means prices can change dramatically over a short period, presenting both risks and opportunities. Key drivers of the current currency volatility include: Divergent Central Bank Policies: Central banks globally are at different stages of their monetary policy cycles. Some are still raising rates aggressively, others are nearing a pause, and a few remain highly accommodative. These divergences create significant interest rate differentials that can cause rapid capital flows and currency swings. Geopolitical Events: Ongoing geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, and regional instabilities continue to introduce uncertainty, prompting sudden shifts in safe-haven demand or risk aversion that directly impact currencies. Inflationary Pressures: The unpredictable nature of inflation across different economies means that expectations for future interest rates are constantly being revised, leading to choppy currency movements. Market Liquidity: In some instances, reduced market depth or liquidity can amplify price movements, causing larger swings in response to relatively small orders or news events. For investors, increased currency volatility implies several considerations. It means higher risk for unhedged international investments, as returns can be significantly eroded by adverse currency movements. However, it also creates opportunities for active traders who can capitalize on these fluctuations. For long-term investors, understanding and managing currency risk becomes even more critical, often involving hedging strategies or diversification across different currency exposures. Key Economic Indicators Now Steering the Ship With the diminishing influence of trade news, the spotlight has firmly returned to core economic indicators as the primary drivers of currency movements. These data points provide fundamental insights into the health of an economy and, crucially, signal the likely direction of central bank monetary policy. For those tracking the US Dollar and other major currencies, paying close attention to these releases is paramount. The most impactful economic indicators include: Inflation Data (CPI, PCE): Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) are closely watched for signs of inflationary or disinflationary trends. High and persistent inflation pressures central banks to raise interest rates, which typically strengthens a currency. Conversely, cooling inflation might signal a pause or reversal in rate hikes, potentially weakening the currency. Employment Figures (Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate, Wage Growth): A strong labor market, characterized by low unemployment and robust wage growth, indicates a healthy economy, giving central banks more room to tighten monetary policy. Weak employment data, however, can signal economic slowdown and prompt more dovish central bank stances. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth: GDP is the broadest measure of economic activity. Strong GDP growth indicates a robust economy, which is generally supportive of its currency. Weak or negative GDP growth can weigh heavily on a currency’s value. Retail Sales: This indicator provides insight into consumer spending, a major component of economic activity in many developed nations. Strong retail sales suggest healthy consumer demand and economic momentum. Manufacturing and Services PMIs (Purchasing Managers’ Index): These surveys provide forward-looking insights into the health of the manufacturing and services sectors. Readings above 50 generally indicate expansion, while readings below 50 suggest contraction. Central Bank Communications: Beyond just data, speeches, press conferences, and minutes from central bank meetings (like the Federal Reserve’s FOMC, ECB, BoJ) are meticulously scrutinized for clues about future monetary policy direction. Forward guidance from policymakers can cause significant currency shifts even without new data. These indicators collectively paint a comprehensive picture of an economy’s health and trajectory, providing the fundamental basis upon which currency valuations are built. Understanding their nuances and interdependencies is key to anticipating future currency movements. Challenges and Opportunities in a Shifting Landscape The current market environment, characterized by a slipping US Dollar , evolving Forex market trends , fading impact of global trade tensions , and persistent currency volatility driven by core economic indicators , presents both challenges and opportunities for investors across the spectrum, including those in the crypto space. Challenges: Increased Uncertainty: The shift from predictable trade narratives to complex macroeconomic dynamics introduces a higher degree of uncertainty. Predicting central bank moves and inflation trajectories is inherently difficult. Rapid Sentiment Shifts: Markets can react quickly and sharply to new economic data or central bank commentary, leading to rapid reversals in currency trends. Complex Interdependencies: Understanding how inflation in one region, energy prices, and geopolitical events in another might influence a specific currency pair requires sophisticated analysis. Impact on Crypto: While not direct, a stronger or weaker Dollar can influence global liquidity, risk appetite, and the flow of capital into alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. A weaker Dollar, for instance, might sometimes correlate with increased appetite for riskier assets, including digital ones. Opportunities: For Astute Investors: Those who can accurately interpret economic data and central bank signals may find opportunities to capitalize on mispricings or emerging trends in currency markets. Diversification Benefits: Understanding currency dynamics allows for better portfolio diversification, potentially hedging against adverse movements in one’s primary currency exposure. Enhanced Risk Management: A clearer understanding of currency drivers enables more effective risk management strategies for international investments, whether in traditional equities, bonds, or digital assets. Actionable Insights for Investors Navigating the current complex currency landscape requires a proactive and informed approach. Here are some actionable insights for investors looking to make sense of the shifting dynamics: Monitor Central Bank Communications Closely: The words and actions of central bankers are arguably the most significant drivers of currency markets today. Stay updated on interest rate decisions, policy statements, and speeches from the Federal Reserve, ECB, BoJ, and other major central banks. Focus on Core Economic Indicators: Shift your attention from trade headlines to the fundamental economic data points: inflation, employment, GDP, and retail sales. These provide a more reliable compass for currency direction. Understand Relative Performance: Currencies trade in pairs, meaning their value is always relative. Assess the economic health and monetary policy outlook of both economies in a pair to make informed decisions. Consider Diversification: For those with international exposure, diversifying across different currencies or asset classes can help mitigate risks associated with significant swings in a single currency. Stay Adaptable: The global economic environment is constantly evolving. What drives markets today may not be the primary driver tomorrow. Maintain flexibility in your investment strategies and be prepared to adjust your outlook as new information emerges. By adopting these practices, investors can better position themselves to understand and potentially benefit from the ongoing shifts in global currency markets, even as the US Dollar continues its complex dance. The recent slip of the US Dollar from its elevated highs signals a pivotal moment in global finance. The era where global trade tensions singularly dictated currency movements appears to be fading, replaced by a renewed emphasis on core economic indicators and divergent central bank policies. This shift is leading to dynamic Forex market trends and persistent currency volatility , demanding a more sophisticated and adaptable approach from investors. Understanding these evolving drivers is not just for currency traders; it’s fundamental for anyone navigating the interconnected global economy, including those with interests in the cryptocurrency space.

In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), Zhao criticized legal systems as “gigantic, patched, added, and often intentionally made complex.” “AI/LLMs are great at text processing. And laws should be simple and easy to understand, by a normal person,” Zhao added. Zhao also emphasized that his post did not mean to disparage lawyers; instead, he argued that their expertise could be better used in innovation rather than untangling legalese. CZ proposes AI as a legal reform and clarity toolkit Zhao’s argument comes amid global efforts to regulate AI, such as the European Union’s AI Act and ongoing U.S. legislative debates. Yet, his suggestion flips the script, taking the conversation beyond whether AI can be regulated to talking about how the technology could help rewrite and streamline laws themselves. Legal-tech advocates, including Wolters Kluwer, have already embraced generative AI to simplify legal research. In its “Straight Talk” series, the firm’s leaders argue that lawyers who leverage AI effectively can outpace those who don’t. The U.S. tax code runs over 6,800 pages. At the same time, regulations like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) have been repeatedly criticized for its opacity, even by the companies attempting to comply with them. AI-based platforms like Harvey.ai, used by major firms, and tools from Wolters Kluwer’s VitalLaw AI now assist in summarizing decisions and streamlining contract reviews. Stanford’s Human-AI collaboration lab found AI-generated legal briefs often rivaled human-written originals, although it cautioned about the occasional hallucinations that have embarrassed lawyers and drawn strong criticism from court officers. Legal professionals agree that AI is part of their future AI may shift law firm workloads from billable grunt work to strategic tasks, but legal practitioners must pair speed with judgment.A 2023 Wolters Kluwer’s “Straight Talk” survey notes that 73% of legal professionals expect to integrate generative AI into their work within a year. No, there are unlimited amounts of work. There could be a 1000 companies building spaceships vs only a couple now. We can test more drugs to cure cancer. Flying cars… All of them need tremendous amounts of legal work. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) July 10, 2025 While AI boosts efficiency in research and drafting, seasoned lawyers caution against blind trust without context and legal understanding.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) is a decentralized perpetuals exchange that operates on its own blockchain. This blockchain is now home to a vibrant ecosystem of protocols, which are quickly gaining attention as one of the most promising prospects for aidrop hunters. In this in-depth guide, we will walk you through the basics of airdrop farming, while also giving you a step-by-step explanation on how to best position yourself for the next wave of likely airdrops that are coming not just to Hyperliquid but also to the most popular protocols within its ecosystem. Key Takeaways: Hyperliquid is a fast, decentralized exchange with its own blockchain and over 80% of the DEX market share for futures trading. Farming airdrops means to trade, stake, and use apps across the Hyperliquid ecosystem. A significant portion of HYPE tokens remains unclaimed and is reserved for future community rewards. Top projects award points, which are likely to transition into airdrops. There are risks – fees, no guaranteed airdrops, and disqualification for suspicious activity. In this guide: Understanding Hyperliquid What is airdrop farming and how does it work? Farming the next Hyperliquid (HYPE) airdrop Top 5 Hyperliquid ecosystem protocols without a token Tips to maximize your airdrop chances Risks and realities of airdrop farming Conclusion: is Hyperliquid airdrop farming worth the time? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Understanding Hyperliquid Before we dive deeper into the intricacies of airdrop hunting, it’s important to understand why Hyperliquid is so popular, why people are bullish on it, and what makes it and its ecosystem prime hunting grounds for potentially lucrative airdrops. The following is a very brief overview, because this guide will be focused on airdrops, but if you want to familiarize yourself with Hyperliquid fully, we have prepared a few very in-depth explainers that you must check out: What is Hyperliquid (HYPE) and How Does it Work: The Complete Guide in 2025 Hyperliquid Bridge: How to Bridge USDC to Hyperliquid How to Trade on Hyperliquid: Step-by-Step Walkthrough in 2025 What is Hyperliquid: a quick overview Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange that, unlike most of its competitors, runs on its blockchain (the HyperEVM ). The platform offers crypto-based perpetual futures, currently denominated only in USDC, although the founder has already shared that crypto-denominated contracts are also underway. One of its main appeals lies in its high-speed, simple, and feature-rich platform, which enables high-level trading while providing a smooth user experience, low latency (below 1 second trade finality), and reliability in a decentralized environment. Please refer to our guide (stated above) for more detailed information on the various technical features that distinguish Hyperliquid from other decentralized perpetual futures exchanges. In 2025, it has managed to establish itself as the leading derivatives DEX, accounting for a substantial 83% market share and boasting daily volumes that are significantly greater than those of all other DEXs combined. Source: CoinMarketCap Key features that make Hyperliquid and its ecosystem a top airdrop prospect Besides capturing peak mindshare in 2025 due to its successful product (the derivatives exchange), Hyperliquid is beloved by many in the community for its tokenomics and the way the team handled its genesis token distribution. The HYPE token was officially launched in late 2024 through an airdrop to early backers and users of the Hyperliquid exchange. There were no private presales or venture capital – the team simply rewarded its community by airdropping roughly 33% of the total HYPE supply. However, what’s currently attracting users is the fact that nearly 40% of the remaining supply is locked for future emissions and community rewards. This has the community hopeful that there will be more airdrops in the near future. However, beyond HYPE’s attractive tokenomics, additional mechanics are at play that draw airdrop hunters to pour millions into its ecosystem. Many protocols have active point systems that reward participation and are expected to transition into a token model, distributing parts of their supply through airdrops. We have selected the five that are most likely to do so, and you can read about them later in the guide. The role of HYPE in the ecosystem HYPE is the native cryptocurrency at the heart of the entire Hyperliquid ecosystem, not just the DEX itself. It’s also the gas token of the HyperEVM. Part of its utilities include: Users can enjoy reduced fees on the Hyperliquid decentralized perpetuals exchange. They can stake their tokens, receive yield, and support the network Participate in voting and help shape the network Become a validator The team is also actively working on many other features, most of which will be accessible through HYPE ownership. Additionally, all major protocols built on the HyperEVM, particularly those heavily focused on lending, are centered on HYPE. For example, many of the liquid staking protocols would allow you to stake your HYPE tokens to receive yield and, at the same time, give you a synthetic token that you can then use to stay liquid. What is Airdrop Farming and How Does it Work? The following is a brief overview of what airdrop farming actually means and how it works for those of you who are new to it. However, if you want to dive deeper, feel free to check the following in-depth guide: What Are Crypto Airdrops And How to Find the Next Major One? Airdrop farming is the process of utilizing new or upcoming crypto protocols with the aim of receiving free token distributions, commonly referred to as “airdrops.” Unlike traditional investing, you don’t need upfront capital beyond gas fees and funds to use the platform. You interact with different decentralized applications, specifically those built on the HyperEVM or Hyperliquid itself (for the purpose of this explainer), and conduct various actions. These can range: Provide liquidity Swap tokens Buy and sell NFTs Bridge funds into the protocols Conduct transactions over time, etc. In return, projects often reward early users once they launch their token, distributing it retroactively based on activity. Hyperliquid’s ecosystem has emerged as a key target for airdrop farmers due to a few factors. First of all, the HyperEVM was launched in March 2025, which means that a lot of the teams building on it are relatively young. Many of them have followed in Hyperliquid’s footsteps and launched their own point systems, indicating an impending airdrop. At the same time, airdrops have become a very powerful tool for bootstrapping communities. Users who anticipate a token launch will deliberately promote the protocol and also take full advantage of its features to guarantee potential qualification. Farming the Next Hyperliquid (HYPE) Airdrop As we mentioned above, Hyperliquid’s team has reserved a good chunk of HYPE tokens for future community rewards. This has led many in the community to believe that a second airdrop is coming. Below is a step-by-step process (with reasoning) on what you can do to qualify for it, potentially. Step 1: Bridge funds to Hyperliquid’s application The most logical first step is to send some funds to the Hyperliquid app so that you can begin using its features. Sometimes, this is more than enough to qualify for an airdrop but, to be completely honest, in the past couple of years, most of the teams require further participation. Still, you will need funds to interact with the app and with its ecosystem, so this is the foundation for your HYPE airdrop farming. As mentioned before, we do have a step-by-step guide on how you can bridge USDC to Hyperliquid, so make sure to check it out here: Hyperliquid Bridge: How to Bridge USDC to Hyperliquid Step 2: Use the Hyperliquid DEX for perps trading Perpetual futures trading is the bread and butter of Hyperliquid. However, the first HYPE airdrop was heavily targeted at people who did that, and since then, the exchange has evolved tremendously, achieving billions in daily trading volume. This means that the competition will be fierce, and there is a high chance that this will not yield the best results in terms of HYPE airdrop farming. Nonetheless, it’s a step that you can’t ignore because it might even be a qualification criterion. Fortunately for you, trading on Hyperliquid is extremely easy and user-friendly. Visit the official page Your bridged USDC is likely already sitting in your perps account Go to “Trade” and open the interface Adjust your preferred margin mode Execute trades with the leverage of your choice Step 3: Use the Hyperliquid DEX for spot trading This one is also pretty straightforward. All you have to do is transfer funds from your Perp account to your Spot account (which happens with a click of a button). The spot interface looks exactly the same as the one for perpetual futures, with the exception of having to adjust margin modes and leverage, because there is none. Step 4: Deposit USDC into the Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) vault In general, any action that supports the protocol can be a qualification criterion for a future airdrop, so depositing USDC into the Hyperliquid Liquidity Provider (HLP) vault is likely a good idea, and it comes at zero cost to you. On the contrary, it earns yields based on the performance of the vault. To do so: Go to “Vaults” from the top navigation menu. Select Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) Click Deposit and deposit the USDC you are comfortable with Note: your USDC will be locked for four days and the APY varies depending on how successful the vault’s strategy is. Step 5: Stake HYPE to secure the network and earn yield Staking your HYPE with a validator helps secure the HyperEVM and is most likely going to be one of the more important criteria for a future airdrop. The reasoning is simple: the team has already rewarded trading activity, but at the time the first airdrop took place, the HyperEVM wasn’t live. It’s clear that the project is now transitioning and evolving into a new phase, which is ecosystem expansion. Staking HYPE helps ensure that. To do so: Transfer USDC to your Spot account and buy HYPE Go to Staking from the main navigation menu Transfer HYPE to your staking balance Select a validator and stake Note: Transfers from staking balances to spot balances are locked for 7 days, so act accordingly. Step 6: Transfer HYPE to the HyperEVM and interact with various dApps Using the HyperEVM will likely be another important qualification factor for potential HYPE airdrops, for reasons similar to those we shared above. I personally think that sending HYPE to the EVM itself is unlikely to do a lot in terms of helping you get an allocation and you will need to interact with various dApps on the blockchain. That’s what the next part is all about, but before you get to do it, you will still need to send funds. Here’s how: Get a HyperEVM-compatible wallet. MetaMask works just fine. Send USDC to your Spot account and buy HYPE From there, all you need is to hit “transfer to/from EVM” Have fun. Top 5 Hyperliquid Ecosystem Projects Without a Token Below are some of the most popular HyperEVM-based protocols that have point systems and provide an expanded suite of functionalities for those who want to both get involved in the ecosystem and also farm potential airdrops. Hyperlend HyperLend is a high-performance lending protocol that’s centered around capital efficiency. It’s also built on Hyperliquid’s EVM. The platform offers real-time leverage, deep liquidity, dynamic interest rates, loops, and whatnot – all features designed to maximize the potential of your HYPE. Why farm for a HyperLend Airdrop? HyperLend has an official system where users receive points for their activity. The speculation is that this will eventually translate into tokens. How to farm for a HyperLend Airdrop? Here are a few steps you can take: Connect your wallet to the HyperLend dApp. Supply assets to the lending pools. Borrow funds against your deposited collateral. Loop leverage by re-supplying borrowed assets to increase exposure. Swap assets within the protocol to show authentic activity. Refer friends. HypurrFi HypurrFi introduces a leveraged lending marketplace built natively on Hyperliquid’s HyperEVM. It enables users to create leverage loops, meaning that you can deposit and stake HYPE (or other assets), then use the borrowed assets to increase your exposure while still earning a yield on the original deposit. The protocol powers the USDXL stablecoin. It’s minted against overcollateralized deposits and is also backed by a growing vault of tokenized US Treasuries, adding a layer of stability and security. Why farm for a HypurrFi Airdrop? For all of your activity on HypurrFi, you will receive “HypurrFi Points.” So whenever you supply liquidity, borrow, swap, and pretty much everything else you can do on the platform, you will get points that may later factor into future rewards. How to farm for a HypurrFi Airdrop? Here are a few steps you can take: Connect a wallet to the HypurrFi dApp on HyperEVM. Supply assets such as HYPE, stHYPE, or stablecoins to various liquidity pools. Borrow USDXL or other supported assets against your collateral. Loop some leverage (advanced) by using borrowed USDXL to buy more of the collateral asset and then redeposit. Utilize various features, including isolated markets, pooled markets, vaults, and swaps Swap and withdraw periodically to show authentic user behavior. Hyperbeat By this time, you’re probably expecting it – Hyperbeat is a native protocol within the Hyperliquid EVM ecosystem, designed to facilitate scaling, liquidity, and yield functionality. It provides both dynamic and automated trading strategies that you can deposit HYPE into to receive greater APY than you would if you were using validator staking, for example. Apart from that, you can generate points for multiple protocols simultaneously, as Hyperbeat loops your staked HYPE across different projects. Why farm for a Hyperbeat Airdrop? For all on-chain actions that you conduct through Hyperbeat, you receive “hearts.” It looks a lot like a points system that projects are using to gauge rewards in future airdrops. How to farm for a Hyperbeat Airdrop? Here are the steps: Connect your wallet to the Hyperbeat dApp. Deposit assets into some of the vaults. Earn yield and points by supplying to vaults and staking. Borrow funds against your collateral. Invite users to the platform. Swap assets through the swap function. HyperSwap HyperSwap is a decentralized and AI-powered decentralized exchange that’s built on the HyperEVM. In case you were wondering, yes, there are many tokens already circulating on the HyperEVM, and sometimes you can only trade them through a decentralized exchange like HyperSwap because they are not listed on Hyperliquid’s DEX. The protocol combines Uniswap-style liquidity pools with a smart routing engine that’s designed to optimize swaps across multiple networks. This router minimizes slippage and gas fees by selecting the most efficient route for each trade. Why farm for a HyperSwap Airdrop? HyperSwap, much like any other protocol on our list, has a points system. In other words – users are speculating that this will transition into an airdrop at some point in the future. How to farm for a HyperSwap Airdrop? Here’s what you can do: Bridge funds into HyperEVM usingthe HyperSwap cross-chain bridge. Make regular swaps to earn base points and engage with the router. Provide liquidity. Refer and engage with the community. Felix Protocol Felix is a stablecoin protocol that’s built on HyperEVM. It allows users to mint feUSD, which is a soft-pegged stablecoin. They can do so by locking collateral such as HYPE and a few other cryptocurrencies into CDP vaults. It also offers some vanilla lending markets for dynamic borrowing and lending of supported assets. Some of its core functionalities include collateralized borrowing, seamless on-chain liquidity, yield generation, and more. Why farm for a Felix Protocol Airdrop? You guessed it – Felix Protocol has a points program, and it rewards different types of actions that we will outline in the next point. How to farm for a Felix Protocol Airdrop? Here’s what you can do: Connect your Web3 wallet to the Felix dApp. Mint feUSD using collateral in the CDP vaults. Deposit feUSD into different pools to earn yield. Use vanilla markets – borrow or lend assets ike HYPE. Supply liquidity to the feUSD-involving pools on Kittenswap or HyperSwap. Refer other users. Tips to Maximize Your Airdrop Chances If you’re serious about farming airdrops on Hyperliquid, simply using the platform once or twice is unlikely to be enough. This applies to the other protocols on our list as well. Projects tend to reward users who show consistent and, most importantly, organic activity over time. Here are five practical tips that will help you improve your chances of qualifying for a future airdrop in the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Use the features consistently, not just once Find the core product offering of each protocol because this is (most likely) going to be the rewarding factor. For instance, if you are focusing on a protocol that specializes in lending and borrowing, it’s a good idea to lend and borrow funds. A significant number of previous airdrops have favored users who demonstrate consistent engagement, as opposed to those who have used the platform only once or twice. Use multiple features across the platform Don’t just focus on using one feature – check out all of them. Using the above example as a guide, you may want to provide liquidity to the protocol, utilize a synthetic token (if available), explore various lending and borrowing mechanisms or markets, and so forth. Airdrop criteria often include multiple interaction points with the ecosystem, and engaging with more parts of it can signal that you’re not a bot or just an opportunist. Avoid obvious farming behaviors Don’t try to game the system by making a lot of the same repetitive actions. For instance, if you’re using a trading platform within the HyperEVM, opening and closing small positions quickly is likely not going to do much for you-unless, of course, it’s part of a genuine and consistent trading strategy. Ensure that you use the protocol as intended by genuine users. Stay active in the community and monitor updates Sometimes, being visible within the project’s ecosystem can be beneficial. Join their official Discord or Telegram channels to stay informed and follow for updates. Some projects reward early community supporters as well as on-chain activity. Risks and Realities of Airdrop Farming While airdrop farming is often seen as a way to earn “free money,” it also comes with actual risks, time costs, and a certain set of limitations. Understanding these trade-offs is very important before committing serious effort to farming platforms like the ones I’m talking about in this guide. Time vs. Reward is Never Guaranteed One of the biggest misconceptions is that your effort will guarantee a payout. Many users spend days, even months, interacting with platforms only to receive no airdrops or one worth far less than what they expected. Protocols become a lot more selective and the qualification criteria are almost never disclosed in advance. This creates uncertainty, especially when it comes to managing multiple projects simultaneously. Gas Fees, Trading Fees, and Real Costs We said in the beginning that you won’t be needing to do a direct investment, and this is true, but airdrop farming is still not entirely free. You will need to pay network gas fees and also platform trading fees (in certain cases). These costs can still accumulate over time, especially when using larger volumes. Smart Contract and Platform Risks Vitalik Buterin said it back in 2019 – the chance of every DeFi app failing is never zero. This is especially true for new or rapidly growing platforms, as they often carry risks of bugs or exploits. Most of the protocols in this list fit that criteria – they are relatively young and, as such, it’s not recommended that you work with money that you can’t afford to lose. Conclusion: Is Hyperliquid Airdrop Farming Worth the Time? Despite some of the risks and challenges, Hyperliquid airdrop farming is worth it, especially in the context of potential ecosystem expansion. There are numerous examples from previous cycles where high-performance protocols (such as Solana, for instance) saw massive airdrops happen within its ecosystem and made fortunes for early participants. Frequently Asked Questions How to qualify for a potential Hyperliquid (HYPE) airdrop? There are no guaranteed qualifications, but users who trade on the platform regularly, interact with multiple features, and demonstrate consistent activity over a prolonged period of time are more likely to be eligible. It’s very important to use the platform (and all other protocols) in an authentic and organic way. Can I farm airdrops on multiple wallets? Technically, you can. However, you must be aware of the risks associated with sybil disqualification, especially if you plan to use multiple other addresses. When will Hyperliquid airdrops happen? There is no official timeline for a Hyperliquid airdrop. It could happen at any given moment, or it may not happen at all. Do I need to deposit real money to farm Hyperliquid airdrops? Yes, you must deposit real money to farm Hyperliquid airdrops. Trading on the platform requires collateral and using all other protocols is also associated with real money.

Efforts to boost Cardano’s (ADA) price have yet to bring consistent returns. On Thursday, June 10, the Cardano Foundation released a report detailing its spending in 2024. According to the report, the Foundation spent $15 million on adoption, which includes flashy deals like the one with Barcelona FC. The report details that total expenditures for 2024 were $29.2 million. Of this, $22.1 million was allocated to expanding in strategic areas, including adoption, core operations, and education. Another $7.1 million was dedicated to sustaining these core areas, including legal, finance, and network infrastructure. You might also like: Cardano price approaches key resistance level, can bulls push ADA to $1? The funds came from the Cardano Foundation’s assets, which stood at $659.1 million at the end of 2024. The majority of these funds, or 76.7%, were in ADA, 14.9% were in Bitcoin (BTC) , and 8.3% were in cash and other assets. According to Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, the goal is to ensure that these funds are used effectively. “The focus is on maintaining a sustainable balance between costs and income while maximizing impact for the broader ecosystem,” Frederik Gregaard, Cardano Foundation stated. You might also like: Solana, Cardano, XYZ: How high can these coins climb by the next 60-day cycle? When will Cardano’s price go up? Despite this spending, Cardano’s price performance has been lackluster this year. After a major rally in November, when ADA reached its yearly high of $1.32, the price has been on a sustained downtrend. Currently, Cardano’s price is down 50% from its highs in December of last year. Moreover, Cardano has failed to generate sustained user and developer engagement. Notably, Cardano has just 49 developers and a $348 million total value locked. In comparison, Solana has 232 dApps and TVL of over $20 billion. Additionally, many of these Cardano-based dApps have very little user activity . Cardano’s price will likely only sustainably go up once its ecosystem attracts more developers and more user activity.

Source: TradingView Sentiment hasn’t shifted much, either. The Binance fear and greed index is still in neutral territory at 58, a slight uptick from 52 the previous day. Traders are yet to show full commitment to a continuation above all-time highs. Bitcoin RSI and EMAs keep bullish structure, but hesitation near $112k limits upside Meanwhile, on-chain data flagged movement of dormant Bitcoin from long-term holders who had held coins for seven to ten years. These kinds of transfers often suggest profit-taking, especially after price reaches high-value areas like all-time highs. On the technical front, both the daily and 4-hour RSI are still showing bullish momentum, and price structure is supported by upward-trending EMAs. Bitcoin currently trades between two key levels: $110,530, now acting as support, and $112,000, which serves as resistance. If the price slips below $110,530, there’s a high chance Bitcoin may pull back into the consolidation range that has held for the last eight weeks between $100,000 and $112,000. But if bulls manage to absorb supply and reclaim strength above $112,000, it opens the door for a fresh breakout. Traders had aggressively shorted Bitcoin for nine weeks, but spot buyers defended 100k support . RSI stayed above 50 and signalled strength as Bitcoin held key levels.

Nexo’s 2024 Card Report shows that over 100,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and 750,000 Ethereum ( ETH ) avoided being sold through users accessing the Nexo Card’s collateralized credit line. Weekly card transaction frequency jumped by 324% across the European Economic Area. “Today, people don’t want to choose between their financial future and their present needs — and the Nexo Card reflects that,” noted Chief Product Officer Elitsa Taskova. “It’s empowering users to live fully without losing the potential of their assets. Whether it’s art, travel, or supporting a loved one, crypto is now part of everyday life.” The Mastercard-powered Nexo Card won several 2024 awards from The Digital Banker, FinTech Breakthrough, and INATBA, including Best PayTech for Digital CX – Payments, Consumer Payments Innovation, and Most Exciting Payments Solution of the Year. Usage growth and spending patterns As mentioned earlier, the Nexo Card recorded a 72% rise in credit card mode usage compared to the previous year, alongside 203.3% growth in transaction volume and a 324% jump in weekly transaction frequency. The growth occurs as traditional borrowing declines across Europe, indicating a shift toward crypto-backed lending alternatives. Adoption grew particularly in Southern Europe. Usage increased during key cultural and commercial periods, averaging 223% growth across major seasonal events. High-net-worth users spent 21% of their allocations on travel, while larger transactions typically supported long-term objectives like education and investment rather than everyday purchases.

But while the crypto giant garners headlines, eyes are quietly shifting toward a lesser-known yet fast-emerging coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The token is now in presale, currently in stage 5 at $0.03. Over 60% of the phase has already been sold. Mutuum Finance has over $12 million raised with over 13,000 investors already. As institutional interest stabilizes BTC’s trajectory, Mutuum Finance is carving out a narrative of exponential growth, drawing attention from yield-seeking investors and DeFi enthusiasts alike. Bitcoin Market Update Bitcoin is currently trading around $109,541, consolidating just below its recent all-time high near $112,000. Analysts highlight a key resistance zone at $114,000, where a sustained breakout could pave the way toward broader upside targets in the $143,000–$166,000 range. The rally has been underpinned by ongoing flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, improving macroeconomic sentiment amid expectations of interest rate cuts, and a more supportive U.S. regulatory backdrop. Technical sentiment indicators point to a bullish setup as Bitcoin tightens around key trendlines, though it remains subject to resistance at the $110K–$114K zone. With its movement showing increasing institutional traction and technical resilience, Bitcoin’s current positioning offers a cautiously optimistic backdrop, while attention also now turns toward fresh narratives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). $12M Raised Swiftly in Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has attracted more than 13,000 investors with a raise of more than $12 million. Hype for the project is through the roof and this is clearly a very good sign of the project moving forward. MUTM tokens are $0.03 in phase 5 but will go up 16.67% in phase 6. This phase is already more than 60% sold out as investors scramble to get in at the lowest price. The demand is becoming exponentially excellent and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a disruptor in DeFi is even more precious considering that it will be one of the hot crypto investments of 2025. $100K in Rewards Available Through MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance is set to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with $10,000 MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time’s running out. Mutuum Finance Enhances Security with $50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance has launched its Bug Bounty Program with the help and coordination of CertiK, and a reward pool of 50,000 USDT will be provided in total. Reward is in four levels namely; Major, critical, minor, and low so that each level of exposure will be rewarded. This is one more step confirming that Mutuum is a project with proactive safety attitude and its commitment towards establishing the environment favorable to the finances that can be trusted. While Bitcoin continues to chart a course toward $115,000, bolstered by ETF inflows and bullish technicals, it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s turning heads with its explosive presale performance and high-growth DeFi model. Now in Stage 5 at $0.03, over $12 million has been raised from more than 13,000 investors, with the phase already 60%+ sold out. With a 16.67% price increase locked in for the next stage and bullish projections of a 3,000% rally, Mutuum is shaping up as one of the most promising crypto investments of 2025.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) rose to $0.000012 on Thursday, with its 24-hour volume jumping to over $270 million. This rebound lagged behind that of the top meme coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Pepe ( PEPE ). There are several reasons why Shiba Inu’s rally may be short-lived. First, whales have remained on the sidelines this year, with many selling their coins in a sign of capitulation. Santiment data shows that holders of between 10 million and 1 billion coins have been on a selling spree this year. This selling pressure explains why SHIB has underperformed other meme coins. Shiba Inu whale activity | Source: Santiment Second, Shiba Inu’s open interest in the futures market has been weak in the past few months. Open interest stood at just $179 million on Thursday, July 10, much lower than that of other smaller meme coins like Pepe and Bonk. You might also like: Here’s why Bitcoin and crypto prices are in a bull run today The same is true for Shiba Inu’s volume in the spot market. The $270 million volume on Thursday was lower than Dogecoin’s $2.4 billion, while Pepe, Bonk, and Pudgy Penguins each had over $1 billion. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem is also struggling, with Shibarium holding a total value locked of just $2.3 million and its transaction growth declining. Its other tokens, such as BONE, TREAT, and LEASH, have also not gained traction. Shiba Inu technical analysis points to a dive SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news Meanwhile, technical analysis signals that Shiba Inu price may be on the verge of a bearish breakout. The Average Directional Index has tumbled to 18, a sign that the rally has no momentum. An ADX figure of 20 and below, especially when pointing downward, is usually a bearish sign. Further, Shiba Inu remains below the Supertrend indicator, indicating that this recovery is still weak. The coin also remains below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. The biggest risk, however, is that the ongoing rally is part of the handle section of the inverse cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern often leads to a strong bearish breakdown. Therefore, the coin will likely have a bearish breakout in the near term. This view will be confirmed if it drops below the lower side of the inverse cup-and-handle. Such a move will likely push it below $0.000001.

The crypto community is buzzing with speculation: does this whale know something the rest of us don’t? The massive purchase, flagged by crypto analyst Xaif, is fueling excitement and raising questions across the XRP ecosystem. Given the size and timing of the investment, many believe something big could be brewing for Ripple’s native asset. Whale Confidence Amid Market Volatility XRP has been experiencing significant price swings in recent weeks. After a sharp rise past $2.20 in late June, it briefly dipped to around $1.96 before recovering. Now trading around $2.42, the token appears to be consolidating above a key support zone at $2.30. The whale’s decision to scoop up millions worth at $2.44 suggests strong conviction that XRP is on the verge of a major breakout. What does this whale know that we don’t? He just dropped $9M on $XRP at $2.44 is something HUGE coming? pic.twitter.com/kKrr9h6pdH — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 10, 2025 On-chain data supports this sentiment. Whale activity has been steadily rising since early July, echoing patterns seen before previous XRP rallies. Historically, large transactions like this one have preceded powerful price surges. These deep-pocketed investors often move early—either because they have access to privileged insights or because they’re reading the market with a high degree of sophistication. Xaif’s post reflects a growing view among analysts: this isn’t just a random buy. It could be the start of a strategic accumulation phase ahead of a major bullish event. Technicals and Key Price Levels Technically, XRP is approaching a critical resistance zone between $2.70 and $2.90. A clean break above this range could trigger a full reversal and open the door to new all-time highs. Prominent market watchers like XRPunkie and EGRAG Crypto have identified the $3.30–$5.50 levels as potential medium-term targets. Some are even predicting a longer-term surge toward $10 or $15 if momentum continues building. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Volume, however, remains a crucial factor . While XRP is showing strength, global trade volumes are still under the $10 billion threshold, a level last seen when the token skyrocketed from $0.58 to over $2. Still, large-scale buys like this $9 million purchase could indicate that smart money is preparing for a fresh wave of demand. Ripple vs. SEC: A Final Catalyst? Fueling further speculation is the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case. After Judge Torres rejected both parties’ joint settlement proposal in late June, Ripple announced on June 27 that it would drop its counter-appeal. Many now expect the SEC to follow suit and withdraw its own appeal, which could finally bring the years-long legal battle to an end. Such a resolution would remove a major overhang on XRP and potentially unlock massive institutional interest, especially as talk of an XRP ETF gains steam. For whales and retail investors alike, this could be the moment they’ve been waiting for. Whether this whale knows something we don’t, or is simply betting on what’s to come, one thing is certain: confidence in XRP is quietly building. And the next move could be explosive.

This isn’t just a technical exercise; it’s a significant step towards a more efficient and innovative financial future for Australia. Why is the RBA Stablecoin Trial a Game Changer? Imagine a financial system where transactions are faster, more transparent, and settled almost instantly. That’s the vision driving Project Acacia, the RBA’s pioneering initiative. In collaboration with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) and with the strong support of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the RBA is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in Australia’s financial landscape. The core objective of this RBA stablecoin trial is to understand how crypto assets can enhance the country’s wholesale tokenized asset markets. This isn’t about retail payments for your morning coffee. Instead, it focuses on the large-scale transactions between financial institutions – the kind that underpins the entire economy. By exploring the integration of stablecoins and CBDCs, the RBA aims to unlock new efficiencies and capabilities that traditional systems simply can’t offer. It’s a strategic move to ensure Australia remains at the forefront of global financial innovation. Unpacking Australia CBDC and Its Wholesale Vision The RBA’s pilot program is incredibly comprehensive, diving into 24 distinct use cases. This broad approach allows them to test various scenarios and understand the full potential and challenges of integrating digital currencies. A key component of this trial involves the exploration of an Australia CBDC , specifically a wholesale version. What does this mean in practice? The pilot will involve several types of digital assets: Stablecoins: These are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the Australian dollar. They offer the speed and efficiency of crypto with the stability of traditional money. Bank Deposit Tokens: These represent tokenized versions of commercial bank deposits, allowing for digital transfer and settlement. Wholesale CBDC: This is a digital form of central bank money, accessible only to financial institutions. Unlike a retail CBDC, which would be for public use, a wholesale CBDC aims to improve interbank settlements and the functioning of wholesale markets. Major banks and leading fintech firms are actively participating in this trial, bringing their expertise and real-world scenarios to the testing environment. Their involvement is crucial, as it ensures the solutions developed are practical and scalable for the broader financial industry. Revolutionizing the Tokenized Asset Market At the heart of the RBA’s efforts lies the ambition to revolutionize the tokenized asset market . But what exactly are tokenized assets? Simply put, they are digital representations of real-world assets – anything from real estate and commodities to shares and bonds – stored on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). Think about the current process for settling complex financial transactions involving multiple parties and assets. It can be slow, costly, and require numerous intermediaries. Tokenization, combined with digital currencies, promises to streamline this. Here’s how it could transform wholesale markets: Atomic Settlement: This means transactions can be settled instantly and simultaneously, eliminating settlement risk where one party fulfills their obligation but the other doesn’t. Increased Efficiency: Automated processes and reduced manual intervention lead to lower operational costs and faster transaction speeds. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear, auditable trail of all transactions. Greater Liquidity: Tokenization can fractionalize high-value assets, making them more accessible and potentially increasing market liquidity. For example, imagine a bank wanting to settle a large bond transaction. Instead of waiting days for traditional settlement systems, a tokenized bond could be exchanged for a wholesale CBDC almost instantly, significantly reducing counterparty risk and freeing up capital. The Ripple Effect: Digital Finance Innovation Down Under This initiative is not just about a single trial; it’s a testament to Australia’s commitment to fostering broad digital finance innovation . The RBA, in conjunction with ASIC and the DFCRC, is building a framework for future financial services that leverages cutting-edge technology. This proactive approach positions Australia as a leader in adapting to the evolving digital economy. Globally, central banks are grappling with the rise of digital currencies. By actively experimenting with stablecoins and a wholesale CBDC, Australia is contributing valuable insights to the international discourse. This collaborative effort helps to inform regulatory approaches and ensure that new financial technologies are introduced responsibly, protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. The regulatory support from ASIC is particularly important, as it ensures that any new digital asset frameworks prioritize market integrity, consumer protection, and financial stability. This balance between innovation and regulation is key to successful adoption. Understanding the Power of Wholesale Digital Currency While much of the public discussion around digital currencies focuses on retail applications, the true transformative potential for large-scale financial markets often lies in wholesale digital currency . This distinction is crucial. A wholesale CBDC, for instance, isn’t designed for everyday purchases. Its primary role is to facilitate interbank settlements, provide a secure and efficient means for financial institutions to transfer value, and enable the seamless integration of tokenized assets. Think of it as the high-speed rail network for the financial world, rather than a local bus service. The benefits for institutions are profound: Enhanced Security: Transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger, offering robust cryptographic security. Reduced Settlement Times: Near-instantaneous settlement drastically cuts down on processing delays. Lower Costs: Automation and disintermediation can lead to significant cost savings in clearing and settlement. New Financial Products: The programmability of digital currencies allows for the creation of innovative financial instruments and smart contracts, automating complex agreements. This wholesale focus is strategic because it addresses the foundational layers of the financial system, potentially unlocking efficiencies that ripple outwards to benefit the entire economy. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the potential is immense, the path forward is not without its challenges. Key considerations include: Interoperability: Ensuring that different digital platforms and currencies can seamlessly communicate and transact with each other. Regulatory Clarity: Developing clear and consistent regulatory frameworks that foster innovation while mitigating risks. Cybersecurity: Protecting these new digital infrastructures from sophisticated cyber threats. Technological Scalability: Ensuring the underlying technology can handle the vast volume of transactions required by wholesale markets. The RBA’s trial is precisely designed to address these questions, providing valuable data and insights to inform future policy decisions. It’s a collaborative effort that requires ongoing dialogue between central banks, financial institutions, technology providers, and regulators. Conclusion The Reserve Bank of Australia’s ongoing trial of stablecoins and wholesale CBDCs within the tokenized asset market represents a monumental step forward for the nation’s financial future. By actively exploring these digital frontiers, Australia is not just adapting to change; it’s helping to shape it. This initiative promises to bring greater efficiency, transparency, and innovation to wholesale financial markets, setting a strong precedent for other nations to follow. The journey towards a truly digital financial ecosystem is complex, but with pioneering efforts like Project Acacia, the future of finance looks incredibly promising.

As of 7/9/25, we hodl 1021 $BTC acquired for ~ $101 million at ~ $98,627 per bitcoin. $KULR pic.twitter.com/aXyB0AABsr — Michael Mo (@michaelmokulr) July 10, 2025 In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm said with additional bitcoin purchases totaling approximately $10 million, KULR now holds 1,021 BTC, valued at about $101 million. The latest acquisitions were made at a weighted average price of $108,884 per bitcoin, including fees and expenses. This move is in line with the company’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, first announced on December 4, 2024, under which up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves are allocated to bitcoin. BTC Yield Emerges as Key Performance Indicator A core component of KULR’s strategy is its proprietary metric: BTC Yield. This figure, which reached 291.2% year to date, measures the percentage increase in the ratio of bitcoin holdings to Assumed Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding. According to the firm it is intended to reflect the effectiveness of the company’s bitcoin acquisition tactics. Complementary metrics include BTC Gain (633 BTC), BTC Dollar Gain ($70.3 million), and a multiple of Net Asset Value (mNAV) currently at 2.24. KULR notes these metrics are designed to capture the value-accretive nature of its treasury operations, rather than serve as traditional financial indicators. Cautions on Interpreting BTC Metrics While BTC Yield offers insight into KULR’s Bitcoin-centric strategy, the company cautions that it should not be considered a proxy for earnings performance or liquidity. It excludes liabilities and does not reflect overall financial health. KULR said that its stock price is influenced by a broader set of variables beyond bitcoin holdings. Investors are advised to use BTC Yield as a supplemental tool and refer to the company’s full financial statements and SEC filings for a comprehensive view of its position. KULR Price Action – Modest Gain KULR Technology is trading at $6.58 today, up 2%, reflecting modest intraday gains. KULR continues to show investor confidence, supported by its Bitcoin-driven narrative and endorsements by analysts. That said, it remains a volatile, technically uncertain stock.

Bitcoin (BTC) recently shattered records, hitting an astonishing new all-time high of $112,014. While such milestones always spark curiosity, a deeper dive reveals a fascinating driving force behind this monumental surge: aggressive buying from U.S. investors. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a conclusion backed by insightful CryptoQuant analysis , shedding light on the powerful dynamics at play in the market. Understanding the Coinbase Premium: A Key Indicator for Bitcoin Price When we talk about the influence of U.S. buyers, a crucial metric comes into play: the Coinbase Premium . But what exactly is it, and why is it so important for understanding Bitcoin price movements? The Coinbase Premium Gap measures the difference in Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase, a popular U.S.-based exchange, compared to other global exchanges like Binance. A positive premium indicates that buyers on Coinbase are willing to pay more for BTC than their counterparts elsewhere. This often signals strong demand from U.S. institutional and large retail investors, who frequently use Coinbase due to its regulatory compliance and liquidity. Recent Spike: CryptoQuant, citing crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci, highlighted that the Coinbase Premium Gap for BTC recently swelled to 42 points. This means U.S. buyers on Coinbase were paying a significant $42 more per Bitcoin than those trading on Binance. Aggressive Accumulation: This wasn’t an isolated incident. Just the week prior, the gap expanded even further, reaching as high as $87.76. Such consistent and substantial premiums are a clear indicator of aggressive accumulation by U.S. entities, signaling strong confidence and a willingness to acquire BTC at higher prices. Market Barometer: The Coinbase Premium acts as a real-time barometer for U.S. demand, offering valuable insights into the conviction of a major segment of the global crypto market. Why Are US Crypto Investors So Aggressive? The question naturally arises: what’s fueling this remarkable aggression from US crypto investors ? Several factors contribute to the robust demand observed on U.S. exchanges, distinguishing them from other global markets: 1. Institutional Inflows and Spot ETFs: The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has been a game-changer. These ETFs provide a regulated, accessible, and familiar pathway for traditional financial institutions, wealth managers, and even individual investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. The sheer volume of inflows into these ETFs since their launch has been unprecedented, acting as a major demand driver. 2. Regulatory Clarity (or Perceived Clarity): While the U.S. regulatory landscape for crypto remains complex, the existence of regulated entities like Coinbase and the approval of ETFs provide a degree of comfort for larger players seeking compliant avenues for investment. This perceived clarity encourages more traditional capital to enter the market. 3. Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and the search for uncorrelated assets continue to push investors towards Bitcoin. U.S. investors, with significant capital, are often at the forefront of allocating funds to alternative assets like BTC as a hedge or growth opportunity. 4. Tech-Savvy Investor Base: The U.S. boasts a large and increasingly sophisticated investor base, including a significant number of tech-aware individuals and institutions eager to explore innovative investment opportunities in the digital asset space. BTC All-Time High: What Drove This Historic Milestone? The recent BTC all-time high wasn’t just a random event; it was the culmination of several converging factors, with U.S. buying playing a pivotal role. Beyond the direct demand from Coinbase, the broader market context provided fertile ground for this record-breaking surge: Pre-Halving Hype: Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events (which reduce the supply of new BTC) have preceded significant price rallies. The anticipation of the upcoming halving fueled bullish sentiment. Increasing Liquidity: Despite some market corrections, overall liquidity in the crypto market has been on an upward trend, indicating growing investor confidence and capital availability. Global Adoption: Beyond the U.S., increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies worldwide, from payment solutions to corporate treasury strategies, contributes to a positive long-term outlook for Bitcoin. The aggressive buying from U.S. investors, particularly through regulated channels, signifies a maturing market where institutional capital is increasingly dictating the pace. This shift from primarily retail-driven rallies to institutionally-backed surges adds a layer of stability and credibility to Bitcoin’s price discovery process. CryptoQuant Analysis Unveils Deeper Market Insights The insights provided by CryptoQuant are invaluable for understanding these complex market dynamics. CryptoQuant analysis utilizes on-chain data and proprietary metrics to provide a deeper look into investor behavior, market flows, and potential trends. Their platform tracks vast amounts of data, from exchange inflows/outflows to miner activity and derivatives markets, offering a comprehensive view of the crypto ecosystem. By specifically highlighting the Coinbase Premium Gap and attributing the recent BTC all-time high to U.S. buying, CryptoQuant and analyst Burak Kesmeci are providing actionable intelligence that goes beyond simple price charts. This type of data-driven analysis helps investors and traders make more informed decisions, understanding the underlying forces driving market movements rather than just reacting to them. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors Given the aggressive U.S. buying and Bitcoin’s recent record-breaking performance, what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Continue to monitor on-chain metrics and market analysis from reputable sources like CryptoQuant. Understanding the flow of capital can provide early signals of market shifts. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is inherent in crypto, the growing institutional interest and the structural drivers behind Bitcoin’s adoption suggest a strong long-term growth trajectory. Risk Management: Despite the bullish sentiment, the crypto market remains volatile. Always invest only what you can afford to lose and consider diversification within your portfolio. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just react to price movements. Try to understand the underlying reasons, whether it’s institutional demand, macroeconomic factors, or technological advancements, to make more reasoned investment choices. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Bitcoin’s recent ascent to an astounding new all-time high, significantly propelled by aggressive U.S. buying and a widening Coinbase Premium , marks a pivotal moment in its journey. This isn’t merely a price pump; it’s a clear signal of growing institutional confidence and the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. The insightful CryptoQuant analysis has illuminated the powerful role of US crypto investors , showcasing how their robust demand is shaping the market’s trajectory. As Bitcoin continues to evolve, understanding these fundamental drivers will be key for anyone looking to navigate the exciting, yet complex, world of cryptocurrency.

The company raises red flags for its offshore connections and a relatively low BTC treasury. BIT Mining, a NYSE-listed company registered in an offshore territory, has promised to be among the first to implement a SOL treasury strategy. The company announced it would raise up to $300M, depending on market conditions, and switch its reserves to SOL. Currently, BIT Mining is ranked #102 based on a treasury of just 19 BTC, acquired at a price of $77,526. BIT Mining is the second BTC treasury company to pivot to an altcoin, following Bit Digital’s decision to fully shift to ETH. The scale of the SOL treasury is much larger compared to even the combined BTC and altcoin holdings of BIT Mining. The company also reported 1,246 ETH, 7.6M DOGE, 900K USDT, and 1,770 LTC. The assets were acquired during a period of mining activity and are held by BIT Mining Limited, a Cayman Islands holding company. BIT Mining intends to convert all holdings to SOL and participate in the Solana ecosystem as a validator and node operator. The SOL treasury will also accrue passive income through staking and rewards. BIT Mining reinvents itself after its casino past BIT Mining recently changed its identity from its former casino business, known as 500.com . The company had subsidiaries in Hong Kong, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Malta, Cyprus, Curacao, the United States, and China. In November 2024, the company was fined $10M in connection with a failed bribery scheme in Japan, where 500.com attempted to receive a casino license. The fine is owed to the US Department of Justice and partially to the US SEC, and was lowered from $54M due to inability to pay. Despite the company’s past, demand for treasury companies gives BIT Mining a chance at pivoting. The company retains its mining operations, data centers, hosting, and hardware, but will expand into Solana’s staking ecosystem. Treasury announcement revives BIT Mining share price BIT Mining lost over 98% of its price since the initial listing in 2015. Over the years, the company stock continued to slide, down to a valuation of just $40M. BIT Mining went vertical following the SOL treasury announcement, but is still down from its peak by 98%. | Source: Google Finance The recent SOL treasury announcement brought the price of BIT Mining to the highest level in the past 12 months, above $5.80. BTCM shares expanded by over 90% in the past year on average, but gained a net 137% in the past five days. The treasury effect may be short-lived, as the shares quickly slid from their peak of $6.97. BIT Mining is also not clear about its plan to acquire SOL, using the announcement effect to boost its visibility and share price. The company announced that SOL acquisitions will depend on access to capital and market conditions, a feat that is difficult even for large-scale BTC treasury companies. For now, the leading Solana treasury company is still DeFi Development Corp., still trading near its higher range at $22.86.

Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) rose to $0.30, its highest level since May 23, and 35% above the lowest point in June. Its market capitalization has jumped to nearly $9 billion. DeFi Llama data shows that the total value locked in Stellar’s decentralized finance has soared to a record high of $98 million. This is a strong rally, as TVL started the year at $50 million. Including Franklin Templeton’s tokenized fund, Stellar’s TVL has jumped to over $543 million.

The supply of USD Coin ( USDC ) in the network has jumped to $172 million, while EURC has climbed to $1.85 million. Rising stablecoin supply in a network signals growing utility. Meanwhile, Stellar’s futures open interest and weighted funding rate have continued to grow. Open interest rose to $246 million, the highest level since January, a sign of strong demand. Spot volume jumped to nearly $927 million, with most of it on Binance and Bitget. XLM crypto price technical analysis Stellar price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily timeframe shows that the XLM price formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.2170 in April and June. This pattern had a neckline at $0.3323, its highest level in June this year. Stellar Lumens price also moved above the upper side of the descending channel. This channel is part of a bullish flag pattern, a highly popular bullish continuation signal. Stellar has jumped above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, indicating that bulls are in control. Further, the Average Directional Index has moved above 20, a sign that the trend is gaining strength. The Relative Strength Index has risen to its highest level since May. Therefore, the most likely scenario is a move up to the neckline at $0.3323. A move above that level will point to more upside, with the key level to watch at $0.4247, the 38.2% retracement level.

The rule, known as TD 10021 (RIN 1545-BR39), had already been repealed by Congress, and President Donald Trump signed off on it in April, killing the expanded IRS definition of a “broker.” TD 10021 had originally been built under Section 6045 of the tax code and backed by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. It was approved in December 2024, and it would’ve made DeFi protocols report customer activity as if they were traditional brokers. That meant identifying users and tracking all transactions, even though these platforms don’t hold customer data or custody crypto. It was scheduled to go live in 2025, with full enforcement planned for 2026. Congress shuts it down, Trump signs it off The rejection didn’t come out of nowhere. The expanded broker rule faced backlash from the minute it was announced. Developers, privacy advocates, and policy groups pushed back hard. Their argument? DeFi platforms can’t comply with rules written for custodians. Most DeFi tools don’t have sign-ins, don’t store names, and don’t control wallets. There’s nothing to report. Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, said, “You can’t report data you don’t have.” His group wasn’t alone. Industry organizations warned that if the rule passed, it would crush open-source development in the U.S. and push teams offshore. Even wallet providers, who don’t touch funds, were getting swept into the rule’s broad language. By early 2025, opposition made it to Congress. Lawmakers used the Congressional Review Act to repeal the regulation entirely. It passed the Senate 70–28, then cleared the House. Trump signed the bill into law on April 11, officially cutting the IRS’s plan off before it could take effect. The law was clear: Congress didn’t want DeFi treated like brokerage firms. The Treasury’s withdrawal this week confirms it got the message. In its filing, the department acknowledged that broker reporting should only apply to custodial exchanges and intermediaries. That means platforms like Coinbase or Binance US are still covered. But the rule no longer touches decentralized protocols or front-end developers. IRS rule dies, but crypto still on Treasury’s radar The now-scrapped rule had introduced a new form—1099-DA—for crypto brokers to file with the IRS. It required detailed transaction data: amounts, wallet addresses, and identities. The IRS designed it to mirror the way stock brokerages report trades. But applying that to DeFi was a mess. The language in the rule was so wide that even tools with no control over user funds, like token aggregators and some wallet interfaces, would have had to comply. Critics called it unworkable. Many also said it violated basic privacy rights. Still, the Treasury isn’t stepping away from crypto altogether. Under Scott Bessent, the department has been active elsewhere. Throughout 2023 and 2024, it’s issued sanctions against players in Iran’s shadow banking networks and flagged North Korean-linked hackers suspected of laundering stolen crypto. That tells you they’re still watching illicit finance closely, even as they ease up on domestic crypto developers. On the global front, the Treasury is locked into bigger financial policy debates. It’s part of ongoing G7 discussions on setting a global minimum tax and is also working through tariff negotiations that tie into international digital trade. These talks reflect broader U.S. efforts to stay aligned with allies on tax and finance, even while scaling back harsh local rules. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?
