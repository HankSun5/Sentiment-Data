Among them, a Dogecoin (DOGE) whale, known for his strategic moves and significant market influence, has recently turned their attention to an emerging AI altcoin, PCHAIN, currently valued at just $0.01. This shift signals a growing belief in the potential of AI-driven crypto assets to outperform traditional tokens, Ethereum, XRP, DOGE , etc., in 2025. With a focus on innovation and real-world utility, this AI altcoin has captured the interest of both seasoned investors and newcomers eager to capitalize on the next wave in 2025. As the intersection of AI and blockchain technology gains momentum, this low-cost, low-market-cap AI altcoin is positioning itself as a disruptive force in the crypto market. Its unique value propositions, including advanced AI integration for predictive analytics and tokenization of real estate, have set it apart from other projects. Backed by the Dogecoin whale’s endorsement, market analysts forecast that this under-the-radar coin could deliver exponential gains in 2025. This has made this AI altcoin, PCHAIN, a must-watch for investors seeking high-growth opportunities in the evolving crypto market in 2025. PCHAIN: The AI Altcoin with over 43,640% Growth Potential This AI altcoin that has captured the attention of the Dogecoin whale is the utility token of PropiChain. PropiChain is a blockchain-powered real estate tokenization platform designed to power the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. Aside from PCHAIN’s unique value proposition, another major thing that has caught the eye of the Dogecoin whale is the token’s profit potential. According to leading market analysts and experts, this AI-powered real estate altcoin is poised to hit a 43,640% rally. Priced at just $0.01 for its ongoing presale, this crypto asset combines low entry opportunity, robust technology, and real-world utility to drive its market growth. This positions the AI altcoin as a compelling choice for investors seeking low-risk, high-reward opportunities. Dogecoin Whale Backing: What it Means Dogecoin whales are known for their significant influence in the crypto market. These individuals or entities can sway market sentiment and drive price movements by holding substantial amounts of DOGE. When a whale endorses a lesser-known altcoin, it often garners widespread attention and trust among retail and institutional investors alike. The Dogecoin whale’s backing of this AI-powered altcoin suggests confidence in its potential. Like every seasoned crypto investor, the Dogecoin Whale typically conducts thorough research before making substantial investments. This whale considered technology, utility, team credibility, and market trends. This Dogecoin whale endorsement could serve as a catalyst for increased adoption and price appreciation. Why the Dogecoin Whale is Backing this AI Altcoin Here are some key factors that motivated the Dogecoin whale to back PCHAIN for over 43,640% rally in 2025: Growing Market Demand This AI-powered token is an RWA altcoin that bridges the gap between the number one asset class in the world and the blockchain. With the RWA tokenization market projected to grow to $16 trillion , PCHAIN gives investors the early-mover advantage to capitalize on the market. This unique use case has increased the demand for the PropiChain token as investors seek to position themselves for maximum gains in the $16 trillion RWA tokenization market. Affordability Priced at $0.01, this AI-based RWA altcoin offers an accessible entry point for investors. This affordability and its potential for exponential growth make it an attractive prospect for early investors. Real-World Use Cases The altcoin’s roadmap includes applications in the multi-trillion-dollar global property market. By solving the inefficiencies in the property market, PCHAIN establishes its long-term utility and value, unlike DOGE, which thrives on market hype. PropiChain: Your Gateway to the Future Real Estate Property Ownership PropiChain is transforming the property market using advanced technologies to revolutionize property transactions. The platform sets a new benchmark for buying, selling, and investing in real estate with its innovative features. Immersive Virtual Property Tours in the Metaverse PropiChain is reshaping how properties are scouted by utilizing state-of-the-art Metaverse technology. This lets buyers and investors experience properties through fully immersive 3D virtual tours. Investors and buyers can save significant time and resources while still making informed decisions. The platform makes global real estate opportunities accessible to everyone by overcoming geographical constraints. This cutting-edge approach eliminates the logistical challenges of traditional property viewings, enabling instant evaluations without requiring in-person visits. Blockchain-Enabled Smart Contracts At the core of PropiChain’s efficiency is the integration of blockchain-powered smart contracts. These self-executing contracts automate critical real estate processes, such as ownership transfers, lease agreements, and rent collections. By automating these operations, the platform reduces dependency on intermediaries like brokers, offering secure, cost-effective, and seamless transactions. This innovation ensures transparency and trust in every deal. AI-Powered Real Estate Insights PropiChain employs sophisticated artificial intelligence to enhance decision-making in real estate investments. Its AI-driven virtual assistants and chatbots provide round-the-clock support, helping users navigate the market’s complexities easily. Its predictive AI tools also analyze market trends, project property value changes, and deliver actionable recommendations. These data-backed insights empower investors to make smarter, more profitable decisions while minimizing risk. Tokenized Real Estate for Broader Accessibility PropiChain pioneers the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA), transforming real estate properties into digital tokens. This enables fractional ownership of high-value properties, increasing market liquidity and making property investments accessible to a wider audience. This innovative model allows global investors to participate in the property markets, breaking down financial barriers and democratizing individual property ownership, regardless of capital size. PropiChain Presale: Your 43,640% ROI Opportunity PCHAIN’s focus on real-world utility combined with its potential for a 43,640% rally positions it for the top-gamer position in 2025. The Dogecoin whale’s backing is the icing on the cake, further attracting investors. According to market experts, a $1000 investment in the PCHAIN presale would yield over $ 430, 640 ROI in 2025. The Project has raised over $1.3 million in the first presale round and already crossed the $990,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round. This underscores the high confidence of investors in the project’s potential. After this presale round, the token price will rise by over 109% for the third and final presale round. Join the PCHAIN presale now to enjoy over 43,000% ROI in 2025. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , highlighting the project’s readiness to do bigger things in the crypto space.

39297733,https://nulltx.com/?p=140251,1737586834,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,TRUMP Token Crashes 50% Leading Many to a Cheaper Alternative Priced at Only $0.07 Eyeing a Run to $3,https://nulltx.com/the-trump-token-crashes-50-leading-many-to-a-cheaper-alternative-priced-at-only-0-07-eyeing-a-run-to-3/,"The TRUMP token’s fast rise has taken a sharp turn, with its value crashing 50%. While this has sent shockwaves through the market, experienced investors are turning their attention to a more affordable and promising alternative; RCO Finance (RCOF). Currently priced at just $0.07, RCOF is eyeing a potential surge to $3, presenting an opportunity for exponential gains. Unlike volatile memecoins, RCOF offers real-world utility and a robust ecosystem, making it a compelling choice for those seeking stability and growth. The TRUMP Token’s Meteoric Rise and Sudden Fall The TRUMP token’s debut took the crypto world by storm, largely due to its high-profile association with US President-elect Donald Trump. Launched by CIC Digital LLC, the token surged to a peak market cap of $5.5 billion within hours of its launch. For a time, it seemed like the TRUMP token was set to redefine meme coin success stories. However, the euphoria was short-lived as the token’s value plunged by nearly 50%, leaving latecomers scrambling to recover losses. The TRUMP token only emphasizes the volatile nature of meme coins. Prone to speculative hype, these tokens often experience massive initial gains followed by sharp declines. Early investors typically cash out at the peak, leaving others to face significant losses. For instance, after trading at $75, the TRUMP token now sits at $37, highlighting the risk associated with such ventures. This steep decline has sparked a growing interest in emerging assets with intrinsic value, such as RCO Finance (RCOF). Unlike meme coins, with limited use cases, RCOF offers a comprehensive ecosystem designed to deliver real-world financial solutions. RCO Finance is a More Promising Alternative RCO Finance (RCOF) stands out as a beacon of innovation in DeFi. Its ecosystem isn’t just about crypto; it’s about creating a financial hub that empowers users to take control of their wealth. One of RCOF’s standout features is its AI-powered robo-advisor, which provides tailored investment strategies based on market analysis. For instance, an investor seeking to diversify can rely on this tool to identify opportunities across 120,000 assets, including stocks, ETFs, and tokenized real estate. This feature acts as a personal financial guide, making complex investment decisions accessible to everyone. Another game-changer is RCOF’s debit card, which allows users to spend their crypto seamlessly in the real world. This card bridges the gap between digital assets and everyday spending, whether you’re trying to pay for groceries or booking travel. Add to that the platform’s KYC-free model, and users can trade without cumbersome verification processes, offering unparalleled convenience and privacy. Also, features like borrowing and lending enable users to use their assets effectively, while tokenization opens doors to fractional ownership in high-value assets like real estate. Security is paramount in RCOF’s design. The platform has undergone a rigorous audit by SolidProof, ensuring its reliability and transparency. Unlike the speculative nature of the TRUMP token, RCOF provides tangible benefits, making it a smarter choice for long-term investors. The RCOF Presale: Affordable Entry With Exponential Potential For investors looking to get in early, RCOF’s presale offers a golden opportunity. Currently priced at $0.07, the token is projected to reach $3 by 2025, representing a massive growth potential. To put this into perspective, investing just $1,000 at the current price would yield approximately 14,285 tokens. When the price rises to $0.1 in the next presale stage, the value of that investment would increase to $1,428. When RCOF hits $3, those same tokens would be worth over $42,855. This shows the rewards of investing in a value-driven asset. The platform has already raised over $10 million, signaling strong investor confidence. With features designed to address real-world financial needs, RCOF is poised to deliver gains reminiscent of the TRUMP token’s early days, but with far greater stability. Why RCOF Stands Out as the Smart Choice The volatility of the TRUMP token serves as a cautionary tale for crypto investors. While meme coins can deliver short-term gains, they often lack what’s needed for sustained growth. RCO Finance, on the other hand, combines innovation, security, and real-world utility to create a comprehensive financial ecosystem. As the presale continues, now is the time to act. At $0.07, RCOF is at its lowest price, offering a rare chance to secure a position in a project with immense potential. Don’t let the opportunity slip away as this could be the next big thing, delivering gains that rival the TRUMP token’s initial success but with far less risk.

According to a recent filing by the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the previous decision to place sanctions on the digital assets tumbler has been lifted. “It is ordered and Adjudged that the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals District Court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of this Court.” Tornado Cash was first sanctioned by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) after being deemed a threat to the nation’s security as hackers associated with the government of North Korea were believed to have used it to clean stolen funds. Crypto mixers allow users to obfuscate the source of their digital assets by mixing them with other coins from different sources and giving each user back the dollar amount they put in. In November, the court ruled that the OFAC’s sanctions failed to correctly define “property” in their sanctions. He went on to say that if “property” means “capable of being owned,” then Tornado Cash and its smart contracts wouldn’t quality, thus making the sanctions unlawful. “Contrary to the Department’s arguments, the immutable smart contracts are not services. So even when we consider OFAC’s regulatory definitions, the immutable smart contracts are not property because they are not ownable, not contracts, and not services.” News of the landmark ruling caused TORN to spark a massive rally, going from a price of $8.08 on January 21 to a peak of $25.28, a gain of 212%. The token has since retraced and is moving for $19.57 at time of writing.

However, Solana (SOL) remains criticized for its ecosystem rate of inflation and network outages that have plagued the platform. Meanwhile, Remittix is amassing popularity among investors for its pragmatic approach to solving issues in the cross-border payment space. Packing plenty of utility for investors, businesses and individuals, this project is poised to disrupt the PayFi space in 2025. So what are the key features that are drawing so many to Remittix and how will Solana fare over the next quarter? Solana (SOL) Posts Strong Gains In January Solana (SOL) had a slow 2024, causing impatience among many holders, though it has caught a second wind in the first few weeks of January. Solana’s net gain now stands at 61% over the last month with most of that increase over just the last week. Solana’s market cap has stormed back past $100 billion now settling on $124.51 billion. Though it’s not clear how much further Solana (SOL) could go. Despite its successes, some critics of Solana (SOL) are still skeptical of its growth, believing it may face corrective price action in the near future. A New Era for Cross-Border Payments Via the powerful Remittix (RTX) platform, users can convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and transfer funds directly to global bank accounts. Unlike traditional systems laden with hidden fees and unpredictability, Remittix operates with a flat rate pricing model, ensuring that recipients receive exactly what is sent. This straightforward approach and the cost effective structure make Remittix an appealing option for both personal and business use. Crypto Payment Adoption for Businesses Remittix also offers powerful tools for businesses to embrace cryptocurrency as a viable payment option. The Remittix Pay API is an impressive piece of technology, enabling companies to accept crypto payments from their customers while settling transactions in fiat and transferring the funds to their desired bank account. This solution is particularly ideal for individuals and businesses who are aware of the potential of the cryptocurrency market and customer base, but who do not feel comfortable navigating its complexities. User Privacy Another key feature of Remittix (RTX) is its focus on user privacy. Transactions processed through Remittix arrive as conventional bank transfers, completely hiding their cryptocurrency origins. This approach offers both individuals and businesses greater confidence in adopting blockchain solutions without attracting unwanted attention. This is particularly helpful in industries where crypto payments may carry some stigma. Remittix Presale Surpasses $4 Million Raised Currently in its presale phase, Remittix (RTX) is demonstrating potential having already raised over $4 million and maintaining its strong momentum.

So, what features are attracting attention to Remittix, and how might Solana perform in the upcoming months? Solana (SOL) Achieves Significant Gains In January Solana (SOL) endured a sluggish 2024, testing the patience of many of its holders, but it has rebounded strongly in the opening weeks of January. Solana's net gain now stands at 61% over the past month, with the majority of this rise occurring recently. Its market cap has surged beyond $100 billion, currently resting at $124.51 billion. Despite these achievements, some Solana (SOL) critics remain doubtful about its future growth, predicting it might soon encounter a price correction. A New Phase for Global Payments Through the innovative Remittix (RTX) platform, users can convert more than 40 different cryptocurrencies into fiat money, sending it directly to international bank accounts. Unlike traditional systems with hidden fees and uncertainties, Remittix employs a straightforward flat-rate pricing model, ensuring recipients receive exactly the amount sent.

Initially viewed as a digital currency for speculation and investment, crypto has expanded its reach into various sectors, creating unique opportunities that go far beyond just trading. Today, cryptocurrency is shaping new industries, offering innovative solutions to everyday problems, and providing creative ways for individuals to engage with technology. 1. Charitable Donations and Fundraising Cryptocurrency is making waves in the world of philanthropy, offering a new way for individuals and organizations to donate to causes they care about. Crypto donations are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer several advantages over traditional charitable giving methods. One of the biggest benefits is that cryptocurrency donations are often faster and cheaper than traditional payment methods, as they bypass intermediaries like banks and payment processors. Cryptocurrency also allows for greater transparency in donations. Since blockchain technology is public and immutable, charitable organizations can track how funds are being spent, ensuring that donations go directly to the intended cause. This level of transparency builds trust between donors and organizations, making it easier for people to feel confident in their contributions. 2. Crypto Gaming Cryptocurrency is transforming the gaming industry, offering new ways for players to earn rewards and enjoy secure, fast transactions. In play-to-earn (P2E) games, players can earn cryptocurrency or NFTs by participating in in-game activities, allowing them to monetize their time and efforts. These games are built on decentralized networks that ensure transparency and security, with rewards tied to the value of digital assets, which can be traded or used for in-game purchases. Online crypto casinos are also growing in popularity, enabling players to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This provides faster transactions, increased privacy, and a more secure experience than traditional payment methods. Bitcoin casinos offer a wide variety of games, from blackjack to slots, with live dealer options available. With exclusive bonuses and lower fees, crypto casinos are quickly becoming the preferred choice for many players. 3. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Cryptocurrency has introduced a new era of decentralized finance (DeFi), a system that allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their digital assets without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks. DeFi platforms leverage blockchain technology to create open, permissionless financial services that are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Through DeFi, individuals can participate in activities such as yield farming, staking, and liquidity provision . Yield farming allows users to earn passive income by lending their cryptocurrency to others in exchange for interest, while staking involves locking up digital assets in a network to support its security in exchange for rewards. Liquidity provision involves adding funds to a decentralized exchange (DEX) to facilitate trades and earn a share of the transaction fees. 4. Tokenizing Real-World Assets Another innovative application of cryptocurrency is the tokenization of real-world assets. Tokenization refers to the process of converting ownership of real-world assets—like real estate, art, or even stocks—into virtual tokens that can be traded via the blockchain. These tokens represent ownership or a stake in the underlying asset and can be bought, sold, or exchanged with greater ease. For example, a real estate property could be tokenized , with each token representing a fractional share of the property. Investors can then buy or sell these tokens without needing to go through traditional property buying or selling processes, which can be time-consuming and costly. Tokenization opens up investment opportunities to a wider audience, allowing individuals to invest in assets that were previously out of reach due to high entry costs. 5. Digital Identity and Authentication Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are also paving the way for more secure and privacy-focused digital identities. With concerns over data privacy and security becoming increasingly prevalent, blockchain-based identity solutions are gaining traction. These decentralized digital identities give individuals greater control over their personal information and reduce the risk of data breaches. Blockchain-powered digital identity systems can be used for a variety of purposes, including secure login processes, online voting, and identity verification in financial services. By using cryptographic methods to secure personal data, these systems allow users to authenticate their identity without relying on centralized institutions or risking their sensitive information being compromised. 6. Tokenized Rewards and Loyalty Programs Loyalty programs have long been a staple of consumer engagement, but cryptocurrency is now transforming how rewards and incentives are offered. Brands are exploring ways to tokenize loyalty points, offering customers cryptocurrency-based rewards that can be redeemed across multiple platforms. These tokens can also be traded or sold, adding value to the loyalty program beyond simple discounts or gifts. By tokenizing rewards, businesses create a more flexible, transparent, and transferable incentive system that benefits both customers and companies. Customers can earn tokens for purchasing products, sharing content, or engaging with brands, and these tokens can then be used to access special perks, products, or experiences within a decentralized ecosystem.

The digital asset market is experiencing a surge of activity, with exciting presales, transformative mainnet launches, and boundary-pushing projects. Whether you’re an experienced trader or new to the world of crypto, this year presents ample opportunities for bold investment decisions. Within the dynamic blockchain ecosystem, several projects have solidified their standing. Litecoin continues to maintain its relevance as a staple in the digital currency market, while NEAR Protocol has garnered attention for its scalability and developer-centric updates. However, the newcomer Qubetics is quickly gaining momentum, with a presale performance that has captured the attention of the crypto community. If you are seeking the top cryptocurrencies to consider for short-term investment, Qubetics has likely come onto your radar. As a revolutionary Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is making waves with its innovative tools and exceptional presale results. But how does it compare to the established players like Litecoin and NEAR Protocol? Let’s explore the details. Qubetics: The Best Crypto Presale to Join for Short Term Gains When the term “ Web3 aggregator ” is mentioned, Qubetics should immediately come to mind. This groundbreaking project is transforming blockchain interoperability by building a platform that enables seamless movement of assets, data, and identities across various chains. This isn’t As of January 22, 2025, Qubetics has already raised over $10.2 million in its presale. With more than 15,500 token holders and 430 million $TICS tokens sold, the momentum is undeniable. And the presale price? Just $0.0551 per token in its 18th stage. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end—a potential gain of 353.39%. The standout feature of Qubetics is its QubeQode IDE , an integrated development environment that’s changing the game for developers and businesses. Imagine a tech startup in New York using QubeQode IDE to build dApps that run flawlessly across Ethereum, NEAR Protocol, and Litecoin. No more endless compatibility issues or costly delays. Or consider a freelance developer building a custom NFT marketplace—QubeQode’s streamlined tools make it faster and easier than ever. For anyone serious about finding the top cryptos to buy and hold for short term, Qubetics is an absolute no-brainer. The presale is already making waves, and the price predictions? Let’s just say this rocket ship has plenty of fuel left. Litecoin: The Digital Silver Litecoin has been a mainstay in the crypto world for over a decade, often referred to as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” And while some might see it as old news, Litecoin has proven time and again that it’s here to stay. Recently, it’s been making headlines for its 18% price surge, reaching $120.56—all thanks to speculation about a potential Litecoin-based ETF. Litecoin’s inclusion in the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF is a game-changer. Not only does it bring Litecoin closer to mainstream financial markets, but it also solidifies its reputation as a reliable investment. Picture this: a retiree in Florida who’s wary of volatile stocks decides to diversify their portfolio with Litecoin through an ETF. It’s safe, steady, and still offers solid growth potential. Beyond the ETF buzz, Litecoin continues to attract users with its fast transaction speeds and low fees. Whether you’re buying coffee or transferring funds internationally, Litecoin gets the job done quickly and affordably. That’s why it’s earned a loyal following over the years, particularly among those looking for a no-frills digital currency. If you’re searching for the top cryptos to buy and hold for short term , Litecoin offers a unique blend of stability and growth potential. While it might not deliver the eye-popping returns of a presale like Qubetics, it’s a solid bet for anyone looking to dip their toes into crypto without diving into the deep end. NEAR Protocol: The Developer’s Dream NEAR Protocol is often touted as the blockchain for developers, and it’s easy to see why. With its focus on scalability and user-friendly design, NEAR has carved out a niche as a go-to platform for building decentralized apps. The recent launch of Nightshade 2.0 on its mainnet has only solidified its reputation. Nightshade 2.0 is a big deal. By enhancing scalability and performance, it’s made NEAR more attractive to developers and investors alike. Imagine a gaming company in Seattle that’s building the next big blockchain-based MMORPG. With NEAR, they can create a seamless gaming experience without worrying about lag or high transaction costs. That’s the kind of innovation that keeps NEAR at the forefront of the crypto world. The price action has been equally exciting. After the Nightshade 2.0 launch, NEAR’s token hit $5.22 before settling at $4.83. While some might see this as volatility, savvy investors know it’s an opportunity. With its long-term vision and strong developer community, NEAR remains one of the top cryptos to buy and hold for short term gains. NEAR’s commitment to user experience and scalability isn’t just talk—it’s action. For those who believe in the power of innovation, NEAR Protocol is a project worth watching closely. Conclusion Whether you’re hunting for the top cryptos to buy and hold for short term or looking to make a splash in the long run, these three projects offer something for everyone. Qubetics is setting the crypto world on fire with its record-breaking presale and revolutionary QubeQode IDE. Litecoin continues to shine as a stable and reliable digital currency, while NEAR Protocol pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in blockchain technology. But here’s the kicker: the potential returns on Qubetics are in a league of their own. Join the Qubetics presale today and be part of what could be the most exciting crypto story of 2025. Don’t let this chance pass you by.

39313167,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/what-can-crypto-traders-learn-from-traditional-forex-platforms,1737587859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/39313167.jpeg,What Can Crypto Traders Learn from Traditional Forex Platforms?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/what-can-crypto-traders-learn-from-traditional-forex-platforms,"When the concept of cryptocurrency was introduced back in 2009 – when the first Bitcoin whitepaper was released by the anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto – its unique selling point was that it was different. By that we mean, the idea of a decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency that could operate independently was revolutionary for the financial market. Trading crypto, too, was a different experience compared to trading on traditional Forex platforms. Unlike Forex markets, which are heavily regulated and rely on central authorities like banks or brokers, cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on blockchain, a distributed ledger that is transparent and independent of any governing body, introducing a whole new dynamic for traders. While this is still true today, however, as the cryptocurrency market has evolved, significant similarities between both markets have come to light. In 2025, crypto traders can learn a lot from traditional Forex platforms, with both markets having merged in terms of accessibility, tools, and strategies. Whether it’s through Forex trading apps or crypto trading platforms, traders now have access to similar features that enable them to execute trades efficiently and strategically, and if you look closely, the way in which they do so is not so different. Learning to Manage Risk Everyone knows that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. One day, the price of Bitcoin could be reaching a high of $106,000, the next it could have dropped down to $95,000. As a result, entering the crypto market is a risk in itself, but there are ways to mitigate that risk and ensure it never becomes too damaging. Forex traders have long used risk management strategies to protect their capital, with stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, and position sizing being common risk management tools that can be found on Forex platforms. By setting a stop-loss at a predetermined price, traders can limit potential losses if the market moves against them. Similarly, setting take-profit orders allows traders to lock in profits when the market reaches a specific level. These are standard practices in the traditional Forex market, and they can be beneficial practices in the crypto market too. For investors buying BTC , ETH, or any other altcoin, adopting risk management strategies can work to mitigate the high volatility and unpredictable nature of what is a very unpredictable market. Learning to Trade Responsibly Another thing that crypto traders can learn from traditional Forex platforms is the ability to trade responsibly. In Forex trading, emotional control and maintaining discipline are critical factors for long-term success. Provided an investor utilises a trusted, regulated platform, they should not only be receiving access to the financial market, but information and guidance on how to safely navigate that access. To give an example, on the Exness app – one of the up-and-coming platforms for both Forex and crypto traders alike – investors can access a wide range of educational resources, including guidelines on trading psychology, discipline, and emotional control. For those asking: “ is Exness legit ?”, this is one of the key signifiers that a platform is committed to helping traders succeed, and it’s also must-have information in both a Forex and crypto context. As an investor, it can be very easy to let emotions get the better of you. The fast-paced nature of both Forex and crypto markets often triggers impulsive decisions based on a range of factors, and this emotional response can easily lead to overtrading, chasing losses, or taking unnecessary risks that ultimately erode profits. Through digesting the tips and guidelines of platforms like Exness, however, it’s possible to learn how to mitigate these symptoms and make informed, strategic decisions based on fact rather than emotion. Learning to Manage Whether you’re a new investor in crypto or Forex – or both – you’ll learn very quickly that you are your own manager. You can follow all the necessary guidelines and steps, but ultimately, you are in charge of your portfolio, and it’s up to you to manage it effectively. One of the reasons Forex trading has become more accessible in recent years, however, is because the platforms are specifically designed to support this level of personal responsibility, offering tools and features that enable traders to take full control of their investments. As mentioned before, this includes risk management tools, but also real time access to market data. On a Forex platform, you can track live price movements, monitor currency pair fluctuations, and follow global economic events that are bound to affect market behaviour. You can also utilise automated trading options, such as bots or algorithms that program the platform to execute trades for you based on specific criteria – helping you stick to your plan without getting swayed by emotional impulses. In terms of the crypto market, it is these kinds of tools that you can learn from and utilise when managing your crypto portfolio. In both markets, of course, diversification is crucial in mitigating risk, but especially in the crypto-verse, this makes it harder to keep control in a volatile space and remain aware of everything going on. To succeed, it is crucial to take advantage of platforms offering this level of help, working to keep you on top of your game and flourishing, no matter where the market swings.

What Is The Latest Remittix News,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/ripple-xrp-price-will-hit-5-in-q1-of-2025-if-this-one-thing-happens-what-is-the-latest-remittix-news,"Ripple’s most recent surge saw its price surge past $3.38, causing speculation as to whether Ripple could surpass the critical $5 mark in Q1 of 2025. Meanwhile, a new contender, Remittix (RTX) , has been gaining traction for its advanced PayFi solution. It promises to address the longstanding frustrations of individuals and businesses who need to make global payments on a regular basis, often facing high costs, hidden charges, and lengthy delays. Currently powering through its presale, Remittix is seeing major investment, having raised over $3.85 million in just a few weeks. So what could Remittix achieve in 2025, and will Ripple (XRP) be able to reach $5? Ripple’s Momentum Stalls At $3.15 Ripple (XRP) has been on a real journey this last week. Between 14th and 16th January it shot up from $2.54 to $3.38 in a short window before plummeting to $3.04. It is now back to $3.15 where it seems to be settling. This price point seems to have stagnated for the short term, but where it might head next is unclear. The market cap for Ripple is now sitting at around $180 billion and its 24 hour trading volume dropped by 8% in the last day. Optimistic holders think the new administration will boost Ripple's price if Trump’s team shows signs of loosening crypto regulations. Remittix Ushers in a New Era for Global Payments Focusing on resolving inefficiencies in the cross-border payments market, Remittix (RTX) taps into the $190 trillion industry with precision. Facilitating the conversion of over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat, the platform allows users to send funds directly to bank accounts worldwide. For businesses, the Remittix Pay API is a standout feature, simplifying the integration of crypto payments into existing systems while offering easy and accessible fiat settlement options. Additionally, merchant accounts are tailored for companies managing multiple currencies, supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30 fiat currencies. This flexibility makes Remittix (RTX) an adaptable solution for diverse financial needs. Helping bridge the gap in regions with limited access to traditional financial services, Remittix supports individuals and businesses by providing 24/7 access to global payment systems. With low fees and efficient processing times, it is particularly attractive to users in underserved areas, breaking down barriers to participating in the international economy. Remittix Soars In Presale, Surpassing $4 Million Central to the Remittix (RTX) ecosystem is the RTX token, intelligently designed for growth with applications in staking, governance, and platform rewards. With a capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens, RTX is rapidly gaining traction among forward-thinking investors. Currently, priced at $0.0239 in its presale phase, the RTX token has already exceeded $4.6 million raised! Thanks to its compelling value proposition in the lucrative cross-border payments market, analysts project an 800% gain during the presale, with further growth expected as adoption grows.

Maeil Ilbo reported that the platforms have agreed to settle with customers in a total of 720 cases. Upbit and Bithumb: Customers Compensated According to data released on January 22 by Kim Hyun-jung, a Democratic Party lawmaker and a member of the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee, Upbit agreed to pay out 3,144,598,156 won ($2,192,550) in compensation for 596 cases. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) The cases all related to “computer system failures” on what has become known in South Korea as “Martial Law Day.” Bithumb, meanwhile, agreed to pay out 377,533,687 won ($263,273) in compensation for 124 cases. The media outlet wrote that this amounts to the “largest amount of compensation ever paid out” by domestic exchanges. However, critics claimed that it was still “difficult to determine whether” exchanges were providing a “proper level of investor protection.” They said that each exchange was determining the size of its own compensation packages, rather than cooperating to provide a unified response. Kim’s offices confirmed that the total amount of compensation “may increase slightly” once remaining “negotiations” are completed. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) Marital Law Sparked Crypto Crisis on December 3 The lawmaker’s data showed that Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax – the remaining three KRW-trading exchanges reported “no such cases.” South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol sparked a crisis in the nation’s crypto and financial markets on December 3 last year when he declared martial law. This saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) plummet from around 130 million won (around $90,610) to 88 million won ($61,352) on domestic platforms. This sparked panicked sell-offs, while other investors rushed to “buy the Bitcoin dip.” This saw “the number of users accessing” Upbit and Bithumb “skyrocket,” the outlet wrote. And this sudden surge in traffic essentially crashed both platforms. Some users were unable to log into their accounts. Others complained that they could access the websites but were unable to execute transactions. Upbit reportedly “experienced problems” including the “cancellation of some crypto withdrawals and KRW deposits.” Parliamentary committee holds 1st hearing on martial law, but without key witnesses https://t.co/pfDsiZIOWH — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) January 22, 2025 Regulators Respond The outages have sparked controversy, with financial regulators stepping in with “on-site inspections” at exchanges beginning on January 20. The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) has asked exchanges to submit reports on “future responses.” The regulator thinks the exchanges should look into expanding their server capacities, improving their cloud services, and adjusting their emergency response plans. South Korea's Yoon defends his martial law decree in his first public appearance since his arrest https://t.co/FZYX9dIIXP — Yahoo News (@YahooNews) January 21, 2025 The FSS will also follow up by “looking into whether these measures are being properly implemented,” the outlet added. “The number of virtual asset investors is rapidly increasing in South Korea. But we still lack an institutional foundation for investor protection. The financial authorities and [crypto] exchanges should establish practical and specific measures. They need to take steps such as increasing the number of servers they use and improving their emergency response plans. This will help prevent computer accidents. And it will create a safe and trustworthy ecosystem for trading virtual assets.” Kim Hyun-jung, Democratic Party lawmaker and member of the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee The post Upbit and Bithumb to Pay Customers $2.4M Compensation for ‘Martial Law Blackout’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Crypto Exchange|South Korea,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-22 23:30:00
39313538,https://coingape.com/?p=234913,1737588791,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Breaking: Bitwise Files for Dogecoin ETF, DOGE Price To $15?",https://coingape.com/bitwise-files-for-dogecoin-etf-doge-price-to-15/,"Bitwise has reportedly registered a legal entity for a Dogecoin ETF, creating speculation of an imminent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development briefly boosted the price of Dogecoin, which touched $0.373 before settling near $0.36 at the time of reporting. Bitwise Moves Toward a Dogecoin ET Filing According to information accessed on the Delaware corporate registration website , Bitwise has created a legal entity named “BITWISE DOGECOIN ETF.” This is not an official ETF filing with the SEC, but it is seen as a stepping stone to such a submission. In most cases, ETF registrations are made after setting up the legal structure that follows the filing of Form S-1 with the SEC. Market participants are likely to see Bitwise submit the necessary documentation in the near future, with Dogecoin joining other digital assets that have been proposed for ETFs by issuers. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also confirmed this stating that; “This is real and not a market manipulation scheme.” Balchunas had estimated that a DOGE ETF could launch in as soon as April 2025 if it gets the green light. DOGE Price Reaction and Whale Activity News of the registration led to a slight increase in Dogecoins value, which spiked to 4% and trading at $0.373 before dropping back to $0.36. This announcement has garnered interest from institutional and retail investors, with more action expected from the price if an official ETF filing is made. At the same time, whale activity has risen due to improving sentiment. According to data provided by Santiment, the majority holders have accumulated 590 million DOGE tokens in the last one day. To the excitement, the icon of Dogecoin has been displayed on the website of the newly formed U.S. Department of Government Efficiency or D.O.G.E. It was created by an executive order shortly after the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. Other technical analysts have also come up with possible price predictions for Dogecoin. Trader Mikybull posted a chart indicating a bullish flag pattern which could propel DOGE to $2 if the pattern is confirmed. Nonetheless, crypto analyst Ali Martinez anticipates that the price may rise to $15 if a Dogecoin ETF is granted approval. Growing Momentum for Crypto ETFs The potential filing of a Dogecoin ETF comes as the SEC has shown greater willingness to approve cryptocurrency-related funds. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were recently greenlit, signaling a shift in regulatory attitudes. The resignation of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler has further fueled speculation around the approval of spot cryptocurrency ETFs. Rex Osprey, an asset manager overseeing $8 billion, has also filed for a Dogecoin fund , adding to the momentum. Observers believe a Dogecoin ETF would increase institutional adoption and provide retail investors with easier access to the cryptocurrency.

Will the Meme Coin Frenzy Collapse Next Month?",https://bitzo.com/2025/01/price-forecast-shiba-inu-pepe-and-remittix-will-the-meme-coin-frenzy-collapse-next-month,"The meme coin market is witnessing notable shifts, with Shiba Inu and Pepe capturing attention. Yet, as growth is driven by speculation and the actions of large investors, concerns emerge about the future stability of these meme coins. Amidst this speculation, investors are turning to a promising altcoin with tangible utility: Remittix (RTX) . Remittix is quickly becoming a top investment pick this year, achieving $4 million in ICO funding. Learn why experts prefer Remittix over Shiba Inu and Pepe. Remittix Ushers In a New Era for International Transfers Traditional methods for cross-border payments are often slow and obscure. Transactions can take days or even weeks, coupled with hefty conversion rates and concealed fees. These inefficiencies frustrate both individuals and businesses alike. Remittix (RTX) addresses these issues through its PayFi platform, which enables users to change over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send funds globally within just 24 hours. This innovation cuts out middlemen, greatly minimizing transaction times and costs. Featuring a flat-fee system, Remittix guarantees full transparency so users are always aware of the fees they incur. No more unexpected deductions—whether sending money to family or managing overseas business transactions, users can rest easy. Loyal users of Remittix are rewarded through its VIP program, which provides staking benefits across multiple levels, offering up to 18% APY at the highest level. This additional value makes the RTX token a standout in the market. Currently trading at $0.0221, RTX is projected to climb to $0.0228 soon. Early backers have seen gains of over 50%, with over $4 million raised and more than 6,000 holders. Trump’s Impact May Propel Shiba Inu to New Heights The buzz around meme coins, especially Shiba Inu, is once again building. This is partly attributed to Trump's growing influence within the crypto space. The 47th President of the U.S. holds a favorable view on cryptocurrencies, which could boost the market, potentially leading to significant gains for Shiba Inu. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is also progressing, highlighted by the launch of the WHY combinator. This new tool is designed to support blockchain projects, fostering growth and making the ecosystem more appealing to developers. Currently, Shiba Inu is valued at $0.00002075, marking a 1.81% increase in the last week. The meme coin seems poised for a substantial rise and may break its yearly high of $0.000045 by Q2 2025. Shiba Inu investors are watching closely, hoping for a significant price increase. Analysts suggest that Trump's influence could reshape the market landscape and reignite interest in meme coins like Shiba Inu, potentially leading to even better price movements as the year unfolds. Pepe May Experience a 10x Price Surge Pepe has recently stirred the crypto market, particularly on January 13th, due to major whale activity. One whale withdrew 280 billion PEPE tokens, valued at about $5 million, from Binance, while another invested $3.72 million to purchase an additional 200.4 billion. Despite market challenges, the frog-themed token has demonstrated resilience, increasing from $0.00001600 on January 14th to around $0.00001844. Some experts predict that Pepe could achieve a 10x increase during a 2025 crypto bull run, as whale activity often signifies strong market confidence. With an impressive 1,400% surge year-to-date, Pepe has become one of the leading meme coins, and its listing on Binance Japan enhances its visibility and potential growth. Remittix Poised for an 800% Rally At the core of the Remittix ecosystem is the $RTX token, designed to withstand volatile market conditions. With a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens and a current presale price of $0.0221, Remittix has already amassed over $4 million in funding and continues to gain momentum. Experts foresee an 800% increase during the presale phase, with further growth anticipated post-launch as adoption rises.

Between January 15 and 16, the total Shiba Inu outflows grew from 647 billion to 1.11 trillion SHIB. This large-scale movement has left investors worried about its future price movement. The significant outflows were driven by big investors cashing out and adjusting their positions. Some investors sold out their Shiba Inu holdings to protect their gains.

This is largely due to the success of both tokens over the past years. Ethereum's updates make it a good option while Solana offers high speed of transactions as well as low costs. However, of late, a new presale token, Remittix (RTX) is creating a buzz. This could be attributed to the success of its ongoing presale as well as its innovative way of handling cross-border payments. The ultimate question remains: Can Remittix rival Solana and Ethereum in 2025? Ethereum Rises 7% In 24 hours ETH has begun 2025 with strong momentum. Currently trading at $3,442.66, it is up 7% over the last 24 hours. This keeps Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency. With improvements such as ""The Surge"" upgrade and spot ETF approvals, Ethereum is poised to rise with some analysts anticipating a top of $12,000. In recent years, Ethereum made big changes to how it works. It switched to a proof-of-stake system, which uses less energy than before. This change has made it more environmentally friendly and prepared it for future growth. Ethereum might be a great investment in 2025. Solana: The Fast and Affordable Challenger Solana has gained a lot of attention because of its speed. The network can handle thousands of transactions every second. It is also cheaper to use, making it a good choice for developers building applications in areas like gaming or NFTs. Analysts think that SOL might reach $500 by 2025, thanks to the excitement surrounding its prospective ETF launch. This expands its DeFi adoption, and increases institutional interest. Solana's focus on affordability has strongly impacted its adoption. It has helped it attract a strong community of developers and users. This further advances Solana's place in crypto. What Makes Remittix Different? While Ethereum and Solana are strong players, Remittix is quickly becoming an interesting option for investors. It aims mainly to solve problems in the world of financial transactions. Many traditional systems for sending money across borders are slow and expensive. Remittixoffers a faster and cheaper way to handle these transfers. This focus on real-world financial solutions makes it stand out from other projects.

New projects like Remittix show that there is room for innovation. By focusing on solving real problems, Remittix is setting itself apart as a potential leader in its space. For investors, this means there are more choices than ever. Whether you stick with well-known names like Ethereum and Solana or take a chance on something new like Remittix, the key is to stay informed and consider what fits your goals. Ethereum and Solana have proven themselves as strong options for crypto traders. Both offer unique advantages that make them worth considering in 2025. But for those who want to look beyond the usual names, Remittix could be a game-changer. Its focus on fixing issues with cross-border payments gives it a practical edge in the market.

However, recently, a new presale token called Remittix (RTX) is generating a lot of interest. Its buzz can be attributed to the success of its ongoing presale and its innovative approach to handling international payments.

It is currently valued at $3,442.66, marking a 7% rise in the past 24 hours, maintaining its status as the second-largest cryptocurrency.

This shift has made it more eco-friendly and set the stage for future expansion. Ethereum could be a promising investment by 2025. Solana: The Swift and Cost-Effective Contender Solana has attracted significant attention due to its impressive speed. The network processes thousands of transactions every second. It's also cost-effective, making it appealing for developers creating applications in sectors like gaming or NFTs. Experts predict that SOL might hit $500 by 2025, driven by the excitement over its potential ETF launch. This enhances its DeFi adoption and boosts institutional interest. Solana's emphasis on cost-effectiveness has significantly influenced its adoption. It has helped build a strong community of developers and users, further solidifying Solana's place in the cryptocurrency world. What Sets Remittix Apart? While Ethereum and Solana are established contenders, Remittix is quickly emerging as an intriguing option for investors. It primarily aims to address issues in the realm of financial transactions. Many traditional methods for sending money across borders are sluggish and costly. Remittix offers a quicker and more affordable solution for these transfers. This emphasis on practical financial solutions differentiates it from other projects. Remittix is set to enhance cross-border payments. It is crafted to be practical and beneficial, giving it a distinct standing in the crypto market. Currently, the DeFi coin price for Remittix is low, making it accessible to early investors.

For investors, this means there are more options than ever. Whether you stick with renowned names like Ethereum and Solana or explore new possibilities like Remittix, the key is to remain informed and consider what aligns with your objectives. Ethereum and Solana have established themselves as solid choices for crypto traders. Both offer distinct benefits that make them worthy of consideration in 2025.

Although the coin is meant to be used for charity purposes, crypto X reacted sceptically, to say the least. Predictably, the Trump inauguration delivered some spectacular moments — from Melania’s hat preventing the President’s kiss to Elon Musk’s alleged Nazi salute at the end of his speech. The crypto community was caught off guard by the total absence of cryptocurrency mentioned in Donald Trump’s speech. However, the photos of Trump with Sen. Lummis, who waged war on Operation Choke Point 2.0 and proposed the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin reserve, were met with enthusiasm. Read more: Sen. Lummis warns FDIC staff against destroying OCP 2.0 docs One of the stunning moments of the inauguration was the three-minute-long MLK-heavy prayer delivered by a Michigan pastor, Rev. Lorenzo Sewell. He chanted his words referencing the famous “I Have a Dream” speech and Declaration of Independence, starting his prayer by grating the Lord for the “millimetre miracle” that saved the future president from the bullet during the July murder attempt. Sewell stated that America will begin to dream again. President Trump invited Pastor Lorenzo Sewell from Detroit to pray at the Inauguration, and he did NOT disappoint. God is back in America. pic.twitter.com/3dT7Jn46Wf — George (@BehizyTweets) January 20, 2025 One of the reasons for multiple references to Martin Luther King’s speech may be the fact that Trump’s inauguration coincided with MLK Day. And Sewell mentioned Dr. King that night once again–in a short video on X where Sewell announced the launch of his official crypto token. The pastor urged everyone to buy it in order to help the ministry and concluded that “we know that King’s dream can only be fulfilled if we acknowledge that people are living in a nightmare”. The crypto community was kind enough to send me $Lorenzo, so I have permanently locked my tokens into a Liquidity Pool, so that I will never sell on the community but rather just earn fees as our token continues to flourish! Amazing day, all the Glory to God! CA:… pic.twitter.com/kAZFL3mMmb — Pastor Zo (@pastorzosewell) January 20, 2025 The comment section went poisonous on the announcement. But let’s first talk about Sewell’s personality before diving into his meme coin and the community’s reaction. Rev. Sewell’s complicated past People who followed Trump’s campaign weren’t probably surprised to see Sewell delivering a prayer during the President’s inauguration as the pastor has been actively involved in the 2024 campaign, presenting the pro-Trump Christian events, giving speeches alongside the future president in churches and addressing the public at a Republican National Convention. Before joining the Trump bandwagon, Sewell has been a pastor at the non-denominational 180 Church. Rev. Sewell doesn’t divide religion from politics, saying that the gospel message is the political message and the Bible is a political book. “You cannot be a spiritual person and not be political,” said Sewell . Fox News cites him saying that he doesn’t believe all Democrats are demons, but their platform is demonic. Sewell is passionate and energetic, not only in his prayers. Not everyone in the 180 Church was happy to have a pro-Trump pastor, and on one occasion, the political clash resulted in Sewell getting handcuffed. His enemies drilled new locks to the church door, and the pastor was approached by the police while trying to get into the church. Thankfully, after weeks of holding services elsewhere, including a methadone clinic, Sewell managed to get his church back . It was only a year before Sewell met Trump for the first time and joined his 2024 campaign. During that meeting at the roundtable, Sewell expressed his admiration of Trump, saying the 45th President was charged with 34 felonies, and then he raised $52.8 million in 24 hours. Felonies that don’t stop the one on the way to glory is something that Sewell understands very well as it reflects his own life experiences as reportedly Sewell was a gang leader in the 90s before the 1999 spiritual revelation brought him to a religious path. Pastor’s meme coin roast The pastor’s $Lorenzo meme coin doesn’t seem that different from the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens that garnered substantial amounts of criticism following the launch. However, it seems that it was the pastor’s coin that gravitated the most hate. In the X post, Sewell claims he decided not to sell Lorenzo tokens and instead locked them permanently in the Liquidity Pool to earn fees and let the token flourish. In the video, Sewell asked people to “do him a favor” and “buy the official Lorenzo Sewell coin.” However, the public was harsh on the move. Below, you can see only a few of the many angered voices: Will pastor man rug? Only God knows. What’s clear enough for many in the crypto community is that meme coins began to gain notoriety similar to one that NFTs got at some point, where the element of gambling and scammers started to outshine the revolutionary technology. In his criticism towards the TRUMP token, journalist Nic Carter suggested that tokens issued by political figures in power may be used by external agents to manipulate and bribe national affairs. Can someone influence Sewell via a generous $Lorezno investment? Will see.

Chainlink & TON Enhance Crypto Utilities,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-vs-traditional-retail-how-blockchain-is-winning-the-e-commerce-battle-chainlink-ton-enhance-crypto-utilities/,"As we continue through 2025, we observe how the cryptocurrency environment is being transformed by major advancements in significant digital assets and blockchain-driven e-commerce enhancements. Leading these changes are the noticeable movements in Chainlink’s market and the strategic upgrades to the TON blockchain, both of which are enhancing their utility and scalability. Simultaneously, Web3Bay (3BAY) is making impressive progress by incorporating Web3 technology into the retail world, thereby establishing new benchmarks for how blockchain can improve the online shopping experience. This set of innovations is not only altering their specific sectors but also jointly pushing the limits of blockchain technology in contemporary commerce and finance. Chainlink’s Influence on Decentralized Applications Recent developments in the Chainlink ecosystem are grabbing headlines, highlighted by a surge in acquisitions by major investors, known as “whales.” These influential market players are significantly expanding their LINK holdings, demonstrating their strong belief in the asset’s potential. This increased activity from whales has led to a substantial rise in Chainlink’s market value, fostering optimistic views on its future. In just the last week, LINK has witnessed an 18% increase in value, fueled by broad confidence in its long-term relevance and critical role in providing dependable data feeds for blockchain contracts. This uptrend signifies growing acknowledgment of Chainlink’s ability to support various decentralized platforms, indicating a bright future for its widespread application. TON Partners with Nansen to Enhance Analytics At the same time, the TON blockchain, originally created by Telegram’s developers, has boosted its functionality through a partnership with Nansen, a top blockchain analytics firm. This alliance has provided TON with enhanced tools for analyzing user behavior and transaction patterns, strengthening its framework as a scalable and secure platform for diverse decentralized applications. These advanced analytical tools are anticipated to spur further creativity and uptake within the TON network, equipping developers and investors with crucial data to make well-informed choices. Web3Bay’s Hybrid Platform: Bridging Fiat & Crypto for Flexibility! Despite recent fluctuations in the market, Web3Bay is carving a niche in transforming the e-commerce industry. Leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay has created a decentralized marketplace that accommodates both conventional payment methods, such as PayPal, and innovative cryptocurrency transactions. This hybrid approach attracts a broad spectrum of consumers, making it a flexible platform for various shopping preferences. Additionally, the platform enhances user experience by offering a 5% discount on all purchases made using its native token, 3BAY. The inclusion of blockchain not only secures transactions but also introduces transparency in every transaction, building trust among users. Since beginning, Web3Bay has impressively raised $840,000 from its presale, showcasing strong market trust and resulting in the sale of 222 million coins at an initial price of $0.1959 each. Although market conditions remain volatile, the current price of the coin is $0.004562625, which reflects sustained interest from investors. Token holders contribute actively to governance, having a direct impact on the platform’s policy and future direction. This participatory governance model is setting new standards for how e-commerce platforms are run, positioning Web3Bay as an innovator in the industry. The success of Web3Bay’s model demonstrates the potential for blockchain to disrupt traditional retail models, offering a glimpse into the future of decentralized commerce. Concluding Insights The year 2025 is turning out to be a defining year for the cryptocurrency industry, with Chainlink and TON undergoing crucial developments that could shape their paths forward. Yet, Web3Bay is also in the limelight, with its novel approach to e-commerce potentially transforming how online transactions are managed in a blockchain-centric environment. As Web3Bay continues to expand and its token presale accelerates, early adopters stand to gain substantial returns, with potential ROIs reaching up to 6,430% at launch. This period is thus an optimal time to get involved with a trailblazing platform in the realm of e-commerce innovation.

Research Predicts Big Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-to-122k-next-month-research-predicts-big-move/,"Many analysts are ruminating on the next significant milestone, as the remarkable price increase of Bitcoin has captivated the market’s attention. A research company, 10x Research, predicts thatthe alpha coin could reach $122,000 by February. Although this may appear to be an ambitious goal, it is consistent with the optimistic perspective of numerous experts who have observed Bitcoin’s capacity to surpass critical price thresholds since the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Trump Son Drops Hints About Major World Liberty Plans After Massive Ether Buy Bitcoin: Robust Momentum The momentum of Bitcoin is undeniable. In recent months, its price has fluctuated in a consistent manner, with periodic increases that have typically occurred within the $16,000–$18,000 range. Markus Thielen of 10x Research believes that these consistent increases indicate a continuation of upward movement, which implies that $122,000 is feasible in the near future. Thielen underscores that the crypto asset’s market conduct may experience a pause upon attaining this objective, despite the optimistic outlook. Thielen believes Bitcoin’s breakout presents a “low-risk, high-reward entry opportunity,” with Bitcoin trading at $105,727. He noted that after Donald Trump’s inauguration, BTC tested the $101,000 resistance, making it a favorable time to buy with stop-losses around $98,000. Thielen also pointed out that Bitcoin has risen in $16,000–$18,000 increments since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, suggesting it could reach $122,000 by February before entering another consolidation phase. Expectation Of Consolidation Following The Surge A period of consolidation may ensue following Bitcoin’s prospective ascent to $122,000. This phase, during which its price stabilizes prior to another outburst, has been a recurring trend throughout its history. Investors should anticipate this period of sideways price action, which may present new opportunities for those who are anticipating a more favorable entry point. Strength In Relation To The Stock Market The optimistic forecast is also in line with the relative strength of Bitcoin in comparison to traditional markets. Despite the challenges that equities have encountered, it has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Due to the increasing number of institutional investors who are investing in Bitcoin, the price of this digital asset is becoming less correlated with the broader financial market. This pattern has the potential to intensify the upward trajectory toward $12,000. Meanwhile, according to current price predictions, the price of Bitcoin is predicted to rise by 24% and reach $ 130k by February 21, 2025. Technical indicators, according to CoinCodex, show the current sentiment is Bullish while the Fear & Greed Index is showing 84 (Extreme Greed).

Though historical success of Bitcoin does not ensure future outcomes, the present conditions are favorable for more growth.

The question is not whether Bitcoin will hit $122,000; rather, when.

Insights on PEPE Coin Price Growth & Hyperliquid Token,https://thecoinrise.com/is-marius-bock-the-catalyst-blockdag-needs-to-reach-600m-insights-on-pepe-coin-price-growth-hyperliquid-token/,"As traders search for the best crypto for the future, several tokens are catching the eye for their potential to dominate the scene. The Hyperliquid (HYPE) token has boldly initiated trading rights on its own platform, skipping traditional exchanges to prioritize a community-focused rollout. Meanwhile, the price of PEPE coin has climbed by 6.67%, with market watchers expecting further increases if it surpasses crucial resistance levels. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) appears to have secured a game-changing asset with Marius Bock, previously with Cardano, stepping in as the new Lead Project Manager. Bock’s arrival has propelled BlockDAG’s presale past $183 million, setting a rapid pace toward the $600 million target, with the project poised to solidify its status as a frontrunner in decentralized technology. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Token Reshapes the Crypto Launch Process The launch of the Hyperliquid (HYPE) token may redefine the standard for how cryptocurrencies debut. Eschewing the usual path of premiering on centralized exchanges with allocations earmarked for venture capital and early backers, HYPE was released directly through its own system. This strategy excluded venture capitalists and early investors, promoting a shift towards a more community-centric launch. Vitali Dervoed, CEO of Composability Labs, believes this approach signals a transformative era for cryptocurrency introductions, emphasizing on-chain, equitable distribution. PEPE Coin Price Gains Momentum PEPE coin price recent 6.67% uptick is bolstering its profile in the buoyant meme coin sector, now valued at $107 billion. The four-hour chart suggests bullish trends, with the price rallying from support and surpassing important Fibonacci thresholds. Crypto Analyst Ali Martinez points to a possible ascent to $0.000021, backed by a strong buy signal. A breakout from the symmetrical triangle could push PEPE coin prices even higher, targeting the next resistance at $0.0000225. Conversely, failing to maintain support at $0.00001739 could pressure the price downward. BlockDAG Welcomes Marius Bock as Presale Surges to $183 Million! BlockDAG just hit a major milestone with an incredible $183 million raised in its presale, and now there’s even more thrilling news for everyone involved! Marius Bock, a legendary figure from Cardano, has joined BlockDAG as the new Lead Project Manager. With a whopping 25 years of expertise in blockchain and fintech, Bock is all set to take things to the next level. During his time at Cardano, he was the brain behind their cryptocurrency wallet and made it work seamlessly with popular hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. Bock has also held significant positions at Fundamo (a Visa company) and worked on major projects with giants like IBM and ACI Worldwide. With Bock now part of the team, BlockDAG is turbocharging its mission to develop scalable and efficient blockchain solutions. The team’s innovative approach has already fueled the presale success, amassing $183 million and setting a strong base for more growth. Bock’s arrival could mean hitting their bold $600 million target way ahead of schedule! Analysts are buzzing with predictions that BDAG, currently at just $0.0248 per coin, could soar to $1 by the year’s end. That’s a potential 3932% ROI for those who get in now, especially with the mainnet launch on the horizon. Those who got in early are already seeing huge returns, with a 2380% ROI so far. With a solid base, visionary leadership, and a clear strategy, BlockDAG is perfectly positioned to keep winning. Its commitment to cutting-edge blockchain solutions and strong potential for growth make BDAG the best crypto for the future . Which Cryptocurrency Will Define the Future? The decentralized rollout of the Hyperliquid (HYPE) token introduces a new paradigm in community-led, on-chain cryptocurrency distributions, setting a fresh market benchmark. Meanwhile, PEPE coin’s price continues to show strong upward trends, suggesting more potential gains if current supports hold and key resistance levels are breached. However, BlockDAG remains a standout contender for the best crypto for the future. With a robust $183 million from its presale, the imminent mainnet launch, and the strategic addition of Marius Bock to its leadership team, BlockDAG is well-positioned for substantial growth. Market analysts are optimistic about BDAG’s prospects, forecasting a potential price of $1 by year’s end, which could translate to a 3932% ROI for early adopters. With traders rapidly gathering to the presale, excitement is mounting as BDAG’s price of $0.0248 is expected to surge.

Earlier in the week, bitcoin touched $109,000 during the day before retreating again. Ether's closing price had some movement this week but ended up finishing mostly flat. ETH is currently down ~1% year to date. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and has continued that momentum into 2025. XRP is currently up ~36% year to date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. It is often considered a volatile asset, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price hit a new all-time high on January 21, 2025, finishing just above $106,000. Earlier in the week, bitcoin touched $109,000 during the day before retreating again. BTC is up ~12% year to date. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price had some movement this week but ended up finishing mostly flat. ETH is currently down ~1% year to date. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and has continued that momentum into 2025. XRP is currently up ~36% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead, just edging out XRP. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

And let’s be honest—if you’ve seen what happened to the price of those coins after their Binance debuts, you’ll know that this is a big deal. We’re talking millions made by early investors who hopped on the train before the listing. If you missed out on those gains, don’t worry— BTFD Coin’s presale performance is looking like the perfect chance to ride the next big wave. With over $5.5 million already raised and more than 9,100 bullish holders, BTFD Coin is gearing up to make its splash. BTFD Coin: The Presale Performance That Has Investors Talking BTFD Coin is currently in its 14th presale stage, priced at $0.00016 per coin, but don’t let the low price fool you. The momentum is real. In just a short period, BTFD Coin has raised more than $5.5 million, with over 66 billion coins sold. And the excitement doesn’t stop there. Analysts are predicting that once BTFD Coin lists on Binance (and let’s be honest, it seems very likely), it could surge to $0.0006 , and potentially even hit a moon price of $0.006. If you’re thinking about investing, consider this: $4,000 at today’s presale price could net you over 25 million BTFD coins. If the coin hits $0.0006 post-listing, your investment will grow to $15,000. And if BTFD Coin skyrockets to $0.006, your $4,000 could turn into a massive $150,000. Now that’s some serious potential. The best part? You can get in early and reap the rewards as this meme coin rides the momentum. Dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins: The Binance Effect When Dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins debuted on Binance, they were the “it” coins of the moment. People who had gotten in early saw their investments explode—literally. Dogwifhat: This meme coin was all over the news when it launched on Binance. After being listed, Dogwifhat saw over a 50% surge in price in under 24 hours. Investors who had bought in during its ICO at a much lower price saw returns in the hundreds of percent, with some early supporters walking away with life-changing profits. Its success is often cited as an example of how meme coins can go from niche to mainstream with the right exchange listing. Pudgy Penguins: Another example of meme coin magic, Pudgy Penguins took the crypto world by storm after it was listed on Binance. What was once a cute, niche token turned into a highly sought-after asset. The momentum that built up around Pudgy Penguins’ listing sent its price rocketing, with some early investors experiencing returns that could only be described as epic. Both of these coins saw massive growth following their Binance listings, and it’s easy to see why BTFD Coin is poised to do the same. With a strong community backing it—over 9,100 holders and counting—and its performance in presale, BTFD Coin is already creating a buzz that feels eerily similar to what we saw with Dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins. BTFD Coin’s Momentum Is Building—Top New Meme Coisn to Invest in Now With its presale success, BTFD Coin is setting itself up for the kind of Binance debut that could make meme coin history. The community is behind it, the presale numbers are strong, and analysts are predicting significant price growth post-listing. If you missed out on Dogwifhat or Pudgy Penguins, BTFD Coin might just be your second chance to cash in on meme coin magic. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big meme coin success story. Invest in BTFD Coin now , and prepare to see your portfolio grow—just like the early investors who cashed in on Dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins.

39315189,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=648805,1737592455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39315189.jpeg,Crypto execs are worried about TRUMP meme coins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-execs-are-worried-about-trump-meme-coins/,"According to a Jan. 22nd report by the Financial Times, crypto industry leaders are raising serious concerns about the chaos caused by TRUMP and MELANIA, the controversial memecoins launched by ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump and his wife the weekend before his Monday inauguration. Nic Carter for instance, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures, reportedly said, “Call me old-fashioned, but I think presidents should focus on running the country.” Nic, who’s actually a vocal Trump supporter, also flagged the conflict of interest, pointing out that the president’s position allows him to influence crypto regulations while directly benefiting from the trading of his tokens. The meme coins were initially worth a combined $17.5 billion, per data from CoinGecko. But by midweek, both had lost more than half their value, leaving thousands of investors reeling and raising questions about ethics, conflicts of interest, and the impact on the industry’s reputation. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that most trading activity for the 200 million available TRUMP tokens happened on lesser-known Asian exchanges like BiKing, Gate.io, and Megabit. “Human nature never changes,” a Silicon Valley investor reportedly told the Financial Times at the World Economic Forum in Davos, likening Trump and Elon Musk to Crassus and Caesar. The investor described the memecoins as a modern example of using political influence for personal gain. “We are seeing real ‘End of Empire’ stuff in the U.S.,” they added, referencing the rapid creation of billions in paper wealth and its equally rapid collapse. About 80% of the TRUMP tokens are held by CIC Digital, a Trump Organization-affiliated company, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, another entity linked to the president. Both companies are set to benefit from trading revenues and token sales, as insiders’ holdings will unlock for sale over the next three to 12 months. Lawmakers and executives call out ethical issues According to the report, Maxine Waters, Democratic congresswoman and member of the House Financial Services Committee, said, “This meme coin represents the worst of crypto.” Waters argued that $TRUMP could enable anonymous financial transactions to Trump’s inner circle, bypassing national security and anti-corruption laws. Oskar Åslund, chief strategy officer at AKJ, a crypto hedge fund brokerage, said, “His economic interest is for sale. There are no checks and balances here.” Åslund also warned about the lack of protections for retail investors, adding that terms on the token’s website prevent users from filing class-action lawsuits. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director, expressed concern that $TRUMP could derail efforts to establish regulatory clarity for crypto. “I believe it hurts the industry,” he said during a Davos panel. Meanwhile, Serge-Raymond Nzabandora of Yield Guild Games described the tokens as a drain on resources and attention. “The immediate effect has been draining liquidity and attention away from legitimate projects working on real use cases that the industry desperately needs to prove to the world in 2025,” he said. Nzabandora also pointed out the irony of Trump’s actions, as they appear to undermine the very regulatory protections former SEC chair Gary Gensler sought to establish. Adding fuel to the fire, REX Financial and Osprey Funds filed paperwork with the SEC for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) centered on the $TRUMP token. The proposed fund would allow investors to trade the memecoin more easily, but it has already faced backlash. “These are the first filings we’ve seen for memecoin ETFs in the U.S.,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. He questioned the wisdom of launching an ETF for a token created just days ago, especially one tied to a sitting president. “I’m not sure even a libertarian-minded and Republican-controlled SEC will want to approve these products,” James added. Meanwhile, more than 30 new crypto ETFs are in the pipeline, including filings for funds focused on Solana and XRP. ProShares and CoinShares are among the firms seeking to capitalize on the change in US SEC leadership. But according to James, “These filings are a gamble.” Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood said that TRUMP is a meme coin. She did not buy it herself because she only holds Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. However, she believes that the token isn’t “completely worthless.” “It may symbolize a new stage of the cryptocurrency revolution and have certain practicality in the future,” she said. Cathie is well beloved in the crypto community as one of Bitcoin’s earliest and strongest believers.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano (ADA) and XRP investors are buzzing about 1Fuel’s wallet technology, looking to get in early. Table of Contents Cardano and Ripple plan collaborative projects New wallet technology piques widespread interest 1Fuel presale sees fast progress 1Fuel’s launch Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) are widely known for their blockchain solutions, and achieved more fame when they announced plans to collaborate. But lately, their investors have been more interested in 1Fuel (OFT), especially since its new wallet technology might transform the DeFi landscape. This DeFi wallet is important to 1Fuel’s ecosystem, offering cross-chain transaction capability and privacy tools. With the 1Fuel presale quickly progressing, there has been a lot of excitement surrounding the public listing. Cardano and Ripple plan collaborative projects Recently, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, and the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, announced that they have been discussing collaborations. Once this news broke out, the value of the two altcoins increased in a week. Cardano‘s price increased by 1.14% while XRP rose by 20.68%, further attracting investor interest. This potential collaboration has caused investors to rank ADA and XRP among the best altcoins. With their rising in value, these tokens can be easily managed on wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. You might also like: 1Fuel new exchange is poised to overtake Shiba Inu in 2025 New wallet technology piques widespread interest 1Fuel has emerged with a new wallet technology which is attracting a lot of attention, especially from ADA and XRP whales. This technology is expected to transform the DeFi space, driving 1Fuel’s value as one of the best altcoins. One of the best parts of this wallet is cross-chain transactions and one-click technology. This is a major advantage over platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, which require multiple wallets and tokens for cross-chain swaps. With only the 1Fuel token, investors can freely send altcoins from one blockchain to another. 1Fuel is also fitted with highly advanced financial tools that make it easy to manage digital assets. These include crypto debit and credit cards, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, disposable wallets, and AI-driven features. With all of these, 1Fuel could be a top DEX wallet, especially as it features an inbuilt privacy mixer and cold storage. These are privacy features that are usually lacking in well-known platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. 1Fuel presale sees fast progress The 1Fuel presale has been moving at an impressive pace, which is a sign of the widespread investor interest and confidence. In just a week, stage 1 achieved 100% completion while stage 2 had a similar progress. Now it is in stage 3 and over 30% complete, selling over 146 million tokens and raising $1.4 million. Investors can buy the token at $0.017 in stage 3. Analysts predict that 1Fuel could rise by 100x in 2025, and investors are highly anticipating long-term growth. 1Fuel’s launch Investors are looking forward to 1Fuel’s public listing in Q2 2025. Supported by a robust DeFi ecosystem, 1Fuel could change how digital assets are managed. The exchange technology is offering an edge over widely known blockchain systems like Cardano and Ripple.

Trump Bitcoin MAGA (MAGABTC), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MAGABTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Bitcoin MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Bitcoin MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Bitcoin MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Bitcoin MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Bitcoin MAGA by entering its contract address – 3J7GkdTfz7sHdcKcMnD5fm1aDZZUktz7z8NqTdiacLTy – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MAGABTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-23 00:49:52

However, as Solana (SOL) continues to dominate headlines with its growing trading volume, a formidable altcoin rival, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , is quietly gearing up for an extraordinary 56,000% rally.

At just $0.0420 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers investors a rare chance to join its presale and position themselves for its massive potential surge. Don’t miss out on this life-changing opportunity—act now and secure your spot in the presale before it’s too late! Solana’s (SOL) Meteoric Rise To $10 Billion Trading Volume: Is the Best Yet To Come? Solana (SOL) has surged to an impressive $10 billion in trading volume, driven by heightened market activity and optimism around events like the US presidential inauguration and the launch of $Trump meme coins. This momentum has pushed Solana (SOL) to an all-time high of $272, with a 41% rally in the past week alone. While Solana’s (SOL) $10 billion trading volume is remarkable, the altcoin space is brimming with emerging rivals, and WLTQ is one to watch.

Positioned to capitalize on this momentum, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to gain even more traction with upcoming top exchange listings, increasing its market visibility and paving the way for a significant value surge that could redefine portfolios. The presale has already raised over $5 million, with the first stage selling out quickly at $0.0171 per token.

Armstrong acknowledges that Solana is experiencing transactional delays on Coinbase amid a high volume surge in the trading of memecoins launched on the SOL network. In response to one customer complaining of delays on the social media platform X, Armstrong says, “Team is working hard on scaling our Solana infra now – lots of Solana activity last few days, we were not anticipating this level of surge.” Armstrong also responds to another customer complaining they’ve been waiting two days so far for their transfer of SOL to a private wallet to go through. “It’s a scaling challenge keeping up with activity on Solana chain (which surged lately), not solvency. Customer funds are 100% backed and audited periodically by Deloitte. Team is working hard to resolve it.” According to blockchain data aggregator DefiLlama, Solana has done $22.25 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours while Ethereum ( ETH ) – the top smart contact platform by market cap – has only done $6.21 billion. Solana has also done $35.5 million in fees on the day while Ethereum has only done $15.7 million. US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump both chose the Solana network to launch their respective memecoins just days before the presidential swearing-in ceremony on Monday. Solana is trading for $251 at time of writing, up 5.4% in the last 24 hours.

With the XRP price facing challenges, the spotlight is shifting to this Ethereum altcoin, which is currently in its presale stage. Experts say this is a rare early chance for investors to buy tokens at a low price before its growth begins. Investors Told To Drop XRP And Back This Promising Ethereum Altcoin The XRP price has shown signs of struggle recently, as experts warn investors of a potential drop. Although it is known as a reliable digital asset for international payments, the XRP price is facing strong resistance levels, which limit any upward movement. While its utility as a payment solution has been established, the XRP price movements have become increasingly tied to market speculation and ongoing legal battles. As a result, many experts believe that the XRP price may not deliver the explosive gains that many investors seek. Experts have identified one Ethereum altcoin that could provide investors with big returns during the current XRP price fluctuations. This is due to its innovative approach and real-world applications in DeFi. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Ethereum Altcoin To Deliver Massive Returns WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to make a grand entry into the crypto landscape due to its outstanding utility. Experts have predicted this Ethereum altcoin could grow dramatically following its official launch. This remarkable growth potential is based on its AI-driven platform, which provides unmatched functionalities in digital asset management. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is presently in its presale phase as it prepares for a significant launch in the multi-billion dollar AI coin market. The presale has raised millions of dollars, reflecting investors’ strong confidence in the token’s growth potential. The Ethereum altcoin is currently available at a highly affordable price of $0.042 , offering a distinctive chance for early investors. In addition to this impressive growth opportunity, investors participating in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale will enjoy referral bonuses, lower trading and swapping fees, token airdrops, and the opportunity to earn as much as 180% APY. Investors also have governance rights that allow them to influence important decisions on the platform. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has announced the MVP version of its mobile app for crypto wallet management. Using the CoinGecko API , the crypto wallet delivers real-time pricing information for various cryptocurrencies. Users can access all existing crypto tickers and check their performance in greater detail through interactive candlestick charts. Regarding security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) uses anomaly detection tools to quickly recognize unusual wallet activities and block unauthorized login attempts from unfamiliar devices. Moreover, the project’s smart contract underwent a thorough audit by a prominent crypto auditing firm, SolidProof. With its revolutionary utility and advanced AI-driven functionalities, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ethereum altcoin could deliver life-changing gains for early adopters. By tackling significant issues within the crypto industry, this crypto wallet distinguishes itself as a possible game-changer in the market. Investors should accumulate as many tokens as possible before the presale ends. Conclusion WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) being built on the Ethereum blockchain sets it apart from its competitors. Ethereum supports more than 4,000 decentralized applications (dApps) and handles daily transactions worth billions. Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities and its recent shift to an energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism improve the chances for projects such as WallitIQ to thrive. These strategic advantages position the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ethereum altcoin to deliver considerable value and potentially exponential returns for its adopters as the platform grows in the booming AI coin market. Those who invest now can take advantage of what could be one of the most promising opportunities in crypto. With millions of tokens already sold, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is progressing rapidly as demand is set to overtake supply.

Can Shiba Inu Coin Price Hit 50% Rally?,https://thecoinrise.com/toncoin-surges-over-whale-action-as-blockdag-witnesses-major-miner-sale-of-6-2m-can-shiba-inu-coin-price-hit-50-rally/,"Crypto Enthusiasts Spend $6.2M on 15,400 BlockDAG Rigs as Toncoin Surges & SHIB Price Looks Toward 50% Rise The crypto market witnesses interesting trends, with the latest Toncoin (TON) surge taking center stage, propelled by significant whale moves and massive short liquidations. The buzz has traders watching Toncoin closely to see its next peak. At the same time, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) coin price is gearing up for a robust rally, with projections pointing to a 50% upturn based on current market dynamics and analytical forecasts. In parallel, BlockDAG (BDAG) is experiencing notable demand in the mining sector. With sales reaching $6.2 million from over 15,500 units, BDAG’s mining technology is proving increasingly popular. As the mainnet launch approaches and the availability of mining rigs dwindles, BlockDAG is securing its place as a leading choice for crypto mining within the community, setting the scene for potential substantial growth for those keeping an eye on the market. Toncoin Spikes with Whale Activity: Major Surge Ahead? The recent Toncoin surge has captured widespread interest in the crypto realm, with TON witnessing a 104% spike in significant transaction activity over 24 hours. This surge in TON is fueled by intensified whale activity and $127 million in short liquidations, causing major shifts in asset allocations and a spike in Toncoin’s trading activity. Moreover, the exit of short sellers has prompted a flurry of buy orders, further boosting the Toncoin surge. Market analysts suggest that this dynamic of whale movements and market adjustments may pave the way for continued growth. The trajectory of Toncoin shows promising bullish potential, although market fluctuations could impact the duration of this surge. Shiba Inu Analysis: Coin Price Hints 50% Rally The Shiba Inu coin price is hinting at a possible 50% rally despite recent dips. SHIB has fallen 33% from its December peak, yet signals from a hammer candlestick and a falling wedge on the charts suggest a bullish reversal might be imminent. Analysts see the Shiba Inu coin price potentially rising to $0.000033 from its current $0.00002427. The slowed momentum in Shibarium and reduced transaction fees have affected SHIB’s market standing, impacting burns. Nonetheless, a general uptick in the crypto market, driven by positive trends around Bitcoin, could strengthen SHIB’s recovery prospects. Despite existing risks, the Shiba Inu coin price might gain from an improving market environment and analytical backing. BlockDAG’s Mining Rigs Sell Out Fast: Hits $6.2M Sale BlockDAG is making waves in the crypto mining industry, having sold over 15,400 mining units and nearly depleting its inventory, bringing in $6.2 million from these sales. The X Series miners—comprising models X10, X30, and the top-tier X100—are becoming a hit with both beginners and seasoned miners. The X10 model alone is capable of producing up to 200 BDAG daily, which could amount to $200 daily or $3,000 monthly if BDAG hits its anticipated $1 price this year. For those running larger setups, the X100 model, known as the mining powerhouse, can fetch up to 2,000 BDAG daily, equaling $2,000 per day or $30,000 monthly when BDAG reaches $1. As these X Series miners catch on in the mining circles, BlockDAG’s strong presale showing continues to draw new participants, with over $183 million collected and 17.9 billion BDAG coins distributed at the current $0.0248 price in batch 27. Early supporters have seen returns skyrocket by 2,380%, boosting BlockDAG’s allure in the market. BlockDAG is set to launch its mainnet this year and anticipates a substantial price increase in 2025, fueling further interest in its mining technology. Crypto miners are clamoring to get their hands on BlockDAG’s rigs, betting on the project’s lucrative potential. With its innovative mining tech and growing ecosystem, BlockDAG stands out as a top pick for mining and investment within the crypto sphere. This project offers a versatile platform that appeals to developers, traders, and miners, facilitating easy involvement across the board. Bottom Line: Which is the Best Crypto Right Now? The crypto arena is bustling with activity, highlighted by gains in Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and BlockDAG. The notable 104% Toncoin surge, spurred by significant whale transactions and major short liquidations, has the market speculating on what will happen next. Similarly, the Shiba Inu coin price is on the cusp of a 50% surge, following its recent dips. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is fast becoming a prominent player not just for its success among crypto presales but also for the rapid sales of over 15,500 mining rigs, accruing $6.2 million in miner sales. Its mining equipment offers promising earnings, with growing demand as the 2025 mainnet launch nears. For those considering entering the crypto mining market, investing in BlockDAG’s X series miners could be a wise decision.

The news broke after the company submitted its registration to the Delaware Department of State’s Division of Corporations on Jan. 23, a decision confirmed by Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer, per a report from The Block. “This was from us,” Hougan said. The “Bitwise Dogecoin ETF” is the first attempt by any financial institution to bring a DOGE-focused ETF into the highly regulated U.S. market. The decision comes as no surprise to those watching its recent resurgence under the Trump administration, thanks to “First Buddy” Elon Musk. Created in 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin was designed as a satirical take on the growing crypto market. For years, the Shiba Inu-themed token floated in the shadow of its more serious counterparts. But things took a dramatic turn last year. Under the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), led by President Donald Trump, Dogecoin has become a surprising symbol of financial innovation. The department’s website even displayed DOGE’s logo earlier this week, causing a ton of bullish speculation in the community. ETF Store President Nate Geraci expressed surprise that no company had taken the plunge earlier. “I remain shocked that no issuer has filed for a Dogecoin ETF,” Nate wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on January 15. He pointed out that DOGE is the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, calling the filing a potential marketing win or, at best, a path to SEC approval. Elon continues to be a major force behind DOGE’s mainstream acceptance. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented in November 2024, “Today’s satire is tomorrow’s ETF. Is DOGE a bridge too far? We’ll see.” The timing of the filing aligns with increasing optimism about regulatory reforms. “The hope is that the new administration moves quickly to designate which crypto assets are securities and which aren’t,” Geraci added. “Once that framework is in place, the approval path for additional spot crypto ETFs should become much clearer.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",News|Bitwise|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|MARKET|SHIB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-23 01:04:14

XYZVerse and these 4 altcoins could redefine crypto success stories, potentially creating the next wave of millionaires. Table of Contents XYZVerse secures $5.5 million in presale NEAR Protocol Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Ondo Hedera Conclusion Early investors in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum reaped enormous rewards. Now, new digital assets are emerging with the potential for significant growth. This article explores XYZVerse, along with four other promising altcoins that offer a chance to catch the next wave of crypto success, potentially making millionaires. XYZVerse secures $5.5 million in presale XYZVerse is transforming the crypto space by fusing the excitement of sports with the charm of meme coins. Tailored for fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project seeks to bridge the gap between sports enthusiasts and crypto investors in search of the next big opportunity. While many meme coins falter, XYZVerse sets itself apart with a robust roadmap and a commitment to long-term growth. Already in its presale phase, XYZVerse has attracted significant attention, raising over $5.5 million. This impressive milestone showcases the strong support and enthusiasm of its growing community. The presale consists of 15 stages, with token prices incrementally rising at each phase. Currently priced at $0.002 in stage 10, XYZ is set to reach $0.1 by the presale’s conclusion, signaling substantial growth potential for early adopters. XYZVerse aims to become the G.O.A.T. of meme coins, already earning accolades such as the best new meme project. XYZVerse isn’t just about hype; it’s built on a solid tokenomics foundation designed for sustainability. With 15% allocated for liquidity and 10% reserved for community rewards, including bonuses and airdrops, the project is focused on fostering value. A deflationary burn mechanism will eliminate 17.13% of the total token supply over time, increasing scarcity and potentially boosting token prices. Security and credibility are at the forefront of XYZVerse’s mission. The team has implemented smart contracts audits and has planned listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEX and DEX). These measures, combined with a fully vetted team, position XYZVerse as a credible project with a clear roadmap for growth. Interested investors can be part of XYZVerse’s winning team via presale. NEAR Protocol NEAR Protocol’s price has seen modest downshifts recently. Over the past week, NEAR’s price declined by 2.56%. In the last month, the price changed by -5.95%. Currently, NEAR is trading between $4.75 and $5.83. The 10-day simple moving average is $4.98, slightly below the 100-day average of $5.33. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 45.25, which suggests that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 39.92, supporting the RSI’s neutral stance. The MACD level is -0.0677, hinting at slight bearish momentum. Looking ahead, NEAR faces its nearest resistance at $6.55. Breaking above this level could pave the way toward the second resistance at $8.00. Moving to the first resistance would represent an increase of over 13%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3.63, and falling to this level would mean a decline of around 16%. If the price drops further, the second support at $2.18 comes into play. The data suggests that NEAR’s price could either bounce back from current levels or test these support zones in the near future.

In the last month, it fell by 6.58%, and over the past six months, it has decreased by 3.46%. These consistent declines suggest a bearish trend in the market. FET is currently trading between $1.13 and $1.43. The nearest support level is at $0.96, and a second support is at $0.66. If the price continues to decrease, it may test these support levels. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is at $1.55, with a second resistance at $1.84. Overcoming these resistances could indicate a shift towards a bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 45.40, which is below the neutral 50 mark, suggesting slight bearish sentiment. The Stochastic oscillator is at 46.51, also indicating a neutral to bearish stance. The MACD level is negative at -0.0171, pointing towards bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $1.16, which is below the 100-day SMA of $1.28, indicating that the short-term price is underperforming compared to the longer-term average. Ondo Ondo has shown significant movements. Over the past six months, its price increased by 37.68%. In the last month, however, it declined by 21.51%. This past week saw a recovery with a 2.65% rise. The coin is currently trading between $1.20 and $1.55. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 47.03, suggesting a neutral market. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0172, indicating mild bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the Stochastic at 62.63 points toward potential upward movement. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close at $1.29 and $1.33, indicating consolidation. Based on this data, ONDO’s price might stabilize or see moderate growth in the near term. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $1.80. If ONDO breaks through this, it could reach the next resistance at $2.26, representing an increase of about 43% from current levels. On the downside, support exists at $0.88 and further at $0.42 if the price dips significantly.

Over the last month, it rose by 10.15%. Remarkably, in the past six months, HBAR has surged by 207.56%. This significant growth indicates rising interest in the coin. Currently, HBAR trades between $0.32 and $0.40. It is approaching the nearest resistance level at $0.47. If it breaks through this point, the next target could be the second resistance at $0.62. Reaching this level would represent a substantial increase from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.18, which may provide a safety net if the price dips. The Relative Strength Index is at 44.99, suggesting HBAR is neither overbought nor oversold. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is at $0.33, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.35. The MACD level sits at -0.0048, indicating slight bearish momentum. However, considering the recent price gains, there’s potential for the upward trend to continue. Traders will be watching these levels closely to see if HBAR can sustain its momentum.

The staff changes — with each departure replaced by interim officials appointed by Pham — will have implications on cryptocurrency oversight for the U.S. derivatives regulator that's poised to play a bigger role in the field. Notably, Harry Jung, who joined the CFTC in 2023 as a senior policy advisor to Pham, will lead the agency's engagement with the crypto industry. He's been tapped for an elevated role as the CFTC's new acting chief of staff. Pham announced the departure of an extensive list of senior officials, including the agency's general council and the heads of its enforcement, public affairs, clearing and risk, market oversight and market participants divisions. Also exiting are the head of the office of international affairs and the department that oversees legislative affairs – a key area for the agency as Congress will be working on a crypto bill that could put the CFTC in a starring role. ""I’m pleased to announce CFTC leadership changes with the beginning of the new administration,"" Pham said in a statement. ""I am grateful for their combined many decades of faithful service to the CFTC, and I appreciate our talented CFTC staff who will be assuming these roles on an interim basis."" The new acting general counsel — the agency's top legal official — and Pham's chief of staff and public-affairs director were lifted from the ranks of staff from her commissioner office: Meghan Tente, Taylor Foy and Jung, respectively. Running the legislative office will be Nicholas Elliot, who previously advised her on policy.

Crypto analyst Gert van Lagen revealed how this could happen and what could come next after this price surge. Bitcoin Price To Rally To As High As $170,000 Following Wave Formation The Bitcoin price is set to rally to as high as $170,000 following a wave formation. In an X post, Gert van Lagen revealed that Bitcoin had confirmed blow-off wave 5 within the $150,000 and $180,000 range by recently reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $109,000. Following this development, the analyst stated that the flagship crypto is now aiming to reach between $150,000 and $170,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upper Band Moves Above $105,400 – Where Price Is Headed Next Once the Bitcoin price rallies to between $150,000 and $170,000, Gert Van Lagen predicts that a retracement to as low as $120,000 will follow, with claims of a top. However, the rally to $170,000 won’t mark the cycle top for the flagship crypto as the analyst there will be another parabolic rally to the upside, which will be the wave v to complete the fifth wave. Gert van Lagen predicts that the Bitcoin price will rally to as high as $300,000 on the last leg of this cycle, which would end the bull market. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could reach this price target by April. This isn’t the first time the analyst has predicted that the flagship crypto could rally to as high as $300,000. He previously highlighted a cup and handle pattern, which put the final ascent for BTC at this price target. BTC Rally To $158,000 Still In Play Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price, stating that the projected rally to the $158,000 target is still in play. This target came about when he highlighted a bullish pennant forming on BTC’s monthly timeframe. The analyst remarked that Bitcoin could catapult to the moon if this bullish pattern plays out. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Above $100,000 Renews Hope, Analyst Reveals The Cycle Top Meanwhile, in another X post, Titan of Crypto mentioned that the flagship crypto is back to its bullish momentum as it looks “extremely bullish” on the daily chart. This was based on his Ichimoku Cloud analysis, in which he pointed out that the cloud was turning bullish. Amid these bullish outlooks for the Bitcoin price, crypto analyst Justin Bennett has warned that the flagship crypto could drop to as low as $91,000. He remarked that Bitcoin pumped into Trump’s inauguration, so there is a good chance that the rally fades from here. The analyst added that BTC is range-bound until proven otherwise and that the January 13th lower wick at $91,000 looks primed for a retest. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,402, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Now, meme coins like Dogecoin are struggling to regain momentum, the PropiChain project is capturing attention for its innovative use of AI in the real estate sector. As Dogecoin price sets for a potential $1 milestone by 2025, PropiChain’s technology and game-changing approach to property investment position it for unprecedented growth, projected to deliver returns as high as 30,000x. Let’s explore Dogecoin price potential, its ongoing challenges, and why PropiChain is emerging as the smarter investment for those looking to maximize gains in the crypto market. Dogecoin Price Eyes the $1 Milestone The Dogecoin price has been the subject of much speculation as market analysts predict it could finally achieve the long-awaited $1 mark in early 2025. This would represent a monumental milestone for DOGE, as its strong community, celebrity endorsements, and growing use cases continue to fuel optimism. However, while Dogecoin’s potential is promising, its current market cap and relatively limited technological innovation may limit further explosive growth. That is why most investors are starting to explore other opportunities that offer not just high returns but also long-term utility. PropiChain: The AI Altcoin Set to Eclipse Dogecoin PropiChain has emerged as a powerful alternative to Dogecoin. While DOGE thrives on memes and hype, PropiChain offers tangible utility by combining AI-driven technology with blockchain to revolutionize the real estate industry. With predictions of over 100,000% gains, PropiChain’s potential far exceeds Dogecoin price’s projected rise. How PropiChain Outshines Dogecoin 1. AI-Powered Market Analysis for Smarter Investments PropiChain uses artificial intelligence to analyze real estate markets, providing investors with deep insights into emerging trends, undervalued properties, and optimal investment opportunities. With PropiChain’s AI analysis, investors can act early and secure higher returns. 2. Automated Property Valuation for Accuracy PropiChain’s Automated Valuation Models (AVM) utilize AI to deliver accurate property valuations based on market conditions, location, and other key factors. This ensures investors avoid overpaying or underselling their properties, maximizing profits in every transaction. 3. Fractional Ownership Through Tokenization The platform allows users to own fractions of high-value real estate properties through blockchain tokenization. Instead of needing large capital to buy entire properties, investors can purchase smaller shares and earn passive income through rental yields and property appreciation. 4. Metaverse Integration for Global Access PropiChain takes real estate investment into the metaverse by offering virtual property tours, staging, and global buyer-seller interactions. These tools enhance the buying and selling process, making it easier to reach international markets. A seller can showcase properties to global buyers without geographical limitations, increasing exposure and sales potential. 5. Real-Time Filtering and Suggestions PropiChain’s AI system uses advanced filtering to match investors with properties that align with their goals, whether it’s rental income or long-term appreciation. This reduces the time and effort required to find lucrative opportunities, letting investors focus on profits. Dogecoin vs. PropiChain: Why PropiChain Could Deliver Double the Gains While Dogecoin has its charm and a committed following, its growth relies heavily on market sentiment and social media hype. PropiChain , on the other hand, delivers practical utility, offering tools that directly enhance profitability for investors. Additionally, Dogecoin’s established market cap makes it challenging to achieve the same meteoric gains it once did. A $1,000 investment in DOGE at it’s the current dogecoin price might yield 10x returns if it hits $1. In contrast, PropiChain, with its early-stage pricing and disruptive technology, could turn that same $1,000 into $100,000 or more. PropiChain Presale: A Golden Opportunity PropiChain’s token (PCHAIN) is currently in its second presale stage, priced at $0.011. The price will rise to $0.023 in the next stage, and with its listing on CoinMarketCap and verified BlockAudit security review, it’s clear that PropiChain is a secure and legitimate investment opportunity. Investors who join now will benefit from the lowest price point before the token gains mainstream adoption. If PropiChain achieves its projected 30,000x growth, early adopters could see life-changing returns. Grab this opportunity now. By the time it transitions to stage three, the price will more than double, and as adoption grows, so will its value. Investors who hesitate may find themselves priced out of one of the most promising opportunities in the crypto market. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price rising to $1 in 2025 is an exciting prospect, PropiChain’s potential to deliver double the returns makes it the better choice for smart investors. With a foundation built on utility, innovation, and accessibility, PropiChain is a game-changer for both the real estate and crypto industries. Early investors in PropiChain stand to gain the most. A modest $1,000 investment today could yield unparalleled returns, cementing its position as the next big thing in crypto. Don’t wait, PropiChain is the future of property investment and wealth generation.

Litecoin, for instance, is grappling with the decreasing likelihood of its ETF approval, negatively impacting its price. On the flip side, a recent BGB price analysis shows promising market sentiment with a notable 12% rise in its value. BlockDAG (BDAG) is cementing its position as the best crypto to buy, bolstered by a prosperous presale that amassed over $183 million. The helm of this success is Marius Bock, a former Cardano leader whose expertise is steering BlockDAG towards a pivotal mainnet launch this year. BGB Price Analysis: Decoding the Surge Bitget’s token, BGB, has seen a 12% increase, surpassing the $6.72 resistance level. This growth, combined with a doubling in daily trading volume, has caught investors’ attention. While optimism for further gains exists, the sustainability of this rally is under scrutiny. Supporting this upward trajectory are technical indicators such as the MACD and RSI, which show signs of continued buyer interest. If this trend holds, BGB could aim for its previous high of $8.50, indicating a potential 20% increase from the current price of $7.25. Fading Chances for Litecoin (LTC) ETF Approval Currently, Litecoin is priced at $103.03, experiencing a substantial 30% dip from its peak in 2024. This drop reflects a larger trend across the crypto market where numerous coins have receded from last year’s highs. A key factor in Litecoin’s downturn is the dwindling probability of an LTC ETF being approved. Earlier, there was optimism for a 2025 SEC nod for a spot LTC ETF, but recent figures from Polymarket show the chances have slipped from 60% to just 42%. This adjustment has directly influenced Litecoin’s valuation as investors reassess its growth prospects. Marius Bock’s Stewardship May Lift BlockDAG to $1 BlockDAG is set to transform with Marius Bock stepping in as the new Lead Project Manager. Bock’s 25 years of rich experience, including a key role at Cardano, equips him with the blockchain expertise necessary to spearhead BlockDAG’s ambitious mainnet launch planned for early 2025. His expertise in navigating complex blockchain environments is expected to sharpen BlockDAG’s competitive edge, accelerating its expansion globally. This strategic hire signals a fresh chapter for BlockDAG, poised to achieve its presale ambitions and smoothly transition to the mainnet launch. So far, the presale has been a blockbuster, garnering over $183 million and distributing more than 17.9 billion coins. With Bock at the helm, the presale’s success is only expected to climb. As the mainnet launch draws near and the team grows stronger, anticipation for BlockDAG’s coins is projected to spike, potentially pushing their value to the $1 threshold. This rise can be attributed to Bock’s visionary leadership and the flawless execution of the mainnet. With BlockDAG’s trajectory on the upswing, its potential for yielding high returns is better than ever, presenting a golden opportunity for early adopters. Currently considered the best crypto coin to buy , BlockDAG offers a rare chance to get in at a price of $0.0248, with the prospect of nearing $1 soon, as forecasted by experts. Deciding the Best Crypto Coin to Buy The cryptocurrency market has displayed mixed results recently. The latest BGB price analysis predicts a promising trajectory for the token, buoyed by a 12% upswing. Meanwhile, the declining approval odds for the Litecoin ETF have tempered LTC’s market stability. In this fluctuating landscape, BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a formidable contender in the crypto arena. With Marius Bock’s seasoned leadership and the anticipated early 2025 mainnet debut, BlockDAG is on track to unveil its full potential. Experts regard it as an excellent buying opportunity, making now an opportune moment to purchase BDAG before it potentially ascends toward $1.

Through the application of Web3 crypto technology, Web3Bay is crafting a decentralized market that enhances control and prospects for both buyers and sellers. This platform stands out from traditional models, which are often plagued by excessive fees, misuse of data, and centralized oversight, by prioritizing equity, clarity, and rewards for its users. Using blockchain technology, rewards in the form of tokens, and a system driven by its community, Web3Bay simplifies and improves e-commerce. It enables buyers to save costs and maintain privacy over their data, while sellers benefit from greater earnings and access to a worldwide customer base. As a leading digital currency for sustained growth, Web3Bay represents more than a shopping space—it’s a gateway to the future of e-commerce. Seize the opportunity to be part of this thrilling new chapter. Ownership and Clear Transactions Conventional e-commerce platforms often exploit user data to maximize profits. Web3Bay counters this with a blockchain framework that ensures users keep complete control over their data. All transactions on the platform are indelibly recorded, providing clear, reliable records that eliminate the need for intermediary trust. For shoppers, this means personal shopping data remains private and unexploited, guaranteeing a secure shopping environment. Sellers get direct connections to customers without third-party meddling, fostering trust and enhancing engagement—addressing a significant issue found in traditional settings. By focusing on transparency and ownership, Web3Bay delivers a mutually beneficial system, bridging the trust deficit typical of Web2 platforms. Reasonable Fees and Worldwide Access Traditional e-commerce sites are notorious for their high operational fees, including listing fees, transaction fees, and charges for increased visibility, with buyers often absorbing these costs through higher product prices. Web3Bay disrupts this model by utilizing smart contracts to streamline operations and drastically cut fees. On Web3Bay, sellers keep a larger share of their earnings, enabling them to reinvest in their businesses, while buyers benefit from the savings passed down due to lower operational costs. The platform’s decentralized payment system also supports seamless, global transactions without the hassles of currency conversion or payment restrictions, establishing Web3Bay as a genuinely international marketplace. Token Rewards and the 3BAY Token Presale Web3Bay distinguishes itself with a unique token-based reward system. Unlike typical platforms that offer negligible incentives, Web3Bay awards 3BAY tokens to actively participating buyers and sellers. Buyers can accrue tokens through purchases, reviews, and referrals. These tokens can be redeemed for discounts, staked for extra rewards, or traded, making shopping a lucrative activity. Sellers can use tokens to boost product visibility, participate in governance, or grow their revenue. This ecosystem aligns the platform’s growth with user success, promoting sustained loyalty and participation. The ongoing 4th stage of the 3BAY token presale, with tokens priced at $0.004562625 and $840,000 already raised, reflects robust community engagement. Early adopters can greatly benefit, with a projected ROI of 6430% from the start to the end of the presale. This isn’t just about buying tokens—it’s about joining a movement set to redefine e-commerce. Early participants will help shape the platform’s trajectory while maximizing the innovative benefits Web3Bay offers. Community Leadership and Clear Governance Web3Bay enables its users to direct the platform’s evolution through community governance. Unlike conventional platforms controlled by opaque corporate decisions, Web3Bay allows its users to vote on policies, updates, and changes, ensuring both buyers and sellers can influence aspects crucial to their interests. This participatory approach, combined with the transparency of blockchain, ensures a platform built on trust and cooperation. Web3Bay also tackles fraud and counterfeit issues with blockchain verification, ensuring every product, review, and transaction is traceable and authentic, creating a reliable online shopping environment for everyone involved. Final Remarks! Web3Bay is more than just a marketplace; it’s a decentralized movement correcting the flaws of traditional e-commerce. By leveraging Web3 crypto technology, Web3Bay offers transparency, fairness, and substantial rewards to all participants. It addresses issues like excessive fees, data misuse, and the absence of meaningful incentives while introducing a tokenized ecosystem that empowers users. As a leading crypto asset for long-term growth, Web3Bay presents unparalleled opportunities for early adopters. With its 3BAY token presale already attracting significant interest, now is the ideal time to engage. By participating, you’re not merely investing in a promising digital asset—you’re investing in the future of e-commerce itself. Web3Bay stands as a community-centric platform that prioritizes people.

Inaugurated Trump (TRUMPINA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPINA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Inaugurated Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Inaugurated Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Inaugurated Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Inaugurated Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Inaugurated Trump by entering its contract address – 2F9Q7eZwdnfWUY6Pcqvb7KFDXVW2vcoLCDoTkzsHUvTF – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPINA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-23 02:03:00

Mumtaz criticized them for statements that he perceived to be attempts to position Base as a superior network to Solana. The past weekend has been one of the busiest for crypto this year. The launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens sparked a frenzy among users as the memecoins quickly amassed historic market cap valuations in record time. The values of the tokens have fallen by 50% since then. The surge in activity led to network congestion and transaction delays. As the memecoin frenzy settles, Coinbase’s Jesse Pollak and Helius Labs’ Mert Mumtaz have also found the time for a social media exchange that got heated quickly but was ultimately resolved graciously. Blockchain executives clash publicly Following the launch of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA memecoins, the Coinbase exchange and Solana networks experienced substantial congestion that led to transaction delays of up to 21 hours. In a post on his X social media account, Mumtaz pointed out how he found it ironic that Coinbase executives were putting Solana down when they failed to handle Solana transactions during “crypto’s biggest weekend.” The CEO went further to accuse Base of using “backroom tactics” to lure users from Solana to Base. He even implied that they often told teams behind closed doors that Base is a long-term solution while Solana is a short-term fix. Jesse Pollak, head of Coinbase’s base initiative, responded directly to Mumtaz’s claims. “I am the founder of Base, and it’s my job to make Base successful,” Pollak wrote. In a series of tweets, Pollak noted the efforts of the Coinbase executive team to address and resolve the scaling challenges. He also acknowledged that while Base does compete with Solana, it is the kind of healthy competition that encourages growth and innovation in the crypto space. Mumtaz ended the exchange graciously by emphasizing that competition should be honest and transparent without undermining the work of thousands of Solana builders. “As long as we agree to compete honestly without false virtue signaling and backroom tactics — I am on board with that. Best of luck and let’s have some fun pushing crypto forward,” he wrote. Network congestion and transaction delays On January 18 and 19, President and First Lady Trump launched their memecoins, TRUMP and MELANIA. The tokens went live on the Solana network and unsurprisingly drew a surge of activity as users raced to join the buying frenzy. This surge attracted over 200,000 new on-chain users through Moonshot. It caused network congestion and transaction delays, with some Coinbase users being unable to complete their transactions for up to four days. In response to the outrage and chaos that ensued due to the delays, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong reassured users that the team was working around the clock to scale Coinbase’s infrastructure to better support Solana. Despite the congestion, Solana’s network maintained 100% functionality, indicating that the delays were only due to the influx of users and had nothing to do with the blockchain itself.

The market is experiencing a surge of opportunities, from thrilling presales to transformative developments that could reshape portfolios. Whether you’re a novice in the crypto space or a seasoned investor, the buzz surrounding high-performing projects is undeniable. Among these innovations, certain projects have emerged as industry leaders. Filecoin, the champion of decentralized storage, continues to shine with its cultural preservation initiatives. Polygon, known for its scalability, has set new standards through strategic partnerships. Meanwhile, Qubetics , the rising Web3 aggregator, is making waves with its impressive presale performance and innovative features. If you’re seeking the best cryptocurrencies for exponential returns, Qubetics should be a priority on your radar. With its unmatched capabilities and record-breaking milestones, it’s poised to be one of the most exciting crypto stories of the year. Let’s explore how it stands in comparison to established giants like Filecoin and Polygon. Qubetics: The Game-Changer for Exponential Returns Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s a revolution. As the world’s first web3 aggregator, it’s solving one of blockchain’s biggest pain points: interoperability. Imagine seamlessly moving data, assets, and identities across different blockchains. That’s the promise of Qubetics, and it’s already delivering in a big way. As of January 22, 2025, Qubetics has raised over $10.2 million in its presale, with more than 15,500 token holders and 430 million $TICS tokens sold . At a presale price of just $0.0551 per token, the potential returns are staggering. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering gains of 353.39%. And if post-launch projections come true, with prices climbing as high as $15, early investors could see returns exceeding 27,103.64. But Qubetics isn’t just about numbers. Its standout feature, the ability to facilitate seamless cross-border transactions , is changing how businesses and individuals interact with blockchain. Picture a freelance graphic designer in São Paulo who uses Qubetics to get paid in Ethereum but needs to settle bills in Solana. With Qubetics’ cross-border transaction capabilities, these headaches disappear. For small businesses, the implications are massive. Think about a boutique in New York sourcing artisanal goods from Africa. With Qubetics, they can handle payments, supply chain logistics, and even regulatory compliance—all within one platform. For anyone seeking the best cryptos for exponential returns, Qubetics is not just a choice—it’s a necessity. Filecoin: The Custodian of Cultural Heritage Filecoin has always been a favorite among those who value decentralization and security. In 2025, it’s stepping up its game with a new initiative: safeguarding cultural heritage. By partnering with organizations like the Smithsonian Institution and MIT Open Learning, Filecoin is creating a decentralized repository for some of humanity’s most precious artifacts. This isn’t just a feel-good project; it’s a practical application of blockchain technology. Imagine a researcher in South Africa accessing high-resolution images from the Smithsonian’s archives without worrying about servers going down or data being tampered with. That’s the power of Filecoin’s decentralized storage network. Filecoin’s market performance reflects its growing reputation. With a current price of $5.14, it’s up 3.42% from the previous close. While it might not offer the explosive growth of a presale like Qubetics, Filecoin’s steady performance makes it a solid pick for those who prioritize reliability and innovation. In the crypto community, Filecoin is known as the go-to project for decentralized storage. Whether it’s protecting cultural treasures or enabling businesses to store sensitive data securely, Filecoin delivers on its promises. For investors looking for the best cryptos for exponential returns , it’s a name that’s hard to ignore. Polygon: The Scalability Superstar Polygon has been making waves in the crypto world, and 2025 is no exception. Known for its scalability and developer-friendly ecosystem, Polygon is a layer-2 solution that’s transforming how decentralized apps (dApps) operate. Its recent partnership with Jio Platforms is a testament to its growing influence. Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited, is collaborating with Polygon Labs to enhance the scalability and user experience of dApps. Imagine a streaming platform that can handle millions of users without breaking a sweat. That’s the kind of future this partnership is aiming to create. Polygon’s current price of $0.450312 reflects a 3.28% increase from its previous close, signaling strong market confidence. For developers, it’s a dream come true. With its low fees and fast transaction times, Polygon has become the backbone for projects ranging from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces. In the eyes of the crypto community, Polygon is the poster child for scalability. It’s the platform that developers turn to when they need reliability without sacrificing speed. For anyone interested in the best cryptos for exponential returns, Polygon offers a compelling mix of growth and stability. Conclusion Whether you’re chasing the best cryptos for exponential returns or looking for projects with a proven track record, these three names should be on your radar. Qubetics is rewriting the rules with its groundbreaking presale and cross-border transaction capabilities. Filecoin is preserving humanity’s cultural treasures while delivering robust decentralized storage solutions. Polygon continues to set the standard for scalability and developer engagement. But let’s be real: the potential returns on Qubetics are in a league of their own. With analysts predicting gains that could redefine what’s possible in crypto investing, this is an opportunity you can’t afford to miss. Don’t wait—join the Qubetics presale today and secure your place in the future of blockchain innovation. Time’s ticking, and opportunities like this don’t last forever.

39317557,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=234918,1737598603,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Ripple (XRP) price forecast: Will Trump’s ETF approvals spark $5 breakout?,https://coingape.com/markets/ripple-xrp-price-forecast-will-trumps-etf-approvals-spark-5-breakout/,"Ripple (XRP) price consolidated above the $3 mark on Wednesday January 23, supported by bullish tailwinds from Trump’s inauguration. With investors increasingly shifting coins into long-term storage, is XRP price could be on the verge of a major breakout towards $5? Ripple (XRP) Consolidates as $3 amid Multiple Trump-fueled Bullish Catalysts Ripple (XRP) price stagnated around $3 on Wednesday, raising a few eyebrows as crypto market events during the day revealed a number of bullish catalysts. First, Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyyfart confirmed the imminent listing of XRP and Solana (SOL) futures on CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange. Given the share size of capital at play among institutional investor-focus exchanges like the CME group, Ripple price is expected to attract significant capital inflows in the long-run. XRP Price Action | XRPUSDT However XRP price failed to advance significantly after the news of this event broke for several reasons. The chart above shows that XRP price spent the larger part of Wednesday in consolidation phase, moving within the narrow channel between $3 to $3.2. First, XRP is not expected to begin trading on the CME group until Feb 10. Hence the expected capital inflows are not priced. More so, Donald Trump’s foray into the memecoin space, has diverted layer-1 capital flows towards the Solana network. These two facts played a role in XRP tepid price action observed on Wednesday. It remains to be seen if bull traders will break out of the current sit-and-watch state, and place larger long bets as February 10, at the tentative date of XRP and SOL listing on CME Group approaches. Binance Traders spotted moving $300M XRP amid Trump ETF Approval Speculations. XRP price has established steady support above $3 this week, amid positive speculations surrounding potential altcoin ETF approvals, President Donald Trump’s expected crypto-friendly policies and rapid digital assets purchase by affiliate firm World Liberty Financial (WLFI). However, on-chain data trends reveal another major bullish signal from investors currently holding XRP. Validating this narrative, CryptoQuant’s exchange reserves chart above tracks the daily balances of XRP coin deposited in wallets hosted on Binance, the world’s largest spot trading crypto exchange. As of January 16 XRP traders held a total of 3.04 billion XRP in Binance-hosted wallets. But that figure has declined steeply since then, hitting the 2.9 billion mark at close of trading on Tuesday. This reflects that XRP holders have effectively removed 100 million XRP ($300 million) form the short-term market supply readily available to be traded on Binance. This reflects that XRP price has increased by double-digits in the past week, the majority of current holders are unwilling to sell, instead are transferring large volumes of coins into long-term storage options. Such a dramatic decline in short-term market supply could clear the path for XRP price to enter an accelerated breakout during the next demand surge. XRP Price Forecast: $3 support holds firm as traders await market clarity XRP price forecast currently flashes positive signals, with recent movements indicating a steady support at the $3.00 zone. The XRPUSD daily chart further highlights a recent 7% rally over two days, showcasing buyer confidence. The Bollinger Bands display a moderate expansion, with XRP trading near the upper band at $3.14, suggesting bullish momentum but signaling a potential overextension. Additionally, the Parabolic SAR, with its dots trailing below current price levels, reinforces the bullish bias as it often signals sustained upward momentum. XRP Price Forecast | XRPUSD The MACD histogram, while remaining positive, shows narrowing bars, hinting at waning bullish momentum. The MACD line is slightly above the signal line, supporting a cautiously optimistic outlook. For a bullish scenario, XRP must decisively breach $3.52, the upper Bollinger Band, to target $3.70 and beyond. Conversely, a bearish breakdown of $3.00 could expose XRP to $2.68 support, indicated by the lower SAR marker and midline of the Bollinger Bands.

Tornado Cash’s TORN surged following the court ruling to as high as $25.48 from $8.12, the highest since November 2024. At the time of writing, TORN was trading at $16.3, up by 102% in the last 24 hours. In a historic court ruling for the crypto industry, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said in a Jan. 21 filing that “the judgment of the district court is reversed,” as “ we hold that Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts (the lines of privacy-enabling software code) are not the 'property' of a foreign national or entity, meaning (1) they cannot be blocked under IEEPA, and (2) OFAC overstepped its congressionally defined authority,” the court said referring to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

The move aims to position FRAX as a leader in the growing U.S.-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. A potential follow-up investment of $10 million is also being considered, contingent on the success of the partnership. Frax Finance Proposes $5M Investment In WLFI The interest in U.S.-origin crypto initiatives has been fueled by the election of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States. The current administration has shown a great interest in the development of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. World Liberty Financial, a DeFi project that is closely aligned with Trump’s agenda of a crypto economy centred around the United States, has become a major player in this regard. Frax Finance, which focuses on the algorithmic stablecoin, plans to incorporate frxUSD into the WLFI system. The proposal focuses on how the business can leverage on the governance structure, distribution network and partnership of WLFI. As per the proposal, WLFI aims to bring millions of Americans into DeFi and help US based crypto projects. The first $5 million investment would enable FRAX to purchase WLFI tokens and thus become shareholders in its governance framework. A second phase of up to $10 million may be available if there is evidence of achievement of the initial goals. WLFI’s Expanding Influence in U.S.-Based DeFi Though Trump had been vocal on the campaign trail about supporting cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, he has not yet officially mentioned Bitcoin or any other virtual currency since taking the oath of office. This has raised eyebrows especially given that his administration was known to have pledged support to U.S based digital currency projects. Nevertheless, the actions of WLFI seem to be aligned with the pro-crypto agenda and are expanding actively in the DeFi sector. The platform has recently added the leading DeFi tokens to its portfolio, including Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), AAVE (AAVE), and Wrapped Bitcoin (BTC). According to the data, the ETH assets of WLFI have reached more than $184 million and the company also has sizable investments in other products. In its governance structure, the WLFI community has the ability to participate in decision making within the ecosystem. For instance, Ethena Labs recently used WLFI’s governance platform to propose the use of its stablecoin as collateral in Aave. Similar governance options are also being considered for the frxUSD that can further enhance the use of FRAX within the WLFI domain. FRAX’s Strategic Position in the Partnership Frax Finance has a unique position in this proposed collaboration due to its U.S. roots and co-founder Stephen Moore’s connection to the Trump administration. Moore, a former economic advisor to Donald Trump, lends credibility to FRAX’s alignment with a U.S.-centric DeFi agenda. The proposal outlines that this partnership would elevate FRAX’s status within the DeFi community. Integrating frxUSD as collateral in WLFI’s ecosystem could potentially increase adoption among millions of WLFI’s users. Additionally, FRAX stands to benefit from WLFI’s governance model, which could provide strategic influence over future decisions.

On Jan. 21, Cuban stated that if memecoins are “the way,” he might consider issuing one similar to U.S. President Donald Trump’s official memecoin. He proposed that the token would follow the same terms and release schedule as Trump’s, but all proceeds would go toward reducing the U.S. national debt. Cuban added that the wallet address for the memecoin would be publicly available, allowing anyone to track the funds. He remarked that individuals who enjoy speculating on meme-based tokens could use their participation to contribute to the debt. “If you want to gamble, gamble. But at least use it to make a dent in the U.S. Debt,” Cuban wrote. Memecoins and the U.S. Government Despite the U.S. government’s generally skeptical stance toward cryptocurrency in recent years, the newly inaugurated president has shown an active interest in the crypto space. In addition to launching official non-fungible token (NFT) projects, Trump has also entered the memecoin market. On Jan. 18, just days before his inauguration, Trump introduced his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin. The token quickly achieved a market capitalization of $14.5 billion within a day, but its value has since fallen by nearly 50%, now trading at around $38.56, according to CoinGecko. Similarly, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own token, Official Melania (MELANIA). The token initially reached a market capitalization of $6 billion but has since dropped to approximately $680 million. Can Cuban’s Memecoin Reduce U.S. Debt? The U.S. national debt stands at nearly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. While Cuban’s proposal might not be serious, it underscores the magnitude of the debt issue. Even if Cuban’s memecoin matched Trump’s in performance, it would only address about 0.03% of the debt, with actual contributions likely to be even smaller due to token devaluation when sold.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-23 02:44:16

BTC is correcting gains and might revisit the $100,000 support zone. Bitcoin started a downside correction from the $107,200 zone. The price is trading below $104,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $103,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $100,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price started a decent upward move above the $103,500 zone. BTC was able to climb above the $104,500 and $105,000 levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $106,000 level. However, the bears were active near the $107,200 zone.

A clear move above the $103,650 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $104,500. A close above the $104,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $107,200 resistance level and a new all-time high. Any more gains might send the price toward the $112,500 level. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $104,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $6.09 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $9.89. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $100 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos recover to its all-time high soon?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $1.16 Market cap $1,189,252,981.56 Trading volume $33,536,725.9 Circulating supply 1,026,096,241.29 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $1.16 24-hour high $1.22 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.78% 50-day SMA $1.398 14-Day RSI 43.13 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 84 (Extreme Greed) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.9119 Tezos price analysis: XTZ continues in the red zone – buying opportunity? TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has seen a 4% decline in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is $1.13, and resistance is $1.427. Tezos (XTZ) is currently retesting support at $1.131. On January 23, Tezos (XTZ) is trading at $1.15, with resistance at $1.427 and support at $1.13. Holding above $1.13 is key to avoiding further decline, while a rebound in buying could push the price above $1.5. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ continues to trend lower The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin shows a continued dip in the price. XTZ’s value is currently around $1.16, just above its critical support at $1.13. XTZ continues to trend lower The MACD indicator also confirms the selling pressure observed on the chart, with a bearish crossover. The RSI (44.97) reflects a rather neutral market, indicating reduced volatility and potential price consolidation. If buyer interest does not return soon, XTZ could break below $1.13 towards $1.02. For a recovery to be confirmed, the coin must break past resistance at $1.427. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Buying interest continues to dip Similarly, the 4-hour chart also shows the bears having a strong hold on the market. The Bollinger Bands are expanding, suggesting rising volatility in the short term and possible price swings. Buying interest continues to dip The MFI and CMF indicators show that there is not enough buying interest to push the price up. If XTZ fails to stay above $1.15, it might make its way toward lower support levels. To confirm a recovery, XTZ must move back above the middle Bollinger Band at $1.22. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.259 SELL SMA 5 $1.287 SELL SMA 10 $1.326 SELL SMA 21 $1.340 SELL SMA 50 $1.397 SELL SMA 100 $1.122 BUY SMA 200 $0.911 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.271 SELL EMA 5 $1.280 SELL EMA 10 $1.306 SELL EMA 21 $1.336 SELL EMA 50 $1.300 SELL EMA 100 $1.163 BUY EMA 200 $1.030 BUY What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? The analysis on both timeframes shows bearish momentum. If the sell-offs persist, traders can expect lower prices and an opportunity to buy XTZ at a discounted price. For any meaningful rebound, Tezos (XTZ) needs to break above $1.22 to shift momentum. Is Tezos a good long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today, falling from $1.225 to $1.16, a 4% price drop—a move spurred by sellers disposing of their coins and taking a profit. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286.

While Polygon continues to gain attention for its innovative features, an emerging blockchain project, Lightchain AI , is poised to outshine its competitors. Priced at just $0.00525 during its presale and with over $10.6 million raised, Lightchain AI is rapidly becoming a top contender for breaking records in the crypto market. Polygon’s Rise and Market Appeal Polygon, once Matic Network, has come up as a big Layer 2 way to make Ethereum faster. It fixes the problems of high costs for transactions and slow speeds for processing. It’s liked more because of smart deals with big firms like Starbucks and Mastercard which helps its trust and use. New tech growths, like the shift to POL token and the making of AggLayer way, have made its place in the bl͏ockchain system even stronger. Market experts guess a good path for Polygon. They think the price may rise in the next years. In January 2025, MATIC, which is Polygon’s main token, is worth about $0.46 with a market value of near $887.94 million What Sets Lightchain AI Apart? Lightchain AI is bringing something new to the table with its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. This innovative approach rewards nodes for performing AI tasks like model training and optimization, boosting both network security and efficiency. It’s a fresh take that stands out from traditional methods. Lightchain AI has an exciting roadmap ahead, with the testnet set to launch in January 2025 and the mainnet going live in March 2025—showing real dedication to growth and scalability. The tokenomics are just as solid, with a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens carefully allocated to support sustainability, fair participation, and ecosystem development. By combining AI and blockchain, Lightchain AI is tackling big challenges like scalability, governance, and privacy, making it easier for industries everywhere to adopt this cutting-edge technology. Why Lightchain AI Could Break Records The market’s enthusiasm for Lightchain AI stems from its ability to address key blockchain challenges while offering a robust infrastructure for future growth. Analysts believe that Lightchain AI’s combination of early-stage pricing, innovative features, and market relevance could lead to exponential growth. As adoption increases, the platform’s scalability and real-world utility could propel it to record-breaking heights.

This level of security goes far beyond what Dogecoin or Shiba Inu offers, making the Ethereum token an appealing choice for investors looking for reliability and long-term growth. Another standout feature is WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) portfolio management capabilities. Through AI-powered insights, users can upgrade their asset allocation and track portfolio performance effortlessly. This provides a level of strategic planning that meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu simply cannot match. Furthermore, the recently launched WallitIQ (WLTQ) MVP crypto wallet management app is set to redefine the user experience in crypto asset management. Supporting ETH and USDT, the app offers features like QR code payments, simulated transactions, and live market data powered bythe CoinGecko API merger. This positions WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a versatile solution that goes beyond the speculative price movements of meme coins. To reinforce its credibility, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) smart contract has been successfully audited by SolidProof, which gives top-tier security and transparency. With analysts highlighting the AI altcoin as a high-potential investment, the current presale phase offers a chance to enter early before its value skyrockets post-launch. Investors seeking real utility and growth should look past the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu price surges and consider the long-term potential of the WLTQ token. Dogecoin Price Performance And Market Outlook According to CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin remains a top contender in the crypto market, with its price experiencing notable surges due to increased adoption and community engagement. However, despite its popularity, Dogecoin lacks the fundamental utility needed for sustained growth, making its price movements highly speculative. In contrast, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a more strategic investment opportunity, with its AI-driven capabilities and presale pricing presenting a higher upside for early adopters. Analysts are betting big on it due to its real-world use cases and the potential for significant value appreciation post-launch. Shiba Inu Price Surge And Competitive Landscape Shiba Inu, another meme coin sensation, has also seen its price rise, fueled by strong community backing and strategic token burns. According to CoinGecko, the Shiba Inu price has maintained an upward trajectory, supported by developments in its ecosystem, such as decentralized exchange integrations and partnerships. Despite these positive indicators, the Shiba Inu price remains largely speculative. On the other hand, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides tangible value. With WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale offering tokens at just $0.0420 , the potential for significant gains far outweighs the uncertain future of Shiba Inu price movements. Conclusion: Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Stands Above Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Despite the occasional surges in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices, the real opportunity for investors, according to analysts, lies in WallitIQ (WLTQ) . Its AI-driven approach to crypto asset management, coupled with a solid security framework and a user-friendly mobile app, makes it a strong contender for substantial long-term gains. At the presale price of $0.0420 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a compelling entry point, with analysts confident that its value will soar post-launch. Don’t let the hype around Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices distract you from the real potential of WallitIQ (WLTQ). Analysts are betting big on its growth, and the current presale is your chance to secure a position before the price skyrockets. Take advantage of this opportunity and invest in this altcoin today to reap the rewards of its future success.

Analysts Say WallitIQ (WLTQ) Has More Room To Grow From $0.042 To $5,https://timestabloid.com/can-dogecoin-reach-2-analysts-say-wallitiq-wltq-has-more/,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with predictions, and while Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to intrigue with its popularity, analysts are drawing attention to an emerging token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) . This token, currently priced at just $0.0420, has captured the attention of investors, including a millionaire analyst, who is confident in its potential to outperform DOGE. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Smart Investor’s Golden Opportunity The WallitIQ (WLTQ) token presale is a golden ticket for investors seeking extraordinary returns during the next crypto bull run. Backed by cutting-edge technology and a solid ecosystem, the token’s platform is redefining decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency management. Its robust utility and unmatched security features make it a game-changer, leaving Dogecoin (DOGE) trailing far behind in functionality and growth potential. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) ecosystem is powered by its native token, WLTQ, which offers multiple utilities that are driving demand and value and creating wealth for early investors. Among its standout features are high-yield staking rewards, offering you the chance to earn up to 180% APY by staking WLTQ tokens. Governance Participation, as a WLTQ holder you have the power to influence key platform decisions and boost community-driven growth. AI-Powered Insights, the platform uses artificial intelligence to simplify multi-asset management and assist users in making complex financial decisions with confidence. Unlike any other decentralized wallet, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet offers top-notch security features like biometric and facial recognition authentication . In an era where security breaches are rampant, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform guarantees that users’ assets remain safe. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) crypto wallet management mobile app is another game-changer. It allows users to simulate wallet management for ETH and USDT, view live market data, and even send payments with just a few taps. At just $0.0420 per token, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale offers an incredibly affordable entry point. Analysts, including a millionaire who made a fortune on Dogecoin (DOGE), predict the WLTQ token price will surge to $5 by the end of Q1 2025, delivering a staggering ROI. With a $1,000 investment at $ 0.0420 , you’ll acquire 23,809 WLTQ tokens. If the price reaches $5, this investment would balloon to $119,045. For $10,000 you get 238,095 WLTQ tokens, and your portfolio could skyrocket to $1,190,475 at $5. If you aim for the moon with a $100,000 investment, owning 2,380,952 tokens could result in $11,904,760 if the price rises to $5. This potential for massive returns has created a sense of urgency among investors. The millionaire analyst emphasizes the importance of acting now, as savvy whales have confirmed the platform’s transparency through its CoinMarketCap listing and SolidProof smart contract audit and are already accumulating large amounts of WLTQ tokens in anticipation of this explosive rally. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI-driven trading strategy and innovative ecosystem are set to spark a major rally. Don’t miss your chance to join early adopters and ride the wave of one of the most promising investments in crypto history. Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Hit $2? Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite in the crypto space, thanks to its viral appeal and strong community backing. However, while Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a subject of speculation as to price stability, analysts are skeptical about its ability to reach $2 in the near term. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) utility is limited compared to WallitIQ (WLTQ). Despite occasional pumps driven by celebrity endorsements, Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks the robust ecosystem that underpins WLTQ’s value. For Dogecoin (DOGE) to hit $2, it would require significant institutional adoption and technological upgrades, neither of which are guaranteed. Conclusion: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Smarter Investment While Dogecoin (DOGE) may continue to attract attention with its charm, it’s clear that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token has far more room to grow. With a presale price of just $0.0420 and a forecasted price of $5 by early 2025, WLTQ offers an unparalleled opportunity to create life-changing wealth. The time to act is now. You can turn even a modest investment into a fortune. Don’t be left behind as others seize this moment to secure their financial futures.

However, a recent report by Glassnode suggests that the sustained consolidation observed in recent months may be nearing its end, with the leading cryptocurrency primed for its next significant move. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Declines Sharply According to the latest edition of Glassnode’s ‘The Week On-Chain Report,’ BTC profit-taking volumes have dropped significantly, falling from a peak of $4.5 billion in December to approximately $316.7 million – a sharp decline of 93%. This drop in profit-taking signals a substantial reduction in sell-side pressure for Bitcoin. Currently, BTC is trading within a tight 60-day price range, a pattern that has often preceded significant market volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Target $145,000 To $249,000 Under Trump Administration: Report When Bitcoin trades in a narrow price range, it either signals the beginning of a bull market rally or the final stages of a bear market capitulation. One key metric highlighted in the report is the Realized Supply Density, which measures Bitcoin’s supply concentration around the current spot price within a 15% range, both up and down. Currently, approximately 20% of Bitcoin’s supply is within this price band, indicating heightened price sensitivity. Small price movements within this range could significantly impact investor profitability, thereby fueling market volatility. The report also points to a key metric, CoinDay Destruction (CDD), as further evidence of declining sell-side pressure. During late December and early January, CDD values were notably high, reflecting increased activity by long-term holders. However, the metric has cooled off in recent weeks. For the uninitiated, CDD measures the economic activity of spent BTC by tracking how long coins were held before being moved. It multiplies the number of coins by the number of days they remained idle, highlighting whether long-term holders are spending their coins. The recent decline in CDD suggests that many BTC investors who planned to take profits have already done so within the current price range. As a result, the market may enter a new price range to unlock the next wave of supply and liquidity. Long-Term Investors Return To Accumulation Mode The report also highlights the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Binary Spending Indicator, a key metric that tracks Bitcoin held by long-term investors. The report notes: Aligned with the heavy profit-taking volumes from before, we can see a significant decline in the total LTH Supply as the market reached $100k in December. The rate of LTH Supply decline has since stalled out, suggesting a softening of this distribution pressure in recent weeks. Additionally, LTH inflows to crypto exchanges have fallen sharply, dropping from $526.9 million in December to just $92.3 million. That said, the total LTH BTC supply is showing signs of growth, indicating that long-term investors are returning to accumulation mode. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Hit Its Peak In Summer 2025? Analysts Weigh In Meanwhile, retail demand for BTC remains strong. Investors holding less than 10 BTC collectively purchased approximately 25,600 BTC in the past month. In comparison, Bitcoin miners minted only 13,600 BTC during the same period. At press time, BTC trades at $104,207, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

Musk Nazi (MUSKNAZI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKNAZI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Nazi can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Nazi could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Nazi launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Nazi on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Nazi by entering its contract address – 9xM2riPkTrrdu61VQoGYrcYrtxNbuFRvg2mRzcoaUp2y – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKNAZI.

ETH is showing a few bearish signs and might decline below the $3,150 support. Ethereum failed to gain pace for a close above $3,350 and $3,400. The price is trading below $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key contracting triangle with support at $3,270 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $3,120 support level. Ethereum Price Breaks Support Ethereum price started a decent upward move from the $3,220 level but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . ETH cleared the $3,300 resistance before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $3,361 and the price is now moving lower. There was a move below the $3,250 and $3,220 support levels . Besides, there was a break below a key contracting triangle with support at $3,270 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A low was formed at $3,201 and the price is now consolidating. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,280 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,363 swing high to the $3,201 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,300 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,363 swing high to the $3,201 low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,350. A clear move above the $3,350 resistance might send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. An upside break above the $3,450 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,550 resistance zone or even $3,580 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,300 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level. The first major support sits near the $3,150. A clear move below the $3,150 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000.

Better Markets Inc., a nonprofit organization, has filed an amicus brief in support of the SEC. For context, the SEC has appealed the 2023 ruling, arguing that Judge Torres made errors when deciding that certain sales of XRP on digital asset exchanges were not securities. To summarize the SEC’s position: they believe the judge wrongly ruled that these “programmatic sales” of XRP were not securities. The SEC argues that these sales should have been considered securities, as they were conducted through exchanges, even though the buyers didn’t directly purchase from Ripple. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple Better Markets Inc. has filed an Amicus Brief in Support of the @SECGov . https://t.co/cu8lTLBqtM — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) January 22, 2025 Attorney Jeremy Hogan took to social media and said that Better Markets’ amicus brief seems to misunderstand the trial judge’s ruling. The judge didn’t rule that XRP sales on exchanges weren’t securities because the buyers didn’t purchase directly from Ripple. Instead, the judge found that these transactions were “blind bid/ask” sales, meaning buyers couldn’t know if they were buying from Ripple or another seller. This meant the buyers couldn’t rely on Ripple to increase the price, which was a key factor in the judge’s decision. ""Better Market's"" Amicus Brief was hard to read. Not because I don't think this case will ever be ruled on by the appellate court, but because it COMPLETELY misses (or misconstrues?) what the Trial Judge ruled (see excerpt below). The Trial Judge did NOT rule that sales of XRP… https://t.co/XCjKXYuwQo pic.twitter.com/cjpiCSkvHj — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) January 22, 2025 Hogan expressed frustration that Better Markets didn’t directly address the core issue of how the judge applied the facts to the law. Instead, the brief argued that the decision was wrong without tackling the legal reasoning behind it. Better Markets also suggested that if the ruling stands, the SEC wouldn’t be able to protect investors, but Hogan disagreed with this line of argument. What is an Amicus Brief? An amicus brief (short for amicus curiae brief) is a document filed in a court case by someone who is not directly involved in the case but wants to provide additional information or arguments that may assist the court in making its decision. The term amicus curiae translates to “friend of the court,” meaning the person or group submitting the brief is offering their expertise or perspective to help the court understand broader issues or implications of the case.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-23 03:47:53

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a global leader in derivatives trading, may be gearing up to introduce futures contracts for Solana ( SOL ) and Ripple ( XRP ) as early as Feb. 10, according to a leaked page from their beta website. While the page was quickly removed, it detailed key specifications for the contracts. However, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that a CME spokesperson described the beta website as a draft environment used for mock-ups, which was mistakenly made public. A @CMEGroup spokesperson tells @FoxBusiness that the beta version of the website, which is often used for mock up drafts, was made public in error. No official decisions have yet been made about launching futures contracts for either token. https://t.co/10XfenoIL7 — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2025 “No official decisions have yet been made about launching futures contracts for either token,” the spokesperson clarified. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, commented on the leak, stating, “Honestly, it makes sense and is largely to be expected if true.” Assuming ""beta.cmegroup"" is actually a beta/test version of the actual CMEGroup website — looks like CME is expecting to launch SOL & XRP futures on Feb 10. But this isn't available on the actual website yet. Honestly makes sense and largely to be expected if true IMO https://t.co/lfMGd8X9KE — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 22, 2025 According to the leaked details, the futures contracts for both Solana and XRP would be available in standard and micro sizes. Solana’s standard contracts would feature a 500 SOL lot size, with micro contracts reduced to 25 SOL. Similarly, XRP’s standard futures contracts would involve 50,000 XRP per lot, with micro contracts sized at 2,500 XRP. All contracts are expected to settle in U.S. dollars, making them convenient for institutional players wary of dealing with direct crypto settlements. The reelection of Donald Trump and the resignation of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler have led to renewed optimism among investors, with firms racing to bring products like Solana and XRP ETFs to market. ProShares, for example, submitted a Solana futures ETF application on Jan. 17, while WisdomTree filed for an XRP ETF in December 2024. Other firms, including Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, are also vying to introduce various ETFs. Seyffart noted that the availability of Solana futures on CME could address questions about whether the current Solana futures market—dominated by Coinbase—has the necessary liquidity for such products. “I’m not sure if the Coinbase SOL futures are large and liquid enough,” Seyffart remarked in an earlier tweet. NEW: ProShares just filed for a Solana Futures ETF. VolatilityShares also filed for one of these back in December.

By integrating Web3 technology, Web3Bay crafts a decentralized market, enhancing control and opportunities for both buyers and sellers. This new setup reduces the usual high costs, mismanagement of data, and centralized governance of typical platforms, focusing instead on fairness, clarity, and rewarding participation. In this system, blockchain technology and community-based operations simplify and improve e-commerce. Buyers benefit from lower expenses and data privacy, while sellers gain more earnings and a broader customer base. As a promising crypto asset for long-term growth, Web3Bay transcends mere transactions, representing a forward leap in e-commerce dynamics. Ownership and Clarity in Transactions Traditional online shops often exploit customer data for profit. Web3Bay counters this with a blockchain structure that ensures users keep complete data control. This method records all transactions clearly and permanently, reducing reliance on middlemen. For consumers, this guarantees privacy and security in shopping data. Sellers gain direct access to their customers, fostering trust and improved engagement, and solving major issues found in old-style e-commerce. By valuing transparency and data control, Web3Bay offers a mutually beneficial environment for all users, bridging the trust deficit seen in conventional platforms. Lower Costs and Worldwide Reach Conventional online markets are known for their prohibitive fees. Web3Bay removes these barriers using smart contracts to automate services and slash costs significantly. Here, sellers keep a larger share of their profits, enabling business growth, while buyers save money, benefiting from the reduced fees passed down by sellers. The decentralized payment system of Web3Bay also supports smooth, unrestricted transactions globally, making it a universally accessible market. 3BAY Token Rewards and Presale Boom Web3Bay differentiates itself with a revolutionary tokenized reward system. Unlike standard platforms lacking meaningful incentives, Web3Bay incentivizes both buyers and sellers through the issuance of 3BAY tokens for their active participation. Shoppers accrue tokens by purchasing goods, writing reviews, and making referrals. These tokens are redeemable for discounts, can be staked for further rewards, or traded, making shopping a lucrative endeavor. Sellers utilize 3BAY tokens to boost product visibility, engage in governance, and expand their profit channels. This token-centric model synchronizes the platform’s expansion with user success, encouraging ongoing engagement and loyalty. Currently, in its fourth phase, the 3BAY token presale offers tokens at $0.004562625 each, having already raised $840,000, signaling robust community engagement. With a predicted ROI of 6430% from the start to the end of the presale, early investors are poised to substantially benefit as they gain a foothold in this evolving marketplace. The presale extends beyond simple token acquisition; it represents an opportunity to be part of a transformative movement in e-commerce. Early participants not only invest financially but also contribute to shaping the future direction of Web3Bay, maximizing the potential benefits of its forward-thinking model. Community Leadership and Transparent Operations Web3Bay empowers its users to shape the platform’s future through community-led governance. Unlike conventional platforms where choices are decided in secrecy, Web3Bay enables its users to vote on various policies, updates, and alterations to the platform. This inclusive approach ensures that both buyers and sellers actively participate in developing the ecosystem. Sellers have a say in policies affecting their operations, while buyers can support enhancements that improve their purchasing experiences. When combined with the clarity of blockchain technology, this governance structure guarantees a platform founded on mutual trust and cooperative effort. Additionally, Web3Bay tackles issues of fraud and counterfeit products through robust blockchain verification processes. Each product, review, and transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring both traceability and veracity. This level of transparency mitigates the typical uncertainties of online shopping, establishing a reliable and secure marketplace for all users. In a Nutshell! Web3Bay is redefining the e-commerce scene by addressing its traditional shortcomings through Web3 technology, ensuring transparency, fairness, and user benefits. It tackles high costs, data misuse, and incentive gaps while fostering a tokenized community that uplifts both buyers and sellers. Positioned as a leading crypto entity for substantial future growth, Web3Bay is ripe for early participation. The ongoing 3BAY token presale is an ideal opportunity to engage with a platform that’s set to redefine online shopping . Web3Bay isn’t just a marketplace; it’s a community-centric platform prioritizing its users. Join this transformative journey today.

If confirmed, this increase would be the largest since February 2007. The report said that reasons for the hike include solid wage growth and the absence of any major market shocks following U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Overnight-indexed swaps show traders are certain about the rate hike, with predictions jumping from 50% certainty last month to nearly 100% now. Economists are also aligned—three-quarters of them expect the hike, according to a Jan. 21st survey. If you look closely enough, you’ll see that since last year, the BOJ has been very careful about making any sudden moves, but conditions now seem to warrant action. “The wage data is there, and the markets have been calm since Trump’s re-election. The timing for a hike is clear,” said Bloomberg’s report. Investors are now focused on what Ueda will say about future hikes. Japan’s borrowing costs are still the lowest among developed economies. Analysts expect the BOJ’s quarterly forecast, which will also be released Friday, to show inflation staying on target through March 2027. However, Ueda is unlikely to commit to a clear way forward. Market experts warn that being too cautious in his tone could weaken the yen and lead to further inflation pressures. Currency intervention might then be necessary, a decision Tokyo hasn’t ruled out. The official policy statement and the BOJ’s economic outlook report will be released at noon local time. Ueda is scheduled to hold a press conference at 3:30 p.m., where he will likely face questions about the BOJ’s next steps. Stocks, crypto, and rate risks ahead of BOJ’s decision Wall Street remains calm ahead of the BOJ’s decision. Futures for the S&P 500 fell by less than 0.1% on Wednesday evening. Dow Jones futures dipped 5 points, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down about 0.1%. This performance actually follows a record-breaking day for the S&P 500, which gained 0.61% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq rose by 1.28%, and the Dow surged by 0.30%. Investors remain bullish on incoming tax cuts and deregulation under Trump, as well as strong economic growth in the U.S. Corporate earnings are also giving investors’ confidence. Netflix shares jumped over 9% after its latest earnings report. So has Nvidia and Bitcoin whales MicroStrategy and BlackRock. Crypto markets were dealt a huge blow the last time BOJ hiked its rates. On August 5th 2024, we all had to watch Bitcoin lose nearly $10,000 in less than 5 hours after the announcement. The total market cap fell below $2 trillion for the first time in ages as investors freaked out. At press time, Bitcoin has seemingly stabilized above $100,000 after a rocky December, and we’re now all waiting for the president to make an executive order directly about Bitcoin. Admittedly, he does have better priorities, but he has managed to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road.

The price is now correcting gains and might find bids near the $3.00 level. XRP price started a downside correction from the $3.30 zone. The price is now trading below $3.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3.1450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it stays above the $3.00 support. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price managed to start a fresh increase from the $3.120 support zone, but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . The price was able to surpass the $3.250 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $3.285 and the price recently started a downside correction. There was a move below the $3.20 support. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3.012 swing low to the $3.285 high. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3.1450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $3.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is now holding the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3.012 swing low to the $3.285 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.150 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.20 level. The next resistance is $3.250. A clear move above the $3.250 resistance might send the price toward the $3.30 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.4250 resistance or even $3.450 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.50. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $3.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.120 level. The next major support is near the $3.00 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $3.00 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.880 support. The next major support sits near the $2.750 zone.

And if there’s one scenario where it’s likely to have a real impact – soon – it has to be the customer service industry. No matter if a customer is making a simple purchase inquiry or asking for something more complex, they have come to expect a timely and accurate response from the brands they’re dealing with. Simply put, customer service teams need to be able to deal with their customer’s problems and solve them amicably in the shortest time possible, and do it in a friendly way. That’s why agentic AI has such incredible potential in this industry, as it’s able to step up and handle many aspects of the customer contact center, automating outcomes and relieving the burden on overstretched human workers. Why Chatbots Don’t Cut It Most contact centers already use some form of AI. Chatbots, for instance, are incredibly common, designed to handle simple customer inquiries and direct users to the most appropriate resources, or reroute more complex requests to human agents. According to one study by IDC , 41% of organizations already use AI chatbots for customer service, while 60% have implemented the technology in their IT help desks. But these first-generation chatbots can only do so much, and they cannot replicate human interactions. And even though customers appreciate the speed and efficiency of chatbots, there are many situations where all they want is a human that understands them and is sympathetic to their needs. Until recently, AI simply wasn’t capable of doing this, but agentic AI sets a new bar in what automated systems are capable of, paving the way for the creation of more realistic “AI avatars” that look and sound just like humans. The time has come where AI agents can engage with customers in such a lifelike way that it’s becoming difficult to tell them apart from real humans. They can even display what appears to be genuine empathy, which is precisely what’s needed to ensure satisfactory outcomes for any customer with a problem. AI Avatars Drive Humanlike Interactions If you don’t believe that AI can possibly be that realistic, take a look at what Antix has been doing lately. An innovative Web3 company, Antix is the creator of the Avagen platform , which anyone can use to create an AI avatar for any kind of scenario they can possibly envision. Antix is not so much building AI avatars as “digital humans”, combining a powerful graphics engine with an array of advanced algorithms. It’s a powerful combination that enables the creation of ultra-lifelike digital humans that look and act just as real humans do, with the ability to show real emotions, be understanding and empathetic, and solve extremely complex problems. Antix’s avatars use AI to understand the context of their interactions with real people, so they respond just as a human would do to almost anything they’re told. So if someone is in tears after losing their prized concert ticket, its AI avatars will be able to recognize this and respond in a more sympathetic way. It’s a far cry from the stale, robotic responses of old-world chatbots. In addition, Antix employs the powerful Unreal Engine 5 graphics engine to ensure its AI avatars look incredibly realistic, which means they can even be deployed in video calls or on websites, creating even more lifelike experiences. Increasingly, fewer people are able to tell that they’re engaging with an AI agent rather than a real human, and that has significant implications for the customer service industry. A Complex Interplay Between AI and Humans While some fearmongers raise concerns about AI taking away jobs from humans, the reality is expected to be more nuanced, and in customer service what we’ll most likely see is AI avatars working alongside their human counterparts, handling the more mundane aspects of customer interactions. AI avatars will continue to assist with the more repetitive and time-consuming tasks in contact centers, such as handling the initial interactions with customers, answering common queries and managing simple transactions. The biggest difference is that it will be able to handle these tasks better than before, with more empathy and friendliness, increasing customer satisfaction. As AI avatars become more knowledgeable, they’ll get better at understanding their own limits and when they need to make the handover to a real human agent. They’ll use techniques such as sentiment and voice analysis to recognize when a customer is becoming angry, frustrated or upset, allowing them to bring in a human before dissatisfaction sets in. They’ll enable a smoother handover, too. Just as they can talk to customers, they’ll also be able to fill in their human colleagues by providing them with the case details and answering any follow-up questions the agent has, so he or she knows exactly what they’re dealing with and won’t need to trouble the caller by asking them to repeat everything. This will help to make customers feel as though they’ve been listened to and understood, and it will lead to quicker resolutions. While AI avatars will certainly take on greater responsibility in customer service, it will be humans that continue to have the final say in matters that require empathy, nuanced decision-making and ethical considerations. For example, a human agent can be authorized to offer customers a much higher discount than AI avatars are allowed to offer. Of course, they’ll also be called upon to come up with more creative solutions when necessary, and understand the unique circumstances of each customer. But even here, AI avatars will play a role, helping their human counterparts to think of these more creative solutions. AI has the ability to quickly look at and summarize all of the contextual data available, and consider other information about each customer, including their previous interactions and purchases. By considering all of this, AI can help humans to find the shortest path to a satisfactory resolution, making the experience better for everyone involved. A Better Experience For Customers AI avatars are coming to contact centers. It’s the beginning of a new era for customer service, where the boundaries between human and machine are increasingly blurred, and where they work much more collaboratively than before to achieve better outcomes than previously possible. This unique interplay will help to boost the efficiency of customer service operations, enhancing the overall experience. In the future, human agents and AI avatars will both become indispensable in helping companies to ensure their customers are not only satisfied, but perhaps even pleasantly surprised by how easy it was.",Information|Artificial Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-23 04:48:11

When asked if he thought the SEC would settle with Ripple soon, McBride responded on social media, stating that the case should either be dismissed or settled within the week. He explained that while there are nuances to both options, he believes a settlement is more likely than a dismissal. McBride shared his opinion that Ripple, as well as its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, deserve compensation, and that a settlement would provide a more detailed resolution than a simple dismissal. Within the week the case SHOULD either be dismissed or settled. I know there are nuances involved with each option, which is why I think it will be settled vs. dismissed.

There should also be some confidentiality with… — Sean McBride (@seanmcbride16) January 23, 2025 The former director went on to say that Ripple and its executives have “flipped the script” on the SEC, meaning they’ve turned the situation in their favor. He also speculated that if the case were dismissed, Ripple could countersue the SEC for damages. However, if the case is settled, he believes the details would likely be sorted out through private negotiations or “back channels,” possibly involving promises from the new administration. Legal Experts Weigh In Marc Fagel, a former SEC lawyer, reacted to McBride’s comments, explaining that a countersuit would likely not succeed, especially since the district court had already ruled that Ripple violated the law. He also pointed out that SEC settlements are always made public, so any “back-channel” resolution would be unlikely. Fagel concluded by saying that the case is not expected to be resolved within the week. Attorney Bill Morgan also opened up about a settlement and wrote, “A settlement would have to deal with Ripple’s cross-appeal. The important point is that Judge Torres’ finding that XRP is not a security is not under challenge no matter what happens.”",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-23 04:50:10

Pepe Loves Bezos (PEPEBEZO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBEZO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Bezos can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Bezos could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Bezos launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Bezos on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Bezos by entering its contract address – 5fminHHGkusginuqs4jjR2qivagMWWBStM2Hs21HVLcm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBEZO.

Bitwise Asset Management has registered an entity named “BITWISE DOGECOIN ETF” in Delaware, sparking speculation about an upcoming SEC filing. While not an official ETF application yet, this move could pave the way for Dogecoin to join the ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ETF space. Adding to the excitement, Dogecoin’s logo now appears on the newly established U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) website, created by executive order on January 20, 2025. This quick nod to the meme coin has further fueled investors’ interest in DOGE. What’s Brewing? Bitwise’s registration is a strategic step toward filing a Form S-1 with the SEC. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed the legitimacy of this move, estimating that a Dogecoin ETF could launch as early as April 2025 if approved. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, expressed surprise that no issuer had pursued a Dogecoin ETF sooner.

The resignation of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler has also sparked hopes for the approval of spot ETFs, including Dogecoin. Clearing DOGE at this moment will be crucial as Trump is already making the crypto crazy with his meme love and promises of laying crypto-friendly rules. With a new administration and retail adoptions in the future, the market will open for DOGE, though it all depends on SEC approval. DOGE Market Sentiment Following the news, Dogecoin’s price soared 4% to $0.373 before it settled around $0.36. Whale activity surged, with major holders accumulating 590 million DOGE tokens within 24 hours. These wallets now hold 47.7 billion DOGE—roughly 30% of the total supply. While this reflects bullish sentiment, the concentration of holdings raises concerns about potential volatility if whales decide to sell. Looking at the DOGE rise, Crypto analysts are buzzing with predictions. Trader Mikybull spotted a bullish flag pattern that could push DOGE to $2 if confirmed. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez has given a bold price target of $15 if a Dogecoin ETF gets an early SEC approval. #Dogecoin $DOGE ETF will send it to $15! https://t.co/4peKi93NZX pic.twitter.com/gRqDdoXhob — Ali (@ali_charts) January 22, 2025 DOGE is giving a bull vibe with the latest buzz of ETF coming sooner than expected it will be a huge buy opportunity for retail investors who are looking to divert their portfolio from big brands due to market fluctuations.

This came just after Trump’s inauguration and Ripple’s closed-door meeting held this month the factors are hinting something bigger is on the way. Many analysts are expecting many more ETFs will be hitting the market in the next 6 months. However, XRP and Solana are the top contenders for ETF approval after Bitcoin and ETH. Following the news, XRP faced $6.66 million in futures liquidations over the past 24 hours, with $3.92 million in longs and $2.73 million in shorts. Notably, the proposed offerings include standard and micro contracts for both cryptocurrencies. For Solana, the contracts are set at 500 SOL and 25 SOL, while XRP contracts will feature 50,000 XRP and 2,500 XRP options. These contracts are designed to benefit diverse investor needs, from large institutions to retail participants seeking smaller-scale exposure. Potential Ripple Effect on the Market The announcement fits well with rising optimism about the U.S. SEC’s approval of cryptocurrency ETFs, particularly following leadership changes that have created a more favorable regulatory environment. However, the lack of direct confirmation from the CME has led to cautious reactions. Past incidents, such as the false reports of a BlackRock-backed XRP ETF in 2023, have heightened the need for verified information in such announcements. Eleanor Terrett of Fox Business highlighted that CME’s move could lead to a wave of similar XRP and Solana Futures ETF products, reflecting the growing momentum in the crypto ETF sector. While Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas initially commented on the news, he later retracted his statements, emphasizing the need for concrete updates from CME.

With the successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs, BTC is already becoming Wall Street’s favorite. To accomplish a similar success for ETH, Buterin has reportedly invested in a startup that wants to market Ether as the best cryptocurrency for Wall Street. Vitalik Buterin Invests in An Ethereum-Promoting Startup Vivek Raman, who’s a former bond trader at Nomura Holdings and UBS Group AG, is founding Etherealize, which has received investments from Vitalik Buterin as well as the Ethereum Foundation. This new startup from Raman will market Ether (ETH) on Wall Street as one of the best cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported on January 23. Although dubbed as a BTC challenger, ETH has underperformed Bitcoin to a great extent. While the BTC price surged 160% surging past $100K levels last year, ETH has gained only 40% during the same period. Apart from just Bitcoin, Ether has also underperformed other top altcoins like Solana, XRP, etc. Source: Bloomberg To recover this gap, Vitalik Buterin and the Foundation are making a push with Etherealize, with an undisclosed investment amount. Raman revealed that he and his team of eight full-time employees have started operations this month in New York. Their focus is on promoting Ethereum to financial institutions and developing products designed to streamline the network’s usability for banks. “If there’s any time it’s going to work, it’s right now when all the headwinds that existed in the past are now suddenly tailwinds, from regulatory to technology to Ethereum being ready to have institutional presence”. Addressing the Recent Criticism for Ether Ethereum is reportedly losing competition to competitors like Solana and other layer-1 blockchains. It has been the go-to choice for meme coin launches last year. Furthermore, Solana has received greater recognition after the Trump family launched their TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins on the blockchain. The Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin have come under fire from users for not capitalizing more swiftly on the network’s first-mover advantage. In response to the criticism, Buterin addressed the concerns on X last week, pledging “significant changes” to the foundation’s structure and objective. Raman emphasized the need for stronger advocacy for Ethereum and aims to be a prominent voice for the network on Wall Street. An early priority will be tokenization —the process of transforming traditional financial products into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain. He added: Financial institutions “want safety, they want security, they want reliability, they want a track record. And the only blockchain that stood the test of time and has 10 years of operating history and some regulatory clarity is Ethereum.” Will Ether ETFs Help in Recovery? The launch of the Bitcoin ETFs in the US, last year in January 2024, provided a great institutional boost to the asset class. Also, with corporate players like MicroStrategy accumulating Bitcoins over the past four years, BTC has gained further global recognition. Moreover, with a greater focus on building US Bitcoin reserves, ETH has taken a backseat for investors as of now. Unlike Bitcoin ETFs, the launch of Ether ETFs in July 2024, didn’t catch up fast. However, after Donald Trump’s victory in November 2024, inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have picked up once again. Currently, the net inflows across all Ether ETFs since inception stand at $2.725 billion. If the efforts from Etherealize materialize further, we can see strong demand for ETH moving ahead in 2025. However, the ETH price also needs to catch for this. While consolidating at around $3,300 levels, ETH is seeing strong whale accumulation that sets the ETH price target of $4,000.

On Jan. 21, the crypto asset saw a 3.78% jump, but its price movement has since consolidated within this range over the last 24 hours. With no clear directional momentum on the lower time frame (LTF), one analyst predicts that this sideways trend could persist for the rest of the month. Will quantitative easing spark Bitcoin’s next rally? Krillin, a professional crypto trader, suggested that Bitcoin might continue its consolidation until after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Jan. 28–29. He stated, “Assuming no BoJ scam, we likely chop between 100k and 110k till FOMC end of month.” The analyst also hinted at a potential dip, given that interest rate cuts are not expected during the meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there is a 99.5% likelihood that interest rates will remain unchanged at 4.25%–4.5%. However, dovish comments or hints at quantitative easing (QE) could drive risk assets higher. As of Jan. 22, U.S. national debt reached $36.21 trillion, surpassing the $36.1 trillion ceiling. Congress may raise the debt limit again, as it has done 78 times since 1960. If QE becomes a reality, the Federal Reserve may inject liquidity into the market through large-scale asset purchases, a scenario that would likely benefit Bitcoin. Tracking a reversal in the Fed’s balance sheet, which has declined from $9 trillion in April 2022 to $6.8 trillion as of Jan. 15, could provide further insight. Bitcoin’s capital inflows have slowed While the market anticipated aggressive bullish momentum after Bitcoin surpassed $100,000, data from Glassnode shows a decline in capital inflows. BTC’s realized cap net position change fell from 12.5% to under 5% since November 2024. Glassnode reported, “Net realized profit-taking peaked at $4.5B in Dec 2024, and is now down to $316.7M (-93%). This reduction in sell-side pressure suggests the market is resetting to a state of supply-demand balance.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-23 05:27:22

While most altcoins are stagnating, this price action closely mirrors previous cycles where altcoins exploded following a decline in Bitcoin dominance around late January and early to mid-February. In time for the next major pump, three altcoins appear primed to deliver sizable returns, including Pepe, Cardano, and Near Protocol. However, due to market cap constraints, these cryptocurrencies are unlikely to net the parabolic profits most market players are seeking. Within the DeFi sector, Elluminex presents a far more lucrative option during the presale. Read on to learn more about this Toncoin-based asset. Bearish Factors Hamper Pepe In The Short-Term The launch of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins has stolen much of the spotlight in the meme coin market, drawing significant liquidity and attention away from Pepe. Combined with ongoing whale sell-offs, this shift has contributed to Pepe’s struggles in 2025. However, recent listings on tier-1 exchanges such as Coinbase and Robinhood signal optimism for Pepe’s future, offering increased accessibility and visibility for new market players in the USA, affirming Pepe’s potential to remain a top 5 meme coin by the end of this cycle. Despite being overshadowed by the hype surrounding newer meme coins such as TRUMP, Pepe remains a contender for recovery thanks to its dedicated community and history of explosive price movements even during bearish slumps. While replicating its 2024 performance may prove challenging due to market cap limitations, the anticipated altcoin season could reignite interest in Pepe, especially as meme mania hits the market once again. Bullish Developments Weigh In Cardano’s Favour Despite Wider Market Slump For Altcoins Cardano is gearing up to become a top 3 layer-1 cryptocurrency, driven by advancements like the Midnight ZK scaling project and its planned integration as a Bitcoin layer-2. Additionally, its inclusion in CoinMarketCap’s “Made in America” digital assets list under the pro-crypto Trump administration has heightened its visibility. With over $100 million in ADA accumulated by whales since January 19, confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential continues to build as anticipation grows for the next major altcoin rally. Speculation surrounding Charles Hoskinson’s role as an advisor to the Trump administration on crypto policies adds further momentum to Cardano, with the potential for favorable regulations and Cardano ETFs gaining traction under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins. These developments, coupled with Cardano’s strong fundamentals and increasing adoption, position Cardano as a leading layer-1 blockchain ready to capitalize on the 2025 bull market. Sleeper Pick Near Protocol Set To Wake Up Imminently Near Protocol has surged 4% this week as a large proportion of cryptocurrencies stagnate, following Deutsche Telekom’s announcement as a Near Protocol network validator. This partnership boosts Near Protocol’s credibility and institutional adoption, aligning with Near Protocol’s mission to deliver scalable blockchain solutions for developers and decentralized AI innovations. Backed by Deutsche Telekom and collaborations like Zero1 Labs, Near Protocol is solidifying its role as a leading blockchain platform with strong momentum heading into the next market cycle. With rising investor interest and increased trading volume, Near Protocol is positioned for continued growth as the bull run progresses and altcoins have their time in the limelight, though Elluminex presents a far more enticing opportunity during its burgeoning presale phase. Discover How Elluminex Is Redefining DeFi On Toncoin Elluminex is redefining the DeFi landscape by building an all-in-one platform on the TON blockchain. Designed to streamline decentralized finance, Elluminex integrates features like staking and an AI-powered portfolio tracker, offering users an intuitive and comprehensive solution on Toncoin, a blockchain with untapped potential compared to layer-1 giants like Cardano and Solana. The platform’s anticipated cross-chain bridge is a key innovation, which will facilitate effortless transfers of assets across various blockchains to enhance liquidity and expand trading possibilities. Coupled with its decentralized exchange, Elluminex ensures efficient transactions with low slippage and robust liquidity, allowing users to retain full control of their assets. Elluminex will also commit to educating its community through a DeFi academy besides being an all-in-one utility hub. Whether it’s learning how to store cryptocurrency securely in cold storage vs hot wallets, understanding tax obligations in certain jurisdictions, or crafting effective profit-taking strategies, the academy equips users with the tools they need to thrive in the evolving blockchain and DeFi space. The ELX token is central to the platform, driving its ecosystem while offering staking rewards of up to 18% APY. This tokenomics structure promotes liquidity and fosters long-term growth, positioning Elluminex as a promising contender in the decentralized finance sector bound for sustainable long-term growth For more information about Elluminex (ELX) visit the links below: Website: https://elluminex.com/ Twitter/X: https://x.com/elluminex Telegram: https://t.me/Elluminex Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Currently in its presale, RTX, the native utility token of Remittix, is set to revolutionize the global remittance market and pump hard in this bull season. As such, token holders are selling their bags to invest in this new token. Solana’s Media Frenzy Ends with Trump’s Inauguration Solana’s price rose to $280 just before the U.S President’s inauguration, however its price faltered after the launch of the $TRUMP hitting a price resistance level around the $240 mark. As of this press, SOL is trading at $253, a 7% rise in the past day, representing a 33% increase in the past 7 days. However, data from TradingView suggests strong buying signals, potentially delivering high returns. Other indicators suggest a potential rebound fueled by robust ecosystem growth and institutional interest. However, Solana’s investors are currently seeking better alternatives that could give multiple yields. SHIB’s Investors May Look Elsewhere Despite Positive Outlook Meanwhile, Shiba Inu recorded a 613% burn rate today January 22, according to data from Shibburn. This massive burn rate upside came after 3.24 million tokens were sent to a null address, permanently diminishing the token in supply. This burn rate has a positive effect on Shib’s price as the token is seeing a 1.4% rise in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $0.00002048. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001983 and $0.00002127, respectively. This minimal rise price of Shib was a result of positive market sentiment and general recovery of the crypto market. Along with Shiba Inu, DOGE, PEPE, and TRUMP also witnessed significant upside moves. A pseudonymous crypto analyst VipRoseTr forecasted Shiba Inu’s price on X, noting that a $0.00004029 price target is ahead for the asset. However, this depends on the general market trend, making investors put eyes on a new token. Dogecoin Could Drop to $0.20 Support Level With Bitcoin rebounding to the $105, 000 mark, Dogecoin’s price followed suit, recording 5.4% upswing in the last 24 hours. Currently trading at $0.3646, its market cap stands at $53.81 billion with a trading volume of $8.02 billion in the past day. Now as Dogecoin’s price is above the $0.35 psychological mark, a more bullish outlook is now expected. Dogecoin’s daily technical indicators reveal that the price trend over the past few weeks has maintained a sideways shift between $0.30 and $0.40. For a bullish move, the Fibonacci levels point to a price target at the 50% level of $0.4973. However DOGE’s crucial support is at $0.20 if the price drops. Meanwhile, the proposed Dogecoin ETF has added to its positive market sentiment. But how these would improve its price remains sketchy, leaving investors with no choice than to seek RTX as an alternative. Investors’ Rush to RTX as the Most Viable Crypto Coin Remittix (RTX) presents an altcoin ready to transform world payments as big blockchain networks like Ethereum and Cardano experience difficulties. Offering a quick solution for international money transfers, Remittix connects blockchain technology and conventional banking with its creative PayFi (Payment Finance) concept. Users of this innovative method can send $500 overseas in cryptocurrencies and the identical amount will be received by the recipient straight into their fiat bank account. There are no hidden costs, no trouble with currencies and no technical crypto expertise needed. Remittix appeals for its special characteristics meant to streamline international transfers. It offers flawless worldwide transfers to any bank account, therefore removing the typical complication of cross-border payments. Using a clear flat-rate pricing system free of hidden fees, the platform is also quite reasonably priced. Priority is speed and security; near-instant settlements underpinned by blockchain dependability and traceability. Remittix is perfect for enterprises negotiating the expanding crypto scene since it provides flexibility through APIs allowing taking bitcoin payments while settling in FIAT. Remittix also brings RTX, its native token, valued at $0.0272 in its ongoing presale, which has raised over $5.2 million. With only 1.5 billion coins on hand, RTX has drawn the interest of investors. Its value may rise dramatically by 2025 providing up to 100x profits, according to experts’ analysis. Along with the platform’s value, RTX’s great growth potential makes it a significant rival to more established tokens in the cross-border payment market. Worth about $190 trillion, the worldwide banking sector is ready for change and Remittix is positioned as a leader in this process. Now is a great time to participate in its presale as early investors could see an 800% rise in their holdings even before launch.

This market optimism comes from a favorable shift in regulations under Donald Trump’s administration, which is actively reducing crypto restrictions. Trump’s pro-crypto stance, along with key figures like Paul Atkins supporting innovation, is boosting XRP’s potential for greater adoption. But can it reach $15 during this cycle? Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could emerge as a potential solution for Bitcoin’s scalability and transaction speed issues. Here’s all you need to know. Can XRP Hit $15 in 2025 as Trump’s Deregulation Boosts Market Confidence? As of January 21, 2025, XRP trades at $3.10, reflecting a 6% rise over the past 24 hours. In the last week, the cryptocurrency has surged by 19.6%, while its year-on-year increase stands at an impressive 459%. The 24-hour trading volume has reached $14.92 billion, showcasing strong activity in the market. X RP’s market cap currently sits at $178.44 billion, supported by a circulating supply of 57.56 billion tokens. With a total supply nearing 100 billion tokens, the fully diluted valuation (FDV) is estimated at $309.94 billion. This results in a market cap to FDV ratio of 0.58, suggesting a significant amount of the total supply is already circulating. XRP’s highest price to date was $3.40, recorded on January 7, 2018, which places the current price just 8.8% below that peak. Conversely, its lowest recorded value was $0.002686 on May 22, 2014, so it’s had extraordinary growth over the years. Currently, the RSI is at 48, which means XRP is in the neutral zone. The crypto market is undergoing some big changes with Donald Trump’s return to the presidency, especially for Ripple’s XRP. Back in December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, claiming XRP was sold illegally as an unregistered security. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges, though sales to institutional investors were deemed unregistered securities transactions. Trump’s administration has taken a pro-crypto stance and aims to reduce regulations and encourage innovation. With figures like Paul Atkins, known for supporting crypto, leading regulatory efforts, the environment for digital assets like XRP looks more favorable. This shift could help boost adoption and further integrate cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. CryptoBall , an analyst on X, forecasts that XRP could climb to $13 in the near future and exceed $20 during the current bull cycle. His prediction relies on Elliott Wave Theory, which points to substantial price increases following a breakout. Meanwhile, XBT Liquidators projects XRP reaching a price range of $27-$30 and base their analysis on high time frame Gann fans, which suggest cyclical movements between key support and resistance levels. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Give Bitcoin a Big Upgrade with Speed, Affordability, and EVM Compatibility Bitcoin often struggles with slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could offer a potential solution. This innovative Layer-2 network could operate alongside Bitcoin’s blockchain and reduce congestion, cut costs, and enhance scalability. Bitcoin’s 10-minute block times have long been a drawback compared to faster chains like Ethereum and Solana. PlutoChain offers block times of just 2 seconds, using its Layer-2 technology. This rapid pace could allow seamless execution of smart contracts, DeFi operations, and other advanced blockchain applications. With Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility , developers could easily migrate Ethereum-based projects to Bitcoin’s secure infrastructure. This could boost Bitcoin’s versatility and create new real-world use cases. PlutoChain’s testnet processes 43,200 transactions daily without delays, which means it’s ready for real-world use. Security is a top priority. The platform has successfully passed audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . It also performs regular code reviews and stress tests to ensure safety and reliability for users. PlutoChain’s commitment to community is equally impressive. Its decentralized governance model allows users to vote on critical proposals, upgrades, and partnerships. Final Thoughts Whether XRP will reach $15 depends on continued regulatory support and widespread adoption, especially with Trump’s deregulation efforts. Market conditions, along with further positive rulings for Ripple, will play a key role in determining XRP’s trajectory. On the other hand, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might offer a game-changing solution for Bitcoin’s scalability issues. With its Layer-2 technology and EVM compatibility, PlutoChain could position Bitcoin as a faster, more scalable, and developer-friendly platform. ———— Please remember that this article is purely informational and not financial advice.

Currently, Ripple (XRP) trades near $3.16, after a +20.86% this week and +36.75% this month. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) sits around $0.025, having risen +75% from an initial $0.018 during its presale. Below, we examine why many XRP holders investing are now looking closely at Remittix as a potential game-changer. Why Ripple Gains Investor Trust A key reason Ripple commands loyalty is its global reach in cross-border payment innovation. Over the past month, Ripple (XRP) saw +36.75% growth thanks to fresh partnerships. Priced around $3.16, it remains a top-tier choice for large institutions. Many still rank it as the next big crypto project, highlighting Ripple’s work with banks to lower transaction costs. But concerns about regulations hangover Ripple, prompting XRP holders to invest with caution. While some believe it could jump another +50% if legal hurdles clear, others see younger tokens like Remittix creeping up. If Ripple (XRP) can’t deliver new features soon, some fear it may lose ground to rivals solving everyday problems directly. Remittix Emerges as a Challenger Unlike older coins, Remittix focuses on practical remittances for individuals. Remittix (RTX) started at $0.015 and soared to $0.0272, marking a +80% jump during its presale. This rapid rise suggests it’s on track to become the next big crypto project for people seeking lower fees and quick transfers. By letting users convert crypto into fiat within 24 hours, Remittix aims to disrupt the remittance industry. While Ripple collaborates with major banks, Remittix speaks directly to freelancers, migrants, and small businesses looking for real-world solutions. Backers say Remittix (RTX) fees can be 50% cheaper than standard bank transfers. These benefits could fuel mass adoption, pushing Remittix to outshine Ripple if everyday users prefer simple, budget-friendly crypto transfers. Comparing Their Futures Both Ripple and Remittix have strong roadmaps, but each targets a different audience. Ripple (XRP) focuses on institutions that can drive volume, while Remittix (RTX) aims at everyday people who need faster, cheaper payments. Some experts predict Ripple might see another +40% climb if more banks adopt its network. However, analysts also believe Remittix could jump again from $0.0272 to $0.0282 if user adoption continues at the current pace. Because it tackles high fees and long waits directly, many call Remittix the next big crypto project for mainstream adoption. If users prefer easy, no-frills options, Remittix could eventually surpass Ripple in market appeal. Conclusion While Ripple enjoys strong partnerships and a proven record, Remittix focuses on real-world usability that could power bigger gains. With Ripple (XRP) climbing +36.75% in a month and Remittix (RTX) up +66% from its starting price, both offer major upside. Yet for those who see convenience, affordability, and speed as the future of crypto, Remittix may well be the better bet. As the competition heats up, only time will tell which project truly transforms global payment systems. Ready to explore Remittix further?

Positioned perfectly to cash in on this growth is Remittix (RTX), a promising new PayFi project that is currently gaining significant traction during its presale. Having just surpassed the $5.3 million mark, Remittix is transforming the way we view cross-border payments by blending together blockchain technology with the dependability of traditional finance. So what sets Remittix apart from its competitors and why are investors so hyped up about it? Remittix Disrupts The Global Payments Status Quo Traditional international payment systems are simply riddled with inefficiencies and Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi space with the promise of addressing these challenges. The platform enables the straightforward conversion of more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat, while facilitating transfers to bank accounts worldwide. Transactions are typically completed within 24 hours and this speed provides a practical solution for users who depend on fast access to funds, particularly those operating in global markets or frequently transferring money across borders. For businesses, Remittix offers powerful tools like the Remittix Pay API, which integrates seamlessly into existing payment systems, allowing cryptocurrency payments to flow smoothly into fiat settlements. Additionally, companies can access merchant accounts that support over 50 cryptocurrency pairs and 40 fiat currencies, offering flexibility for managing cross-border operations. Remittix (RTX) is also bridging the gap for individuals and businesses in regions where traditional financial services are limited. By providing access to global payment systems around the clock, the platform supports those who might otherwise encounter barriers to participating in the international economy. Low fees and efficient processing times further enhance its appeal, especially for users in underserved areas. Another key draw is Remittix’s (RTX) approach to privacy. In a world where crypto payments are stigmatized in some cultures and social circles, Remittix ensures that its users can still benefit from crypto payments without concern. It achieves this by giving no visual indicator that payments received have originated from cryptocurrency, instead listing them as regular bank transfers. Investors Race To Snap Up RTX Tokens The RTX token is central to the Remittix ecosystem, serving essential functions such as governance and staking. As the presale progresses, Remittix (RTX) has already raised over $5.3 million in investments with tokens currently available to early adopters for just $0.0282. By the end of the presale, experts anticipate an 800% increase in value with even greater gains likely as the project scales post-launch. As Remittix begins to tap into the cross-border payments industry, it is poised to disrupt the PayFi space in 2025.

The meme coin market has firmly established itself in the crypto ecosystem and is starting 2025 with renewed energy as the sector’s market cap once hovers around $119 billion. However, finding the next meme coin with massive growth potential remains a challenge for most investors, as only a small percentage of tokens deliver the exponential returns that crypto enthusiasts seek. This is where Meme Index changes the game as the first-ever meme coin index platform. By providing Dynamic Indexes and Curated Meme Coin Baskets, it allows investors to spread risk while maximizing growth potential. Its native token, $MEMEX, acts as the key to accessing these indexes, catering to risk preferences ranging from moderate to high volatility. https://twitter.com/memecoin_index/status/1881360287066185795 What makes $MEMEX unique is its adaptability. Token holders can customize their portfolios by modifying assets in each index and choosing from both established and emerging tokens. Priced at $0.0154693, $MEMEX offers an attractive entry point for early adopters. With the next price increase set to occur in less than two days, now is the perfect time to secure your position. Meme Index: A Safer Way to Invest in Meme Coins The meme coin market has become a defining feature of the cryptocurrency landscape, attracting investors with its mix of humor, community engagement, and rapid growth potential. Established tokens like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) have paved the way for meme coins to gain legitimacy, boasting market caps of $53 billion and $12 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, newer players such as Pepe ($PEPE) and Bonk ($BONK) are climbing the ranks. Even niche tokens like Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) and Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) are finding their audiences. However, investing in meme coins is notoriously risky. While a handful of tokens achieve astronomical gains, many fail to gain traction or deliver meaningful returns. Recent events in the meme coin market underscore the importance of diversification, particularly with tokens like $TRUMP experiencing significant price dumps. Investors who bought $TRUMP at its all-time high are currently down by nearly 50%. However, with Meme Index, investors could have allocated funds to one of the indexes instead of buying $TRUMP to mitigate losses or maintain a more diversified and balanced portfolio. Meme Index’s structure ensures that the failure of one token does not derail the performance of the entire index, offering a more resilient investment strategy in the unpredictable world of meme coins. Tailored Indexes for Every Investor Meme Index provides four indexes designed to align with investors’ risk tolerance and strategies: Meme Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Meme Frenzy. The Meme Titan Index, regarded as the “blue-chip” index, includes top meme tokens like $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE. While these higher-cap tokens exhibit slower growth, they still hold strong upside potential. The Moonshot Index targets high-growth tokens with market caps under $1 billion, offering greater return potential at a higher risk. The Midcap Index shifts to tokens with market caps between $50 million and $250 million, presenting opportunities for 4x to 20x gains if they reach the $1 billion threshold. Finally, the Meme Frenzy Index appeals to risk-takers, featuring highly volatile, unconventional tokens. While not every token may succeed, the collective performance of the index mitigates individual risks, and one standout performer can drive significant gains. As a $ MEMEX holder, you gain access to these indexes and can participate in community governance. Token holders can vote on which assets are included or removed, keeping the indexes dynamic and aligned with market trends. For instance, if the community decides that $PEPE, which has declined 2.56% in the past week, no longer belongs in the Meme Titan Index, they could replace it with a more promising token like Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) or Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN). This unique functionality has earned Meme Index high praise from crypto influencers, including Austin Hilton, who shared a glowing review with his 301,000 followers. Earn Up to 856% APY by Staking $MEMEX To join the Meme Index presale, visit the official website and connect your wallet (such as Best Wallet). $MEMEX tokens can be purchased using USDT, ETH, BNB, or a bank card. After acquiring tokens, holders can stake them and enjoy a Supercharged APY of 856%. At this rate, investments could double within 31 days, provided the APY remains consistent. Meme Index has also undergone rigorous audits by trusted firms Coinsult and SolidProof , ensuring the platform’s smart contracts are secure and reliable.

After serving nearly 12 years behind bars, Ulbricht was granted a commutation by former US President Donald Trump, sparking renewed interest in his story. The documentary, expected to be released in 2025, promises to provide insights into Ulbricht's journey from an Eagle Scout to a controversial figure in the world of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the crypto community, including industry players like Kraken, has rallied in support of Ulbricht, offering both financial assistance and public endorsements as he begins to rebuild his life post-incarceration. Kraken’s $111,111 Bitcoin Donation to Ross Ulbricht Marks a Milestone in Crypto and Justice Narratives The cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has revealed its donation of $111,111 in Bitcoin (BTC) to Ross Ulbricht , the founder of Silk Road, who was recently freed following a pardon by former US President Donald Trump. The donation, disclosed on social media platform X, was sent to the address listed on freeross.org, a site claiming to represent Ulbricht’s official online presence. The funds are aimed at helping Ulbricht re-establish his life after spending over a decade in prison. The Silk Road founder had been incarcerated since 2013 and was handed a harsh double life sentence plus 40 years without parole for nonviolent offenses related to running the darknet marketplace. Kraken’s contribution comes as part of a broader outpouring of support from the crypto community. According to Bitcoin blockchain explorer Mempool, 93 donations totaling 2.5 BTC—approximately $261,000—have already been made to the address listed on freeross.org. Kraken’s $111,111 donation carries a symbolic significance, reflecting a gesture of solidarity from a platform that has long championed the ideals of financial freedom and decentralization. This move highlights the deep connection between the crypto community and libertarian values, as well as its enduring support for figures like Ulbricht, who are seen as early builders of the digital asset ecosystem. Ross Ulbricht’s release was made possible by a full and unconditional pardon granted by Donald Trump, who fulfilled a campaign promise that resonated deeply with libertarians and crypto enthusiasts. Ulbricht’s sentence, widely criticized as excessive, became a rallying point for advocates of criminal justice reform and cryptocurrency adoption. Trump , who signed the pardon during his second day in office, described Ulbricht’s punishment as “ridiculous.” Ulbricht’s incarceration had spanned 12 years, beginning with his arrest in October 2013. His release has reignited discussions about the intersection of crypto, justice, and the regulatory landscape that continues to evolve alongside digital assets. The pardon has also sparked renewed interest in Bitcoin wallets reportedly associated with Ulbricht. Conor Grogan, an executive at Coinbase, shared that wallets left behind by Ulbricht and not seized by the US government could hold Bitcoin valued at $47 million as of January 2025. While these wallets were considered “dust” at the time of Ulbricht’s arrest due to Bitcoin’s lower valuation, they have appreciated significantly over the years. Grogan speculated on X about whether Ulbricht retains access to the keys required to unlock these funds, stating, “We will know soon enough.” The potential movement of these assets could further add to the intrigue surrounding Ulbricht’s story. The Silk Road Legacy: A Double-Edged Sword Ulbricht’s release and the subsequent crypto community support have reignited debates about the legacy of Silk Road. The darknet marketplace, often described as the ”eBay of drugs,” was both a trailblazer in using Bitcoin for transactions and a controversial symbol of the illicit uses of cryptocurrency. While critics argue that Ulbricht facilitated illegal activities, his supporters view him as a scapegoat punished for pioneering decentralized technologies. Some members of the crypto community see his story as emblematic of the challenges early adopters faced in bringing blockchain technology into the mainstream. The crypto community’s reaction to Ulbricht’s pardon has been overwhelmingly positive. Many see it as evidence of Trump’s willingness to honor commitments to the libertarian and crypto communities. Speculation is rife about what this could mean for future digital asset policies, including potential executive orders related to Bitcoin, such as establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Kraken’s donation also signals a growing trend among crypto firms to engage in philanthropic efforts that align with the industry’s values. Beyond financial assistance, the donation is a statement about the role of cryptocurrency in challenging traditional power structures and advocating for justice. As Ross Ulbricht steps into a world transformed by the cryptocurrency revolution he helped spark, the challenges and opportunities ahead are immense. With significant financial support from the crypto community and the potential to access dormant Bitcoin wallets, Ulbricht may have the means to rebuild his life. Documentary Featuring Ross Ulbricht to Shed Light on Silk Road Saga In related news, Ulbricht is set to take center stage in a new documentary that promises to explore his arrest, incarceration, and the events leading up to his release. Filmmakers Blake J. Harris and Jonah Tulis, best known for their work on the Console Wars documentary, have revealed that they secured over 60 hours of exclusive footage, including interviews with Ulbricht conducted during his time in federal prison. This announcement comes in the wake of a pivotal moment in Ulbricht’s life: his release from custody following the commutation of his life sentence by US President Trump on Jan. 21, 2025. The yet-to-be-titled documentary, currently in post-production and slated for release in 2025, aims to dive into the life of Ross Ulbricht and the extraordinary story of how he went from being an Eagle Scout to becoming the target of an international manhunt. Blake J. Harris described the documentary as a comprehensive exploration of Ulbricht’s life, from his early years to his role as the mastermind behind Silk Road. Jonah Tulis added that the project seeks to dispel many of the myths and misconceptions surrounding Ulbricht, who operated under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts.” The filmmakers have hinted that the documentary will provide unprecedented access to Ulbricht’s thoughts, experiences, and reflections during his incarceration. It also aims to examine the broader implications of the Silk Road case for the cryptocurrency industry, law enforcement, and the evolving debate over internet freedoms. Ross Ulbricht launched Silk Road in 2011, a darknet marketplace that quickly became notorious for facilitating the trade of illicit goods, including drugs. The platform operated using Bitcoin, a revolutionary use of cryptocurrency at the time. Ulbricht’s arrest in 2013 at a San Francisco Public Library marked the end of the Silk Road. He was convicted on charges of money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics, ultimately receiving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The severity of his punishment sparked widespread debate. While some viewed Ulbricht as a criminal who profited from illegal activities, others saw him as a visionary persecuted for his pioneering use of blockchain technology. His case became a rallying cry for libertarians and cryptocurrency enthusiasts advocating for reduced government overreach and criminal justice reform. President Trump’s commutation of Ulbricht’s sentence has reignited these debates, with many in the crypto community celebrating the decision as a step toward justice. The forthcoming documentary is not the first attempt to tell Ulbricht’s story. CBS aired a documentary in 2020, featuring interviews with Ulbricht’s former girlfriend and FBI agents involved in the Silk Road investigation. In 2021, Lionsgate released a dramatized version of the story starring Nick Robinson. The Coen Brothers had also proposed a project based on Ulbricht’s life in 2016, though the film was never produced. The new documentary, however, stands apart by incorporating Ulbricht’s own voice, providing a perspective largely absent from earlier portrayals. Life After Prison: What’s Next for Ulbricht? Since his release from the US Penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona, Ulbricht has maintained a low profile. Photos of him outside prison have circulated on social media, but he has not issued a public statement or resumed posting on his blog, which he regularly updated while incarcerated. It remains unclear whether Ulbricht intends to step into the public spotlight or play an active role in the cryptocurrency industry. His case and release, however, continue to generate significant attention, with some speculating that he could use his platform to advocate for criminal justice reform or blockchain innovation. Ulbricht’s story contrasts sharply with other industry leaders who have faced legal troubles. For instance, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently completed a four-month prison sentence but returned to public life. Whether Ulbricht follows a similar path or opts for a more private existence remains to be seen. Ross Ulbricht’s release and the upcoming documentary show the enduring fascination with the Silk Road saga. While some view him as a criminal mastermind, others consider him a martyr for internet freedom and cryptocurrency adoption. The documentary by Harris and Tulis is expected to offer a nuanced perspective on the events that shaped Ulbricht’s life and legacy, providing an opportunity to reassess the impact of Silk Road on the world of cryptocurrency and beyond. As the crypto community continues to grapple with the implications of Ulbricht’s actions and his release, the documentary may serve as a critical lens through which to examine the intersection of technology, freedom, and justice in the digital age.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-23 06:00:00

Pudgy Penguins Eyes Reversal Amid Market Bullish Hopes Pudgy Penguins, trading in the $0.05 to $0.08 range, is eyeing a breakout. With its nearest resistance at $0.10, a push past this level could lead to an uptrend. The coin’s support at $0.04 suggests some cushion against further decline. Although PENGU experienced drops of over 21% in a week and above 51% for the month, indicators show potential. The RSI is below 55, hinting at a possible upward move. Stochastic levels support bullish sentiment. If it breaks the $0.10 resistance, the next target is $0.12, a possible 50% increase from current levels. The bears might be on pause, with holders hoping for an altcoin season lift. Brett (Based): Set for a Turnaround in the Crypto Bull Run? Brett (Based) is currently priced between $0.0768 and $0.1227, showing recent declines. Its 1-week and 1-month price changes are down by nearly 21% and 28%, respectively. Despite this pullback, Brett has the potential to climb. The nearest resistance is at $0.1523, offering room for growth if it can break past this point. With a Relative Strength Index of 43.23, it suggests a possible bounce back. However, momentum remains weak with a MACD level under zero. If Brett rallies past $0.1523, it could aim for the $0.1982 mark, offering around a 50% rise from the upper current price range. Conclusion While PENGU and BRETT show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility—governance, rewards for loyalty, and passive staking—it unites crypto enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains.

Here’s what this could mean for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Realized Cap Continues To Grow, Albeit At A Slower Rate According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, capital inflows into BTC have been on the decline recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Realized Cap,” which is a capitalization model for Bitcoin that calculates its total valuation by assuming that the ‘real’ value of any token in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. The last transaction for any token can be considered to be the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at its time would denote its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap takes the total sum of the cost basis of the entire BTC supply in circulation. Related Reading: Arbitrum (ARB) Primed For 46% Rally If This Happens, Analyst Reveals This value is nothing, but the total amount of capital that the investors as a whole have used to purchase the cryptocurrency. Changes in the indicator, therefore, reflect the capital flowing into or out of the asset. Below is the chart for the Realized Cap shared by the analytics firm, which shows the trend in its daily value, as well as its 30-day percentage change, over the last couple of years. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap observed some sharp growth during the last couple of months of 2024, implying capital was flowing at a rapid rate into the cryptocurrency. This is more easily visible through the monthly percentage change, which shot up to a very high positive level. These inflows appear to have provided the fuel for BTC’s rally above $100,000. From the chart, it’s apparent that after hitting a peak, the 30-day change in the Realized Cap reversed its direction and started going down in a sharp manner instead. This decline in the metric has continued into 2025. Despite the drawdown, though, its value is still quite positive, suggesting the Realized Cap continues to grow at a notable rate. A similar trend was also witnessed back in the first few months of 2024, where a high in capital inflows was followed by a cooldown, which led into a lengthy consolidation period for Bitcoin. So far, capital is still flowing into BTC at a rate of $38.6 billion per month, which is significantly higher than the lows observed during last year’s sideways phase. It now remains to be seen whether the inflows will continue to decline in the coming days, or if a reversal would happen, potentially acting as a bullish signal for the asset.

AI16z is leading the charge among large caps, soaring 35% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, newly launched AI agent MIND Of Pepe is showing incredible demand in its ICO, raising $3 million in its first week. Trump’s ‘Crypto Task Force,’ OpenAI’s Stargate Project, Skyrocket AI Coin Prices The AI agent sector has risen in value by 14.2% in the past 24 hours, fueled by actions taken by some of the most influential players on the world stage. Starting with Donald Trump, not 48 hours after his inauguration to become the US’ first-ever pro-crypto president, he is already living upto expectations. Trump has just promised a “crypto task force” which will provide the industry with a clear regulatory framework. Regulatory uncertainty has been a big barrier to adoption in the crypto industry, especially among institutional players who must retain strict compliance. The addition of clearer regulations does nothing but provide a frictionless onboarding process for professional investment firms. Moving to AI news, ChatGPT creator OpenAI has unveiled a new mega-project called ‘Stargate Project,’ which will invest a staggering $500 billion into AI infrastructure over the next four years. It also reveals that Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Oracle are the key initial technology partners, showing the mass scale of this new venture. Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle Corporation, says that it will “construct the largest computer ever built, which will enable AI to create cancer vaccines, personalized medicine, and pandemic prevention.” Not only is the crypto sector in an advantageous position right now, with Donald Trump taking positive efforts toward advancing the industry, but AI technology continues to see unprecedented efforts in its development. At the intersection of crypto and AI are AI agents, such as ai16z – and they’re seeing significant success. Analyst Says Ai16z Bottom Is In, Run to ATH Is Next Ai16z is forming what appears to be a definite bottom on its price chart, showing strong momentum around its previous high set in December 2024. Currently, ai16z is trading at $1.21, up 35% today, down 11% this week and up 106% this month. It holds a $1.33 billion market cap and a $355 million 24-hour trading volume. Analyst Cryptoknight890 highlighted the recent bounce from $0.96 and suspects that this will precede a run toward the current ATH in the coming days. But as ai16z shows strength, a low cap presale meme coin called MIND Of Pepe is tipped for significant gains of upto 100x. New AI Agent MIND Of Pepe Can Spot Market Trends and Launch Tokens MIND Of Pepe is a multi-purpose AI agent which operates its own X account and crypto wallet. The agent will use X to gather data, shape narratives, and build an audience. It will then leverage this to share patterns and trends with its token-gated community and will also launch its own tokens. $MIND holders will get insider access to the token launches before anyone else, but then the agent will share them on social media afterwards to bolster their growth potential. Another benefit to the $MIND token is that it can be staked. Staking is live amidst the presale and currently provides a 707% APY, but this will decrease over time. Besides the MIND Of Pepe agent having multiple use cases, the thing that separates it from other agentic projects is its innate token utility. This provides a steady demand stream that will rise alongside the agent’s popularity, creating an optimal environment for long-term growth. As to how far it could go, analysts from Cryptonews suggest that it could 100x in price. Given the $500 billion liquidity injection coming to the AI industry and MIND Of Pepe’s current $3 million raise, this prediction is certainly not unreasonable. Currently, investors can buy $MIND for $0.0031762, but this price will rise throughout the ICO.

Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Today, dYdX faced selling demand as it dropped below $1.2. This is due to the overall cautious approach in the altcoin market. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiments, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX, and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinion on dYdX Binance stops dYdX transactions on ERC20 Binance will stop supporting DYDX token deposits and withdrawals on the Ethereum network from February 12, 2025, at 02:00 UTC.

However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $1.3. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction January 2025 $1.3 $2 $2.6 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $3.86 by the end of 2024.

This engagement follows his earlier meeting with President Donald Trump during events surrounding Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States. In a tweet shared by Garlinghouse, he highlighted these significant meetings, including D.C.’s first “Crypto Ball,” a session at the Capitol, and separate dinners with Trump and Vance. He expressed optimism about the evolving regulatory landscape for crypto in the United States, stating, “there’s palpable excitement for all the good that’s possible leveraging crypto and blockchain… here in the US (finally!) and globally” Still riding high from all the Inauguration events in DC this weekend!

A photograph of Garlinghouse with Vance, taken during one of the events, has been widely shared and celebrated on social media platforms, particularly on X (formerly Twitter). In addition, a video clip showing Garlinghouse and Vance exchanging greetings at Trump’s Candlelight Dinner, held on the eve of the inauguration, has been circulating online. The increased visibility of these interactions has sparked optimism within the XRP community, with many interpreting them as positive developments for the broader ecosystem. Garlinghouse’s meeting with Trump earlier this month also drew significant attention. A widely shared image featuring Trump, Garlinghouse, and Ripple Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty has further fueled speculation about the company’s engagement with the new administration. Ripple’s Financial Contributions and Strategic Objectives Ripple has also made notable contributions to political and inaugural events associated with the Trump administration. While Ripple did not directly fund Trump’s reelection campaign, Stuart Alderoty personally contributed 624,000 XRP —worth approximately $300,000 at the time—to a Super PAC supporting Trump. Additionally, according to a Fox Business report , Ripple donated $5 million to support Trump’s inauguration ceremony after his electoral victory. These financial contributions and the high-level meetings with key figures in the new administration have led to speculation that Ripple may be lobbying for favorable outcomes related to its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Alderoty has expressed confidence that the Trump administration could move to dismiss the lawsuit, which he has previously described as baseless. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Rumored National XRP Reserve Amid these developments, rumors have surfaced regarding the potential establishment of a U.S.-based crypto reserve under the Trump administration. Reports suggest that Trump’s team is exploring the creation of an “America-first” reserve for domestic crypto assets, with XRP reportedly being among the assets under consideration. This proposed reserve, if implemented, would align with Trump’s vision for a national Bitcoin stockpile, which has also been rumored. However, no formal announcements have been made regarding these initiatives, and Trump has yet to confirm any plans to include XRP in such a reserve. As Ripple continues its push for regulatory clarity and a resolution to its legal challenges, these interactions underscore the company’s active role in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency industry in the United States.

The flagship coin was rejected at a crucial resistance range between $107k and $109k, thus forming a short-term reversal pattern. Bitcoin Price Today In the four-hour time frame, Bitcoin price has been forming a possible head and shoulders (H&S) pattern , coupled with a falling divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI). In case of further short-term bearish sentiment, Bitcoin price will find a solid support range between $101k and $99.5k. In the daily time frame, a potential macro reversal pattern, characterized by a double top and bearish divergence, has been forming since early December 2024. In this regard, Bitcoin price could drop in the lower border of a horizontal channel around $91k. Conflicting Market Outlook Following the glamorous inauguration of pro-crypto US President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President the cryptocurrency’s bullish outlook has significantly cooled down, possibly due to the sell-the-news narrative. Although long-term investors – led by MicroStrategy, and BlackRock – have continued to relentlessly accumulate more Bitcoins, short-term traders have continued to shift focus to the highly anticipated altcoin season. Meanwhile, tomorrow’s BoJ’s policy rate announcement among other high-impact news will likely guide traders on next week’s Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy change.

The scenario could play out in two ways: a bullish continuation to the upside or a corrective pullback. Both scenarios are part of an overall bullish outlook as XRP may be undergoing a wave two correction. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.14 and is down by more than two percent in the last 24 hours. Bullish Outlook and Key Support Levels: In the most optimistic case, the price could be forming a wave one move up followed by a wave two pullback that may have already bottomed around $2.79. The important level to watch is the $2.52 mark, which acts as a key support zone. A break below $2.52 would invalidate the bullish scenario and point toward a more bearish outlook, with further downside potential. Challenges to Immediate Breakout The current price action is somewhat unclear. While XRP has held key support levels, it remains below its all-time high, and the price action since January 20th has been choppy and overlapping. This suggests that while the bullish case remains intact, there may still be some consolidation or a retest of support before any sustained breakout. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Ex-Ripple Exec Predicts SEC Will Settle or Dismiss Ripple Lawsuit Within the Week , Potential for Sideways Movement: XRP’s price may continue to consolidate between $2.50 and $3.40. While this range could be seen as “noise,” it’s important to monitor the $3.40 level as a key resistance. A breakout above that would signal the next leg up in this bullish scenario. On the other hand, if XRP fails to break higher and dips below the $2.52 level, it would signal that a corrective wave is still unfolding. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Primarily, it has questioned the foundation’s alleged mismanagement of its $900 million Ether holdings. Importantly, the community has expressed their unhappiness about the foundation’s alleged failure to support its developers. Notably, it has expressed concerns about the alleged inability of the network to challenge the threats posed by its top competitors like Solana and XRP.

However, the ongoing leadership and community challenges highlight the need for a united vision to maintain Ethereum’s competitiveness in the rapidly evolving crypto space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A ""Bitwise Dogecoin ETF"" was submitted late Wednesday and appeared on the Department of State's Division of Corporations in the U.S. state of Delaware. Such filings may often be a spoof, but Bitwise confirmed the registration in a message to The Block . https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1882202309293433217 That came on the back of investment managers Rex Shares and Osprey Funds filing paperwork for several crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including one for dogecoin. An ETF approval by regulatory bodies like the SEC would provide dogecoin with institutional validation, potentially attracting more conservative investors to the memecoin. Increased demand could drive up DOGE prices if the product captures even a small fraction of the inflows seen by bitcoin ETFs (over $50 billion in the past year). DOGE is the world’s largest memecoin with a market capitalization of $52 billion as of Thursday. It has more than tripled in the past year as a speculative token that follows bitcoin’s gains and, more recently, the creation of a Department of Government Efficiency in the U.S. Abbreviated D.O.G.E, the non-governmental agency is led by technocrat Elon Musk and aims to reduce government spending while streamlining Federal worker operations. It was first proposed in mid-October and officially acknowledged during Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on Monday. D.O.G.E’s website briefly displayed a dogecoin token logo on Tuesday, which was later updated to display just its name.

Although many altcoins have easily surpassed Bitcoin’s performance, its outlook remains extremely optimistic due to the first pro-crypto president, the anticipation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and many institutions following MicroStrategy’s path to accumulate BTC. All of these fundamental developments suggest that there is more room to grow before the bull run hits a new high. Although Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, its popularity is due to its first-mover advantage and its being a secure, decentralized network. In addition, many narratives, like digital gold, inflation hedges, and uncorrelated assets, have kept BTC at the forefront of the crypto market since its inception in 2009. But will this advantage push Bitcoin’s price to end this month with positive returns? Can BTC Extend Close January 2025 on a Positive Note? More than a decade’s worth of historical data shows that the first quarter is bullish with an average return of 56%. If history repeats, BTC could close January 2025 on a positive note.

Peter Schiff Questions Bitcoin’s Value Meanwhile, EuroPacific Capital founder and chief global strategist Peter Schiff posted a note on X this week to remind readers that “Bitcoin is a meme coin.” But is that true? And if so, does it mean gold is nothing more than a “meme rock,” as one feisty reply said? Remember, Bitcoin is a meme coin. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 21, 2025 Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that feature a meme with a public and automated blockchain currency maintained by cryptographic security. In a 2022 article, the New York Times defined memes as “a piece of media that is repurposed to deliver a cultural, social or political expression, mainly through humor.” For example, President Donald Trump supporters recently launched a TRUMP meme coin on Solana. On January 21, the day of the incoming president’s inaugural, it was the top trending meme coin in the cryptoverse. Is BTC a Meme Coin? So, is Bitcoin a meme coin? According to Coinbase, meme coins “are cryptocurrencies often inspired by internet memes or trends.” But the financial crisis of 2008 inspired Bitcoin, not a meme or online fashion. According to Bankrate, “A meme coin is a type of cryptocurrency that draws its inspiration from internet memes, characters or trends.” However, Bitcoin draws its inspiration from cryptography and P2P networks for distributed databases. According to Investopedia, “A meme coin is a cryptocurrency named after characters, individuals, animals, artwork, or anything else in an attempt to be humorous, light-hearted, and attract a user base by promising a fun community.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not derivative of any character, individual, or artwork. It is original and one of a kind, just like every digitally serialized and protected bit of coin on its network. So, it seems as if Peter Schiff is just doing more Peter Schiff things.

According to data from SoSoValue, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs dropped by 69% from the previous day, reaching $248.65 million on Wednesday. The entire inflows recorded on the day came from BlackRock’s IBIT which drew in $344.28 million from investors. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded outflows of $47.93 million, while Bitwise’s BITB and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB added to the negative momentum, with investors withdrawing $34.67 million and $13.02 million from the funds, respectively.

After weeks of strong performance, the total market cap has dropped by about 3%, now standing at around $3.54 trillion. This drop comes just after Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President ‘s presidential inauguration, which many believed would bring good news for the crypto world. Disappointment from Trump’s Inauguration Leading up to the inauguration, there was excitement about potential crypto-friendly policies under Trump. However, during his speech, Trump did not mention cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology. This lack of focus on crypto left investors disappointed, leading to speculations that the inauguration became a “sell the news” event. The hype quickly turned to worries, hurting the optimism that had previously driven prices upward. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Add to the Downturn Adding to the market pressure, there has been a significant outflow of Bitcoin ETFs. As of January 22, about $95.62 million worth of Bitcoin ETF outflows were reported, primarily from Grayscale and Bitwise funds, excluding BlackRock’s data. These outflows align with the market’s weakening trend, further contributing to the overall decline .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction for Jan 23: Is a Drop to $91K on the Horizon? , Liquidations Deepen Market Pressure The market has also seen significant liquidations, adding to the downward trend. In the past 24 hours, $243 million worth of positions were liquidated, with long traders suffering the most at $192 million. The largest single liquidation, worth $5.93 million, occurred on the OKX exchange. Bitcoin and Other Cryptos Decline Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has struggled to maintain its gains. It dropped by 2.9% to $102,600 after briefly reaching a record high of over $109,000 earlier this week. Other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana also fell by 3%-4%, while meme coins such as DOGE, SHIB, TRUMP, and PEPE saw sharper declines of 5%-10%. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a detailed analysis, Tarsi pointed out that while the XRP Ledger facilitated over $3 billion in trades last year, its strategic focus diverges from most DEXs in the crypto ecosystem. Designed with institutions in mind, the XRP Ledger DEX could be uniquely positioned to lead the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Over the past few years, trading volume on DEXs has skyrocketed — however, no top tier banks or hedge funds are using them yet. Under the new Trump administration — this might all be about to change. Here is why I think the $XRP Ledger DEX is uniquely positioned to lead: — Tyler Tarsi (@ttarsi_) January 22, 2025 The State of DEX Adoption Trading volumes on DEXs have seen exponential growth over the past few years. However, major financial institutions, including top-tier banks and hedge funds, have largely refrained from participating in the DeFi space. The primary obstacle lies in regulatory compliance. Tarsi, drawing on his experience developing trading algorithms for JP Morgan, noted that compliance is a non-negotiable aspect for institutional players. Without compliance mechanisms, trades simply cannot occur, regardless of potential profitability or efficiency. The XRP Ledger’s Institutional Advantage From its inception, the XRP Ledger’s DEX was designed with institutions in mind. It was purpose-built to handle high-volume trades involving tokenized assets such as JPY, EUR, GBP, and RLUSD, a new stablecoin. This focus on traditional, bank-friendly assets sets it apart from many other DEXs that prioritize crypto-native assets. According to Tarsi, this institutional-first approach is critical for bridging the gap between TradFi and DeFi. The XRP Ledger’s emphasis on scalability, efficiency, and interoperability aligns with the operational needs of banks and hedge funds. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of Permissioned Domains A pivotal upgrade to the XRP Ledger , known as Permissioned Domains, addresses one of the most significant barriers to institutional adoption: compliance. This feature enables regulated entities to trade within a framework that meets their compliance requirements. By introducing permissioned environments, the XRP Ledger allows institutions to maintain the transparency and security benefits of blockchain technology while adhering to strict regulatory standards. This innovation could mark a turning point for the DEX ecosystem. While $3 billion in annual trading volume is a significant milestone, Tarsi suggests that institutions entering the space could amplify this figure exponentially. He estimates that institutional participation might bring a 1,000-fold increase in trading volume, unlocking entirely new levels of liquidity and market efficiency. The Path Forward Under the new Trump administration , Tarsi anticipates a regulatory environment more favorable to blockchain innovation. This, combined with the XRP Ledger’s institutional-grade infrastructure and compliance capabilities, positions it as a potential leader in the DEX space. Tarsi’s insights underscore the importance of aligning blockchain technology with institutional requirements. As traditional and decentralized finance continue to converge, platforms like the XRP Ledger are likely to play a crucial role in shaping the future of global finance. With Permissioned Domains addressing compliance challenges, the XRP Ledger DEX is well-positioned to attract institutional players and redefine the boundaries of DeFi.

So far, the asset has seen a slightly reduced upward momentum with the price just hovering above $104,000. However, despite the slowing upward momentum, Bitcoin’s recent performance has prompted renewed interest in the market. CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci has recently shared insights into Bitcoin’s price behavior and key market indicators, shedding light on potential future moves. In a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake Platform, Kesmeci’s analysis focused on Binance Bitcoin Funding Rates, a metric that provides notable clues about market sentiment and dynamics. By reviewing historical data from previous bull cycles, he identified three distinct phases that can serve as a framework for interpreting the current market environment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Selling at a Loss: What This Means For BTC What’s Next For Bitcoin Based On Funding Rates? According to Kesmeci, during the 2020-2021 bull run, Binance Bitcoin Funding Rates moved through three distinct phases: Phase 1 (July 2020): Funding rates remained stable at 0.01 for weeks before demand surged. This phase acted as the “calm before the storm,” leading Bitcoin from $9,000 to $12,000 as funding rates rose to 0.10. Phase 2 (November 2020): After an initial rally, Bitcoin experienced a correction. Funding rates briefly turned negative before flipping positive, supporting Bitcoin’s climb from $12,000 to $19,000. Phase 3 (December 2020): As Bitcoin surpassed its previous highs and crossed the $60,000 mark, funding rates climbed significantly, reflecting strong market support. Currently, Kesmeci notes that Binance Bitcoin Funding Rates are at the baseline level of 0.01—consistent with the early stages of a bull cycle. The analyst wrote: Analyzing recent data, I believe we’ve completed the first two phases of this bull cycle. For the third phase, I’ll be closely watching if the Binance Bitcoin Funding Rates exceed 0.01. The analyst mentioned that a sustained rise above the 0.01 level would suggest heightened futures market activity and could lead to another significant upward move. However, Kesmeci also cautions that elevated funding rates are often unsustainable, and markets tend to correct through “long squeeze” events that restore balance. Key Metrics and Divergences in the Market In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst TraderOasis explored several critical metrics, including the Coinbase Premium Index, open interest, and funding rates. These indicators give a picture of Bitcoin’s market health and potential direction. TraderOasis highlighted a divergence between the Coinbase Premium Index and Bitcoin’s price movement. While the asset reached a new peak above $109,000, the Coinbase Premium Index formed a lower high. This lack of alignment raised concerns about the sustainability of the current price trend. Moreover, a divergence between open interest and price also suggested that the market might lack the robust foundation needed for continued upward momentum. According to TraderOasis, a healthy uptrend requires these metrics to be more closely aligned, which would signal strong investor confidence and a stable market structure. Looking at funding rates, TraderOasis observed a recent bearish sentiment among traders. However, he noted that such conditions often precede sharp price movements. The analysis suggested the possibility of an initial upward spike to shake out bearish positions, followed by a subsequent pullback. This pattern, if realized, could set the stage for a more sustainable long-term uptrend.

Because of how unpredictable the market of meme coins were last year and as the excitement around PEPE token performance starts to fade, many investors are searching for the next big thing. Many of these investors have moved on to Remittix, an altcoin ready to revolutionize transactions involving cryptocurrency and FIAT money. With a presale that has already garnered more than $5.2 million, smart investors are taking notice of Remittix’s growth potential and think that by 2025 the project could surge by 100x . But what makes Remittix so special? This token isn’t simply another one that’s following the meme trend. With its practical applications, Remittix aims to address real-world issues and may emerge as one of the top altcoins for 2025. Why PEPE Fans Are Eyeing Remittix Despite its reputation for generating huge short-term returns, meme currencies like PEPE have left many investors wanting more. Although remarkable at its peak, the PEPE token performance has had difficulty keeping up. Holders are thus turning their attention to coins with the potential for long-term growth. Remittix’s growth potential makes it a standout alternative. Its presale structure is intended to provide early adopters with substantial rewards in addition to providing creative options for crypto-to-fiat exchanges. Former PEPE devotees who are prepared to diversify their holdings are being drawn in by this mix of potential and utility. What Makes Remittix Stand Out Among Top Altcoins for 2025? While the PEPE token performance has seen had many ups and downs in the past year alone, here’s why Remittix’s growth potential makes it a better and safer choice for investors: Real-World Utility: Unlike other meme currencies like PEPE, Remittix has a clear goal.

Since the project’s vision calls for community governance and major exchange listings, early investors stand to gain a great deal. Cost-Effective Transactions: With fixed rates and no additional costs, Remittix guarantees that recipients receive the precise amount that was sent. Because of this, freelancers and businesses who depend on precise and reasonably priced payment solutions appreciate it. Transparency and Security: The smart contract for the project has undergone a thorough examination and will be relinquished after the presale, granting the community complete governance. It differs from a lot of other altcoins in this regard. Key Benefits of Investing in Remittix Global Reach: Remittix is revolutionizing cross-border payments by enabling crypto-to-fiat transactions in more than 50 cryptocurrency pairings and more than 30 fiat currencies.

However, his recent speech disappointed many crypto fans as there was no mention of a Bitcoin Reserve or even a reference to crypto. Now, attention is shifting to a new category of coins, the “Made in USA” coins and Analyst Altcoin Buzz has brought to attention top altcoins to stack immediately: Altcoin 1: XRP XRP takes the lead among US-made coins, based on market cap. It has been in the news a lot recently, especially with the SEC lawsuit seemingly coming to a close. The new SEC chair may be dropping the case, which is a positive for XRP. Additionally, XRP launched a new stablecoin, RLUSD, which has strong potential to enter the European market. Despite Trump’s lack of interest in CBDCs, XRP continues to grow, with over 100 million XRP purchased by whales in just 48 hours. Altcoin 2: Solana Next up, Solana ranks second in market cap for US-made coins. The platform has seen massive growth, especially with the launch of Trump and Melania meme coins. Solana hit a new all-time high during the meme coin launch, and key ecosystem platforms like Radium, Jupiter, and Moonshot also performed well. However, Trump’s DeFi platform is yet to buy Solana. Altcoin 3: Cardano Cardano’s ADA is another standout. Cardano’s CEO, Charles Hoskinson, is expected to have an advisory role in Trump’s crypto board, which boosts Cardano’s chances of making it into the US-based coin reserve. Cardano’s recent price increases have put it back on the radar. Altcoin 4: Chainlink Chainlink (LINK) has solidified its place in Trump’s World Liberty Financial portfolio, with the latest investment of $4.7 million bringing its total investment to $6.6 million. Chainlink is the leader in the oracle sector, and its growing influence in the crypto space makes it a contender for the US-made coin reserve. Other coins like Ondo Finance and Sui are also making waves. Ondo is involved in the Real World Asset (RWA) sector, a field expected to experience massive growth in the coming years. Trump’s World Liberty Financial has invested $250,000 in the altcoin. Meanwhile, Sui, a rising star in this bull run, has even caught the attention of Eric Trump, who holds Sui tokens.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|XRP|ADA|LINK|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-23 07:37:29

This comes years after Warren Buffet said they would never have a position in cryptocurrencies or the crypto sphere. Berkshire Hathaway continues to follow a conservative investment approach as it increases its holdings in Nu Holdings, as recorded in 2024-Q3. Berkshire Hathaway Broadens Investment in Nu Holdings In a recent SEC filing , Nu Holdings reported that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway increased its holdings to 0.4% as per the records for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This is an increase from 0.1% which was reported for the fourth quarter which ended on December 31, 2022. Berkshire Hathaway initially invested $500 million in Nu Holdings when the Brazilian digital banking company held Series G Funding in 2021. Buffet’s company later invested more funds worth $250 million to take the total investments to $750 million. It is now estimated that Berkshire Hathaway holds over 86 million shares of Nu Holdings for a value of approximately $1.2 billion. Warren Buffet’s Earlier Stand on Crypto The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffet, was earlier against having any share in the crypto market. He never identified himself as a fan of the crypto sphere, and is known for calling Bitcoin ‘probably rat poison squared.’ Warren Buffet said that in 2018 while also telling the media that cryptocurrencies would come to a ‘bad ending.’ He confirmed at that time that they don’t have a position in cryptocurrencies and they will never have any position in them. That stand appears to be steering in a different direction now with Berkshire Hathaway expanding its holdings in a company that launched its crypto platform in 2022 – Nubank Crypto. The cryptocurrency platform by Nu offers support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Uniswap, and Chainlink. Some core functions that it offers to users are sending, receiving, and converting cryptocurrencies. Investment Strategy of Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire Hathaway is known to follow a conservative approach with its investments. This is evident from its financial statements wherein it revealed holding over $325 million in cash and equivalents with most of it being in U.S Treasury Bills. Thereby, staying away from making heavy investments in hot stocks during their bull run. The top management has backed this approach of Berkshire Hathaway by saying that the company has succeeded over the decades by ‘being boring in that way.’ Nevertheless, other prominent figures in the industry continue to support the crypto market even as BTC prices crash. For instance, Fred Thiel, the CEO of MARA Holdings, has outlined a plan to implement Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for 50 states and the Federal Government. Similarly, John Deaton outlined four key objectives for the White House Crypto Council . This has boosted the confidence of crypto investors who are looking forward to more developments, especially under the Trump Administration.

The attackers linked a fake X account as a Nasdaq-affiliated account and tweeted under the guise of the official Nasdaq account, recommending the newly released meme coin STONKS. This post managed to attract the attention of investors. In a short time, STONKS' market value skyrocketed and skyrocketed to $80 million in a few hours, but crashed shortly after. It turned out that STONKS, introduced under the name Nasdaq, was a copy of the memecoin of the same name, which was based on Solana. *This is not investment advice.

After the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the business now expects Solana and XRP ETFs. With pending regulatory approval and the CME Group preparing to launch Futures ETFs on XRP and SOL this February, is this the last chance to stack these altcoins at a lower price range? In this article, we at CoinPedia uncover the possible short-term prospects of the top 2 altcoins after Ethereum. Potential Exchange-traded Fund (ETF) Filing Considering the tokenomics and core fundamentals of Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL), these altcoins could be highly undervalued at this point. However, a possible ETF listing could push the price of these projects toward their maximum potential. Notably, top analysts speculate multiple ETFs to hit the cryptocurrency market this year. With XRP and Solana being the top contenders. Moreover, among other possible ETF listings this year include Chainlink, Hedera, Trump coin, and Melania meme coin. With this, the cryptocurrency market could experience the beginning of a new chapter during the coming altcoin market. Ripple (XRP) With an intraday correction of 1.29%, the XRP crypto price is currently valued at $3.14. Reportedly, with a Year-to-Date return of +51.39%, this altcoin has outperformed major tokens. Moreover, with the new SEC chair and the potential dismissal of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, this altcoin is trading at a discount of less than 20% from its ATH. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a constant decline in the green histogram with a possible bearish convergence in the XRP price chart. On the other hand, the RSI indicator acts as a support, suggesting a mixed price sentiment for the altcoin in the market. Maintaining the value above its support level of $3 could set the stage for the Ripple price to retest its resistance of $3.50 this month. However, if the bears outrun the bulls, this could result in it plunging toward its low of $2.70. Are you curious about questions like “Will XRP reach $100?” Read CoinPedia’s XRP Price Prediction to explore the long-term mysteries! Solana (SOL) Despite recording a drop of 2.87% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $9.038 billion, the SOL price has jumped 23.11% in seven days and has a YTD return of 31.79%. With only a few billion short of challenging Tether’s 04th position, Solana’s market cap is currently valued at $131.335 billion. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues hovering around the overbought range in the daily time frame. With its EMA 50/200-day constantly recording an upward trend, the Solana price hints at a positive outlook in the coming time. Suppose, the market favors the bulls, under such a situation, the SOL coin price will breach its resistance of $270 and head toward its upper high of $300. Conversely, a bearish reversal could pull the price of Solana toward its low of $225. Planning on stacking SOL tokens before the altcoin season kickstarts? Read our Solana Price Prediction !

For those unfamiliar, crypto ATMs are kiosks at physical locations that allow users to convert cash into cryptocurrencies and vice versa. However, the limited regulation surrounding these machines and the anonymity provided by cryptocurrency transactions have made them increasingly susceptible to exploitation by scammers, who use them as a channel for funneling illicit loot. According to Lisa Kruse, North Dakota’s Department of Financial Institutions Commissioner, locals filed 103 crypto scam complaints with the FBI in 2023 alone, resulting in reported losses of $6.5 million. Reported losses are much higher when considering the latest Federal Trade Commission data , which shows that scam incidents in the United States have surged over tenfold between 2020 and 2023. At the hearing, House Representative Steve Swiontek, the primary sponsor of the bill, raised concerns over the current lack of regulations and protection measures that make it easier for criminals to exploit crypto ATMs. You might also like: Niagara Regional Police to issue fraud warnings on crypto ATMs What is House Bill 1447? The bill seeks to put in place various protection measures, such as capping daily withdrawals at $1,000 and limiting transaction fees to $5 or 3% of the transaction amount, whichever is higher. Additionally, it mandates that all crypto ATMs display fraud warning notices to alert users of common scam tactics and advise them to contact law enforcement if they suspect fraudulent activity. Users will also be notified of the irreversible nature of crypto transactions so they’re aware that funds, once sent, may not be recoverable. Meanwhile, Kiosk operators will be required to acquire a license, comply with requirements applicable to money transmitters under state law, and submit quarterly reports to the state commissioner. They must also ensure that kiosks are placed in commercially accessible areas, are accessible to users with mobility limitations, and are equipped with adequate security measures such as proper lighting and surveillance. The bill has received support from committee members and industry representatives, including Kevin Lolli from CoinFlip , who backed its consumer protection measures but was against the transaction limits and fee caps. Regulatory efforts With crypto ATM-related fraud cases on the rise , regulators all across the globe have moved to tighten oversight of the sector. Concerns over money laundering and unregulated operations also remain at the forefront. The Niagara Regional Police announced a similar initiative on Jan. 22 where it said it would collaborate with major kiosk operators in Ontario, Canada, to issue warnings on crypto ATM machines. Meanwhile, in Germany, authorities reported carrying out nationwide raids to crack down on unlicensed crypto ATM operations. Roughly $28 million in cash and 13 kiosks were seized as a part of the effort.

On Jan. 22, crypto fund manager Bitwise Asset Management submitted documents to register for a Dogecoin ( DOGE ) exchange-traded fund . The filing can be found within the Delaware Department of State’s Division of Corporations official website . The agent registered on the form was revealed to be CSC Delaware Trust Company. Bitwise’s application marks the start of the process towards establishing a Dogecoin ETF under the fund manager. A few hours after the news broke, the Polymarket poll betting on the odds of whether a Dogecoin ETF will get approved by the SEC in 2025 stood at nearly 50%. In the past 24 hours of trading, Dogecoin has dipped slightly by 3.18% to a trading price of $0.35 according to data on crypto.news. In the past week, the Shiba Inu coin has gone down by nearly 7%. DOGE currently has a market cap of more than $52 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $2.8 billion. As previously reported by crypto.news, Dogecoin’s price movement has been showing signs of heading towards a bullish breakout amidst the ongoing crypto rally.

Aside from Dogecoin, REX Shares also filed for ETFs tied to the official TRUMP meme coin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bonk, and Solana. Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas commented on the rise of the Dogecoin ETF, calling it “surreal” in a recent post on X. He also previously predicted that a Dogecoin filing would come around the end of December. Dogecoin has been gaining momentum these past few months after President-elect Donald Trump announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency to streamline government operations.

However, on Jan. 21 Ramaswamy declared he would be stepping down from the role, leaving Musk and his team to lead the department.

The event, buzzing with energy, marked a significant change in the regulatory atmosphere. Over the past four years, industry leaders felt stifled by unclear rules and a perceived lack of collaboration from the previous administration, led by figures like Gary Gensler. Now, with a new administration in place and key pro-crypto appointments like David Sacks as the "" crypto czar ,"" optimism is high. The industry is focused on securing clear and lasting legislation to prevent crypto from being a political issue that flips with each election. The relationship with government is evolving. Coinbase and other firms had struggled to engage meaningfully with the previous administration but now find an open door for dialogue, even if alignment isn’t guaranteed. The new environment encourages public-private cooperation, essential for establishing stable regulations. One key topic of discussion is meme coins, such as President Trump's planned coin. While some criticize meme coins as unserious, the industry acknowledges their potential role as part of a broader crypto ecosystem, similar to how early internet trends seemed trivial but paved the way for transformative innovation. Meme coins demonstrate how innovation often begins with play , though caution is necessary to protect consumers from financial risks, especially in the absence of strong regulations. The regulatory focus extends to two major areas: token classification and stablecoin oversight. The industry seeks clarity on distinguishing commodities, securities, and other categories like artwork. A decentralized asset like Bitcoin, for instance, is viewed as a commodity due to its lack of central control. Stablecoins, essential for global payments, need regulation ensuring full reserve backing and transparency. USDC , seen as more compliant than Tether, is preferred in the U.S. market, although global differences in approach are acknowledged. International competition also looms. Governments like China are advancing their own digital currencies, prompting U.S. stakeholders to highlight how crypto can support the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. Coinbase's corporate culture has evolved too. A 2020 decision by CEO Brian Armstrong to depoliticize the workplace sparked controversy but ultimately strengthened the company's focus. Employees were encouraged to bring their best professional selves to work, leaving unrelated social and political issues outside the office. Despite initial resistance, this approach improved alignment, and other companies have since adopted similar policies. Armstrong’s leadership during this transition emphasized assuming positive intent among colleagues and fostering clearer communication, including face-to-face interactions to reduce misunderstandings. Crypto’s role in broader cultural shifts was also highlighted. Many Americans are drawn to crypto for the freedom it represents—freedom of speech, economic freedom, and the ability to protect personal wealth from systemic risks. Voters’ support for pro-crypto candidates in recent elections reflects dissatisfaction with traditional financial systems and frustration with perceived overreach by regulators like Gensler and Senator Elizabeth Warren . These dynamics contributed to significant political consequences, showcasing the growing influence of the crypto voting bloc. As the crypto industry integrates further with traditional financial systems, leaders like Armstrong envision a collaborative future. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs and partnerships with legacy firms like BlackRock illustrate how crypto complements rather than replaces traditional markets. The ultimate goal is a global financial system updated with digital assets, built through cooperation and innovation.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-23 07:59:46

These campaigns aim to lure unsuspecting victims into downloading malware designed to steal sensitive data, including crypto wallet credentials, ultimately draining their assets. Here’s an in-depth look at how this attack works and how users can protect themselves. The Deceptive Trap: Google Ads and Fake Homebrew Sites The attack begins with cybercriminals creating fraudulent advertisements through Google Ads. These ads are tailored to target specific keywords such as “Homebrew,” a popular package manager for macOS. By mimicking legitimate ads, scammers manage to position their malicious links at the top of search results, significantly increasing their chances of victim engagement. When a user clicks on one of these ads, they are redirected to a fake website designed to resemble the official Homebrew page. The counterfeit site appears authentic and offers what it claims to be a legitimate installation script. However, downloading and executing this script initiates the installation of malware instead of the intended software. How the Malware Operates Once the malicious script is executed, the malware goes to work, focusing its efforts on cryptocurrency users. It deploys several tactics to harvest sensitive information and exploit users’ crypto wallets. Here’s a breakdown of its operations: 1. Stealing Browser Data: The malware extracts cookies, saved passwords, and information from browser extensions commonly used for crypto transactions, such as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Phantom. 2. Targeting Crypto Wallets: It identifies and steals wallet files from popular cryptocurrency wallet applications, including Electrum, Exodus, Atomic Wallet, and Ledger Live. These files often contain critical data needed to access and transfer funds. 3. Inducing Password Entry: Victims are prompted to enter their system password during the script execution, providing the attackers with even deeper system access. 4. Harvesting System and Communication Data: The malware gathers comprehensive system information, including keychain data, and even targets files from messaging apps like Telegram, which may store sensitive information related to crypto accounts. Communication with a Remote Server The stolen data is transmitted to a remote server controlled by the attackers, located at 81[.]19[.]135[.]54/joinsystem. The malware uses the `curl` command to send data, including custom headers such as user information and BuildID. This communication allows the attackers to compile a complete profile of the victim, potentially facilitating further exploitation. How to Stay Protected Given the sophistication of this malware campaign, taking proactive steps to safeguard your devices and data is crucial. Here are some tips to help protect yourself from falling victim to such attacks: – Avoid Clicking on Ads: Even if an ad appears legitimate, it’s safer to access software or services directly through verified official websites. – Be Cautious with Unknown Commands: Never execute commands or scripts from untrusted sources, as they may contain hidden malware. – Use Antivirus Software: Regularly scan your system with reliable antivirus tools to detect and remove potential threats. – Opt for Hardware Wallets: Store your cryptocurrency in hardware wallets rather than software-based ones. Hardware wallets are not connected to the internet and provide an additional layer of security. 1/7 SECURITY ALERT: Another case of malicious software distributed via Google Ads, targeting crypto users through fake Homebrew installers. Attackers are using fake ads to lure victims into downloading malware designed to steal crypto wallet data and drain assets. Here's how… https://t.co/6DEC0XnrjC pic.twitter.com/vfuKCsECo2 — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) January 20, 2025 The Growing Threat to Crypto Users The rise of cryptocurrencies has made crypto users a prime target for cybercriminals. This latest scheme demonstrates their evolving strategies, combining legitimate platforms like Google Ads with deceptive tactics to compromise user security. As such, vigilance is key. Staying informed about the latest threats and practicing cautious online behavior can help protect your assets and personal data. Always verify websites before downloading software and consider implementing robust security measures to defend against these sophisticated attacks. While Google has taken steps to combat fraudulent ads, the persistence of such scams underscores the need for individual awareness. Crypto users should remain on high alert, as falling victim to these attacks can result in significant financial losses. By following best practices and adopting a security-first mindset, users can reduce the risk of becoming the next target. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Notably, the Tesla & SpaceX CEO has called Altman “a liar” as he looks to acquire 7% equity in the AI firm amid its shift from a non-profit entity. Meanwhile, with recent reports revealing that the AI firm also funded the anti-Trump media house Axios, the AI giant remains under severe scrutiny. Elon Musk Takes A Dig At Sam Altman, Here’s Why In an X post dated January 23, the Tesla & SpaceX lead Elon Musk stated, “Altman literally testified to Congress that he wouldn’t get OpenAI compensation, and now he wants $10 billion! What a liar.” This statement comes against the backdrop of the AI giant’s for-profit shift and decision to hand over 7% equity to its CEO, Altman. Previous reports revealed that Altman is to get 7% of equity in the AI firm as it looks to restructure its business model. In light of this saga, CoinGape reported earlier that Elon Musk called the AI giant a ‘profit-maximizer.’ Altogether, the recent rebuking by the Tesla & SpaceX CEO aligns with past chronicles, underscoring unhappiness with the AI firm’s decision to shift to a for-profit organization. OpenAI Under Scrutiny Amid Anti-Trump Media House Funding In another recent development, IBC Group co-founder Mario Nawfal has spotlighted on X that the Altman-led AI giant funds Axios, a media outlet that blasts president-elect Donald Trump. Notably, Nawfal revealed that the AI entity’s “three-year deal marks OpenAI’s first direct control of newsroom operations,” sparking speculations as Axios has been seen attacking Trump’s immigration policies on religious grounds following his inauguration. Besides, it’s also noteworthy that Trump announced ‘Stargate formation ,’ bolstering the ChatGPT maker and other firms’ AI ventures with massive investments. The abovementioned anti-Trump funding has emerged as contrary to this news, with Elon Musk also reacting to this saga on X. Elon Musk vs Sam Altman: What’s The Scoop? This simmering feud between the Tesla lead and Sam Altman began primarily due to the ChatGPT maker’s decision to shift from a non-profit to a for-profit organization. Musk, being one of the earlier backers of OpenAI as it initially originated as an open source, has condemned the AI giant for this shift. In the aftermath of the feud, numerous lawsuits between the two American entrepreneurs surfaced, sparking industry discussions globally. Besides, the abovementioned chronicles appear to have further presented the AI firm with quite the backlash across the broader sector.

Pseudonymous trader The Flow Horse tells his Telegram channel that Celestia ( TIA ) may be gearing up for a breakout after forming a classic bottoming pattern during the last six months. “I find TIA very interesting right now. For a few reasons: There seemed to be a major capitulation of emotions on it over the last few days, peaking during the period that [venture capitalist] Chris Burniske was the target of CT (crypto Twitter) over his position on it. Because of that it has become something that while new and novel, has been largely written off. It is bouncing along the same low now for six months. Contextually not a bad area to build a position if you expect this market to continue to work the way it does.” However, he warns that TIA may first dip to the $4 level before entering an uptrend. “Personally, I think this structure begs for the spill below all those lows that gets bought back up, which actually lines up with a large bid placed around $4. So something to keep track of never the less. But keep in mind, if that came, it would be a 20% haircut. This is just an asset I want to keep tabs on.” In September, Burniske doubled down on his prediction that TIA would be a top-performing altcoin this cycle and said he was still loading up on TIA tokens, anticipating a massive recovery at some point. TIA is trading for $4.67 at time of writing, down 5.1% in the last 24 hours.

While the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced pockets of exuberance, Ethereum’s price performance remains relatively muted, leaving frustrated traders questioning its near-term prospects. Ethereum Lags Behind as XRP and Solana Shine Over the past month, Ethereum’s market cap has declined by 4.7%, a stark contrast to the stellar performances of other top-cap assets like Ripple’s $XRP and Solana’s $SOL. XRP surged an impressive 36.9%, driven by bullish sentiment and increased adoption, while Solana posted gains of 32.2%, benefiting from its growing ecosystem and network activity. Ethereum's frustrated traders have watched other top cap counterparts shine. In the past month, $ETH 's marketcap is -4.7%, while $XRP (+36.9%) & $SOL (+32.2%) thrive. Read our breakdown on $ETH 's underperformance, and what realistic outcomes await. https://t.co/0mqsB3NqKT — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 22, 2025 This underperformance has left Ethereum investors disappointed as $ETH struggles to break free from its price range between $3,200 and $3,500. Despite Ethereum’s status as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, its price stagnation raises concerns about its ability to maintain dominance in an increasingly competitive market. $ETH’s Estimated Leverage Ratio is climbing, signaling increased risk as traders load up on high-leverage positions. With ETH stuck between $3.2K and $3.5K, a breakout feels imminent. Bullish? Likely. But high leverage could spark volatility and liquidations—stay sharp. pic.twitter.com/nalu44mX5I — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) January 22, 2025 Rising Leverage and the Risk of Volatility One of the more concerning trends for Ethereum is its climbing Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR). This metric indicates that traders are increasingly engaging in high-leverage positions, which amplifies risk in the market. High leverage can lead to sharp price swings and cascading liquidations during volatile movements, adding further uncertainty to Ethereum’s trajectory. With $ETH stuck in a narrow range, traders are speculating on an imminent breakout. The combination of growing leverage and tight price action could set the stage for significant volatility, either propelling Ethereum to new highs or pushing it further downward. Market participants are advised to stay vigilant as these conditions could trigger rapid and unpredictable price movements. Ethereum Spot ETFs Gain Momentum Amid this turbulent trading environment, Ethereum’s adoption continues to expand through institutional channels. The Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market has seen a consistent inflow of capital over the past five days. On January 21 alone, the total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETFs was $74.4 million, a testament to growing institutional interest. Leading the charge is BlackRock’s ETHA ETF, which accounted for $56.3 million of the inflow, further cementing its dominance in the Ethereum ETF market. Meanwhile, the Grayscale ETH ETF attracted $12.5 million in inflows. These consistent inflows have pushed the total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETFs to an impressive $12.07 billion, highlighting the increasing demand for regulated Ethereum investment vehicles. On January 21, the total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETF was $74.4275million, and the net inflow continued for 5 days. The inflow of BlackRock ETF ETHA was $56.3138million, and the inflow of Grayscale ETF ETH was $12.4943million. The current total net asset value of Ethereum spot… pic.twitter.com/TvhWsr4kdH — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 22, 2025 The Road Ahead: A Breakout on the Horizon? Despite Ethereum’s recent underperformance, there are reasons to remain optimistic about its future prospects. The network continues to attract developers and projects, reinforcing its position as the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Moreover, Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has bolstered its environmental credentials, appealing to investors with a focus on sustainability. However, the current market dynamics suggest that Ethereum is at a crossroads. Its ability to break out of its current range will likely depend on a combination of factors, including broader market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and the resolution of its leverage-driven risk. In the short term, traders should prepare for heightened volatility as Ethereum navigates this challenging environment. With its market cap under pressure and leverage on the rise, Ethereum’s next move could set the tone for the rest of the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent struggles have left traders and investors on edge as it lags behind the stellar performances of assets like $XRP and $SOL. With climbing leverage ratios signaling increased risk and an imminent breakout appearing likely, the coming weeks could prove pivotal for Ethereum’s market trajectory. At the same time, institutional interest, as evidenced by strong inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs, underscores the asset’s long-term appeal. Whether Ethereum can capitalize on this momentum and reclaim its position as a market leader remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: all eyes are on $ETH as the market anticipates its next major move.

From being a vocal skeptic to actively promoting blockchain innovation, Trump’s shift has had a profound impact on the digital asset world. His policies, personal investments, and crypto-focused initiatives have positioned him as a major influence in the cryptocurrency world. Evolution of Trump’s Crypto Stance Donald Trump’s journey with cryptocurrencies was a spectacular transformation from open skepticism to full-fledged advocacy. 2019: Active Critic of Cryptocurrencies In July 2019 , Trump made several strong criticisms against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He tweeted: “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activities.” During that time, Trump’s administration also proposed tighter regulations on digital currencies, claiming that illicit activities were being conducted. 2021-2023: Gradual Shift Toward Acceptance Trump also started to dial back his rhetoric from the White House onwards. He said in multiple interviews that blockchain was an opportunity to be used in modernizing the financial system. He, however, remained guarded regarding Bitcoin volatility. He slowly became more amenable to blockchain as a tool for efficiency and innovation. 2024: Campaign Messages: Pro-Crypto In his 2024 presidential election , Trump made a direct move to be pro-crypto. In his agenda, he promised to enhance blockchain innovation, relax the regulations, and be the first in the digital economy in the United States. 2025: “The First Crypto President” By 2025, Trump had been fully submerged into cryptocurrency: he was the “ First Crypto President .” The policies of his administration and his private investment activities mirror an attempt at the full implementation of blockchain in the U.S. economy. Donald Trump’s Crypto Portfolio According to the data from crypto intelligence firm Arkham , as of January 2025, Trump’s cryptocurrency portfolio has experienced multiplying growth. His holdings reveal a strategic approach to digital asset investments. Portfolio Details Total Value: $15.8 million (up from $1.3 million in January 2024). Key Assets: TROG Tokens: 210 billion tokens valued at $9.5 million. Trump Coins: 579,000 tokens valued at $1.66 million. Ethereum (ETH): Approximately $1.60 million in value. Market Performance In January 2025, Trump’s portfolio increased by $2.7 million. This was due to an increase in investor confidence after the announcements of crypto-friendly policies from his administration. Donald Trump’s Crypto Project World Liberty Finance is one of Trump’s most ambitious cryptocurrency projects. The project aims at creating a global financial ecosystem powered by blockchain. World Liberty Finance Project Overview Token Name: WLFI (World Liberty Finance Token). Total Token Supply: 100 billion WLFI tokens. First Raise: $300 million, 20% of tokens sold. Current Token Sale: Sold an additional 5 billion tokens at $0.05. Projected Additional Raise: $250 million. Key Investors Justin Sun: TRON founder who has invested $75 million in WLFI: Initial investment: $30 million. Additional investment: $45 million. Transaction Volume: The platform has processed more than $889 million through its Safe Protocol institutional account, which shows a lot of activity within its ecosystem. World Liberty Finance is that decentralized finance platform which would make global transaction, lending and investments simpler as well as easy for everyone to access. The project presents a very clear and secure financial ecosystem from which the clients could perform various transactions without necessarily making use of central banks. Therefore, it will help the underbanked communities in availing equal financial growth opportunities. This project will be a great fit into the much bigger scheme that Donald Trump envisions towards the modernization of financial systems using blockchain technology as an approach towards spurring innovation and breaking barriers to help make the global adoption of digital assets a reality. It will make people and businesses around the world more financially free. Trump Cryptocurrency Tokens: $TRUMP and $MELANIA Memecoins In January 2025, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched two memecoins: $TRUMP and $MELANIA. It was a great entry into the cryptocurrency market. $TRUMP Memecoin Blockchain: It was launched on the Solana blockchain. It is a high-speed transactional blockchain and scalable. Market Capitalization: The market cap crossed over $9 billion in two days after the launch. Launch Price: Sold at $0.18 per token. Peak Price: The two days topped it at $75.35 since the market had a lot of interest in it. Ownership: The tokens are held by Trump-affiliated entities, especially CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, about 80%. $MELANIA Memecoin After the release of $TRUMP, first lady Melania Trump launched the $MELANIA memecoin. Market Cap: Within days, it reached a market cap of about $810 million. Rapid Adoption: Its prices skyrocketed in no time after its creation. Trump Administration’s New Cryptocurrency Regulations President Donald Trump’s administration has introduced several initiatives to position the United States as a leader in blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation: Establishment of the U.S. DOGE Service In early 2025, President Trump signed an executive order renaming the U.S. Digital Service to the U.S. DOGE Service, integrating it within the Executive Office of the President. This move aims to reduce federal spending and bureaucracy, with Elon Musk appointed to lead the department. Presidential Council on Cryptocurrencies According to Forbes report, President Trump plans to sign executive orders to elevate cryptocurrency to a national policy priority and form a Presidential Council on Cryptocurrencies. This council is expected to provide guidance on integrating digital assets into the U.S. financial system. Support for ‘Made in USA’ Crypto Projects The administration is anticipated to promote domestic blockchain projects , encouraging innovation within the United States. This initiative aligns with the broader goal of establishing the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the planet.” These actions reflect a strategic effort to integrate cryptocurrencies into the national economy, fostering innovation while addressing regulatory challenges. Problems and Ethical Issues in Crypto Policies of Trump President Donald Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency policies have been a source of both excitement and criticism. Major problems and ethical issues are as follows: President Trump’s launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins sparked ethical debates over potential conflicts of interest, as his policies directly influence related markets. Critics argue this blurs public service and personal gain. Additionally, the $TRUMP coin’s early price volatility raised concerns about market speculation Outlook Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency journey is a dramatic departure from the general to digital asset. From personal investment and innovative projects like World Liberty Finance to a transformative regulatory vision, Donald Trump’s actions have shaped the future of the US crypto world differently than most had envisioned. In this light, his initiatives draw both ethical and regulatory views but also indicate the growing influence of blockchain technology in global finance. As long as Trump remains a proponent of cryptocurrency, his policies and projects will be a legacy that lasts and perhaps makes the U.S. a global leader in blockchain innovation.",Research Report|Altcoins|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-23 08:06:21

Concerns are growing over potential conflicts of interest and transparency issues surrounding Trump’s financial ties, particularly regarding his role in the crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLF) and the launch of the ""TRUMP"" meme coin. Connolly has written to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urging an inquiry into whether Trump’s crypto-related activities violate ethics and transparency standards. He warns that these ventures could compromise national security and allow foreign entities to gain undue influence. At the center of the controversy is WLF, a cryptocurrency initiative tied to Trump’s vision of financial independence. Reports reveal that Justin Sun , the founder of Tron and a figure under investigation by the SEC for alleged securities fraud, invested $30 million in WLF tokens. Connolly claims this investment helped WLF meet its revenue goals, possibly directing funds to Trump and his family. The congressman describes these financial connections as troubling, raising questions about ethical and legal boundaries under the Presidential Ethics Reform Act. In addition to WLF, Trump’s personal cryptocurrency, the TRUMP meme coin, has raised alarms. The coin, launched shortly before Trump’s inauguration, surged dramatically in value, reaching a fully diluted valuation close to $40 billion. Despite its initial success, its value has fluctuated, recently trading around $37.93. When asked about the coin, Trump appeared unfamiliar with its specifics, stating only that it was “very successful.” Critics argue that the TRUMP meme coin could be used to bypass national security and anti-corruption laws. Congresswoman Maxine Waters has labeled it “the worst of crypto,” emphasizing its potential to allow anonymous financial transactions that could benefit Trump’s circle or sanctioned individuals. She further warned that such tools create avenues for global entities to trade and profit without oversight. Connolly’s letter also highlights the broader implications of these ventures, including concerns about quid pro quo arrangements tied to Trump’s financial dealings. While WLF tokens reportedly offer no tangible financial returns, Connolly warns that they enable foreign entities to curry favor with Trump and his organization. These developments underscore the need for immediate action to evaluate Trump’s involvement in the crypto space and ensure that national security and transparency laws are upheld. Connolly insists that without a thorough investigation, such entanglements could pose significant risks to ethical governance.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-23 08:11:31

Led by Wall Street expert Vivek Raman, this program focuses on developing tools to simplify Ethereum adoption by banks and financial firms, signaling a significant push toward blockchain tokenization. With Ethereum’s position as the second-largest blockchain, the Etherealize initiative is backed by its co-founder Vitalik Buterin and supported by the Ethereum Foundation (EF). Etherealize positions itself as a bridge between traditional finance ( TradFi ) and blockchain. Raman, known for his expertise in AI, crypto, and decentralized finance (DeFi), emphasizes Ethereum’s role as the “most secure operating system for the global economy.” According to Raman, “Ethereum’s adoption moment is here—let’s bring TradFi into the blockchain era.” Etherealize, staffed by a small team in New York, complements the Ethereum Foundation’s efforts while building institutional-grade products for banks. The initiative’s mission is to enhance Ethereum’s capabilities for tokenizing and trading high-value assets securely on the blockchain. Through its dashboard, Etherealize highlights its focus on creating educational content, building institutional tools, and ensuring Ethereum’s reliability for the financial sector. Raman stated, “All high-value assets will be tokenized and traded on the most secure blockchain: Ethereum.” Although the initiative has been well-received, it has sparked mixed reactions. Some, like Mathew Sigel, Head of Digital Asset Research, praised Etherealize’s vision but remain cautiously optimistic about its execution. “The first product is a fire idea if they can execute,” Sigel said. Etherealize has already gathered over 5,400 Twitter followers and is promoting Ethereum’s potential through education and application development. Ethereum’s push into TradFi comes at a time of internal challenges within the Ethereum Foundation. Leadership changes and critiques of its strategic effectiveness have led to debates about Ethereum’s long-term direction. Recently, Vitalik Buterin proposed staking Ethereum to cover operational expenses, fueling speculation about financial pressures. Additionally, notable figures, such as Ethereum developer Eric Conner, have departed, citing lost enthusiasm due to leadership struggles. Despite these challenges, Ethereum’s integration with financial institutions reflects a growing trend. Banks and asset managers are increasingly exploring blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenization. However, Ethereum faces stiff competition from rival blockchains like Solana and Avalanche, which market themselves as more scalable and cost-efficient. Critics within the crypto community have expressed skepticism. One user joked, “Accelerating institutional adoption? More like accelerating the demise of fun in DeFi. Guess I’ll go back to trading jpegs of rocks.” Meanwhile, external figures like Justin Sun and Lido co-founder Vasily Lomashuk have proposed creating a secondary Ethereum foundation and improving the network’s usability to attract developers and institutions. As institutional interest in blockchain grows, Ethereum’s push with Etherealize may prove pivotal. However, its success will depend on overcoming internal challenges and staying ahead in a competitive market.",,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-23 08:14:44

The island is gearing up to propose a new law in June 2025 that will integrate cryptocurrency into its national economy. New regulations will allow banks to issue stablecoins and create a trading portal for investors in a trial program supervised by The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC). The move is part of Taiwan’s effort to build a secure and regulated environment for digital assets. The law will also impose strict anti-money laundering (AML) rules on virtual asset service providers (VASPs), requiring them to register by September 2025. Non-compliance could lead to hefty fines or even jail time. The goal is to tighten oversight of the fast-growing crypto sector and ensure transparency and security. Additionally, the FSC plans a trial run for crypto custody services through local banks, letting institutional clients safely store their digital assets. If successful, crypto custody could roll out fully by 2025, putting Taiwan at the forefront of global crypto adoption. The initiative highlights Taiwan’s push to become a leading crypto hub in Asia. New regulations may provide a clear framework for managing digital assets while leveraging the country’s strong financial infrastructure and tech-savvy population. Prior to this move, Taiwan had taken a cautious approach to crypto regulations. In 2013, the FSC released a statement naming Bitcoin as a highly speculative digital commodity. Later, the institution banned local banks from accepting Bitcoin or providing any related services, such as exchanging Bitcoin for fiat currency. In 2017, the FSC reiterated its stance. The recent declaration marks a significant departure from Taiwan’s earlier approach.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-23 09:25:04

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s plan to launch SOL and XRP futures on February 10 has already influenced the performance of the assets. The products (if they go live) may attract more institutional investors and positively influence both tokens in the long term. The Potential Catalyst Solana (SOL) has been among the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the last week, with its price soaring by over 20% for that timeframe. It reached a new all-time high of more than $285 on January 19, while currently, it trades just south of $250. SOL Price, Source: CoinGecko One important factor suggesting that the bull run may prevail is Grayscale’s intention to convert its Solana Trust Fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The agency responsible for approving such filings in the US is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Its initial decision deadline for Grayscale’s investment vehicle is set for today (January 23). The recent shifts in the Commission’s leadership have caused some industry participants to speculate that the aforementioned ETF could receive the necessary green light. Up until January 20, the SEC was led by Gary Gensler, who was known as an enemy of the cryptocurrency industry. However, he stepped down on the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration, with the pro-crypto Mark Uyeda succeeding him at the helm. Other well-known companies that have filed to launch SOL ETFs on American soil include VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital. The SEC has until January 25 to give its nod or deny those applications. It is important to note that the watchdog has the authority to extend its review period beyond the initial deadlines. This was a common policy during Gensler’s reign, and we have yet to see whether the agency will keep this practice after the changes at the top. Nearly a year ago, the SEC approved a wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs for trade in the United States. The companies behind the funds included popular names such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, Wisdom Tree, and others. The price of the primary cryptocurrency plunged after the announcement, but a few weeks later, it started pumping substantially. This might serve as a warning to investors that the potential launch of a spot Solana ETF in America could be generally beneficial for the valuation of the underlying asset but may also lead to enhanced volatility and a move to the downside in the short term. The Additional Bullish Element Another factor that could positively impact Solana’s price is the supposed plan of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to introduce SOL and XRP futures. The financial derivatives exchange is looking to do so on February 10 . The news had an immediate impact on the prices of both assets. SOL pumped to as high as $270, whereas XRP briefly jumped to $3.28. The contracts (if approved) will allow people to speculate on the future price of the aforementioned assets without actually owning them. They may attract an additional number of investors into the Solana and Ripple ecosystems, possibly having a positive influence on the prices of their native tokens.

It’s a crypto news website with an extensive library of official documents related to cryptocurrency cases in US courts. The crypto activist recently warned that meme coins like the new TRUMP tokens that have been going around may threaten cryptocurrency’s public relations image. Deaton: Meme Coins Not A Good Look For Crypto In an episode of the “Good Morning Crypto Show” that streamed on Monday, Jan. 20, Deaton suggested meme coins threaten crypto’s legitimacy. The Good Morning Crypto Show is a popular crypto podcast with over 198,000 subscribers on YouTube. When the show host asked about the TRUMP coin, Deaton didn’t have any of it. “I’m excited like everybody else. We’ve witnessed an absolute war against crypto, not just unjust, but unlawful,” Deaton said. “So I’m excited like everyone else. But I have a concern— in this country, sometimes we have the tendency to go from one extreme to the other extreme.” “So we’ve had this completely unfair war against crypto,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean we want a complete free-for-all where there are no rules of the road or regulations whatsoever because users, consumers, and customers get taken advantage of. So we want smart regulations.” “We fought for survival. The last five years we have fought for crypto’s survival. But now we have to not just survive— we have to fight for our legitimacy,” Deaton added. “If this becomes just a casino-gambling technology in the view of the public… it’s one extreme to the other.” XRP’s Price Up 44% on 30-Day Window At the height of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s war on Ripple Labs over its XRP tokens, Deaton lobbed powerful amicus briefs at the SEC’s lawyers. He also took to the digital town square on X to combat the SEC’s legal actions and definitions of crypto tokens like XRP. He also ran against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for the US Senate in November but lost in a heavily Democratic state where she is a heavyweight incumbent. XRP’s price on Wednesday notched a 1% gain to $3.23 after retracing from $3.27. The top 3 crypto by market cap was up 44% for the 30-day window.

Solana (SOL): The Fast Lane for Decentralized Apps Solana is a rising star in the blockchain world, focusing on speed and scalability. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana is designed to handle a high number of transactions quickly. This makes it an attractive platform for developers building decentralized applications, or dapps. Its flexible architecture allows coding in multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a broad range of developers. At the heart of Solana’s network is the SOL coin. This cryptocurrency powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. Solana sets itself apart by avoiding complex solutions like sharding or second-layer add-ons to boost speed. Instead, it relies on its efficient design to attract developers and investors. In today’s market, where the need for fast and scalable blockchain solutions is growing, SOL’s technology and potential make it a coin worth watching compared to others. Conclusion SOL’s momentum signals a bullish market, while XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme ecosystem and whale interest position it for potential 20,000% growth, aiming to surpass tokens like PEPE and MOG.

33767162,[object Object],1737624751,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Solana Meme Coins Flood the Market – Best Presales for Crazy Gains in 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/meme-coins-flood-the-market-best-presales-in-2025/,"Solana ($SOL) rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of $294 after Trump launched his official token last week. However, it has since dipped to $249 after failing to break resistance at $272. The spike in trading activity of Solana meme coins was so dramatic that it overwhelmed Coinbase. The platform’s founder, Brian Armstrong, admitted keeping up with it is a ‘scaling challenge.’ Reaching a new ATH would require Solana to address its congestion issue and, perhaps, a new hot meme coin. We picked the best presales that have the potential to become the next 100x token. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) Could Be Solana’s Scalability Savior Solaxy ($SOLX) launched just in time to save Solana from its scalability pitfalls. By offloading a substantial part of transactions to its proprietary Layer-2 network, Solaxy could speed up processing, lower fees, and mitigate failed transfers. Whether the timing is strategic or lucky, Solaxy has attracted a lot of attention from the Solana community and raised $13.5M in its first month on presale. One $SOLX now costs $0.00161, but the price is set to increase in seven hours. This is the lowest entry opportunity into a project that could help $SOL break new records. Early adopters have staked over 4B $SOLX so far at a 281% APY. One-fourth of all tokens are allocated to community rewards to build loyalty, and another 30% to the ecosystem’s continuous development. 2. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Frog Battalion Is Ready to Storm the Market, 24 Days Left to Join Whales have a significant influence on the market and can manipulate retail investors to their advantage. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) assembles a degen army to level the playing field. $WEPE’s frog battalion will share market insights and trading strategies to outsmart the big fish. The project’s tokenomics model prioritizes community rewards and marketing to grow $WEPE’s following and encourage engagement. Wall Street Pepe’s token presale raised an impressive $57M and will end in 24 days. Investors tired of whales conspiring in insider groups have the last chance to join the battle at a final price of $0.0003665. FOMO is building up as the presale draws to a close. Yesterday, one investor made two transactions of $367K and $133K , which suggests they recognize $WEPE’s potential and expect it to surge after listings. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) Helps Diversify Your Meme Coin Portfolio with 4 Curated Baskets New meme coins launch every day, and knowing which ones will make it to the top is virtually impossible. Meme Index ($MEMEX) simplifies meme coin investment with four baskets that cater to different risk tolerance levels. Titan Index is for risk-averse investors who prefer established meme coins like $DOGE and $SHIB. Moonshot and MidCap include mid-volatility tokens, and the Frenzy Index features assets with the highest risk-reward ratio. On top of exclusive access to the four indexes, $MEMEX holders gain governance rights. Anyone can submit and vote on proposals regarding the project’s development or particular basket. One $MEMEX now costs $0.0154693 on presale, but the price will increase tomorrow. Given the project’s innovative approach and the growing demand for meme coins, $MEMEX has a strong potential to explode 10x after listing. 4. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Democratizes AI with Proof of Intelligence AI is the hottest trend of 2025 – we see it everywhere, from Samsung phones to face care products. But Lightchain AI ($LCAI) appears to have rolled out something truly useful. Its Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus protocol rewards nodes with $LCAI tokens for sharing their computational power to train AI models and optimize tasks. The project also plans to roll out an AI-powered meme coin launchpad and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) to help developers build complex decentralized apps. To top it all off, $LCAI token holders have a say in key decisions related to the project’s development. Lightchain AI has raised $12.6M so far, a significant part of which will go toward ecosystem upgrades. The 4 Best Presales You Can’t Miss The altcoin season is only getting started, and smart investors flock to early-stage projects that could bring them exponential returns. Solaxy, Wall Street Pepe, Meme Index, and Lightchain AI are some of the best presales this year due to their unique missions and approaches. However, remember that no gains are guaranteed.

With the launch, AI Mafia seeks to promote networking and raise awareness in regard to some critical blockchain issues. The #PolitiFAI movement Looking forward, one of AI Mafia’s chief goals is to lead the #PolitiFAI movement, an initiative that blends politics, AI, and decentralized finance ( DeFi ) to promote more mainstream uses of AI. As part of the initiative and its broader mission to promote AI as a public good, AI Mafia now focuses on educating and reshaping the socio-political landscape, bringing it more in line with the philosophies propagated by Peter Thiel, Elon Musk , and Andrew Yang. Ultimately, the platform seeks to challenge the growing power of centralized AI monopolies like OpenAI , which are often characterized by a lack of transparency, as noted in the AI Mafia manifesto : “Join us or get left behind in the dustbin of history. The future belongs to those who dare to seize it — and we’re here to make sure it’s ours for the taking.” As an alternative, AI Mafia proposes a trustless system built on 0G’s Layer-1 ( L1 ) blockchain, which prioritizes open systems, collaboration, and accountability. AI activism With the launch of 0G’s blockchain, AI Mafia opens a window of opportunities for political, autonomous, and scalable AI agents that can help educate their audience and reshape the industry more efficiently. Naturally, the launch also underscores the growing need for more verifiable systems to ensure accountability and prevent misuse. As AI continues to shape society at all levels, from policymaking to defense, AI Mafia thus emphasizes its commitment to an open-source revolution powered by AI networks, The post AI Mafia launches world’s first blockchain-based AI activist agent appeared first on Finbold .",Cryptocurrency news|AI|blockchain|DeFi,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Finbold', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",finbold,2025-01-23 09:33:08

The House Bill 1447 was submitted on January 15 to the state legislature, after 103 state residents reported $6.5 million in losses to crypto scams in 2023. The bill is primarily sponsored by Representative Steve Swiontek and aims to create key consumer protections to combat such frauds. The proposed legislation would restrict daily ATM withdrawals to $1,000 per day, the bill read. Additionally, it would cap transaction fees at $5 or 3% of the total amount, whichever is higher. Lisa Kruse, commissioner of the North Dakota Department of Financial Institutions, reminded about the increasing crypto-related fraud complaints from residents. On Wednesday, Kruse addressed the House Industry, Business, and Labor Committee, stressing the $6.5 million in losses in 2023. Per an FBI report in September 2024, Americans lost $5.6 billion to cryptocurrency fraud in 2023 alone . Besides, 5,500 fraud cases involved cryptocurrency ATMs, resulting in losses of over $189 million. During the Wednesday Committee hearing , Swiontek noted that currently crypto ATMs lack the protection measures that traditional money ATMs have. “Unfortunately, this has allowed criminals to exploit them for theft,” Swiontek added. Bill to Protect Elderly Residents From Crypto Fraud Meanwhile, Josh Askvig, North Dakota director of the American Association of Retired Persons, said that the legislation would help elderly residents from falling prey to crypto scams. The bill noted that along with ATMs displaying warning about fraud, the machines would also advise users to contact law enforcement in case of scam detection. The note would also include a cautionary message that funds lost in fraud may not be recoverable. Kevin Lolli from crypto ATM operator CoinFlip said at the hearing that the company is opposing the bill’s fee and transaction limits clause. However, he expressed support to the proposed consumer protection. Lolli told the state lawmakers that the reduced fee would affect ATM operators in covering various expenses. These include costs involved with the hardware and maintenance and rental to local businesses hosting the machine. ATM operators typically charge a fee between 8% and 20%, he added.

As blockchain activity exploded last year, fees went through the roof, hitting $6.89 billion, according to a CoinGecko report . Ethereum ( ETH ) stayed way ahead of the pack, pulling in a massive $2.48 billion in gas fees. TRON ( TRX ) wasn’t far behind, pulling in $2.15 billion in fees, a huge leap from 2023. CoinGecko analysts point to TRON’s strong grip on the stablecoin market as the main driver, with monthly earnings steadily climbing throughout the year. On average, Ethereum made $6.79 million daily, while TRON followed with $5.89 million.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin ( BTC ), with its 15.9% growth in fees, earned $922.89 million in total. CoinGecko says the surge was driven by “increased activity from Ordinal NFTs, BRC-20 and Rune tokens, as well as rapidly growing interest to build on Bitcoin.” In the layer-2 space, Coinbase’s network Base led the charge, earning $84.78 million in fees in 2024, marking a 548.2% increase from the previous year. While Ethereum still dominates fee earnings, other layer-2s like Arbitrum, Linea, and Optimism are making their mark with $44.10 million, $39.20 million, and $37.97 million, respectively. CoinGecko says that fluctuations in layer-2 fee earnings “for now seem to mainly reflect on-chain activity driven by token airdrop and incentive marketing programs,” adding that “it remains to be seen how much fees layer-2 chains can earn in the long term.” Read more: How layer 1 blockchains are leading the 2024 bull run – and who’s winning",News|Base|Bitcoin|CoinGecko|Ethereum|Layer 2|Solana|Tron,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|BTC|AIRDROP|SOL,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-23 09:38:37

Rollblock (RBLK) Staking Rewards Will Create An Army Of Hodlers Rollblock ( RBLK ) just passed $1 million in inflows as it races through stage nine of its promising presale token launch. Rollblock is a brand-new player in the $500 billion online gaming market and is set to shake things up with its mission to bring transparency back to this industry that is sorely in need of innovation. By inscribing all transactions securely onto the Ethereum blockchain, Rollblock can guarantee that its gamers won’t be manipulated – a common complaint among users of traditional gaming platforms. Rollblock has seen incredible growth, recording a 600% surge in new signups and more than 45,000 investors registered for its presale. More than 7,000 games are currently available on the site, plus a brand-new sports betting league that has added yet another valuable revenue stream. All these immersive gaming experiences are powered by RBLK – the native token of Rollblock. RBLK can be staked for huge APY, meaning that holders will be incentivized to stay away from the sell button. Each week, the platform will take up to 30% of its operating profits to buy up RBLK, burning 60% of these to create a deflationary spiral that will make RBLK scarcer. The remaining 40% is returned as staking rewards allowing investors to build a passive income. Ethereum (ETH) Up 4% As Foundation Announces DeFi Initiative Ethereum has finally started to move, rallying by 4.3% this week to reach $3.33K. This follows a period of relative stability for Ethereum, which has actually seen it underperform the wider crypto recovery. Recently, the Ethereum Foundation launched a new initiative, moving 50,000 Ethereum tokens to various DeFi platforms. This will provide a consistent yield for the Ethereum ecosystem and has come about after much criticism over the Ethereum Foundation’s regular sales of Ethereum in recent years. Without this selling pressure, Ethereum could break $4K in the coming weeks. Solana (SOL) Soars Amid Trump Token Mania Solana has had an incredible week of price action, adding 35% to its token price to trade at $252 at the time of writing. Solana recently broke a new all-time high as it shot up to $295 during the Trump token launch. Solana recently topped Coinbase’s list of the most purchased cryptocurrencies, with an alleged 161,000 buyers stepping up to buy Solana in just 24 hours. The Solana chain was recently responsible for over 75% of all transactions across all blockchains – a remarkable feat. If Solana can continue its dominance, then a four-figure price tag is inevitable. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Pinning Their Hopes On TREAT Shiba Inu has put in a red candle this week, declining by 1.7% to reach $0.000021. The price of Shiba Inu has been relatively flat throughout January and Shiba Inu holders are likely watching the rest of the market pump and wondering if this meme token has any more juice in the tank. The SHIB team recently announced a generous airdrop to the Shiba Inu community to launch the TREAT token. This went live across major exchanges this week and rewards users of the Shiba Inu chain for interacting and trading. Holders of Shiba Inu will hope that this will invigorate the ecosystem and propel it back into the crypto top 10 before long. Rollblock Will Outrun These Large Caps In 2025 Rollblock (RBLK) is seeing unprecedented demand for its presale tokens at just $0.046. Holders of Ethereum, Solana, and Shiba Inu have already begun the rotation into Rollblock, and this will only accelerate as the market wakes up to Rollblock’s huge potential for growth in 2025. With momentum snowballing, experts anticipate a massive 800% presale rally followed by a huge surge once Rollblock hits major exchanges.

However, Goldman Sachs cannot embrace Bitcoin at the moment due to regulatory constraints, Solomon quipped. BTC Doesn’t Threaten US Dollar Speaking during a Wednesday interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box , Goldman’s boss, David Solomon, said Bitcoin is not in competition with the United States dolla r. “I don’t see Bitcoin as a threat to the US dollar,” Solomon opined. “At the end of the day, I’m a big believer in the U.S. dollar… [and] Bitcoin is a speculative asset, an interesting speculative asset, I don’t think there’s a lot more to ask about this, though.” Solomon’s statements come at a time when the crypto community is keen to see whether President Donald Trump will fulfill his promise to create a national Bitcoin reserve, a key pledge during his re-election campaign. When asked whether Goldman Sachs’ approach towards cryptocurrency will change under the new Trump regime, Solomon noted that the banking institution has already been leveraging Bitcoin’s underlying technology, blockchain, to reduce friction within financial systems. “Well, first, you know, we’ve had this conversation a number of times. The underlying technology is something we’ve spent a lot of time on. It’s something that we’re utilizing and testing to create less friction in the financial system. Super important,” the banker posited. However, Goldman Sachs still can’t get involved with Bitcoin from a regulatory perspective. “At the moment, from the regulatory perspective, we can’t own, we can’t principle, we can’t be involved with Bitcoin,” Solomon said, suggesting possible changes if the regulatory structure evolves. Solomon echoed a similar sentiment last month, indicating that Goldman Sachs’ ability to participate in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading is currently limited due to regulatory restrictions. However, the bank is open to assessing the opportunity to engage in market-making for these digital assets if the regulatory environment shifts. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs was the second-biggest holder of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust , according to the bank’s latest SEC filing for the quarter ending September 30. Goldman also had $79.5 million in the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF, $35.1 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and $56.1 million in the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Goldman Sachs|U.S,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-23 09:39:59

XRP Eyes Next Resistance Level Amid Market Growth XRP is currently trading between $2.39 and $3.46, showing significant activity in the market. Over the past month, it has seen a price increase of over 40%, and an impressive gain of more than 400% over the last six months. The Simple Moving Averages for 10 and 100 days are closely aligned at around $3.17, indicating a stable trend. The Relative Strength Index is just below 50, suggesting a neutral market sentiment, while the Stochastic indicator is near the oversold territory at approximately 22. These signals imply that the bears may be losing momentum, potentially paving the way for the bulls to take over. Looking ahead, XRP is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.97. If it manages to break through this point, the next target would be the second resistance level at $5.03. Surpassing this level could represent a substantial percentage increase from current prices. Given the recent positive price changes and the technical indicators, XRP has the potential to continue its upward trajectory. However, if the price falls, the nearest support level is at $1.83, providing a safety net before the second support at $0.757. Overall, XRP’s price movement suggests that it might be poised for further growth in the coming period. Solana’s Price Rises with Bullish Momentum Ahead of Altcoin Season Solana (SOL) has seen its price rise recently, moving within a range of $182.53 to $308.44. Over the past week, the price increased by 35.68%, and over the past month, it’s up by 41.10%. These gains suggest that bulls are gaining strength in the market. Technical indicators support this bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 56.03, indicating positive market sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is 2.935, pointing to upward momentum. If this trend continues, Solana could test the nearest resistance level at $364.82. Reaching this level would represent a potential increase of about 43% from the current price. If momentum carries the price to the second resistance level at $490, that would be an increase of approximately 92%. These levels could be reached if bulls maintain control. Cardano (ADA) Sees Stable Trading with Potential for Price Growth Cardano (ADA) is trading between $0.86 and $1.15. Over the past month, the price increased by 11.45%, though it declined by 1.50% in the last week. Indicators suggest the coin is close to oversold conditions, which might lead to a price rebound. If the price rises above the resistance level at $1.30, it could reach the next resistance at $1.59, which is about a 59% increase from the current price. Support levels are at $0.72 and $0.43. The average prices over the past 10 and 100 days are close to the current price, indicating stability. Breaking above resistance levels may lead to higher prices. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis and Potential Growth Levels Chainlink (LINK) is trading between $19.23 and $28.02. In the past week, it gained 25.67%, and over the past month, it rose 15.99%. Over six months, the price increased by 97.88%. The current price is near the resistance level at $31.74, with support at $14.16. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $26.28, and the 100-day SMA is $24.90. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 45.24, indicating a neutral market. The MACD level is 0.1368, suggesting slight upward momentum. If LINK surpasses the resistance at $31.74, it may reach the next resistance at $40.52, which is about 62% above the current price. Traders are monitoring these levels amid expectations of an upcoming altcoin season and a global crypto bull run. Conclusion Though XRP, SOL, ADA, and LINK are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends sports and memes, aiming for massive growth and active community participation during this bull market.

39328825,https://crypto.news/?p=14329873,1737625338,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/39328825.jpeg,"PENGU rallies ahead of Abstract mainnet launch, but potential correction looms",https://crypto.news/pengu-rallies-ahead-of-abstract-mainnet-launch-but-potential-correction-looms/,"After bottoming out earlier in the week, PENGU continued its recovery on Jan. 23 with a sharp rally, fueled by community anticipation of the Abstract mainnet launch and related speculation. The Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) token rose 8.7% to an intraday high of $0.0264 on Jan. 23, making it one of the top performers among the largest 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap per CoinGecko. With a market cap that surpassed $1.6 billion, the meme coin witnessed a 20% jump in daily trading volume, hovering over $411 million. PENGU’s recent rally came despite the broader NFT token market falling 3.8% over the past day, with popular projects such as Floki ( FLOKI ) and Apecoin ( APR ) witnessing steep losses of 16.2% and 10.9% over the past week. The key driver that helped PENGU buck the broader trend was growing anticipation holders regarding the launch of Abstract, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by Igloo Inc., the parent company behind both PENGU and the Pugy Penguins NFT collection. Pudgy Penguins is expected to launch on Abstract alongside other projects, and there are rumours that PENGU holders will be eligible for an airdrop of the layer 2 network’s native token during its token generation event. You might also like: NFT sales enjoy modest bump to $164.3m, Azuki dethrones Pudgy Penguins with 268% surge While these rumors have not been officially confirmed, Abstract has announced a January mainnet launch without specifying a date, leaving only a few days for the launch to materialize as the month approaches its end. The surge in PENGU’s price implies that investors are positioning themselves early, anticipating potential benefits from the upcoming network launch. Another factor potentially adding fuel to the rally could be the jump in its non-fungible token sales . According to CryptoSlam data , Pudgy Penguin sales rose by almost 80% on Jan. 23, making it the sixth best-performing NFT collection. Its daily transactions jumped by 100% to 16. PENGU technical analysis Although the current momentum is pushing PENGU higher, technical indicators suggest that a potential price correction may be on the horizon. PENGU price, Bollinger Bands and Chaikin Money Flow chart — Jan. 23 | Source: crypto.news On the 1-day PENGU/USDT price chart, the meme coin’s price was close to the lower Bollinger Band, which means that bears were in control and could lead to further losses if selling pressure builds up. Combined with the Relative Strength Index at 41, which also signals a bearish momentum but not yet an oversold condition, the market may experience additional downward pressure unless buying interest picks up to counteract the trend. PENGU Supertrend and RSI chart — Jan. 23 | Source: crypto.news The Supertrend line stood above the asset’s price, while the Chaikin Money Flow, with a negative reading, indicated buying pressure was waning. Based on these indicators, PENGU could soon face a pullback, potentially retracing to its local support at $0.022. A drop below this level could push it further toward its psychological support at $0.020. However, one potential catalyst that could invalidate this scenario is ongoing speculation that President Donald Trump could soon end capital gains tax on crypto profits for U.S.-based cryptocurrencies. Projects developed by U.S. companies like Igloo Inc. could see significant upside if such rules are enforced.

According to a report from local media outlet Money UDN, the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission wants to introduce a draft law covering virtual asset service provision or VASP. One of the major highlights included is a law that would allow banks to issue their own stablecoins . Chairman of the Taiwan FSC, Peng Jinlong, stated that stablecoins will be used as a bridge that connects the gap between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, making it easier for investors to access the crypto trading market. In the case of Taiwan, stablecoins issued by local banks will be pegged to the new Taiwan dollar instead of the U.S. dollar. Peng said that all locally-issued stablecoins will be jointly managed by the Taiwan central bank. Director of the central bank in Taiwan, Zhuang Xiuyuan, criticized the popular stablecoins circulating on the market, such as Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ). He said that those stablecoins are often declared as legitimate U.S dollar assets by the firms issuing them, not by the government. Therefore, all future stablecoins issued by Taiwan firms must first be approved by the FSC before launching on the market. You might also like: Taiwan regulator approves foreign crypto ETFs for professional investors In order for stablecoins to gain approval from the Taiwan FSC, they must meet certain requirements, including including issuer firm qualifications, token reserve allocation and many more that will be stipulated in the draft law. When asked whether Taiwan citizens will be able to use stablecoins for every day transactions, moving from the virtual economy into the “real” economy, Zhuang said that there are still certain hurdles such as monetary policy and financial stability that need to be further resolved by the central bank. As previously reported by crypto.news, the Taiwan FSC reportedly planned to create a pilot program for banks to offer crypto custody services, expected to start applications in the first quarter of 2025. Taiwan’s regulations for virtual assets, titled “VASP Registration Regulations” reportedly came into effect in early January 2025. These set of rules are meant to regulate virtual asset service providers, such as crypto exchanges, trading platforms, and crypto custodians. Under the new rules, VASPs must adhere to strict anti-money laundering protocols and submit annual risk assessment reports.

The titular cryptocurrency peaked above $109k and is on its way to the psychological 120k mark. The trending crypto news should be upward, but the altcoins have been slow to respond to the Trump presidency so far. This could be a case of tokens eagerly waiting to break out. XRP has a great chance of going even bigger on the back of a Trump presidency, and Algorand (ALGO) is doing its best to carry November’s momentum forward into 2025. The real winner this altcoin season seems to be Rollblock, a new online casino that is now in presale. Let’s go see which of the trending cryptos are worth investing in. Rollblock (RBLK): Trending crypto casino goes big Regarding altcoins, finding a token with genuine utility is a surefire way to ensure returns. This is one of the reasons Rollblock’s RBLK token is getting so much attention. The online gambling market is worth over $500 billion annually, and the capacity to invest in this lucrative industry is the game-changing option Rollblock offers. With Rollblock’s trending crypto presale, retail investors can now grab a piece of the online gambling pie and, what’s more, can earn dividends! This is the unique selling point of this new altcoin: it pays out a weekly dividend from the income generated by Rollblock’s online casino! That’s a great reason to invest in this trending crypto casino. XRP (XRP): The Top Trending Crypto Threatens To Go Even Higher XRP has been the success story of 2024 and staged the comeback of the decade after Trump’s election win. But investors are now asking if the top trending crypto can trend even more skywards. The answer, surprisingly, seems to be yes! While XRP has skyrocketed on the back of the Trump victory, the XRP price action is sustained thanks to the doors of mass adoption now open to this altcoin. XRP has been waiting in the wings for regulatory certainty to begin its mission: integrate into international banking systems to make international payments easier and quicker. Some Asian markets have already declared XRP a binding system going forward, a move that will see much of the world following suit. Algorand (ALGO): Established Altcoin Trying To Build On Momentum. Algorand has never exceeded its launch price of $4.77 since it hit the markets in 2019, but it has seen an appreciable spike in 2021. Still, this altcoin has not done much to endear investors to its cause. Anyone who has held Algorand since the start is on a dead loss, but recent adopters have reason to smile. Algorand has been up nearly 400% since election day and is giving bullish signals across the altcoin markets. But unlike XRP, it does not seem Algorand is sustainable, and it has already lost enough market cap to lose a ranking place to Mantle (MNT). It seems Algorand’s Cinderella story was short-lived. Conclusion It’s easy to get bullish on the upwards-trending cryptos, but not everything that glitters is gold. Algorand may serve as a cautionary tale, but there’s also reason for great optimism! XRP and Rollblock are outpacing even Bitcoin and will make great returns in the year ahead. Rollblock is now available at $0.046 directly from their website.

The altcoins have also turned red on a daily scale, with ETH sliding to $2,300, DOGE dropping to $0.35, and ADA losing the $1 level. BTC Slips The weekend went quite favorably for the primary cryptocurrency, as its price remained above $100,000 during the TRUMP-token wild ride. The landscape was quite different on Monday, at least during the morning Asian trading session. BTC headed south as the day started and dumped from $106,000 to just under $100,000. After this massive price decline, though, came the bounce-off, which propelled the cryptocurrency to over $109,000 for the first time ever. Following the latest all-time high, bitcoin started to lose value , which culminated during the Trump inauguration speech. As he failed to mention crypto or bitcoin even once, BTC slumped by several grand once again. Nevertheless, it recovered some ground on Wednesday and stood at around $105,000. The past 24 hours have been painful again, as BTC now sits at around $102,000. Its market cap has taken a hit, but it is still above $2 trillion, while the dominance over the alts is north of 55% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts in Red Most alternative coins have headed south in the past 24 hours. Ethereum is close to breaking below $3,200 after a 2.6% daily decline. A similar decrease has pushed SOL to well below $250, while DOGE and ADA have dropped by more than 3%. Chainlink has lost the most value from the larger-cap alts, dropping by 6% to under $25. Next in line in this adverse ranking are AVAX, SUI, and XLM, as well as PEPE, AAVE, VET, and CRO from the mid-cap alts.

In a recent X post, Ki Young Ju said that China has likely sold 194,000 Bitcoin, which has dampened the investors’ sentiment. Notably, this also contradicts the recent global trend of soaring BTC adoption and the US possibly exploring to creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Bitcoin News: CryptoQuant CEO Makes Bold Claim On China’s BTC Sale In a recent X post, CryptoQuant CEO said that China has likely sold its Bitcoin holdings, which has sparked discussions in the market. In other words, Ki Young Ju’s recent statement raises questions about the fate of Bitcoin seized during the 2019 PlusToken scam . Notably, Ju argued that China had sold the entire stash of 194,000 BTC, despite official claims of transferring it to the national treasury. He emphasized, “A censored regime holding censorship-resistant money feels unlikely.” Source: Ki Young Ju, X Meanwhile, to bolster his argument, Ju pointed to on-chain data suggesting that Bitcoin was mixed and distributed through exchanges like Huobi. He questioned the use of mixers if the intention wasn’t to sell the cryptocurrency. This theory aligns with suspicions that the Chinese government liquidated these assets to secure fiat funds. Bitcoin Holding Data Fuels Discussions Despite the CryptoQuant CEO’s assertions, some data suggests that China still holds 194,000 BTC, making it the second-largest Bitcoin holder after the United States. A user responding to Ju’s post presented a chart supporting this claim. Source: JerryYun44, X However, the CryptoQuant founder dismissed these reports, reiterating his faith in blockchain analysis over official statements. He stated: “On-chain data tells a different story: they sold everything, using mixers to distribute funds across exchanges in 2019. I trust on-chain, not the CCP.” This discrepancy highlights the opacity of government-held cryptocurrency transactions and fuels debate over China’s true Bitcoin position . Besides, it also adds to market uncertainty, which has already forced investors to move cautiously amid the broader crypto market selloff . Bitcoin Gains Traction In Global Market Despite the latest Bitcoin news, the flagship crypto remained on the global investors’ radar lately. However, the CryptoQuant CEO’s claims come at a time after the US reportedly sold $6.7 billion worth of Bitcoin, pressuring the broader crypto market. Such large-scale liquidations contribute to market volatility, dampening investor confidence. Having said that, if China indeed sold its Bitcoin reserves, it may further impact BTC’s price trajectory. Meanwhile, Bitcoin adoption is also gaining momentum worldwide, with discussions about a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve signaling institutional interest. What’s Next For BTC? BTC price today was down about 2.5% and exchanged hands at $102,323 and its trading volume slipped 19% to $60 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $105.5K while falling to as low as $101.5K. Further, Bitcoin Futures Open Interest fell 2% reflecting the hovering market uncertainty. Meanwhile, the speculation around China’s Bitcoin reserves fuels further concerns about BTC’s market dynamics. While on-chain data appears to support Ju’s theory, the lack of official confirmation keeps the debate alive. Notably, as global leaders are increasing their focus towards the flagship crypto, this recent revelation has dampened the investors’ sentiment. However, despite that, market experts remained confident about the long-term trajectory of the coin, especially after Trump’s inauguration. Although the US President skipped mentioning BTC or crypto during his inauguration, which impacted the crypto market, experts remain hopeful. For context, Coinbase CEO anticipates increasing investment into the crypto sector under Trump’s presidency. However, as BTC continues to slump, a recent Bitcoin price analysis hints at key levels to watch for the crypto.

Notably, the launch of tokens representing the personal images of U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife Melania has drawn attention to politically-themed digital currencies. For those interested in trading such assets, BYDFi crypto exchange has emerged as a preferred platform due to its asset protection measures, low fees, and strong reputation. BYDFi has now launched Perpetual Contract Trading for $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens, offering spot trading , perpetual contracts , and perpetual copy trading. Traders have the chance to utilize leverage ranging from 1x to 50x, providing opportunities to tailor strategies based on market dynamics. Additionally, BYDFi offers a $8,100 USDT welcome bonus to help new users mitigate initial investment risks and provide more funding for future trades. The platform supports fiat deposits in over 150 countries, allowing users to easily purchase cryptocurrencies via credit or debit cards. For more details, users can visit the BYDFi website or contact customer support. SEC's Historic Shift: A New Era of Crypto Regulation and the Rise of Political Memecoins On January 20, 2025, the resignation of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler was followed by the announcement of the creation of a cryptocurrency-focused task force led by Hester Peirce. A steadfast supporter of the crypto community, Hester Peirce made it clear that what the crypto industry needs is clear regulation and transparent rules, not excessive intervention. Against this backdrop, this development helped politically-themed memecoins $TRUMP and $MELANIA gain more visibility in the market. $TRUMP , the official Memecoin launched just ahead of Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration, is built on the Solana blockchain. The token not only symbolizes Trump’s supporters but also represents the intersection of politics and cryptocurrency. Within just 48 hours, $TRUMP’s market cap briefly exceeded $10 billion. Though it has since been corrected, it remains one of the top three Memes globally, surpassing $Pepe. Currently priced at 42.205, it has seen a staggering 800% increase from its lowest price (within less than four days). Recently, U.S. asset management firm Rex Shares filed for an ETF based on $TRUMP, highlighting the growing interest from traditional investors in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Melania Trump also launched her own Memecoin, $MELANIA. This token capitalizes on the influence of the Trump family to attract supporters of the former president, while tapping into the broader trend of political cryptocurrency. The launch of $MELANIA caused a stir in the market, attracting over $2 billion in investments within 24 hours and sending its price soaring to over $10. Built on the Solana blockchain, $MELANIA also contributed to increased transaction volume and attention on the Solana network (current price: $257.45, market cap: $125.3 billion). The launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA Memecoins represents not only a commercialization attempt by political figures but also a snapshot of a broader societal phenomenon. The brand effect of Donald Trump and Melania Trump has undoubtedly brought substantial attention and capital inflows to these Memecoins. As the popularity of these tokens rises, so does the spread of fraudulent activities, becoming an increasing risk in the market. Leading up to and following President Trump’s inauguration, counterfeit Trump and Melania tokens, along with fake websites themed around $TRUMP and $MELANIA, flooded the market. Many malicious actors exploited these fake tokens, stealing $4.8 million from 12,641 wallets within just 24 hours. BYDFi urges users to obtain project information through official channels and to always use secure and reliable trading platforms to ensure the safety of their funds. BYDFi's Strict Auditing and Security Assurance BYDFi always prioritizes the safety of its users' assets. For every token listed on the platform, BYDFi conducts rigorous audits to ensure that only tokens meeting high security standards are allowed for trading.

Furthermore, all user assets are stored in offline multi-signature wallets, with each account holding a reserve of at least 1:1, and regular Proof of Reserves (POR) reports are published to provide greater transparency for the platform's assets. Michael, the co-founder of BYDFi, stated: ""Political Memecoins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA represent a market phenomenon where speculation and risk profit. While they have attracted significant attention from investors, ensuring fund security and mitigating market risks remain critical concerns for every investor. BYDFi boasts a strict risk control system, robust security measures, and advanced infrastructure to safeguard user assets. At BYDFi, users can trade cryptocurrency with confidence, enjoying safe, transparent, and efficient services.""

This announcement could bring significant changes, providing clarity on crypto regulations. Amidst this Larry Fink CEO of BlackRock believes Bitcoin could rise $700,000. Trump’s Plan for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve One of Trump’s big promises is to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the United States. He aims to ensure that the U.S. government keeps all the Bitcoin it currently holds and adds more in the coming years. He plans to collect 1 million Bitcoins, which would account for 5% of the total Bitcoin supply worldwide, over five years. This idea has already gained traction in several states. Places like Florida, Wyoming, and Massachusetts have introduced bills to include Bitcoin in their state reserves. For states, holding Bitcoin is crucial as they cannot print money like the federal government. This makes Bitcoin a strong option for securing their financial future. Clearer Crypto Policies Ahead Crypto experts believe Trump’s administration could introduce policies that make it easier to invest in and use cryptocurrencies. Anthony Pompliano, a well-known crypto advocate, mentioned three important areas where changes could happen: Bank Support for Crypto: Allowing banks to safely hold cryptocurrencies for their customers. U.S. Bitcoin Purchases: Creating a framework for the government to buy Bitcoin as part of its reserves. Tax Reforms: Simplifying taxes on crypto transactions, especially removing capital gains taxes on purchases made with Bitcoin. These steps could boost confidence in the market and make the U.S. a leader in the global crypto space. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Many experts are hopeful about Bitcoin’s future. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, believes Bitcoin could become a haven during economic struggles. He predicts that if more institutions start using Bitcoin, its price could rise to $500,000 or even $700,000. With Trump’s upcoming announcement and growing interest from states and institutions, the crypto market could see significant changes in the coming days.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-23 09:53:22

The one-time independent presidential candidate and Donald Trump ’s nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services did not voluntarily publish its contents during his run for the White House — although the disclosures he was required to file did give a small glimpse into his holdings. As a scion of one of America’s wealthiest families and a successful lawyer, it stands to reason that Kennedy invests in the financial markets. That thesis was confirmed on January 21 — as Robert F. Kennedy Jr . had to disclose his holdings to the Office of Government Ethics on account of his nomination to a high-ranking cabinet position. A significant portion of RFK’s investments are in private equity, exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), and money market funds, but he does seem to have somewhat of an appetite for riskier assets — as demonstrated by his stock and cryptocurrency holdings. RFK Jr.’s portfolio holds Bitcoin, big tech, and biotech stocks Per the filing, Robert F. Kennedy’s largest publicly traded holding is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). The presumptive Health Secretary owns between $15,001 and $50,000 worth of AMZN stock. In addition, RFK holds between $1,001 and $15,000 in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock. However, his largest holding by far is Bitcoin ( BTC ) — back in November of 2024, the cabinet nominee revealed that he had put most of his wealth in the digital asset — referring to it as the ‘currency of freedom.’ A staunch advocate, Kennedy had at one point even accused members of Congress of being paid to ban the cryptocurrency . At present, his BTC stake is valued at $1,000,001 to $5,000,000. Public Financial Disclosure Report detailing RFK Jr.’s holdings. Source: Office of Government Ethics RFK Jr. bought BTC in May of 2023 following his speech at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami. The exact timing of the purchase was not known — but since the conference took place from May 18 to May 20, 2023, a time when Bitcoin was trading at a price of roughly $27,118, Kennedy accrued significant returns from his crypto position, as the price of BTC has increased by 276.96% since then. BTC price 5-year chart. Source: Google Finance In addition, RFK’s healthcare skepticism doesn’t appear to extend to gene editing — as the filing reveals a $1,001 to $15,000 stake in CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ: CRSP ). Interestingly enough, although the environmental activist has pledged to divest from his stock holdings , he hasn’t made the same promise when it comes to his cryptocurrency assets. On January 29, the Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing to consider RFK’s nomination. The meeting will likely see a further examination of potential conflicts of interest, as well as Kennedy’s divestment plans.

According to AA, the secondary regulation studies regarding cryptocurrency service providers carried out by the Capital Markets Board have come to an end. With the newly prepared drafts, new rules have been introduced for the establishment, activity and capital adequacy of cryptocurrency service providers. Within the scope of the drafts expected to be published shortly, cryptocurrencies listed on the platforms will not be able to be bought and sold with leverage, and will not be subject to derivative instrument contracts and margin trading, short selling and lending transactions. Apart from this, the principles and fundamentals for the listing of cryptocurrencies have also been determined. It will be mandatory to establish a listing committee that is responsible for making decisions regarding the listing and removal of cryptocurrencies. Speaking about the prepared drafts, Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek said that the draft circulars contain quite detailed and comprehensive elements compared to the regulations of other countries. “As in the world, there is a lot of interest in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Turkey. This makes regulation necessary. The example of risk-based regulation regarding capital is not included in the regulations of other country authorities. These steps we have taken will allow the market to function effectively and create an environment of trust for investors. “We aimed to create a set of rules that give controlled obligations to cryptocurrency service providers, have a clearly defined framework, and are applicable to market actors.” In Turkey, the “Law on Amendments to the Capital Markets Law” for the cryptocurrency ecosystem was accepted by the Turkish Grand National Assembly General Assembly on June 26, 2024 and became law. Thus, the first legal framework for crypto assets was created in Turkey. Related News: New Cryptocurrency Statement from CMB President Ömer Gönül! Pointing to January! *This is not investment advice.

The assets have remained untouched for over 13 years. They are not related to the ~174,000 BTC marketplace confiscated by the US government. ”Back then these were probably dust wallets, now, collectively, they are worth about $47M,” Grogan wrote. However, in his opinion, it is unlikely that Ulbricht kept the private keys to bitcoin addresses somewhere all this time. ‘We'll find out soon enough!’ the expert added. On 21 January, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order granting a full and unconditional pardon to the Silk Road creator. Ulbricht's release was one of the politician's election campaign promises. US authorities arrested the founder of the darknet marketplace in October 2013. In May 2015, US District Judge Catherine Forrest found him guilty of drug trafficking, drug conspiracy, computer network hacking and money laundering, as well as leading a criminal organisation. The platform creator received a double life sentence without parole, of which he served 11 years. Ulbricht's case attracted widespread public attention. More than 250 organisations, celebrities and opinion leaders spoke out in favour of his release. In 2019, prominent venture capitalist Tim Draper was among them.

SUI and AVAX Holders Shift Focus to 100X Potential in 2025,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/is-1fuel-the-new-avalanche-sui-and-avax-holders-shift-focus-to-100x-potential-in-2025/,"The post Is 1Fuel the New Avalanche? SUI and AVAX Holders Shift Focus to 100X Potential in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With a mission to simplify complex cross-chain crypto transactions and make digital asset management available to all in the new golden era of crypto, 1FUEL is making waves as the new Avalanche. With over $1.4 million raised in the early stages of its presale, this groundbreaking new platform has rocketed into 2025. Read on to find out why 100x potential is fuelling 1FUEL’s astronomical trajectory, and why Avalanche and SUI holders are finding this cryptocurrency presale hard to resist. Avalanche: Is The Once Golden Child Of Crypto Being Pushed Out Into The Cold? Exactly 12 months ago, it would have been impossible to bet against Avalanche. Prices were rampaging with month after month after month of growth. That all came to a screeching halt later in the year, with huge losses which saw AVAX give up more than 73% of its value. Today, Avalanche is at a critical juncture, stuck in the mud halfway between resistance and support. Avalanche prices are over 75% below the all-time high, and seem rooted around the $35 marker. Avalanche’s technical signals are also flashing bearish and could fall by a further 20%, so there’s little respite on the horizon for stalwart Avalanche supporters. 1FUEL’s performance is in direct contrast to how AVAX is faring. Firmly established as the best cryptocurrency to buy now, 1FUEL offers Avalanche and Sui investors the chance to experience projected 100x returns. With greater utility, a unique user-friendly interface and exponential potential, its stark differences to Avalanche and Sui make it an eye-catching prospect. SUI: The Layer-1 Blockchain With Meta Connection Is SUI about to surge or crash? That’s the question SUI investors will be asking this month, after the same period last year proved highly beneficial to the coin. SUI prices have been climbing for a while now, culminating in a new all-time high being set earlier this month. As is often the case though, SUI could see its momentum now reverse course, with performance now beneath the trend line. This indicates a bear break which some analysts expect could last until July. This forecast makes now an optimal moment for SUI investors to diversify, with 1FUEL the top contender as the best cryptocurrency to buy now. 1FUEL: 100x Price Potential And Exponential Use Cases With stage three of its presale not yet complete, 1FUEL has already raised over $1.4 million. It has garnered considerable praise from industry experts, with analysts quick to highlight the groundbreaking nature of its one-click, cross-chain crypto transactions. 1FUEL’s unique one-click solution to the traditional complexity has been lauded as a game changer by experts. Many observers have cited the supreme ease of use. There’s a huge buzz within the industry that this aspect alone could make digital asset management an everyday reality for millions of new crypto users worldwide. The high degree of utility is backed by expansive privacy features including an in-built mixer and P2P exchange. Military grade security also enhances asset management, giving complete peace of mind to all users.

Ambani Brings Crypto Innovation to India Through JioSphere,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-to-buy-jiocoin-ambani-brings-crypto-innovation-to-india-through-jiosphere/,"The post How to Buy JioCoin ? Ambani Brings Crypto Innovation to India Through JioSphere appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News JioCoin is now the talk of the town. It has triggered extreme excitement among Indian cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Not many cryptos have created striking headlines on the early stage of its launch itself. Can this crypto redefine the Indian cryptocurrency sector? Here is everything you should know about Reliance Jio’s JioCoin. What’s JioCoin? JioCoin is a digital token developed by Jio and Polygon Labs using Ethereum Layer 2. What makes this digital token different is that it does not operate like classic cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum . It has zero market value, so it cannot be used for cryptocurrency trading. The JioCoin team has not yet clarified whether we will be able to redeem our Jio tokens directly. Experts suggest that we may be able to use our tokens to access various Jio Services, like Jio Mobile Network, Jio Broadband Connection, and even JioMart. How To Earn Jio coin? You can earn JioCoins for free through the JioSphere application, which is the official browsing platform of Jio. Signing up for the JioCoins programme is very simple. Download the JioSphere app, if you do not have it. The app is available on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac and more. Enter the JioSphere app. Go to the profile section and sign up for the JioCoins programme by providing all the required details. Once you complete this process, you will earn JioCoins whenever you use the JioSphere app. JPL’s Partnership with Polygon Labs Jio Platforms CEO Kiran Thomas has expressed his excitement about entering a partnership with Polygon Labs, terming it as a significant milestone in the journey of Jio towards digital excellence. Meanwhile, Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal has called the launch of JioCoins a significant step forwards for Web3 adoption in India. Explaining the tremendous potential of the partnership between Jio and Polygon, Bitinning Founder Kashif Raza , in a recent X post, has emphasised Jio’s potential to bring in at least 400 million people on-chan in the next few months. In conclusion, JioCoin represents an innovative step in India’s Web3 journey. While its current value is zero, its potential utility within the Jio ecosystem and its collaboration with Polygon Labs highlight a vision for mass Web3 adoption. As millions of Indians explore JioSphere, JioCoin could soon play a key role in redefining digital engagement.",News|Altcoins|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,MATIC|ALTCOIN|ETH|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-23 10:01:53

The PayFi project attracts global investors with its innovative approach. The three-week presale of Remittix has delivered a 50% return to investors who joined early. This remarkable growth has not only turned heads but also raised the question: is Remittix the next big thing in crypto? The DeFi project solves market problems by providing simple crypto-to-fiat payment solutions and easy cross-border transactions. It stands as a movement that could transform how people use cryptocurrencies. Trump Goes On Ethereum (ETH) Buying Spree The Ethereum coin is among the most sluggish in the market right now. Its value has been consolidating within a narrow range with some analysts calling it a sleeping giant. CoinMarketCap data shows the value of Ethereum (ETH) has dropped by 8.9% in the last two weeks. Fortunately, the poor price movement has not swayed investors. Ash Crypto reveals that Trump’s World Liberty Finance has bought over $58 million ETH in the past few weeks. This increased accumulation could mean a price surge is on the way. The analyst told his followers that something big is cooking. Besides, a crypto expert called MisterrCrypto notes that the Ethereum crypto has hit rock bottom. They said Trump’s ETH accumulation could spark a rally soon. So, Misterrcrypto advised investors to remain patient. The analyst accompanying their post shows the ETH/BTC pair soaring to $0.11. Poseidon says the Ethereum price might hit $5k before February. Cardano (ADA) Key Support Level To Watch In a recent post on X, a top analyst called InvestingHaven told his followers the value of the Cardano coin could skyrocket in the coming weeks. However, the expert told them to watch out for a key support level at $0.824. InvestingHaven says holding this level could push the Cardano price to a new level. He posted a target of $1.9-$2.5 if this level holds. Meanwhile, another analyst called FLASH posted a similar Cardano price prediction. They say the value of the altcoin could pump to $2 next. Technical indicators like the relative strength index support this potential uptrend. The indicator is above the 50 mark which means that bulls are in control. In the meantime, CoinMarketCap data reveals Cardano (ADA) is showing upward movement on the daily chart. The cryptocurrency is currently consolidating close to the $1 mark and is among the top altcoins that could surge higher in the coming weeks. Investors Jump Into Remittix (RTX) As Price Pumps To New High Remittix (RTX) is a top crypto ICO that has shaken the market in the past few weeks. The project has sold over 270 million RTX coins which shows huge interest from investors. Currently priced at $0.0282, Remittix is the best DeFi cryptocurrency to buy. Its value could increase by 20x in 2025. At its core, Remittix brings cryptocurrency into the mainstream financial world through its innovative cross-border payment solution. This advanced solution helps users and businesses move funds across borders quickly while maintaining low fees and easy transfer methods. The basic design and practical features of Remittix drive its success. Through Remittix Pay API businesses can add cryptocurrency payment options to their business operations regardless of size or location. The business can expand its customer base worldwide while gaining market share and standing out against competitors. Remittix enables companies to create merchant accounts for handling transactions. Through Remittix businesses gain complete control over crypto operations and profit withdrawal while benefiting from multiple currency choices and trading pair access. Remittix combines crypto speed and convenience with traditional banking features to help everyone access global finance and build the future of international money transfers. Investors Rush To This Altcoin For More Profits Remittix has emerged as the best crypto to buy right now. Not only has the RTX coin given investors more than 50% gains, but it can also soar another 20x before the end of the quarter. Therefore, investors interested in purchasing a good cryptocurrency in January 2025 can join the presale before it’s too late.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Experts say that the FX Guys presale could outrun Cardano and Arbitrum in 2025. Find out why. Table of Contents Cardano’s gains positive projections Arbitrum attracts investors with layer-2 scaling solutions FX Guys’ foreign exchange trading platform draws investors FX Guys’ staking mechanism rallies long-term holders Conclusion A new opportunity has opened up for investors, and this time, it could be bigger than Cardano (ADA) and Arbitrum (ARB). FX Guys (FXG) is the foreign exchange trading platform that spikes investors’ interest with its distinct contributions to DeFi and TradFi. Despite Cardano and Arbitrum’s strategic positioning in the market, FX Guys shows the potential to offer better gains. This blockchain trading platform offers features like a Trader Funding Program, Trade2Earn, staking rewards, and much more. Investors are convinced that given FX Guys’ solid fundamentals, in no time, it could boost traders’ profits. Find out why FX Guys could outpace Cardano and Arbitrum with its distinct advantages. Cardano’s gains positive projections Cardano is on the verge of a significant price surge fueled by the project’s upward momentum and increased investor interest. The project’s performance is due to the positive sentiments surrounding Donald Trump’s policies that may foster a pro-crypto regulatory environment. ADA trades at about $1.1, surging over 21.7% within the last seven days due to increased network activity, and experts have some things to say about Cardano. Veteran trader Peter Brandt stated that Cardano is bottomed for a grand bull market as ADA recently broke above its previous high of $0.81. Additionally, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared a similar sentiment, stating that ADA’s chart looked pretty strong. Arbitrum attracts investors with layer-2 scaling solutions Arbitrum solidifies its stance as a leader in Ethereum scaling solutions due to its advanced technology. The project enhances the Ethereum ecosystem by offering lower fees and enhancing transaction speeds. ARB trades at about $0.77, rising over 4% due to increased adoption by investors. Despite Arbitrum’s strong fundamentals, the project is below its previous all-time high of about $2.4 due to the massive sell-offs by short-term traders. Analysts predict that ARB will reach $2 by February, given the positive sentiment toward Donald Trump’s entry into the White House. You might also like: AAVE, TRON investors bet big on FX Guys for impressive PropFi utilities FX Guys’ foreign exchange trading platform draws investors The FX Guys project offers a blend of DeFi and TradFi, providing its users better access to trading opportunities. Despite being in its presale phase, the project has garnered attention with over $3.4 million raised. The FXG presale is in Stage 2, with each token valued at about $0.04, and already over 93% of FXG tokens allocated to this Stage have been sold. The success of FX Guys’ presale draws investors seeking the best DeFi crypto projects to boost their portfolios in 2025. This blockchain trading platform sets itself apart from traditional trading platforms by offering practical solutions to the challenges traders face on their journey. Due to features like Trade2Earn, a Trader Funding program, and staking rewards, experts say that this blockchain trading platform could outpace Cardano and Arbitrum this year. The Trade2Earn feature is the highlight of the FX Guys platform, as it rewards traders with FXG tokens regardless of the outcome of their trades. The goal of this feature is to boost active participation on the platform through incentives whether traders make a loss or profit. This approach makes FX Guys the leading foreign exchange trading platform for those seeking access to better opportunities in the crypto market. FX Guys also offers a Trader Funding Program to facilitate easy access to trading capital. The funding program offers traders up to $500,000 to traders who successfully pass the platform’s challenge phase. Additionally, there is an 80/20 profit split between traders and the FX Guys platform, with 80% going in traders’ favor. FX Guys’ staking mechanism rallies long-term holders Another reason why FX Guys is one of the best DeFi crypto projects is its staking mechanism. This staking mechanism gives investors the opportunity to earn passive income on the platform; hence, long-term investors can benefit from it. As an FXG holder, users can earn up to 20% APY when they lock their tokens for a set time. Conclusion FX Guys’ distinct trading platform earns it a spot among top players like Cardano and Arbitrum; hence, its presale continues to thrive. Analysts predict that once FXG launches at $0.10, early investors will enjoy 233% ROI. To find out more about FXGuys, visit the presale , website, whitepaper , socials , and audit.
