Among them, a Dogecoin (DOGE) whale, known for his strategic moves and significant market influence, has recently turned their attention to an emerging AI altcoin, PCHAIN, currently valued at just $0.01. This shift signals a growing belief in the potential of AI-driven crypto assets to outperform traditional tokens, Ethereum, XRP, DOGE , etc., in 2025. With a focus on innovation and real-world utility, this AI altcoin has captured the interest of both seasoned investors and newcomers eager to capitalize on the next wave in 2025. As the intersection of AI and blockchain technology gains momentum, this low-cost, low-market-cap AI altcoin is positioning itself as a disruptive force in the crypto market. Its unique value propositions, including advanced AI integration for predictive analytics and tokenization of real estate, have set it apart from other projects. Backed by the Dogecoin whale’s endorsement, market analysts forecast that this under-the-radar coin could deliver exponential gains in 2025. This has made this AI altcoin, PCHAIN, a must-watch for investors seeking high-growth opportunities in the evolving crypto market in 2025. PCHAIN: The AI Altcoin with over 43,640% Growth Potential This AI altcoin that has captured the attention of the Dogecoin whale is the utility token of PropiChain. PropiChain is a blockchain-powered real estate tokenization platform designed to power the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. Aside from PCHAIN’s unique value proposition, another major thing that has caught the eye of the Dogecoin whale is the token’s profit potential. According to leading market analysts and experts, this AI-powered real estate altcoin is poised to hit a 43,640% rally. Priced at just $0.01 for its ongoing presale, this crypto asset combines low entry opportunity, robust technology, and real-world utility to drive its market growth. This positions the AI altcoin as a compelling choice for investors seeking low-risk, high-reward opportunities. Dogecoin Whale Backing: What it Means Dogecoin whales are known for their significant influence in the crypto market. These individuals or entities can sway market sentiment and drive price movements by holding substantial amounts of DOGE. When a whale endorses a lesser-known altcoin, it often garners widespread attention and trust among retail and institutional investors alike. The Dogecoin whale’s backing of this AI-powered altcoin suggests confidence in its potential. Like every seasoned crypto investor, the Dogecoin Whale typically conducts thorough research before making substantial investments. This whale considered technology, utility, team credibility, and market trends. This Dogecoin whale endorsement could serve as a catalyst for increased adoption and price appreciation. Why the Dogecoin Whale is Backing this AI Altcoin Here are some key factors that motivated the Dogecoin whale to back PCHAIN for over 43,640% rally in 2025: Growing Market Demand This AI-powered token is an RWA altcoin that bridges the gap between the number one asset class in the world and the blockchain. With the RWA tokenization market projected to grow to $16 trillion , PCHAIN gives investors the early-mover advantage to capitalize on the market. This unique use case has increased the demand for the PropiChain token as investors seek to position themselves for maximum gains in the $16 trillion RWA tokenization market. Affordability Priced at $0.01, this AI-based RWA altcoin offers an accessible entry point for investors. This affordability and its potential for exponential growth make it an attractive prospect for early investors. Real-World Use Cases The altcoin’s roadmap includes applications in the multi-trillion-dollar global property market. By solving the inefficiencies in the property market, PCHAIN establishes its long-term utility and value, unlike DOGE, which thrives on market hype. PropiChain: Your Gateway to the Future Real Estate Property Ownership PropiChain is transforming the property market using advanced technologies to revolutionize property transactions. The platform sets a new benchmark for buying, selling, and investing in real estate with its innovative features. Immersive Virtual Property Tours in the Metaverse PropiChain is reshaping how properties are scouted by utilizing state-of-the-art Metaverse technology. This lets buyers and investors experience properties through fully immersive 3D virtual tours. Investors and buyers can save significant time and resources while still making informed decisions. The platform makes global real estate opportunities accessible to everyone by overcoming geographical constraints. This cutting-edge approach eliminates the logistical challenges of traditional property viewings, enabling instant evaluations without requiring in-person visits. Blockchain-Enabled Smart Contracts At the core of PropiChain’s efficiency is the integration of blockchain-powered smart contracts. These self-executing contracts automate critical real estate processes, such as ownership transfers, lease agreements, and rent collections. By automating these operations, the platform reduces dependency on intermediaries like brokers, offering secure, cost-effective, and seamless transactions. This innovation ensures transparency and trust in every deal. AI-Powered Real Estate Insights PropiChain employs sophisticated artificial intelligence to enhance decision-making in real estate investments. Its AI-driven virtual assistants and chatbots provide round-the-clock support, helping users navigate the market’s complexities easily. Its predictive AI tools also analyze market trends, project property value changes, and deliver actionable recommendations. These data-backed insights empower investors to make smarter, more profitable decisions while minimizing risk. Tokenized Real Estate for Broader Accessibility PropiChain pioneers the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA), transforming real estate properties into digital tokens. This enables fractional ownership of high-value properties, increasing market liquidity and making property investments accessible to a wider audience. This innovative model allows global investors to participate in the property markets, breaking down financial barriers and democratizing individual property ownership, regardless of capital size. PropiChain Presale: Your 43,640% ROI Opportunity PCHAIN’s focus on real-world utility combined with its potential for a 43,640% rally positions it for the top-gamer position in 2025. The Dogecoin whale’s backing is the icing on the cake, further attracting investors. According to market experts, a $1000 investment in the PCHAIN presale would yield over $ 430, 640 ROI in 2025. The Project has raised over $1.3 million in the first presale round and already crossed the $990,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round. This underscores the high confidence of investors in the project’s potential. After this presale round, the token price will rise by over 109% for the third and final presale round. Join the PCHAIN presale now to enjoy over 43,000% ROI in 2025. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , highlighting the project’s readiness to do bigger things in the crypto space.

39297733,https://nulltx.com/?p=140251,1737586834,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,TRUMP Token Crashes 50% Leading Many to a Cheaper Alternative Priced at Only $0.07 Eyeing a Run to $3,https://nulltx.com/the-trump-token-crashes-50-leading-many-to-a-cheaper-alternative-priced-at-only-0-07-eyeing-a-run-to-3/,"The TRUMP token’s fast rise has taken a sharp turn, with its value crashing 50%. While this has sent shockwaves through the market, experienced investors are turning their attention to a more affordable and promising alternative; RCO Finance (RCOF). Currently priced at just $0.07, RCOF is eyeing a potential surge to $3, presenting an opportunity for exponential gains. Unlike volatile memecoins, RCOF offers real-world utility and a robust ecosystem, making it a compelling choice for those seeking stability and growth. The TRUMP Token’s Meteoric Rise and Sudden Fall The TRUMP token’s debut took the crypto world by storm, largely due to its high-profile association with US President-elect Donald Trump. Launched by CIC Digital LLC, the token surged to a peak market cap of $5.5 billion within hours of its launch. For a time, it seemed like the TRUMP token was set to redefine meme coin success stories. However, the euphoria was short-lived as the token’s value plunged by nearly 50%, leaving latecomers scrambling to recover losses. The TRUMP token only emphasizes the volatile nature of meme coins. Prone to speculative hype, these tokens often experience massive initial gains followed by sharp declines. Early investors typically cash out at the peak, leaving others to face significant losses. For instance, after trading at $75, the TRUMP token now sits at $37, highlighting the risk associated with such ventures. This steep decline has sparked a growing interest in emerging assets with intrinsic value, such as RCO Finance (RCOF). Unlike meme coins, with limited use cases, RCOF offers a comprehensive ecosystem designed to deliver real-world financial solutions. RCO Finance is a More Promising Alternative RCO Finance (RCOF) stands out as a beacon of innovation in DeFi. Its ecosystem isn’t just about crypto; it’s about creating a financial hub that empowers users to take control of their wealth. One of RCOF’s standout features is its AI-powered robo-advisor, which provides tailored investment strategies based on market analysis. For instance, an investor seeking to diversify can rely on this tool to identify opportunities across 120,000 assets, including stocks, ETFs, and tokenized real estate. This feature acts as a personal financial guide, making complex investment decisions accessible to everyone. Another game-changer is RCOF’s debit card, which allows users to spend their crypto seamlessly in the real world. This card bridges the gap between digital assets and everyday spending, whether you’re trying to pay for groceries or booking travel. Add to that the platform’s KYC-free model, and users can trade without cumbersome verification processes, offering unparalleled convenience and privacy. Also, features like borrowing and lending enable users to use their assets effectively, while tokenization opens doors to fractional ownership in high-value assets like real estate. Security is paramount in RCOF’s design. The platform has undergone a rigorous audit by SolidProof, ensuring its reliability and transparency. Unlike the speculative nature of the TRUMP token, RCOF provides tangible benefits, making it a smarter choice for long-term investors. The RCOF Presale: Affordable Entry With Exponential Potential For investors looking to get in early, RCOF’s presale offers a golden opportunity. Currently priced at $0.07, the token is projected to reach $3 by 2025, representing a massive growth potential. To put this into perspective, investing just $1,000 at the current price would yield approximately 14,285 tokens. When the price rises to $0.1 in the next presale stage, the value of that investment would increase to $1,428. When RCOF hits $3, those same tokens would be worth over $42,855. This shows the rewards of investing in a value-driven asset. The platform has already raised over $10 million, signaling strong investor confidence. With features designed to address real-world financial needs, RCOF is poised to deliver gains reminiscent of the TRUMP token’s early days, but with far greater stability. Why RCOF Stands Out as the Smart Choice The volatility of the TRUMP token serves as a cautionary tale for crypto investors. While meme coins can deliver short-term gains, they often lack what’s needed for sustained growth. RCO Finance, on the other hand, combines innovation, security, and real-world utility to create a comprehensive financial ecosystem. As the presale continues, now is the time to act. At $0.07, RCOF is at its lowest price, offering a rare chance to secure a position in a project with immense potential. Don’t let the opportunity slip away as this could be the next big thing, delivering gains that rival the TRUMP token’s initial success but with far less risk.

According to a recent filing by the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the previous decision to place sanctions on the digital assets tumbler has been lifted. “It is ordered and Adjudged that the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals District Court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of this Court.” Tornado Cash was first sanctioned by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) after being deemed a threat to the nation’s security as hackers associated with the government of North Korea were believed to have used it to clean stolen funds. Crypto mixers allow users to obfuscate the source of their digital assets by mixing them with other coins from different sources and giving each user back the dollar amount they put in. In November, the court ruled that the OFAC’s sanctions failed to correctly define “property” in their sanctions. He went on to say that if “property” means “capable of being owned,” then Tornado Cash and its smart contracts wouldn’t quality, thus making the sanctions unlawful. “Contrary to the Department’s arguments, the immutable smart contracts are not services. So even when we consider OFAC’s regulatory definitions, the immutable smart contracts are not property because they are not ownable, not contracts, and not services.” News of the landmark ruling caused TORN to spark a massive rally, going from a price of $8.08 on January 21 to a peak of $25.28, a gain of 212%. The token has since retraced and is moving for $19.57 at time of writing.

However, Solana (SOL) remains criticized for its ecosystem rate of inflation and network outages that have plagued the platform. Meanwhile, Remittix is amassing popularity among investors for its pragmatic approach to solving issues in the cross-border payment space. Packing plenty of utility for investors, businesses and individuals, this project is poised to disrupt the PayFi space in 2025. So what are the key features that are drawing so many to Remittix and how will Solana fare over the next quarter? Solana (SOL) Posts Strong Gains In January Solana (SOL) had a slow 2024, causing impatience among many holders, though it has caught a second wind in the first few weeks of January. Solana’s net gain now stands at 61% over the last month with most of that increase over just the last week. Solana’s market cap has stormed back past $100 billion now settling on $124.51 billion. Though it’s not clear how much further Solana (SOL) could go. Despite its successes, some critics of Solana (SOL) are still skeptical of its growth, believing it may face corrective price action in the near future. A New Era for Cross-Border Payments Via the powerful Remittix (RTX) platform, users can convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and transfer funds directly to global bank accounts. Unlike traditional systems laden with hidden fees and unpredictability, Remittix operates with a flat rate pricing model, ensuring that recipients receive exactly what is sent. This straightforward approach and the cost effective structure make Remittix an appealing option for both personal and business use. Crypto Payment Adoption for Businesses Remittix also offers powerful tools for businesses to embrace cryptocurrency as a viable payment option. The Remittix Pay API is an impressive piece of technology, enabling companies to accept crypto payments from their customers while settling transactions in fiat and transferring the funds to their desired bank account. This solution is particularly ideal for individuals and businesses who are aware of the potential of the cryptocurrency market and customer base, but who do not feel comfortable navigating its complexities. User Privacy Another key feature of Remittix (RTX) is its focus on user privacy. Transactions processed through Remittix arrive as conventional bank transfers, completely hiding their cryptocurrency origins. This approach offers both individuals and businesses greater confidence in adopting blockchain solutions without attracting unwanted attention. This is particularly helpful in industries where crypto payments may carry some stigma. Remittix Presale Surpasses $4 Million Raised Currently in its presale phase, Remittix (RTX) is demonstrating potential having already raised over $4 million and maintaining its strong momentum.

So, what features are attracting attention to Remittix, and how might Solana perform in the upcoming months? Solana (SOL) Achieves Significant Gains In January Solana (SOL) endured a sluggish 2024, testing the patience of many of its holders, but it has rebounded strongly in the opening weeks of January. Solana's net gain now stands at 61% over the past month, with the majority of this rise occurring recently. Its market cap has surged beyond $100 billion, currently resting at $124.51 billion. Despite these achievements, some Solana (SOL) critics remain doubtful about its future growth, predicting it might soon encounter a price correction. A New Phase for Global Payments Through the innovative Remittix (RTX) platform, users can convert more than 40 different cryptocurrencies into fiat money, sending it directly to international bank accounts. Unlike traditional systems with hidden fees and uncertainties, Remittix employs a straightforward flat-rate pricing model, ensuring recipients receive exactly the amount sent.

Initially viewed as a digital currency for speculation and investment, crypto has expanded its reach into various sectors, creating unique opportunities that go far beyond just trading. Today, cryptocurrency is shaping new industries, offering innovative solutions to everyday problems, and providing creative ways for individuals to engage with technology. 1. Charitable Donations and Fundraising Cryptocurrency is making waves in the world of philanthropy, offering a new way for individuals and organizations to donate to causes they care about. Crypto donations are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer several advantages over traditional charitable giving methods. One of the biggest benefits is that cryptocurrency donations are often faster and cheaper than traditional payment methods, as they bypass intermediaries like banks and payment processors. Cryptocurrency also allows for greater transparency in donations. Since blockchain technology is public and immutable, charitable organizations can track how funds are being spent, ensuring that donations go directly to the intended cause. This level of transparency builds trust between donors and organizations, making it easier for people to feel confident in their contributions. 2. Crypto Gaming Cryptocurrency is transforming the gaming industry, offering new ways for players to earn rewards and enjoy secure, fast transactions. In play-to-earn (P2E) games, players can earn cryptocurrency or NFTs by participating in in-game activities, allowing them to monetize their time and efforts. These games are built on decentralized networks that ensure transparency and security, with rewards tied to the value of digital assets, which can be traded or used for in-game purchases. Online crypto casinos are also growing in popularity, enabling players to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This provides faster transactions, increased privacy, and a more secure experience than traditional payment methods. Bitcoin casinos offer a wide variety of games, from blackjack to slots, with live dealer options available. With exclusive bonuses and lower fees, crypto casinos are quickly becoming the preferred choice for many players. 3. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Cryptocurrency has introduced a new era of decentralized finance (DeFi), a system that allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their digital assets without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks. DeFi platforms leverage blockchain technology to create open, permissionless financial services that are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Through DeFi, individuals can participate in activities such as yield farming, staking, and liquidity provision . Yield farming allows users to earn passive income by lending their cryptocurrency to others in exchange for interest, while staking involves locking up digital assets in a network to support its security in exchange for rewards. Liquidity provision involves adding funds to a decentralized exchange (DEX) to facilitate trades and earn a share of the transaction fees. 4. Tokenizing Real-World Assets Another innovative application of cryptocurrency is the tokenization of real-world assets. Tokenization refers to the process of converting ownership of real-world assets—like real estate, art, or even stocks—into virtual tokens that can be traded via the blockchain. These tokens represent ownership or a stake in the underlying asset and can be bought, sold, or exchanged with greater ease. For example, a real estate property could be tokenized , with each token representing a fractional share of the property. Investors can then buy or sell these tokens without needing to go through traditional property buying or selling processes, which can be time-consuming and costly. Tokenization opens up investment opportunities to a wider audience, allowing individuals to invest in assets that were previously out of reach due to high entry costs. 5. Digital Identity and Authentication Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are also paving the way for more secure and privacy-focused digital identities. With concerns over data privacy and security becoming increasingly prevalent, blockchain-based identity solutions are gaining traction. These decentralized digital identities give individuals greater control over their personal information and reduce the risk of data breaches. Blockchain-powered digital identity systems can be used for a variety of purposes, including secure login processes, online voting, and identity verification in financial services. By using cryptographic methods to secure personal data, these systems allow users to authenticate their identity without relying on centralized institutions or risking their sensitive information being compromised. 6. Tokenized Rewards and Loyalty Programs Loyalty programs have long been a staple of consumer engagement, but cryptocurrency is now transforming how rewards and incentives are offered. Brands are exploring ways to tokenize loyalty points, offering customers cryptocurrency-based rewards that can be redeemed across multiple platforms. These tokens can also be traded or sold, adding value to the loyalty program beyond simple discounts or gifts. By tokenizing rewards, businesses create a more flexible, transparent, and transferable incentive system that benefits both customers and companies. Customers can earn tokens for purchasing products, sharing content, or engaging with brands, and these tokens can then be used to access special perks, products, or experiences within a decentralized ecosystem.

The digital asset market is experiencing a surge of activity, with exciting presales, transformative mainnet launches, and boundary-pushing projects. Whether you’re an experienced trader or new to the world of crypto, this year presents ample opportunities for bold investment decisions. Within the dynamic blockchain ecosystem, several projects have solidified their standing. Litecoin continues to maintain its relevance as a staple in the digital currency market, while NEAR Protocol has garnered attention for its scalability and developer-centric updates. However, the newcomer Qubetics is quickly gaining momentum, with a presale performance that has captured the attention of the crypto community. If you are seeking the top cryptocurrencies to consider for short-term investment, Qubetics has likely come onto your radar. As a revolutionary Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is making waves with its innovative tools and exceptional presale results. But how does it compare to the established players like Litecoin and NEAR Protocol? Let’s explore the details. Qubetics: The Best Crypto Presale to Join for Short Term Gains When the term “ Web3 aggregator ” is mentioned, Qubetics should immediately come to mind. This groundbreaking project is transforming blockchain interoperability by building a platform that enables seamless movement of assets, data, and identities across various chains. This isn’t As of January 22, 2025, Qubetics has already raised over $10.2 million in its presale. With more than 15,500 token holders and 430 million $TICS tokens sold, the momentum is undeniable. And the presale price? Just $0.0551 per token in its 18th stage. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end—a potential gain of 353.39%. The standout feature of Qubetics is its QubeQode IDE , an integrated development environment that’s changing the game for developers and businesses. Imagine a tech startup in New York using QubeQode IDE to build dApps that run flawlessly across Ethereum, NEAR Protocol, and Litecoin. No more endless compatibility issues or costly delays. Or consider a freelance developer building a custom NFT marketplace—QubeQode’s streamlined tools make it faster and easier than ever. For anyone serious about finding the top cryptos to buy and hold for short term, Qubetics is an absolute no-brainer. The presale is already making waves, and the price predictions? Let’s just say this rocket ship has plenty of fuel left. Litecoin: The Digital Silver Litecoin has been a mainstay in the crypto world for over a decade, often referred to as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” And while some might see it as old news, Litecoin has proven time and again that it’s here to stay. Recently, it’s been making headlines for its 18% price surge, reaching $120.56—all thanks to speculation about a potential Litecoin-based ETF. Litecoin’s inclusion in the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF is a game-changer. Not only does it bring Litecoin closer to mainstream financial markets, but it also solidifies its reputation as a reliable investment. Picture this: a retiree in Florida who’s wary of volatile stocks decides to diversify their portfolio with Litecoin through an ETF. It’s safe, steady, and still offers solid growth potential. Beyond the ETF buzz, Litecoin continues to attract users with its fast transaction speeds and low fees. Whether you’re buying coffee or transferring funds internationally, Litecoin gets the job done quickly and affordably. That’s why it’s earned a loyal following over the years, particularly among those looking for a no-frills digital currency. If you’re searching for the top cryptos to buy and hold for short term , Litecoin offers a unique blend of stability and growth potential. While it might not deliver the eye-popping returns of a presale like Qubetics, it’s a solid bet for anyone looking to dip their toes into crypto without diving into the deep end. NEAR Protocol: The Developer’s Dream NEAR Protocol is often touted as the blockchain for developers, and it’s easy to see why. With its focus on scalability and user-friendly design, NEAR has carved out a niche as a go-to platform for building decentralized apps. The recent launch of Nightshade 2.0 on its mainnet has only solidified its reputation. Nightshade 2.0 is a big deal. By enhancing scalability and performance, it’s made NEAR more attractive to developers and investors alike. Imagine a gaming company in Seattle that’s building the next big blockchain-based MMORPG. With NEAR, they can create a seamless gaming experience without worrying about lag or high transaction costs. That’s the kind of innovation that keeps NEAR at the forefront of the crypto world. The price action has been equally exciting. After the Nightshade 2.0 launch, NEAR’s token hit $5.22 before settling at $4.83. While some might see this as volatility, savvy investors know it’s an opportunity. With its long-term vision and strong developer community, NEAR remains one of the top cryptos to buy and hold for short term gains. NEAR’s commitment to user experience and scalability isn’t just talk—it’s action. For those who believe in the power of innovation, NEAR Protocol is a project worth watching closely. Conclusion Whether you’re hunting for the top cryptos to buy and hold for short term or looking to make a splash in the long run, these three projects offer something for everyone. Qubetics is setting the crypto world on fire with its record-breaking presale and revolutionary QubeQode IDE. Litecoin continues to shine as a stable and reliable digital currency, while NEAR Protocol pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in blockchain technology. But here’s the kicker: the potential returns on Qubetics are in a league of their own. Join the Qubetics presale today and be part of what could be the most exciting crypto story of 2025. Don’t let this chance pass you by.

39313167,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/what-can-crypto-traders-learn-from-traditional-forex-platforms,1737587859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/39313167.jpeg,What Can Crypto Traders Learn from Traditional Forex Platforms?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/what-can-crypto-traders-learn-from-traditional-forex-platforms,"When the concept of cryptocurrency was introduced back in 2009 – when the first Bitcoin whitepaper was released by the anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto – its unique selling point was that it was different. By that we mean, the idea of a decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency that could operate independently was revolutionary for the financial market. Trading crypto, too, was a different experience compared to trading on traditional Forex platforms. Unlike Forex markets, which are heavily regulated and rely on central authorities like banks or brokers, cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on blockchain, a distributed ledger that is transparent and independent of any governing body, introducing a whole new dynamic for traders. While this is still true today, however, as the cryptocurrency market has evolved, significant similarities between both markets have come to light. In 2025, crypto traders can learn a lot from traditional Forex platforms, with both markets having merged in terms of accessibility, tools, and strategies. Whether it’s through Forex trading apps or crypto trading platforms, traders now have access to similar features that enable them to execute trades efficiently and strategically, and if you look closely, the way in which they do so is not so different. Learning to Manage Risk Everyone knows that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. One day, the price of Bitcoin could be reaching a high of $106,000, the next it could have dropped down to $95,000. As a result, entering the crypto market is a risk in itself, but there are ways to mitigate that risk and ensure it never becomes too damaging. Forex traders have long used risk management strategies to protect their capital, with stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, and position sizing being common risk management tools that can be found on Forex platforms. By setting a stop-loss at a predetermined price, traders can limit potential losses if the market moves against them. Similarly, setting take-profit orders allows traders to lock in profits when the market reaches a specific level. These are standard practices in the traditional Forex market, and they can be beneficial practices in the crypto market too. For investors buying BTC , ETH, or any other altcoin, adopting risk management strategies can work to mitigate the high volatility and unpredictable nature of what is a very unpredictable market. Learning to Trade Responsibly Another thing that crypto traders can learn from traditional Forex platforms is the ability to trade responsibly. In Forex trading, emotional control and maintaining discipline are critical factors for long-term success. Provided an investor utilises a trusted, regulated platform, they should not only be receiving access to the financial market, but information and guidance on how to safely navigate that access. To give an example, on the Exness app – one of the up-and-coming platforms for both Forex and crypto traders alike – investors can access a wide range of educational resources, including guidelines on trading psychology, discipline, and emotional control. For those asking: “ is Exness legit ?”, this is one of the key signifiers that a platform is committed to helping traders succeed, and it’s also must-have information in both a Forex and crypto context. As an investor, it can be very easy to let emotions get the better of you. The fast-paced nature of both Forex and crypto markets often triggers impulsive decisions based on a range of factors, and this emotional response can easily lead to overtrading, chasing losses, or taking unnecessary risks that ultimately erode profits. Through digesting the tips and guidelines of platforms like Exness, however, it’s possible to learn how to mitigate these symptoms and make informed, strategic decisions based on fact rather than emotion. Learning to Manage Whether you’re a new investor in crypto or Forex – or both – you’ll learn very quickly that you are your own manager. You can follow all the necessary guidelines and steps, but ultimately, you are in charge of your portfolio, and it’s up to you to manage it effectively. One of the reasons Forex trading has become more accessible in recent years, however, is because the platforms are specifically designed to support this level of personal responsibility, offering tools and features that enable traders to take full control of their investments. As mentioned before, this includes risk management tools, but also real time access to market data. On a Forex platform, you can track live price movements, monitor currency pair fluctuations, and follow global economic events that are bound to affect market behaviour. You can also utilise automated trading options, such as bots or algorithms that program the platform to execute trades for you based on specific criteria – helping you stick to your plan without getting swayed by emotional impulses. In terms of the crypto market, it is these kinds of tools that you can learn from and utilise when managing your crypto portfolio. In both markets, of course, diversification is crucial in mitigating risk, but especially in the crypto-verse, this makes it harder to keep control in a volatile space and remain aware of everything going on. To succeed, it is crucial to take advantage of platforms offering this level of help, working to keep you on top of your game and flourishing, no matter where the market swings.

What Is The Latest Remittix News,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/ripple-xrp-price-will-hit-5-in-q1-of-2025-if-this-one-thing-happens-what-is-the-latest-remittix-news,"Ripple’s most recent surge saw its price surge past $3.38, causing speculation as to whether Ripple could surpass the critical $5 mark in Q1 of 2025. Meanwhile, a new contender, Remittix (RTX) , has been gaining traction for its advanced PayFi solution. It promises to address the longstanding frustrations of individuals and businesses who need to make global payments on a regular basis, often facing high costs, hidden charges, and lengthy delays. Currently powering through its presale, Remittix is seeing major investment, having raised over $3.85 million in just a few weeks. So what could Remittix achieve in 2025, and will Ripple (XRP) be able to reach $5? Ripple’s Momentum Stalls At $3.15 Ripple (XRP) has been on a real journey this last week. Between 14th and 16th January it shot up from $2.54 to $3.38 in a short window before plummeting to $3.04. It is now back to $3.15 where it seems to be settling. This price point seems to have stagnated for the short term, but where it might head next is unclear. The market cap for Ripple is now sitting at around $180 billion and its 24 hour trading volume dropped by 8% in the last day. Optimistic holders think the new administration will boost Ripple's price if Trump’s team shows signs of loosening crypto regulations. Remittix Ushers in a New Era for Global Payments Focusing on resolving inefficiencies in the cross-border payments market, Remittix (RTX) taps into the $190 trillion industry with precision. Facilitating the conversion of over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat, the platform allows users to send funds directly to bank accounts worldwide. For businesses, the Remittix Pay API is a standout feature, simplifying the integration of crypto payments into existing systems while offering easy and accessible fiat settlement options. Additionally, merchant accounts are tailored for companies managing multiple currencies, supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30 fiat currencies. This flexibility makes Remittix (RTX) an adaptable solution for diverse financial needs. Helping bridge the gap in regions with limited access to traditional financial services, Remittix supports individuals and businesses by providing 24/7 access to global payment systems. With low fees and efficient processing times, it is particularly attractive to users in underserved areas, breaking down barriers to participating in the international economy. Remittix Soars In Presale, Surpassing $4 Million Central to the Remittix (RTX) ecosystem is the RTX token, intelligently designed for growth with applications in staking, governance, and platform rewards. With a capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens, RTX is rapidly gaining traction among forward-thinking investors. Currently, priced at $0.0239 in its presale phase, the RTX token has already exceeded $4.6 million raised! Thanks to its compelling value proposition in the lucrative cross-border payments market, analysts project an 800% gain during the presale, with further growth expected as adoption grows.

Maeil Ilbo reported that the platforms have agreed to settle with customers in a total of 720 cases. Upbit and Bithumb: Customers Compensated According to data released on January 22 by Kim Hyun-jung, a Democratic Party lawmaker and a member of the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee, Upbit agreed to pay out 3,144,598,156 won ($2,192,550) in compensation for 596 cases. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) The cases all related to “computer system failures” on what has become known in South Korea as “Martial Law Day.” Bithumb, meanwhile, agreed to pay out 377,533,687 won ($263,273) in compensation for 124 cases. The media outlet wrote that this amounts to the “largest amount of compensation ever paid out” by domestic exchanges. However, critics claimed that it was still “difficult to determine whether” exchanges were providing a “proper level of investor protection.” They said that each exchange was determining the size of its own compensation packages, rather than cooperating to provide a unified response. Kim’s offices confirmed that the total amount of compensation “may increase slightly” once remaining “negotiations” are completed. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) Marital Law Sparked Crypto Crisis on December 3 The lawmaker’s data showed that Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax – the remaining three KRW-trading exchanges reported “no such cases.” South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol sparked a crisis in the nation’s crypto and financial markets on December 3 last year when he declared martial law. This saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) plummet from around 130 million won (around $90,610) to 88 million won ($61,352) on domestic platforms. This sparked panicked sell-offs, while other investors rushed to “buy the Bitcoin dip.” This saw “the number of users accessing” Upbit and Bithumb “skyrocket,” the outlet wrote. And this sudden surge in traffic essentially crashed both platforms. Some users were unable to log into their accounts. Others complained that they could access the websites but were unable to execute transactions. Upbit reportedly “experienced problems” including the “cancellation of some crypto withdrawals and KRW deposits.” Parliamentary committee holds 1st hearing on martial law, but without key witnesses https://t.co/pfDsiZIOWH — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) January 22, 2025 Regulators Respond The outages have sparked controversy, with financial regulators stepping in with “on-site inspections” at exchanges beginning on January 20. The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) has asked exchanges to submit reports on “future responses.” The regulator thinks the exchanges should look into expanding their server capacities, improving their cloud services, and adjusting their emergency response plans. South Korea's Yoon defends his martial law decree in his first public appearance since his arrest https://t.co/FZYX9dIIXP — Yahoo News (@YahooNews) January 21, 2025 The FSS will also follow up by “looking into whether these measures are being properly implemented,” the outlet added. “The number of virtual asset investors is rapidly increasing in South Korea. But we still lack an institutional foundation for investor protection. The financial authorities and [crypto] exchanges should establish practical and specific measures. They need to take steps such as increasing the number of servers they use and improving their emergency response plans. This will help prevent computer accidents. And it will create a safe and trustworthy ecosystem for trading virtual assets.” Kim Hyun-jung, Democratic Party lawmaker and member of the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee The post Upbit and Bithumb to Pay Customers $2.4M Compensation for ‘Martial Law Blackout’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Crypto Exchange|South Korea,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-22 23:30:00
39313538,https://coingape.com/?p=234913,1737588791,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Breaking: Bitwise Files for Dogecoin ETF, DOGE Price To $15?",https://coingape.com/bitwise-files-for-dogecoin-etf-doge-price-to-15/,"Bitwise has reportedly registered a legal entity for a Dogecoin ETF, creating speculation of an imminent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development briefly boosted the price of Dogecoin, which touched $0.373 before settling near $0.36 at the time of reporting. Bitwise Moves Toward a Dogecoin ET Filing According to information accessed on the Delaware corporate registration website , Bitwise has created a legal entity named “BITWISE DOGECOIN ETF.” This is not an official ETF filing with the SEC, but it is seen as a stepping stone to such a submission. In most cases, ETF registrations are made after setting up the legal structure that follows the filing of Form S-1 with the SEC. Market participants are likely to see Bitwise submit the necessary documentation in the near future, with Dogecoin joining other digital assets that have been proposed for ETFs by issuers. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also confirmed this stating that; “This is real and not a market manipulation scheme.” Balchunas had estimated that a DOGE ETF could launch in as soon as April 2025 if it gets the green light. DOGE Price Reaction and Whale Activity News of the registration led to a slight increase in Dogecoins value, which spiked to 4% and trading at $0.373 before dropping back to $0.36. This announcement has garnered interest from institutional and retail investors, with more action expected from the price if an official ETF filing is made. At the same time, whale activity has risen due to improving sentiment. According to data provided by Santiment, the majority holders have accumulated 590 million DOGE tokens in the last one day. To the excitement, the icon of Dogecoin has been displayed on the website of the newly formed U.S. Department of Government Efficiency or D.O.G.E. It was created by an executive order shortly after the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. Other technical analysts have also come up with possible price predictions for Dogecoin. Trader Mikybull posted a chart indicating a bullish flag pattern which could propel DOGE to $2 if the pattern is confirmed. Nonetheless, crypto analyst Ali Martinez anticipates that the price may rise to $15 if a Dogecoin ETF is granted approval. Growing Momentum for Crypto ETFs The potential filing of a Dogecoin ETF comes as the SEC has shown greater willingness to approve cryptocurrency-related funds. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were recently greenlit, signaling a shift in regulatory attitudes. The resignation of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler has further fueled speculation around the approval of spot cryptocurrency ETFs. Rex Osprey, an asset manager overseeing $8 billion, has also filed for a Dogecoin fund , adding to the momentum. Observers believe a Dogecoin ETF would increase institutional adoption and provide retail investors with easier access to the cryptocurrency.

Will the Meme Coin Frenzy Collapse Next Month?",https://bitzo.com/2025/01/price-forecast-shiba-inu-pepe-and-remittix-will-the-meme-coin-frenzy-collapse-next-month,"The meme coin market is witnessing notable shifts, with Shiba Inu and Pepe capturing attention. Yet, as growth is driven by speculation and the actions of large investors, concerns emerge about the future stability of these meme coins. Amidst this speculation, investors are turning to a promising altcoin with tangible utility: Remittix (RTX) . Remittix is quickly becoming a top investment pick this year, achieving $4 million in ICO funding. Learn why experts prefer Remittix over Shiba Inu and Pepe. Remittix Ushers In a New Era for International Transfers Traditional methods for cross-border payments are often slow and obscure. Transactions can take days or even weeks, coupled with hefty conversion rates and concealed fees. These inefficiencies frustrate both individuals and businesses alike. Remittix (RTX) addresses these issues through its PayFi platform, which enables users to change over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send funds globally within just 24 hours. This innovation cuts out middlemen, greatly minimizing transaction times and costs. Featuring a flat-fee system, Remittix guarantees full transparency so users are always aware of the fees they incur. No more unexpected deductions—whether sending money to family or managing overseas business transactions, users can rest easy. Loyal users of Remittix are rewarded through its VIP program, which provides staking benefits across multiple levels, offering up to 18% APY at the highest level. This additional value makes the RTX token a standout in the market. Currently trading at $0.0221, RTX is projected to climb to $0.0228 soon. Early backers have seen gains of over 50%, with over $4 million raised and more than 6,000 holders. Trump’s Impact May Propel Shiba Inu to New Heights The buzz around meme coins, especially Shiba Inu, is once again building. This is partly attributed to Trump's growing influence within the crypto space. The 47th President of the U.S. holds a favorable view on cryptocurrencies, which could boost the market, potentially leading to significant gains for Shiba Inu. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is also progressing, highlighted by the launch of the WHY combinator. This new tool is designed to support blockchain projects, fostering growth and making the ecosystem more appealing to developers. Currently, Shiba Inu is valued at $0.00002075, marking a 1.81% increase in the last week. The meme coin seems poised for a substantial rise and may break its yearly high of $0.000045 by Q2 2025. Shiba Inu investors are watching closely, hoping for a significant price increase. Analysts suggest that Trump's influence could reshape the market landscape and reignite interest in meme coins like Shiba Inu, potentially leading to even better price movements as the year unfolds. Pepe May Experience a 10x Price Surge Pepe has recently stirred the crypto market, particularly on January 13th, due to major whale activity. One whale withdrew 280 billion PEPE tokens, valued at about $5 million, from Binance, while another invested $3.72 million to purchase an additional 200.4 billion. Despite market challenges, the frog-themed token has demonstrated resilience, increasing from $0.00001600 on January 14th to around $0.00001844. Some experts predict that Pepe could achieve a 10x increase during a 2025 crypto bull run, as whale activity often signifies strong market confidence. With an impressive 1,400% surge year-to-date, Pepe has become one of the leading meme coins, and its listing on Binance Japan enhances its visibility and potential growth. Remittix Poised for an 800% Rally At the core of the Remittix ecosystem is the $RTX token, designed to withstand volatile market conditions. With a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens and a current presale price of $0.0221, Remittix has already amassed over $4 million in funding and continues to gain momentum. Experts foresee an 800% increase during the presale phase, with further growth anticipated post-launch as adoption rises.

Between January 15 and 16, the total Shiba Inu outflows grew from 647 billion to 1.11 trillion SHIB. This large-scale movement has left investors worried about its future price movement. The significant outflows were driven by big investors cashing out and adjusting their positions. Some investors sold out their Shiba Inu holdings to protect their gains.

This is largely due to the success of both tokens over the past years. Ethereum's updates make it a good option while Solana offers high speed of transactions as well as low costs. However, of late, a new presale token, Remittix (RTX) is creating a buzz. This could be attributed to the success of its ongoing presale as well as its innovative way of handling cross-border payments. The ultimate question remains: Can Remittix rival Solana and Ethereum in 2025? Ethereum Rises 7% In 24 hours ETH has begun 2025 with strong momentum. Currently trading at $3,442.66, it is up 7% over the last 24 hours. This keeps Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency. With improvements such as ""The Surge"" upgrade and spot ETF approvals, Ethereum is poised to rise with some analysts anticipating a top of $12,000. In recent years, Ethereum made big changes to how it works. It switched to a proof-of-stake system, which uses less energy than before. This change has made it more environmentally friendly and prepared it for future growth. Ethereum might be a great investment in 2025. Solana: The Fast and Affordable Challenger Solana has gained a lot of attention because of its speed. The network can handle thousands of transactions every second. It is also cheaper to use, making it a good choice for developers building applications in areas like gaming or NFTs. Analysts think that SOL might reach $500 by 2025, thanks to the excitement surrounding its prospective ETF launch. This expands its DeFi adoption, and increases institutional interest. Solana's focus on affordability has strongly impacted its adoption. It has helped it attract a strong community of developers and users. This further advances Solana's place in crypto. What Makes Remittix Different? While Ethereum and Solana are strong players, Remittix is quickly becoming an interesting option for investors. It aims mainly to solve problems in the world of financial transactions. Many traditional systems for sending money across borders are slow and expensive. Remittixoffers a faster and cheaper way to handle these transfers. This focus on real-world financial solutions makes it stand out from other projects.

New projects like Remittix show that there is room for innovation. By focusing on solving real problems, Remittix is setting itself apart as a potential leader in its space. For investors, this means there are more choices than ever. Whether you stick with well-known names like Ethereum and Solana or take a chance on something new like Remittix, the key is to stay informed and consider what fits your goals. Ethereum and Solana have proven themselves as strong options for crypto traders. Both offer unique advantages that make them worth considering in 2025. But for those who want to look beyond the usual names, Remittix could be a game-changer. Its focus on fixing issues with cross-border payments gives it a practical edge in the market.

However, recently, a new presale token called Remittix (RTX) is generating a lot of interest. Its buzz can be attributed to the success of its ongoing presale and its innovative approach to handling international payments.

It is currently valued at $3,442.66, marking a 7% rise in the past 24 hours, maintaining its status as the second-largest cryptocurrency.

This shift has made it more eco-friendly and set the stage for future expansion. Ethereum could be a promising investment by 2025. Solana: The Swift and Cost-Effective Contender Solana has attracted significant attention due to its impressive speed. The network processes thousands of transactions every second. It's also cost-effective, making it appealing for developers creating applications in sectors like gaming or NFTs. Experts predict that SOL might hit $500 by 2025, driven by the excitement over its potential ETF launch. This enhances its DeFi adoption and boosts institutional interest. Solana's emphasis on cost-effectiveness has significantly influenced its adoption. It has helped build a strong community of developers and users, further solidifying Solana's place in the cryptocurrency world. What Sets Remittix Apart? While Ethereum and Solana are established contenders, Remittix is quickly emerging as an intriguing option for investors. It primarily aims to address issues in the realm of financial transactions. Many traditional methods for sending money across borders are sluggish and costly. Remittix offers a quicker and more affordable solution for these transfers. This emphasis on practical financial solutions differentiates it from other projects. Remittix is set to enhance cross-border payments. It is crafted to be practical and beneficial, giving it a distinct standing in the crypto market. Currently, the DeFi coin price for Remittix is low, making it accessible to early investors.

For investors, this means there are more options than ever. Whether you stick with renowned names like Ethereum and Solana or explore new possibilities like Remittix, the key is to remain informed and consider what aligns with your objectives. Ethereum and Solana have established themselves as solid choices for crypto traders. Both offer distinct benefits that make them worthy of consideration in 2025.

Although the coin is meant to be used for charity purposes, crypto X reacted sceptically, to say the least. Predictably, the Trump inauguration delivered some spectacular moments — from Melania’s hat preventing the President’s kiss to Elon Musk’s alleged Nazi salute at the end of his speech. The crypto community was caught off guard by the total absence of cryptocurrency mentioned in Donald Trump’s speech. However, the photos of Trump with Sen. Lummis, who waged war on Operation Choke Point 2.0 and proposed the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin reserve, were met with enthusiasm. Read more: Sen. Lummis warns FDIC staff against destroying OCP 2.0 docs One of the stunning moments of the inauguration was the three-minute-long MLK-heavy prayer delivered by a Michigan pastor, Rev. Lorenzo Sewell. He chanted his words referencing the famous “I Have a Dream” speech and Declaration of Independence, starting his prayer by grating the Lord for the “millimetre miracle” that saved the future president from the bullet during the July murder attempt. Sewell stated that America will begin to dream again. President Trump invited Pastor Lorenzo Sewell from Detroit to pray at the Inauguration, and he did NOT disappoint. God is back in America. pic.twitter.com/3dT7Jn46Wf — George (@BehizyTweets) January 20, 2025 One of the reasons for multiple references to Martin Luther King’s speech may be the fact that Trump’s inauguration coincided with MLK Day. And Sewell mentioned Dr. King that night once again–in a short video on X where Sewell announced the launch of his official crypto token. The pastor urged everyone to buy it in order to help the ministry and concluded that “we know that King’s dream can only be fulfilled if we acknowledge that people are living in a nightmare”. The crypto community was kind enough to send me $Lorenzo, so I have permanently locked my tokens into a Liquidity Pool, so that I will never sell on the community but rather just earn fees as our token continues to flourish! Amazing day, all the Glory to God! CA:… pic.twitter.com/kAZFL3mMmb — Pastor Zo (@pastorzosewell) January 20, 2025 The comment section went poisonous on the announcement. But let’s first talk about Sewell’s personality before diving into his meme coin and the community’s reaction. Rev. Sewell’s complicated past People who followed Trump’s campaign weren’t probably surprised to see Sewell delivering a prayer during the President’s inauguration as the pastor has been actively involved in the 2024 campaign, presenting the pro-Trump Christian events, giving speeches alongside the future president in churches and addressing the public at a Republican National Convention. Before joining the Trump bandwagon, Sewell has been a pastor at the non-denominational 180 Church. Rev. Sewell doesn’t divide religion from politics, saying that the gospel message is the political message and the Bible is a political book. “You cannot be a spiritual person and not be political,” said Sewell . Fox News cites him saying that he doesn’t believe all Democrats are demons, but their platform is demonic. Sewell is passionate and energetic, not only in his prayers. Not everyone in the 180 Church was happy to have a pro-Trump pastor, and on one occasion, the political clash resulted in Sewell getting handcuffed. His enemies drilled new locks to the church door, and the pastor was approached by the police while trying to get into the church. Thankfully, after weeks of holding services elsewhere, including a methadone clinic, Sewell managed to get his church back . It was only a year before Sewell met Trump for the first time and joined his 2024 campaign. During that meeting at the roundtable, Sewell expressed his admiration of Trump, saying the 45th President was charged with 34 felonies, and then he raised $52.8 million in 24 hours. Felonies that don’t stop the one on the way to glory is something that Sewell understands very well as it reflects his own life experiences as reportedly Sewell was a gang leader in the 90s before the 1999 spiritual revelation brought him to a religious path. Pastor’s meme coin roast The pastor’s $Lorenzo meme coin doesn’t seem that different from the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens that garnered substantial amounts of criticism following the launch. However, it seems that it was the pastor’s coin that gravitated the most hate. In the X post, Sewell claims he decided not to sell Lorenzo tokens and instead locked them permanently in the Liquidity Pool to earn fees and let the token flourish. In the video, Sewell asked people to “do him a favor” and “buy the official Lorenzo Sewell coin.” However, the public was harsh on the move. Below, you can see only a few of the many angered voices: Will pastor man rug? Only God knows. What’s clear enough for many in the crypto community is that meme coins began to gain notoriety similar to one that NFTs got at some point, where the element of gambling and scammers started to outshine the revolutionary technology. In his criticism towards the TRUMP token, journalist Nic Carter suggested that tokens issued by political figures in power may be used by external agents to manipulate and bribe national affairs. Can someone influence Sewell via a generous $Lorezno investment? Will see.

Chainlink & TON Enhance Crypto Utilities,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-vs-traditional-retail-how-blockchain-is-winning-the-e-commerce-battle-chainlink-ton-enhance-crypto-utilities/,"As we continue through 2025, we observe how the cryptocurrency environment is being transformed by major advancements in significant digital assets and blockchain-driven e-commerce enhancements. Leading these changes are the noticeable movements in Chainlink’s market and the strategic upgrades to the TON blockchain, both of which are enhancing their utility and scalability. Simultaneously, Web3Bay (3BAY) is making impressive progress by incorporating Web3 technology into the retail world, thereby establishing new benchmarks for how blockchain can improve the online shopping experience. This set of innovations is not only altering their specific sectors but also jointly pushing the limits of blockchain technology in contemporary commerce and finance. Chainlink’s Influence on Decentralized Applications Recent developments in the Chainlink ecosystem are grabbing headlines, highlighted by a surge in acquisitions by major investors, known as “whales.” These influential market players are significantly expanding their LINK holdings, demonstrating their strong belief in the asset’s potential. This increased activity from whales has led to a substantial rise in Chainlink’s market value, fostering optimistic views on its future. In just the last week, LINK has witnessed an 18% increase in value, fueled by broad confidence in its long-term relevance and critical role in providing dependable data feeds for blockchain contracts. This uptrend signifies growing acknowledgment of Chainlink’s ability to support various decentralized platforms, indicating a bright future for its widespread application. TON Partners with Nansen to Enhance Analytics At the same time, the TON blockchain, originally created by Telegram’s developers, has boosted its functionality through a partnership with Nansen, a top blockchain analytics firm. This alliance has provided TON with enhanced tools for analyzing user behavior and transaction patterns, strengthening its framework as a scalable and secure platform for diverse decentralized applications. These advanced analytical tools are anticipated to spur further creativity and uptake within the TON network, equipping developers and investors with crucial data to make well-informed choices. Web3Bay’s Hybrid Platform: Bridging Fiat & Crypto for Flexibility! Despite recent fluctuations in the market, Web3Bay is carving a niche in transforming the e-commerce industry. Leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay has created a decentralized marketplace that accommodates both conventional payment methods, such as PayPal, and innovative cryptocurrency transactions. This hybrid approach attracts a broad spectrum of consumers, making it a flexible platform for various shopping preferences. Additionally, the platform enhances user experience by offering a 5% discount on all purchases made using its native token, 3BAY. The inclusion of blockchain not only secures transactions but also introduces transparency in every transaction, building trust among users. Since beginning, Web3Bay has impressively raised $840,000 from its presale, showcasing strong market trust and resulting in the sale of 222 million coins at an initial price of $0.1959 each. Although market conditions remain volatile, the current price of the coin is $0.004562625, which reflects sustained interest from investors. Token holders contribute actively to governance, having a direct impact on the platform’s policy and future direction. This participatory governance model is setting new standards for how e-commerce platforms are run, positioning Web3Bay as an innovator in the industry. The success of Web3Bay’s model demonstrates the potential for blockchain to disrupt traditional retail models, offering a glimpse into the future of decentralized commerce. Concluding Insights The year 2025 is turning out to be a defining year for the cryptocurrency industry, with Chainlink and TON undergoing crucial developments that could shape their paths forward. Yet, Web3Bay is also in the limelight, with its novel approach to e-commerce potentially transforming how online transactions are managed in a blockchain-centric environment. As Web3Bay continues to expand and its token presale accelerates, early adopters stand to gain substantial returns, with potential ROIs reaching up to 6,430% at launch. This period is thus an optimal time to get involved with a trailblazing platform in the realm of e-commerce innovation.

Research Predicts Big Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-to-122k-next-month-research-predicts-big-move/,"Many analysts are ruminating on the next significant milestone, as the remarkable price increase of Bitcoin has captivated the market’s attention. A research company, 10x Research, predicts thatthe alpha coin could reach $122,000 by February. Although this may appear to be an ambitious goal, it is consistent with the optimistic perspective of numerous experts who have observed Bitcoin’s capacity to surpass critical price thresholds since the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Trump Son Drops Hints About Major World Liberty Plans After Massive Ether Buy Bitcoin: Robust Momentum The momentum of Bitcoin is undeniable. In recent months, its price has fluctuated in a consistent manner, with periodic increases that have typically occurred within the $16,000–$18,000 range. Markus Thielen of 10x Research believes that these consistent increases indicate a continuation of upward movement, which implies that $122,000 is feasible in the near future. Thielen underscores that the crypto asset’s market conduct may experience a pause upon attaining this objective, despite the optimistic outlook. Thielen believes Bitcoin’s breakout presents a “low-risk, high-reward entry opportunity,” with Bitcoin trading at $105,727. He noted that after Donald Trump’s inauguration, BTC tested the $101,000 resistance, making it a favorable time to buy with stop-losses around $98,000. Thielen also pointed out that Bitcoin has risen in $16,000–$18,000 increments since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, suggesting it could reach $122,000 by February before entering another consolidation phase. Expectation Of Consolidation Following The Surge A period of consolidation may ensue following Bitcoin’s prospective ascent to $122,000. This phase, during which its price stabilizes prior to another outburst, has been a recurring trend throughout its history. Investors should anticipate this period of sideways price action, which may present new opportunities for those who are anticipating a more favorable entry point. Strength In Relation To The Stock Market The optimistic forecast is also in line with the relative strength of Bitcoin in comparison to traditional markets. Despite the challenges that equities have encountered, it has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Due to the increasing number of institutional investors who are investing in Bitcoin, the price of this digital asset is becoming less correlated with the broader financial market. This pattern has the potential to intensify the upward trajectory toward $12,000. Meanwhile, according to current price predictions, the price of Bitcoin is predicted to rise by 24% and reach $ 130k by February 21, 2025. Technical indicators, according to CoinCodex, show the current sentiment is Bullish while the Fear & Greed Index is showing 84 (Extreme Greed).

Though historical success of Bitcoin does not ensure future outcomes, the present conditions are favorable for more growth.

The question is not whether Bitcoin will hit $122,000; rather, when.

Insights on PEPE Coin Price Growth & Hyperliquid Token,https://thecoinrise.com/is-marius-bock-the-catalyst-blockdag-needs-to-reach-600m-insights-on-pepe-coin-price-growth-hyperliquid-token/,"As traders search for the best crypto for the future, several tokens are catching the eye for their potential to dominate the scene. The Hyperliquid (HYPE) token has boldly initiated trading rights on its own platform, skipping traditional exchanges to prioritize a community-focused rollout. Meanwhile, the price of PEPE coin has climbed by 6.67%, with market watchers expecting further increases if it surpasses crucial resistance levels. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) appears to have secured a game-changing asset with Marius Bock, previously with Cardano, stepping in as the new Lead Project Manager. Bock’s arrival has propelled BlockDAG’s presale past $183 million, setting a rapid pace toward the $600 million target, with the project poised to solidify its status as a frontrunner in decentralized technology. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Token Reshapes the Crypto Launch Process The launch of the Hyperliquid (HYPE) token may redefine the standard for how cryptocurrencies debut. Eschewing the usual path of premiering on centralized exchanges with allocations earmarked for venture capital and early backers, HYPE was released directly through its own system. This strategy excluded venture capitalists and early investors, promoting a shift towards a more community-centric launch. Vitali Dervoed, CEO of Composability Labs, believes this approach signals a transformative era for cryptocurrency introductions, emphasizing on-chain, equitable distribution. PEPE Coin Price Gains Momentum PEPE coin price recent 6.67% uptick is bolstering its profile in the buoyant meme coin sector, now valued at $107 billion. The four-hour chart suggests bullish trends, with the price rallying from support and surpassing important Fibonacci thresholds. Crypto Analyst Ali Martinez points to a possible ascent to $0.000021, backed by a strong buy signal. A breakout from the symmetrical triangle could push PEPE coin prices even higher, targeting the next resistance at $0.0000225. Conversely, failing to maintain support at $0.00001739 could pressure the price downward. BlockDAG Welcomes Marius Bock as Presale Surges to $183 Million! BlockDAG just hit a major milestone with an incredible $183 million raised in its presale, and now there’s even more thrilling news for everyone involved! Marius Bock, a legendary figure from Cardano, has joined BlockDAG as the new Lead Project Manager. With a whopping 25 years of expertise in blockchain and fintech, Bock is all set to take things to the next level. During his time at Cardano, he was the brain behind their cryptocurrency wallet and made it work seamlessly with popular hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. Bock has also held significant positions at Fundamo (a Visa company) and worked on major projects with giants like IBM and ACI Worldwide. With Bock now part of the team, BlockDAG is turbocharging its mission to develop scalable and efficient blockchain solutions. The team’s innovative approach has already fueled the presale success, amassing $183 million and setting a strong base for more growth. Bock’s arrival could mean hitting their bold $600 million target way ahead of schedule! Analysts are buzzing with predictions that BDAG, currently at just $0.0248 per coin, could soar to $1 by the year’s end. That’s a potential 3932% ROI for those who get in now, especially with the mainnet launch on the horizon. Those who got in early are already seeing huge returns, with a 2380% ROI so far. With a solid base, visionary leadership, and a clear strategy, BlockDAG is perfectly positioned to keep winning. Its commitment to cutting-edge blockchain solutions and strong potential for growth make BDAG the best crypto for the future . Which Cryptocurrency Will Define the Future? The decentralized rollout of the Hyperliquid (HYPE) token introduces a new paradigm in community-led, on-chain cryptocurrency distributions, setting a fresh market benchmark. Meanwhile, PEPE coin’s price continues to show strong upward trends, suggesting more potential gains if current supports hold and key resistance levels are breached. However, BlockDAG remains a standout contender for the best crypto for the future. With a robust $183 million from its presale, the imminent mainnet launch, and the strategic addition of Marius Bock to its leadership team, BlockDAG is well-positioned for substantial growth. Market analysts are optimistic about BDAG’s prospects, forecasting a potential price of $1 by year’s end, which could translate to a 3932% ROI for early adopters. With traders rapidly gathering to the presale, excitement is mounting as BDAG’s price of $0.0248 is expected to surge.

Earlier in the week, bitcoin touched $109,000 during the day before retreating again. Ether's closing price had some movement this week but ended up finishing mostly flat. ETH is currently down ~1% year to date. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and has continued that momentum into 2025. XRP is currently up ~36% year to date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. It is often considered a volatile asset, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price hit a new all-time high on January 21, 2025, finishing just above $106,000. Earlier in the week, bitcoin touched $109,000 during the day before retreating again. BTC is up ~12% year to date. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price had some movement this week but ended up finishing mostly flat. ETH is currently down ~1% year to date. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and has continued that momentum into 2025. XRP is currently up ~36% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead, just edging out XRP. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

And let’s be honest—if you’ve seen what happened to the price of those coins after their Binance debuts, you’ll know that this is a big deal. We’re talking millions made by early investors who hopped on the train before the listing. If you missed out on those gains, don’t worry— BTFD Coin’s presale performance is looking like the perfect chance to ride the next big wave. With over $5.5 million already raised and more than 9,100 bullish holders, BTFD Coin is gearing up to make its splash. BTFD Coin: The Presale Performance That Has Investors Talking BTFD Coin is currently in its 14th presale stage, priced at $0.00016 per coin, but don’t let the low price fool you. The momentum is real. In just a short period, BTFD Coin has raised more than $5.5 million, with over 66 billion coins sold. And the excitement doesn’t stop there. Analysts are predicting that once BTFD Coin lists on Binance (and let’s be honest, it seems very likely), it could surge to $0.0006 , and potentially even hit a moon price of $0.006. If you’re thinking about investing, consider this: $4,000 at today’s presale price could net you over 25 million BTFD coins. If the coin hits $0.0006 post-listing, your investment will grow to $15,000. And if BTFD Coin skyrockets to $0.006, your $4,000 could turn into a massive $150,000. Now that’s some serious potential. The best part? You can get in early and reap the rewards as this meme coin rides the momentum. Dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins: The Binance Effect When Dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins debuted on Binance, they were the “it” coins of the moment. People who had gotten in early saw their investments explode—literally. Dogwifhat: This meme coin was all over the news when it launched on Binance. After being listed, Dogwifhat saw over a 50% surge in price in under 24 hours. Investors who had bought in during its ICO at a much lower price saw returns in the hundreds of percent, with some early supporters walking away with life-changing profits. Its success is often cited as an example of how meme coins can go from niche to mainstream with the right exchange listing. Pudgy Penguins: Another example of meme coin magic, Pudgy Penguins took the crypto world by storm after it was listed on Binance. What was once a cute, niche token turned into a highly sought-after asset. The momentum that built up around Pudgy Penguins’ listing sent its price rocketing, with some early investors experiencing returns that could only be described as epic. Both of these coins saw massive growth following their Binance listings, and it’s easy to see why BTFD Coin is poised to do the same. With a strong community backing it—over 9,100 holders and counting—and its performance in presale, BTFD Coin is already creating a buzz that feels eerily similar to what we saw with Dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins. BTFD Coin’s Momentum Is Building—Top New Meme Coisn to Invest in Now With its presale success, BTFD Coin is setting itself up for the kind of Binance debut that could make meme coin history. The community is behind it, the presale numbers are strong, and analysts are predicting significant price growth post-listing. If you missed out on Dogwifhat or Pudgy Penguins, BTFD Coin might just be your second chance to cash in on meme coin magic. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big meme coin success story. Invest in BTFD Coin now , and prepare to see your portfolio grow—just like the early investors who cashed in on Dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins.

39315189,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=648805,1737592455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39315189.jpeg,Crypto execs are worried about TRUMP meme coins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-execs-are-worried-about-trump-meme-coins/,"According to a Jan. 22nd report by the Financial Times, crypto industry leaders are raising serious concerns about the chaos caused by TRUMP and MELANIA, the controversial memecoins launched by ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump and his wife the weekend before his Monday inauguration. Nic Carter for instance, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures, reportedly said, “Call me old-fashioned, but I think presidents should focus on running the country.” Nic, who’s actually a vocal Trump supporter, also flagged the conflict of interest, pointing out that the president’s position allows him to influence crypto regulations while directly benefiting from the trading of his tokens. The meme coins were initially worth a combined $17.5 billion, per data from CoinGecko. But by midweek, both had lost more than half their value, leaving thousands of investors reeling and raising questions about ethics, conflicts of interest, and the impact on the industry’s reputation. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that most trading activity for the 200 million available TRUMP tokens happened on lesser-known Asian exchanges like BiKing, Gate.io, and Megabit. “Human nature never changes,” a Silicon Valley investor reportedly told the Financial Times at the World Economic Forum in Davos, likening Trump and Elon Musk to Crassus and Caesar. The investor described the memecoins as a modern example of using political influence for personal gain. “We are seeing real ‘End of Empire’ stuff in the U.S.,” they added, referencing the rapid creation of billions in paper wealth and its equally rapid collapse. About 80% of the TRUMP tokens are held by CIC Digital, a Trump Organization-affiliated company, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, another entity linked to the president. Both companies are set to benefit from trading revenues and token sales, as insiders’ holdings will unlock for sale over the next three to 12 months. Lawmakers and executives call out ethical issues According to the report, Maxine Waters, Democratic congresswoman and member of the House Financial Services Committee, said, “This meme coin represents the worst of crypto.” Waters argued that $TRUMP could enable anonymous financial transactions to Trump’s inner circle, bypassing national security and anti-corruption laws. Oskar Åslund, chief strategy officer at AKJ, a crypto hedge fund brokerage, said, “His economic interest is for sale. There are no checks and balances here.” Åslund also warned about the lack of protections for retail investors, adding that terms on the token’s website prevent users from filing class-action lawsuits. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director, expressed concern that $TRUMP could derail efforts to establish regulatory clarity for crypto. “I believe it hurts the industry,” he said during a Davos panel. Meanwhile, Serge-Raymond Nzabandora of Yield Guild Games described the tokens as a drain on resources and attention. “The immediate effect has been draining liquidity and attention away from legitimate projects working on real use cases that the industry desperately needs to prove to the world in 2025,” he said. Nzabandora also pointed out the irony of Trump’s actions, as they appear to undermine the very regulatory protections former SEC chair Gary Gensler sought to establish. Adding fuel to the fire, REX Financial and Osprey Funds filed paperwork with the SEC for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) centered on the $TRUMP token. The proposed fund would allow investors to trade the memecoin more easily, but it has already faced backlash. “These are the first filings we’ve seen for memecoin ETFs in the U.S.,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. He questioned the wisdom of launching an ETF for a token created just days ago, especially one tied to a sitting president. “I’m not sure even a libertarian-minded and Republican-controlled SEC will want to approve these products,” James added. Meanwhile, more than 30 new crypto ETFs are in the pipeline, including filings for funds focused on Solana and XRP. ProShares and CoinShares are among the firms seeking to capitalize on the change in US SEC leadership. But according to James, “These filings are a gamble.” Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood said that TRUMP is a meme coin. She did not buy it herself because she only holds Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. However, she believes that the token isn’t “completely worthless.” “It may symbolize a new stage of the cryptocurrency revolution and have certain practicality in the future,” she said. Cathie is well beloved in the crypto community as one of Bitcoin’s earliest and strongest believers.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano (ADA) and XRP investors are buzzing about 1Fuel’s wallet technology, looking to get in early. Table of Contents Cardano and Ripple plan collaborative projects New wallet technology piques widespread interest 1Fuel presale sees fast progress 1Fuel’s launch Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) are widely known for their blockchain solutions, and achieved more fame when they announced plans to collaborate. But lately, their investors have been more interested in 1Fuel (OFT), especially since its new wallet technology might transform the DeFi landscape. This DeFi wallet is important to 1Fuel’s ecosystem, offering cross-chain transaction capability and privacy tools. With the 1Fuel presale quickly progressing, there has been a lot of excitement surrounding the public listing. Cardano and Ripple plan collaborative projects Recently, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, and the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, announced that they have been discussing collaborations. Once this news broke out, the value of the two altcoins increased in a week. Cardano‘s price increased by 1.14% while XRP rose by 20.68%, further attracting investor interest. This potential collaboration has caused investors to rank ADA and XRP among the best altcoins. With their rising in value, these tokens can be easily managed on wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. You might also like: 1Fuel new exchange is poised to overtake Shiba Inu in 2025 New wallet technology piques widespread interest 1Fuel has emerged with a new wallet technology which is attracting a lot of attention, especially from ADA and XRP whales. This technology is expected to transform the DeFi space, driving 1Fuel’s value as one of the best altcoins. One of the best parts of this wallet is cross-chain transactions and one-click technology. This is a major advantage over platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, which require multiple wallets and tokens for cross-chain swaps. With only the 1Fuel token, investors can freely send altcoins from one blockchain to another. 1Fuel is also fitted with highly advanced financial tools that make it easy to manage digital assets. These include crypto debit and credit cards, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, disposable wallets, and AI-driven features. With all of these, 1Fuel could be a top DEX wallet, especially as it features an inbuilt privacy mixer and cold storage. These are privacy features that are usually lacking in well-known platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. 1Fuel presale sees fast progress The 1Fuel presale has been moving at an impressive pace, which is a sign of the widespread investor interest and confidence. In just a week, stage 1 achieved 100% completion while stage 2 had a similar progress. Now it is in stage 3 and over 30% complete, selling over 146 million tokens and raising $1.4 million. Investors can buy the token at $0.017 in stage 3. Analysts predict that 1Fuel could rise by 100x in 2025, and investors are highly anticipating long-term growth. 1Fuel’s launch Investors are looking forward to 1Fuel’s public listing in Q2 2025. Supported by a robust DeFi ecosystem, 1Fuel could change how digital assets are managed. The exchange technology is offering an edge over widely known blockchain systems like Cardano and Ripple.

Trump Bitcoin MAGA (MAGABTC), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MAGABTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Bitcoin MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Bitcoin MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Bitcoin MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Bitcoin MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Bitcoin MAGA by entering its contract address – 3J7GkdTfz7sHdcKcMnD5fm1aDZZUktz7z8NqTdiacLTy – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MAGABTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-23 00:49:52

However, as Solana (SOL) continues to dominate headlines with its growing trading volume, a formidable altcoin rival, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , is quietly gearing up for an extraordinary 56,000% rally.

At just $0.0420 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers investors a rare chance to join its presale and position themselves for its massive potential surge. Don’t miss out on this life-changing opportunity—act now and secure your spot in the presale before it’s too late! Solana’s (SOL) Meteoric Rise To $10 Billion Trading Volume: Is the Best Yet To Come? Solana (SOL) has surged to an impressive $10 billion in trading volume, driven by heightened market activity and optimism around events like the US presidential inauguration and the launch of $Trump meme coins. This momentum has pushed Solana (SOL) to an all-time high of $272, with a 41% rally in the past week alone. While Solana’s (SOL) $10 billion trading volume is remarkable, the altcoin space is brimming with emerging rivals, and WLTQ is one to watch.

Positioned to capitalize on this momentum, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to gain even more traction with upcoming top exchange listings, increasing its market visibility and paving the way for a significant value surge that could redefine portfolios. The presale has already raised over $5 million, with the first stage selling out quickly at $0.0171 per token.

Armstrong acknowledges that Solana is experiencing transactional delays on Coinbase amid a high volume surge in the trading of memecoins launched on the SOL network. In response to one customer complaining of delays on the social media platform X, Armstrong says, “Team is working hard on scaling our Solana infra now – lots of Solana activity last few days, we were not anticipating this level of surge.” Armstrong also responds to another customer complaining they’ve been waiting two days so far for their transfer of SOL to a private wallet to go through. “It’s a scaling challenge keeping up with activity on Solana chain (which surged lately), not solvency. Customer funds are 100% backed and audited periodically by Deloitte. Team is working hard to resolve it.” According to blockchain data aggregator DefiLlama, Solana has done $22.25 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours while Ethereum ( ETH ) – the top smart contact platform by market cap – has only done $6.21 billion. Solana has also done $35.5 million in fees on the day while Ethereum has only done $15.7 million. US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump both chose the Solana network to launch their respective memecoins just days before the presidential swearing-in ceremony on Monday. Solana is trading for $251 at time of writing, up 5.4% in the last 24 hours.

With the XRP price facing challenges, the spotlight is shifting to this Ethereum altcoin, which is currently in its presale stage. Experts say this is a rare early chance for investors to buy tokens at a low price before its growth begins. Investors Told To Drop XRP And Back This Promising Ethereum Altcoin The XRP price has shown signs of struggle recently, as experts warn investors of a potential drop. Although it is known as a reliable digital asset for international payments, the XRP price is facing strong resistance levels, which limit any upward movement. While its utility as a payment solution has been established, the XRP price movements have become increasingly tied to market speculation and ongoing legal battles. As a result, many experts believe that the XRP price may not deliver the explosive gains that many investors seek. Experts have identified one Ethereum altcoin that could provide investors with big returns during the current XRP price fluctuations. This is due to its innovative approach and real-world applications in DeFi. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Ethereum Altcoin To Deliver Massive Returns WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to make a grand entry into the crypto landscape due to its outstanding utility. Experts have predicted this Ethereum altcoin could grow dramatically following its official launch. This remarkable growth potential is based on its AI-driven platform, which provides unmatched functionalities in digital asset management. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is presently in its presale phase as it prepares for a significant launch in the multi-billion dollar AI coin market. The presale has raised millions of dollars, reflecting investors’ strong confidence in the token’s growth potential. The Ethereum altcoin is currently available at a highly affordable price of $0.042 , offering a distinctive chance for early investors. In addition to this impressive growth opportunity, investors participating in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale will enjoy referral bonuses, lower trading and swapping fees, token airdrops, and the opportunity to earn as much as 180% APY. Investors also have governance rights that allow them to influence important decisions on the platform. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has announced the MVP version of its mobile app for crypto wallet management. Using the CoinGecko API , the crypto wallet delivers real-time pricing information for various cryptocurrencies. Users can access all existing crypto tickers and check their performance in greater detail through interactive candlestick charts. Regarding security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) uses anomaly detection tools to quickly recognize unusual wallet activities and block unauthorized login attempts from unfamiliar devices. Moreover, the project’s smart contract underwent a thorough audit by a prominent crypto auditing firm, SolidProof. With its revolutionary utility and advanced AI-driven functionalities, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ethereum altcoin could deliver life-changing gains for early adopters. By tackling significant issues within the crypto industry, this crypto wallet distinguishes itself as a possible game-changer in the market. Investors should accumulate as many tokens as possible before the presale ends. Conclusion WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) being built on the Ethereum blockchain sets it apart from its competitors. Ethereum supports more than 4,000 decentralized applications (dApps) and handles daily transactions worth billions. Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities and its recent shift to an energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism improve the chances for projects such as WallitIQ to thrive. These strategic advantages position the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ethereum altcoin to deliver considerable value and potentially exponential returns for its adopters as the platform grows in the booming AI coin market. Those who invest now can take advantage of what could be one of the most promising opportunities in crypto. With millions of tokens already sold, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is progressing rapidly as demand is set to overtake supply.

Can Shiba Inu Coin Price Hit 50% Rally?,https://thecoinrise.com/toncoin-surges-over-whale-action-as-blockdag-witnesses-major-miner-sale-of-6-2m-can-shiba-inu-coin-price-hit-50-rally/,"Crypto Enthusiasts Spend $6.2M on 15,400 BlockDAG Rigs as Toncoin Surges & SHIB Price Looks Toward 50% Rise The crypto market witnesses interesting trends, with the latest Toncoin (TON) surge taking center stage, propelled by significant whale moves and massive short liquidations. The buzz has traders watching Toncoin closely to see its next peak. At the same time, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) coin price is gearing up for a robust rally, with projections pointing to a 50% upturn based on current market dynamics and analytical forecasts. In parallel, BlockDAG (BDAG) is experiencing notable demand in the mining sector. With sales reaching $6.2 million from over 15,500 units, BDAG’s mining technology is proving increasingly popular. As the mainnet launch approaches and the availability of mining rigs dwindles, BlockDAG is securing its place as a leading choice for crypto mining within the community, setting the scene for potential substantial growth for those keeping an eye on the market. Toncoin Spikes with Whale Activity: Major Surge Ahead? The recent Toncoin surge has captured widespread interest in the crypto realm, with TON witnessing a 104% spike in significant transaction activity over 24 hours. This surge in TON is fueled by intensified whale activity and $127 million in short liquidations, causing major shifts in asset allocations and a spike in Toncoin’s trading activity. Moreover, the exit of short sellers has prompted a flurry of buy orders, further boosting the Toncoin surge. Market analysts suggest that this dynamic of whale movements and market adjustments may pave the way for continued growth. The trajectory of Toncoin shows promising bullish potential, although market fluctuations could impact the duration of this surge. Shiba Inu Analysis: Coin Price Hints 50% Rally The Shiba Inu coin price is hinting at a possible 50% rally despite recent dips. SHIB has fallen 33% from its December peak, yet signals from a hammer candlestick and a falling wedge on the charts suggest a bullish reversal might be imminent. Analysts see the Shiba Inu coin price potentially rising to $0.000033 from its current $0.00002427. The slowed momentum in Shibarium and reduced transaction fees have affected SHIB’s market standing, impacting burns. Nonetheless, a general uptick in the crypto market, driven by positive trends around Bitcoin, could strengthen SHIB’s recovery prospects. Despite existing risks, the Shiba Inu coin price might gain from an improving market environment and analytical backing. BlockDAG’s Mining Rigs Sell Out Fast: Hits $6.2M Sale BlockDAG is making waves in the crypto mining industry, having sold over 15,400 mining units and nearly depleting its inventory, bringing in $6.2 million from these sales. The X Series miners—comprising models X10, X30, and the top-tier X100—are becoming a hit with both beginners and seasoned miners. The X10 model alone is capable of producing up to 200 BDAG daily, which could amount to $200 daily or $3,000 monthly if BDAG hits its anticipated $1 price this year. For those running larger setups, the X100 model, known as the mining powerhouse, can fetch up to 2,000 BDAG daily, equaling $2,000 per day or $30,000 monthly when BDAG reaches $1. As these X Series miners catch on in the mining circles, BlockDAG’s strong presale showing continues to draw new participants, with over $183 million collected and 17.9 billion BDAG coins distributed at the current $0.0248 price in batch 27. Early supporters have seen returns skyrocket by 2,380%, boosting BlockDAG’s allure in the market. BlockDAG is set to launch its mainnet this year and anticipates a substantial price increase in 2025, fueling further interest in its mining technology. Crypto miners are clamoring to get their hands on BlockDAG’s rigs, betting on the project’s lucrative potential. With its innovative mining tech and growing ecosystem, BlockDAG stands out as a top pick for mining and investment within the crypto sphere. This project offers a versatile platform that appeals to developers, traders, and miners, facilitating easy involvement across the board. Bottom Line: Which is the Best Crypto Right Now? The crypto arena is bustling with activity, highlighted by gains in Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and BlockDAG. The notable 104% Toncoin surge, spurred by significant whale transactions and major short liquidations, has the market speculating on what will happen next. Similarly, the Shiba Inu coin price is on the cusp of a 50% surge, following its recent dips. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is fast becoming a prominent player not just for its success among crypto presales but also for the rapid sales of over 15,500 mining rigs, accruing $6.2 million in miner sales. Its mining equipment offers promising earnings, with growing demand as the 2025 mainnet launch nears. For those considering entering the crypto mining market, investing in BlockDAG’s X series miners could be a wise decision.

The news broke after the company submitted its registration to the Delaware Department of State’s Division of Corporations on Jan. 23, a decision confirmed by Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer, per a report from The Block. “This was from us,” Hougan said. The “Bitwise Dogecoin ETF” is the first attempt by any financial institution to bring a DOGE-focused ETF into the highly regulated U.S. market. The decision comes as no surprise to those watching its recent resurgence under the Trump administration, thanks to “First Buddy” Elon Musk. Created in 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin was designed as a satirical take on the growing crypto market. For years, the Shiba Inu-themed token floated in the shadow of its more serious counterparts. But things took a dramatic turn last year. Under the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), led by President Donald Trump, Dogecoin has become a surprising symbol of financial innovation. The department’s website even displayed DOGE’s logo earlier this week, causing a ton of bullish speculation in the community. ETF Store President Nate Geraci expressed surprise that no company had taken the plunge earlier. “I remain shocked that no issuer has filed for a Dogecoin ETF,” Nate wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on January 15. He pointed out that DOGE is the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, calling the filing a potential marketing win or, at best, a path to SEC approval. Elon continues to be a major force behind DOGE’s mainstream acceptance. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented in November 2024, “Today’s satire is tomorrow’s ETF. Is DOGE a bridge too far? We’ll see.” The timing of the filing aligns with increasing optimism about regulatory reforms. “The hope is that the new administration moves quickly to designate which crypto assets are securities and which aren’t,” Geraci added. “Once that framework is in place, the approval path for additional spot crypto ETFs should become much clearer.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",News|Bitwise|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|MARKET|SHIB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-23 01:04:14

XYZVerse and these 4 altcoins could redefine crypto success stories, potentially creating the next wave of millionaires. Table of Contents XYZVerse secures $5.5 million in presale NEAR Protocol Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Ondo Hedera Conclusion Early investors in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum reaped enormous rewards. Now, new digital assets are emerging with the potential for significant growth. This article explores XYZVerse, along with four other promising altcoins that offer a chance to catch the next wave of crypto success, potentially making millionaires. XYZVerse secures $5.5 million in presale XYZVerse is transforming the crypto space by fusing the excitement of sports with the charm of meme coins. Tailored for fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project seeks to bridge the gap between sports enthusiasts and crypto investors in search of the next big opportunity. While many meme coins falter, XYZVerse sets itself apart with a robust roadmap and a commitment to long-term growth. Already in its presale phase, XYZVerse has attracted significant attention, raising over $5.5 million. This impressive milestone showcases the strong support and enthusiasm of its growing community. The presale consists of 15 stages, with token prices incrementally rising at each phase. Currently priced at $0.002 in stage 10, XYZ is set to reach $0.1 by the presale’s conclusion, signaling substantial growth potential for early adopters. XYZVerse aims to become the G.O.A.T. of meme coins, already earning accolades such as the best new meme project. XYZVerse isn’t just about hype; it’s built on a solid tokenomics foundation designed for sustainability. With 15% allocated for liquidity and 10% reserved for community rewards, including bonuses and airdrops, the project is focused on fostering value. A deflationary burn mechanism will eliminate 17.13% of the total token supply over time, increasing scarcity and potentially boosting token prices. Security and credibility are at the forefront of XYZVerse’s mission. The team has implemented smart contracts audits and has planned listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEX and DEX). These measures, combined with a fully vetted team, position XYZVerse as a credible project with a clear roadmap for growth. Interested investors can be part of XYZVerse’s winning team via presale. NEAR Protocol NEAR Protocol’s price has seen modest downshifts recently. Over the past week, NEAR’s price declined by 2.56%. In the last month, the price changed by -5.95%. Currently, NEAR is trading between $4.75 and $5.83. The 10-day simple moving average is $4.98, slightly below the 100-day average of $5.33. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 45.25, which suggests that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 39.92, supporting the RSI’s neutral stance. The MACD level is -0.0677, hinting at slight bearish momentum. Looking ahead, NEAR faces its nearest resistance at $6.55. Breaking above this level could pave the way toward the second resistance at $8.00. Moving to the first resistance would represent an increase of over 13%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3.63, and falling to this level would mean a decline of around 16%. If the price drops further, the second support at $2.18 comes into play. The data suggests that NEAR’s price could either bounce back from current levels or test these support zones in the near future.

In the last month, it fell by 6.58%, and over the past six months, it has decreased by 3.46%. These consistent declines suggest a bearish trend in the market. FET is currently trading between $1.13 and $1.43. The nearest support level is at $0.96, and a second support is at $0.66. If the price continues to decrease, it may test these support levels. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is at $1.55, with a second resistance at $1.84. Overcoming these resistances could indicate a shift towards a bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 45.40, which is below the neutral 50 mark, suggesting slight bearish sentiment. The Stochastic oscillator is at 46.51, also indicating a neutral to bearish stance. The MACD level is negative at -0.0171, pointing towards bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $1.16, which is below the 100-day SMA of $1.28, indicating that the short-term price is underperforming compared to the longer-term average. Ondo Ondo has shown significant movements. Over the past six months, its price increased by 37.68%. In the last month, however, it declined by 21.51%. This past week saw a recovery with a 2.65% rise. The coin is currently trading between $1.20 and $1.55. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 47.03, suggesting a neutral market. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0172, indicating mild bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the Stochastic at 62.63 points toward potential upward movement. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close at $1.29 and $1.33, indicating consolidation. Based on this data, ONDO’s price might stabilize or see moderate growth in the near term. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $1.80. If ONDO breaks through this, it could reach the next resistance at $2.26, representing an increase of about 43% from current levels. On the downside, support exists at $0.88 and further at $0.42 if the price dips significantly.

Over the last month, it rose by 10.15%. Remarkably, in the past six months, HBAR has surged by 207.56%. This significant growth indicates rising interest in the coin. Currently, HBAR trades between $0.32 and $0.40. It is approaching the nearest resistance level at $0.47. If it breaks through this point, the next target could be the second resistance at $0.62. Reaching this level would represent a substantial increase from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.18, which may provide a safety net if the price dips. The Relative Strength Index is at 44.99, suggesting HBAR is neither overbought nor oversold. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is at $0.33, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.35. The MACD level sits at -0.0048, indicating slight bearish momentum. However, considering the recent price gains, there’s potential for the upward trend to continue. Traders will be watching these levels closely to see if HBAR can sustain its momentum.

The staff changes — with each departure replaced by interim officials appointed by Pham — will have implications on cryptocurrency oversight for the U.S. derivatives regulator that's poised to play a bigger role in the field. Notably, Harry Jung, who joined the CFTC in 2023 as a senior policy advisor to Pham, will lead the agency's engagement with the crypto industry. He's been tapped for an elevated role as the CFTC's new acting chief of staff. Pham announced the departure of an extensive list of senior officials, including the agency's general council and the heads of its enforcement, public affairs, clearing and risk, market oversight and market participants divisions. Also exiting are the head of the office of international affairs and the department that oversees legislative affairs – a key area for the agency as Congress will be working on a crypto bill that could put the CFTC in a starring role. ""I’m pleased to announce CFTC leadership changes with the beginning of the new administration,"" Pham said in a statement. ""I am grateful for their combined many decades of faithful service to the CFTC, and I appreciate our talented CFTC staff who will be assuming these roles on an interim basis."" The new acting general counsel — the agency's top legal official — and Pham's chief of staff and public-affairs director were lifted from the ranks of staff from her commissioner office: Meghan Tente, Taylor Foy and Jung, respectively. Running the legislative office will be Nicholas Elliot, who previously advised her on policy.

Crypto analyst Gert van Lagen revealed how this could happen and what could come next after this price surge. Bitcoin Price To Rally To As High As $170,000 Following Wave Formation The Bitcoin price is set to rally to as high as $170,000 following a wave formation. In an X post, Gert van Lagen revealed that Bitcoin had confirmed blow-off wave 5 within the $150,000 and $180,000 range by recently reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $109,000. Following this development, the analyst stated that the flagship crypto is now aiming to reach between $150,000 and $170,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upper Band Moves Above $105,400 – Where Price Is Headed Next Once the Bitcoin price rallies to between $150,000 and $170,000, Gert Van Lagen predicts that a retracement to as low as $120,000 will follow, with claims of a top. However, the rally to $170,000 won’t mark the cycle top for the flagship crypto as the analyst there will be another parabolic rally to the upside, which will be the wave v to complete the fifth wave. Gert van Lagen predicts that the Bitcoin price will rally to as high as $300,000 on the last leg of this cycle, which would end the bull market. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could reach this price target by April. This isn’t the first time the analyst has predicted that the flagship crypto could rally to as high as $300,000. He previously highlighted a cup and handle pattern, which put the final ascent for BTC at this price target. BTC Rally To $158,000 Still In Play Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price, stating that the projected rally to the $158,000 target is still in play. This target came about when he highlighted a bullish pennant forming on BTC’s monthly timeframe. The analyst remarked that Bitcoin could catapult to the moon if this bullish pattern plays out. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Above $100,000 Renews Hope, Analyst Reveals The Cycle Top Meanwhile, in another X post, Titan of Crypto mentioned that the flagship crypto is back to its bullish momentum as it looks “extremely bullish” on the daily chart. This was based on his Ichimoku Cloud analysis, in which he pointed out that the cloud was turning bullish. Amid these bullish outlooks for the Bitcoin price, crypto analyst Justin Bennett has warned that the flagship crypto could drop to as low as $91,000. He remarked that Bitcoin pumped into Trump’s inauguration, so there is a good chance that the rally fades from here. The analyst added that BTC is range-bound until proven otherwise and that the January 13th lower wick at $91,000 looks primed for a retest. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,402, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

33767162,[object Object],1737595969,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitwise Seeks Approval For Dogecoin ETF In Delaware: What It Means For DOGE,https://bitcoinist.com/bitwise-seeks-approval-for-dogecoin-etf/,"In a significant development for both the memecoin and the broader cryptocurrency landscape, Bitwise Asset Management has filed for a Dogecoin ETF in the state of Delaware. This application marks a notable addition to the growing roster of exchange-traded products aimed at providing investors with new avenues for cryptocurrency exposure. How Trump’s Presidency Could Transform Crypto Regulations The timing of the new Dogecoin ETF filing is particularly relevant given the recent political landscape in the United States. With Donald Trump having taken office for a second term, there is renewed optimism surrounding the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. President Trump, who previously held the presidency from 2017 to 2021, has expressed intentions to create a more favorable climate for digital assets, contrasting sharply with the regulatory scrutiny that characterized the Biden administration. Under former President Joe Biden, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Gary Gensler, adopted a stringent approach to cryptocurrency regulation. This often resulted in a lack of clarity and an enforcement-heavy strategy that led to multiple lawsuits against key players in the digital asset space. The regulatory landscape was marked by ambiguity, leaving many investors and companies uncertain about compliance and future opportunities. However, President Trump’s administration has already begun making regulatory changes aimed at fostering cryptocurrency innovation. Recent appointments to key regulatory agencies and the establishment of a new crypto council within the White House signal a shift in focus. Observers believe these changes could pave the way for more cryptocurrencies to gain access to investment vehicles like ETFs. Bitwise Leads The Charge With Dogecoin ETF Application The filing for the Dogecoin ETF is also inspired by the success of similar investment products that debuted last year, particularly those focused on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These ETFs have seen substantial uptake from institutional investors, validating the demand for cryptocurrency-based investment options. Bitwise is positioning itself as a key player in this emerging market, following its application for a Dogecoin ETF with similar filings for XRP and Solana. Other asset managers are also seeking approval for ETFs involving Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), and even additional memecoins such as TRUMP and BONK, as evidenced by recent applications from firms like REX Shares and Osprey. Despite the excitement surrounding the Dogecoin ETF filing, the market reaction has been subdued. As of now, the price of DOGE has remained relatively stable, reflecting a 3% decline over the past 24 hours and a 7% drop over the past week. This muted response suggests that while the ETF filing is a positive sign for the future, it has yet to translate into immediate enthusiasm among traders. But should the Dogecoin ETF receive regulatory approval, it could lead to a significant influx of investment into the memecoin, potentially driving its price higher.

Now, meme coins like Dogecoin are struggling to regain momentum, the PropiChain project is capturing attention for its innovative use of AI in the real estate sector. As Dogecoin price sets for a potential $1 milestone by 2025, PropiChain’s technology and game-changing approach to property investment position it for unprecedented growth, projected to deliver returns as high as 30,000x. Let’s explore Dogecoin price potential, its ongoing challenges, and why PropiChain is emerging as the smarter investment for those looking to maximize gains in the crypto market. Dogecoin Price Eyes the $1 Milestone The Dogecoin price has been the subject of much speculation as market analysts predict it could finally achieve the long-awaited $1 mark in early 2025. This would represent a monumental milestone for DOGE, as its strong community, celebrity endorsements, and growing use cases continue to fuel optimism. However, while Dogecoin’s potential is promising, its current market cap and relatively limited technological innovation may limit further explosive growth. That is why most investors are starting to explore other opportunities that offer not just high returns but also long-term utility. PropiChain: The AI Altcoin Set to Eclipse Dogecoin PropiChain has emerged as a powerful alternative to Dogecoin. While DOGE thrives on memes and hype, PropiChain offers tangible utility by combining AI-driven technology with blockchain to revolutionize the real estate industry. With predictions of over 100,000% gains, PropiChain’s potential far exceeds Dogecoin price’s projected rise. How PropiChain Outshines Dogecoin 1. AI-Powered Market Analysis for Smarter Investments PropiChain uses artificial intelligence to analyze real estate markets, providing investors with deep insights into emerging trends, undervalued properties, and optimal investment opportunities. With PropiChain’s AI analysis, investors can act early and secure higher returns. 2. Automated Property Valuation for Accuracy PropiChain’s Automated Valuation Models (AVM) utilize AI to deliver accurate property valuations based on market conditions, location, and other key factors. This ensures investors avoid overpaying or underselling their properties, maximizing profits in every transaction. 3. Fractional Ownership Through Tokenization The platform allows users to own fractions of high-value real estate properties through blockchain tokenization. Instead of needing large capital to buy entire properties, investors can purchase smaller shares and earn passive income through rental yields and property appreciation. 4. Metaverse Integration for Global Access PropiChain takes real estate investment into the metaverse by offering virtual property tours, staging, and global buyer-seller interactions. These tools enhance the buying and selling process, making it easier to reach international markets. A seller can showcase properties to global buyers without geographical limitations, increasing exposure and sales potential. 5. Real-Time Filtering and Suggestions PropiChain’s AI system uses advanced filtering to match investors with properties that align with their goals, whether it’s rental income or long-term appreciation. This reduces the time and effort required to find lucrative opportunities, letting investors focus on profits. Dogecoin vs. PropiChain: Why PropiChain Could Deliver Double the Gains While Dogecoin has its charm and a committed following, its growth relies heavily on market sentiment and social media hype. PropiChain , on the other hand, delivers practical utility, offering tools that directly enhance profitability for investors. Additionally, Dogecoin’s established market cap makes it challenging to achieve the same meteoric gains it once did. A $1,000 investment in DOGE at it’s the current dogecoin price might yield 10x returns if it hits $1. In contrast, PropiChain, with its early-stage pricing and disruptive technology, could turn that same $1,000 into $100,000 or more. PropiChain Presale: A Golden Opportunity PropiChain’s token (PCHAIN) is currently in its second presale stage, priced at $0.011. The price will rise to $0.023 in the next stage, and with its listing on CoinMarketCap and verified BlockAudit security review, it’s clear that PropiChain is a secure and legitimate investment opportunity. Investors who join now will benefit from the lowest price point before the token gains mainstream adoption. If PropiChain achieves its projected 30,000x growth, early adopters could see life-changing returns. Grab this opportunity now. By the time it transitions to stage three, the price will more than double, and as adoption grows, so will its value. Investors who hesitate may find themselves priced out of one of the most promising opportunities in the crypto market. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price rising to $1 in 2025 is an exciting prospect, PropiChain’s potential to deliver double the returns makes it the better choice for smart investors. With a foundation built on utility, innovation, and accessibility, PropiChain is a game-changer for both the real estate and crypto industries. Early investors in PropiChain stand to gain the most. A modest $1,000 investment today could yield unparalleled returns, cementing its position as the next big thing in crypto. Don’t wait, PropiChain is the future of property investment and wealth generation.

The launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens sparked a frenzy among users as the memecoins quickly amassed historic market cap valuations in record time. The values of the tokens have fallen by 50% since then. The surge in activity led to network congestion and transaction delays. As the memecoin frenzy settles, Coinbase’s Jesse Pollak and Helius Labs’ Mert Mumtaz have also found the time for a social media exchange that got heated quickly but was ultimately resolved graciously. Blockchain executives clash publicly Following the launch of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA memecoins, the Coinbase exchange and Solana networks experienced substantial congestion that led to transaction delays of up to 21 hours. In a post on his X social media account, Mumtaz pointed out how he found it ironic that Coinbase executives were putting Solana down when they failed to handle Solana transactions during “crypto’s biggest weekend.” The CEO went further to accuse Base of using “backroom tactics” to lure users from Solana to Base. He even implied that they often told teams behind closed doors that Base is a long-term solution while Solana is a short-term fix. Jesse Pollak, head of Coinbase’s base initiative, responded directly to Mumtaz’s claims. “I am the founder of Base, and it’s my job to make Base successful,” Pollak wrote. In a series of tweets, Pollak noted the efforts of the Coinbase executive team to address and resolve the scaling challenges. He also acknowledged that while Base does compete with Solana, it is the kind of healthy competition that encourages growth and innovation in the crypto space. Mumtaz ended the exchange graciously by emphasizing that competition should be honest and transparent without undermining the work of thousands of Solana builders. “As long as we agree to compete honestly without false virtue signaling and backroom tactics — I am on board with that. Best of luck and let’s have some fun pushing crypto forward,” he wrote. Network congestion and transaction delays On January 18 and 19, President and First Lady Trump launched their memecoins, TRUMP and MELANIA. The tokens went live on the Solana network and unsurprisingly drew a surge of activity as users raced to join the buying frenzy. This surge attracted over 200,000 new on-chain users through Moonshot. It caused network congestion and transaction delays, with some Coinbase users being unable to complete their transactions for up to four days. In response to the outrage and chaos that ensued due to the delays, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong reassured users that the team was working around the clock to scale Coinbase’s infrastructure to better support Solana. Despite the congestion, Solana’s network maintained 100% functionality, indicating that the delays were only due to the influx of users and had nothing to do with the blockchain itself.

With investors increasingly shifting coins into long-term storage, is XRP price could be on the verge of a major breakout towards $5? Ripple (XRP) Consolidates as $3 amid Multiple Trump-fueled Bullish Catalysts Ripple (XRP) price stagnated around $3 on Wednesday, raising a few eyebrows as crypto market events during the day revealed a number of bullish catalysts. First, Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyyfart confirmed the imminent listing of XRP and Solana (SOL) futures on CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange. Given the share size of capital at play among institutional investor-focus exchanges like the CME group, Ripple price is expected to attract significant capital inflows in the long-run. XRP Price Action | XRPUSDT However XRP price failed to advance significantly after the news of this event broke for several reasons. The chart above shows that XRP price spent the larger part of Wednesday in consolidation phase, moving within the narrow channel between $3 to $3.2. First, XRP is not expected to begin trading on the CME group until Feb 10. Hence the expected capital inflows are not priced. More so, Donald Trump’s foray into the memecoin space, has diverted layer-1 capital flows towards the Solana network. These two facts played a role in XRP tepid price action observed on Wednesday. It remains to be seen if bull traders will break out of the current sit-and-watch state, and place larger long bets as February 10, at the tentative date of XRP and SOL listing on CME Group approaches. Binance Traders spotted moving $300M XRP amid Trump ETF Approval Speculations. XRP price has established steady support above $3 this week, amid positive speculations surrounding potential altcoin ETF approvals, President Donald Trump’s expected crypto-friendly policies and rapid digital assets purchase by affiliate firm World Liberty Financial (WLFI). However, on-chain data trends reveal another major bullish signal from investors currently holding XRP. Validating this narrative, CryptoQuant’s exchange reserves chart above tracks the daily balances of XRP coin deposited in wallets hosted on Binance, the world’s largest spot trading crypto exchange. As of January 16 XRP traders held a total of 3.04 billion XRP in Binance-hosted wallets. But that figure has declined steeply since then, hitting the 2.9 billion mark at close of trading on Tuesday. This reflects that XRP holders have effectively removed 100 million XRP ($300 million) form the short-term market supply readily available to be traded on Binance. This reflects that XRP price has increased by double-digits in the past week, the majority of current holders are unwilling to sell, instead are transferring large volumes of coins into long-term storage options. Such a dramatic decline in short-term market supply could clear the path for XRP price to enter an accelerated breakout during the next demand surge. XRP Price Forecast: $3 support holds firm as traders await market clarity XRP price forecast currently flashes positive signals, with recent movements indicating a steady support at the $3.00 zone. The XRPUSD daily chart further highlights a recent 7% rally over two days, showcasing buyer confidence. The Bollinger Bands display a moderate expansion, with XRP trading near the upper band at $3.14, suggesting bullish momentum but signaling a potential overextension. Additionally, the Parabolic SAR, with its dots trailing below current price levels, reinforces the bullish bias as it often signals sustained upward momentum. XRP Price Forecast | XRPUSD The MACD histogram, while remaining positive, shows narrowing bars, hinting at waning bullish momentum. The MACD line is slightly above the signal line, supporting a cautiously optimistic outlook. For a bullish scenario, XRP must decisively breach $3.52, the upper Bollinger Band, to target $3.70 and beyond. Conversely, a bearish breakdown of $3.00 could expose XRP to $2.68 support, indicated by the lower SAR marker and midline of the Bollinger Bands.

Tornado Cash’s TORN surged following the court ruling to as high as $25.48 from $8.12, the highest since November 2024. At the time of writing, TORN was trading at $16.3, up by 102% in the last 24 hours. In a historic court ruling for the crypto industry, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said in a Jan. 21 filing that “the judgment of the district court is reversed,” as “ we hold that Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts (the lines of privacy-enabling software code) are not the 'property' of a foreign national or entity, meaning (1) they cannot be blocked under IEEPA, and (2) OFAC overstepped its congressionally defined authority,” the court said referring to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

The move aims to position FRAX as a leader in the growing U.S.-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. A potential follow-up investment of $10 million is also being considered, contingent on the success of the partnership. Frax Finance Proposes $5M Investment In WLFI The interest in U.S.-origin crypto initiatives has been fueled by the election of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States. The current administration has shown a great interest in the development of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. World Liberty Financial, a DeFi project that is closely aligned with Trump’s agenda of a crypto economy centred around the United States, has become a major player in this regard. Frax Finance, which focuses on the algorithmic stablecoin, plans to incorporate frxUSD into the WLFI system. The proposal focuses on how the business can leverage on the governance structure, distribution network and partnership of WLFI. As per the proposal, WLFI aims to bring millions of Americans into DeFi and help US based crypto projects. The first $5 million investment would enable FRAX to purchase WLFI tokens and thus become shareholders in its governance framework. A second phase of up to $10 million may be available if there is evidence of achievement of the initial goals. WLFI’s Expanding Influence in U.S.-Based DeFi Though Trump had been vocal on the campaign trail about supporting cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, he has not yet officially mentioned Bitcoin or any other virtual currency since taking the oath of office. This has raised eyebrows especially given that his administration was known to have pledged support to U.S based digital currency projects. Nevertheless, the actions of WLFI seem to be aligned with the pro-crypto agenda and are expanding actively in the DeFi sector. The platform has recently added the leading DeFi tokens to its portfolio, including Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), AAVE (AAVE), and Wrapped Bitcoin (BTC). According to the data, the ETH assets of WLFI have reached more than $184 million and the company also has sizable investments in other products. In its governance structure, the WLFI community has the ability to participate in decision making within the ecosystem. For instance, Ethena Labs recently used WLFI’s governance platform to propose the use of its stablecoin as collateral in Aave. Similar governance options are also being considered for the frxUSD that can further enhance the use of FRAX within the WLFI domain. FRAX’s Strategic Position in the Partnership Frax Finance has a unique position in this proposed collaboration due to its U.S. roots and co-founder Stephen Moore’s connection to the Trump administration. Moore, a former economic advisor to Donald Trump, lends credibility to FRAX’s alignment with a U.S.-centric DeFi agenda. The proposal outlines that this partnership would elevate FRAX’s status within the DeFi community. Integrating frxUSD as collateral in WLFI’s ecosystem could potentially increase adoption among millions of WLFI’s users. Additionally, FRAX stands to benefit from WLFI’s governance model, which could provide strategic influence over future decisions.
