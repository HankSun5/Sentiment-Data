The crypto market is showing clear signs of stress, and new data from CryptoQuant confirms that Bitcoin is now moving into one of the most severe short-term capitulation phases of this cycle. According to the latest on-chain metrics, short-term holders (STHs) are realizing losses at a scale typically seen only near major market turning points. Related Reading: XRP Supply In Profit Falls to 58.5% – Lowest Since 2024 Despite Higher Price The key indicator driving this analysis is STH-SOPR, which has plunged to deeply depressed readings around 0.97. This means STHs are selling coins at a clear loss, often driven by fear rather than strategy. Even more importantly, this metric has spent several consecutive weeks below the critical 1.0 threshold, forming what analysts refer to as a structural “capitulation band.” Historically, whenever STH-SOPR remained under 1.0 for extended periods, it signaled heavy emotional selling—typically from the most reactive and least informed market participants. These episodes have repeatedly aligned with late-stage corrections, market reversals, and shifts in long-term holder dominance. With Bitcoin now sitting at a crucial technical and psychological zone, the next phase could determine whether this becomes a deeper bear trend or a major reset before recovery. Short-Term Holders Under Extreme Stress as Capitulation Deepens According to XWIN Research on CryptoQuant, the current selloff is being amplified by the behavior of short-term holders, with the STH-MVRV ratio now sitting far below 1.0. This indicates that nearly all recent buyers are holding Bitcoin at a loss, placing short-term profitability in one of the weakest conditions in the entire dataset. Historically, these deep unrealized-loss phases are extremely rare and tend to compress selling pressure quickly, as weak hands eventually run out of coins to sell. This pattern is clearly visible in real market flows. A striking 65,200 BTC were recently sent to exchanges at a loss, showing that fear is not an abstract sentiment but is materializing in real, loss-driven capitulation. This kind of behavior aligns with classical capitulation structures: unrealized losses surge, panic selling intensifies, and eventually selling pressure becomes unsustainable. Once that happens, stronger hands begin absorbing supply quietly in the background. While this setup doesn’t guarantee an immediate rebound, the broader structure is shifting toward conditions that have historically preceded cyclical recoveries. STH losses remain at extreme levels, STH-SOPR is still below 1.0, and the pressure fueling exchange inflows is rooted in panic rather than fundamentals. Volatility is likely to persist, but the ongoing cleansing of weak hands is a process often seen near the end of major corrections — not at the start. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Dumps 2,800 BTC as Bitcoin Crashes Below $90K Testing Weekly Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market approaching a critical turning point as price trades just above $91,000 following a sharp multi-week decline. The recent breakdown from the $110,000–$105,000 range has confirmed a loss of bullish momentum, with sellers gaining control and pushing BTC toward its next major weekly support cluster near the 50-week moving average around $88,000–$90,000. This zone has historically acted as a key pivot level, often signaling whether a corrective phase deepens or stabilizes. Volume adds important context. The past several weekly candles show rising sell-side activity, reflecting panic-driven exits rather than orderly distribution. However, this surge in volume also indicates that the market may be approaching a capitulation threshold, where forced selling begins to exhaust itself — a setup often seen before stronger hands step in. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Historical Accumulation Level – Just 8% Away From LTH Cost Basis Structurally, Bitcoin is still trading above the 100-week and 200-week moving averages, both of which continue to trend upward. This suggests the aggressive downside move has not yet broken the broader macrotrend. But the loss of mid-term support levels and the sustained downward pressure highlight a market struggling to find confidence.

54630121,630711,1763593259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54630121.jpeg,Shiba Inu Receives Prestigious Honor Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum In Japan,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-prestigious-honor/,"Japan has officially elevated Shiba Inu (SHIB) into its highest-tier crypto compliance category, placing it alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. This milestone reflects a clear shift in how Japanese regulators view SHIB, recognizing it as more than a speculative token and validating its advancement into a government-approved digital asset. The designation is expected to reshape market perception, facilitate faster exchange listings, and enhance Shiba Inu’s readiness for participation at an institutional level within one of the world’s most tightly regulated financial markets . Shiba Inu’s Green-List Recognition Alongside Bitcoin And Ethereum The Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) , operating under the Financial Services Agency, has added SHIB to its Green List. This whitelist is reserved for assets demonstrating strong liquidity, broad exchange presence, and consistent operational performance. Being included on the Green List signals regulatory confidence and allows domestic exchanges to list Shiba Inu without undergoing lengthy, asset-specific vetting procedures. For ecosystem operators and liquidity providers, this reduces barriers to entry, improves the efficiency of capital allocation, and expands Shiba Inu’s reach across Japan’s compliant digital-asset infrastructure. The Green List also carries significant symbolic weight. Only a handful of digital assets—including Bitcoin and Ethereum—have historically received this designation, according to the JVCEA’s November 12, 2025, update. Being recognized alongside these benchmark cryptocurrencies positions SHIB as a more credible and professionally managed asset, helping it shed some of the skepticism associated with meme-based tokens . Japan is also reviewing its cryptocurrency taxation framework . Current policy discussions propose reducing the tax rate on approved, Green-Listed assets from the highest income brackets to roughly 20%. If implemented, this reform could materially enhance Shiba Inu’s appeal to both retail and institutional investors, creating a strong incentive for participation in a lower-tax, regulated environment. Analysts suggest that aligning regulatory recognition with favorable tax treatment could lead to a significant rise in compliant inflows once the reform is enacted, further supporting liquidity and adoption. Impact On Market Positioning And Future Capital Flows This recognition comes at a critical time for Shiba Inu, which has been upgrading its infrastructure and reorganizing its ecosystem to move beyond a meme-asset reputation . Japan’s formal approval confirms SHIB’s improved risk profile and signals to global markets that it has reached a more regulated, professionally governed stage of adoption. Licensed exchanges in Japan can now deploy new Shiba Inu markets, structured products, and liquidity channels with shorter compliance timelines. Increased accessibility encourages higher transactional activity, strengthens liquidity, and improves SHIB’s suitability for institutional participation. The Green-List status also positions SHIB for future inclusion in regulated investment vehicles , such as exchange-traded notes and custodial products, pending further approvals. By joining Bitcoin and Ethereum in Japan’s top compliance tier, Shiba Inu secures a significant step forward in global credibility, institutional acceptance, and its potential to attract future capital flows .",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 23:00:59

According to on-chain metrics, 42% of current XRP wallets accumulated their tokens near the $3 mark, leaving many with losses of 40% or more. Analysts warn that prolonged unrealized losses can trigger capitulation, adding pressure to an already fragile market outlook. While the XRP price is still nearly 4 times higher than it was in November last year, many investors appear to have entered during the post-SEC rally when sentiment was peaking. That surge, triggered by partial legal wins against the SEC, attracted a wave of buyers now sitting deep in the red. With sentiment still near historic lows, analysts warn that this group of underwater holders could start exiting if the broader market continues to slide. XRP Price Prediction: ETF Launches Could Trigger a Trend Reversal XRP is approaching a potential breakdown toward the $1.50 support zone after failing to hold above recent consolidation levels. The chart shows a descending structure forming, with any bounce likely facing resistance around $2.50 and again near the $3.60 high. If sentiment begins to turn and support holds, XRP may recover in phases — but for now, momentum remains weak. The upcoming launch of multiple XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States offers a long-term catalyst, potentially unlocking institutional demand once market conditions stabilize. In the meantime, storage and security remain key for any crypto portfolio.

However, for long-term retirement investors —particularly those using Bitcoin IRAs—price dips can offer strategic entry points rather than reasons for concern. Jonathan Rose, CEO of BlockTrust IRA, told Cryptonews that downturns often create the most compelling opportunities. He noted that the recent crypto pullback resulted in one of the busiest weeks ever for BlockTrust IRA, a U.S.-based platform that allows retail investors to hold crypto in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. “We are seeing a huge shift of investors putting crypto in BlockTrust IRAs, which indicates that Bitcoin is here to stay and that this is a great price entry opportunity,” he said. Data from Alto, a platform that allows users to add alternative assets to self-directed retirement accounts, echoes this trend. The company reported that its 29,000 self-directed IRA users executed over 240,000 crypto trades last year. Alto also stated that proprietary data from its platform reflects the growing confidence in crypto investments as part of a self-directed IRA. Crypto isn't just for traders. It's for planners. A Crypto IRA can help you secure your financial future. — BitcoinIRA (@Bitcoin_IRA) November 13, 2025 A Long-Awaited Entry Point for Retirement Investors Rose added that Bitcoin’s recent dip has opened the door for investors who previously felt like they had “missed the boat.” “For retirement investors who plan to hold Bitcoin for 10, 20, or even 30 years, dips simply represent lower entry points,” he said. This sentiment is shared across the industry. Ryan Flynn, head of Swan Advisor at Swan Bitcoin—a Bitcoin-only wealth management firm—told Cryptonews that Swan sees increased buying activity across all account types during drawdowns, including IRAs. “ Drawdowns in Bitcoin’s price are normal as Bitcoin continues its path of monetization and represents a buying opportunity for those who understand its fundamentals,” Flynn said. Jad Comair, CEO of Melanion Capital, added that Bitcoin’s pullbacks differ from traditional assets. He explained that traditional stock investments typically drop when fundamentals are deteriorating. However, Comair pointed out that Bitcoin investments work differently. “Bitcoin’s fundamentals don’t change when the price pulls back. The supply schedule remains fixed, the halving cadence continues, and global adoption keeps expanding,” he stated. Tax Benefits Strengthen the Case for Buying the Dip While lower prices alone create attractive buying conditions, Bitcoin IRAs offer additional advantages. The most obvious advantage of a Bitcoin dip is the chance to acquire more BTC for the same dollar amount. In a tax-advantaged retirement account , this effect compounds over decades. With a Traditional Bitcoin IRA, gains are tax-deferred; in a Roth Bitcoin IRA, gains can grow tax-free. Accumulating BTC at discounted prices inside these structures maximizes long-term appreciation without triggering taxable events along the way. “In Roth IRAs specifically, this allows for more of Bitcoin’s future price action to be captured as tax-free appreciation. Drawdowns allow retirement investors to max out capped annual contributions, increasing the account’s Bitcoin exposure,” Flynn explained. He added that when Bitcoin pulls back from $125k to $90k, the same $7k annual contribution purchases nearly 40% more Bitcoin. “These advantages accrue mostly to the investor who is preparing for retirement in the next 5-10 or more years,” Flynn stated. Yet, Flynn pointed out that disadvantages can particularly impact those investors who are already in retirement or are nearing that period. This is because these individuals have less time to recover to previous highs before distributions begin. “There is a behavioral risk that puts those investors who don’t understand what Bitcoin represents at a disadvantage where they may be more likely to panic sell near local bottoms,” Flynn said. Jonathan Bander, CPA at a New York-based public accounting firm ExperityCPA, further told Cryptonews that while a drop in BTC enables tax-loss harvesting to offset gains, disadvantages include no offset for personal income inside IRAs and ongoing volatility risk. Who Should Consider a Bitcoin IRA? While industry experts generally agree that Bitcoin dips can favor long-term retirement investors, suitability varies by investor. Crypto is highly volatile and may be more susceptible to manipulation than registered securities. Because of this, Comair believes younger investors may be best positioned to benefit. “They have the longest runway to let Bitcoin’s structural appreciation compound and can treat volatility the same way they would treat another major company’s historic drawdowns,” he said. Comair added that investors with stable cash flow and low liquidity pressure may also find a Bitcoin IRA appealing. “These individuals can keep contributing during corrections without being forced to sell.” Investors worried about long-term fiat debasement could also be a good fit, as Comair commented that Bitcoin’s fixed supply and institutional adoption make it a strategic hedge for retirement portfolios that are otherwise concentrated in assets tied to central bank policy. A Crypto IRA might offer tax-deferred growth and diversification. Just make sure it lines up with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline before jumping in. — Digital Wealth Partners (@DWP_advisors) November 14, 2025 However, investors who are more cautious or close to retirement and cannot tolerate large swings may want to rethink having a Bitcoin IRA. Fidelity research found that adding BTC to a portfolio would have enhanced returns during specific periods in the past, but also that even a small allocation of Bitcoin meaningfully increased portfolio volatility. Source: Fidelity Research The Future Growth of Bitcoin IRAs As the broader crypto market matures , demand for Bitcoin IRAs appears set to accelerate. Rose said BlockTrust is already seeing increased interest from international investors seeking exposure through U.S.-based Bitcoin IRAs. Comair believes this trend is only just beginning. He predicts that by 2026, Bitcoin will sit “much closer to the center of retirement strategies.” “Exchange-traded fund penetration will be broader, corporate ownership more common, and the post-halving supply regime will be tighter. For retirement investors, this period will be remembered as the phase when buying dips in a structurally appreciating asset became standard practice, not a contrarian move.” The post Why Bitcoin’s Latest Dip Has Supercharged Demand for Crypto Retirement Accounts appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Price|btc,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-19 23:18:41

Solana ETF Netflows. Source: SoSoValue . Collectively, Solana-based ETFs have already taken in over $2 billion, as issuers race to meet growing interest from allocators in assets beyond Bitcoin. Still, secondSwap CEO Kanny Lee cautions that these heavy flows could be misleading, crediting them to the novelty of the staking yields narrative when speaking with Decrypt . He argues the “real signal” will emerge early next year if the ETFs maintain sticky allocators once the initial hype wears off, a key test of true long-term holding intent. Considering that Bitcoin ETFs drove the BTC price to former all-time highs in early 2024, Solana could see a similar setup running into 2026 with growing sticky mainstream adoption. Solana Price Predictions: Can Solana Replicate Bitcoin’s 10x ETF Rally Solana could credibly mirror Bitcoin’s 2024 ETF-fuelled breakout, with its latest rebound affirming the lower support of a year-long symmetrical triangle. With momentum indicators verging on bullish, eyes are back on a breakout. The RSI has surged off the oversold threshold, while the MACD closes in on a golden cross, both signalling strengthening buy pressure beneath the surface. If momentum holds, Solana may finally challenge and overcome the key breakout zone around $205. Clearing this level opens the path toward reclaiming the $300 all-time high. With ETF inflows showing sticky, long-term accumulation, a sustained uptrend could unlock far more aggressive targets. As the bull market matures, a move toward $1,500, a 10x from current prices, becomes increasingly feasible. Still, the breakdown scenario remains in the cards if price action aligns with broader market sentiment over the ETF narrative. A rejection here could send Solana 30% lower to retest support near $95. A rejection here could send Solana 30% lower to retest support near $95.

The original cryptocurrency is down by 11% in a week and by 18% in a month, while Ethereum and Solana are down by 24% and 27% in the past month. These are discouraging percentages, yet such losses have stemmed from fears of an AI-related stock market bubble, which has caused institutions to pre-emptively pull money from crypto ETFs. However, fundamentals have not changed at all, while certain new tokens are showing the potential to rally in the coming weeks, including new ERC-20 cryptocurrency PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), which is our best new meme coin to buy today. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 19 November First announced in September, PEPENODE has since gone on to raise just over $2.15 million in its ongoing presale, which is gaining momentum with every passing week. This figure stands as a strong vote of confidence in PEPENODE from investors, who are likely excited by the project’s plan to launch crypto’s first mine-to-earn token. What this means is that PEPENODE will provide users with the opportunity to mine coins without having to invest in traditional mining equipment. Instead, they can use the PEPENODE coin itself to buy virtual mining nodes, with more nodes resulting in greater rewards. It’s as simple as that, with the platform paying out mining rewards in external coins, such as the original Pepe and Fartcoin (the project will announce more tokens at later dates). Because users will need to buy more PEPENODE in order to grow their virtual mining rigs, the token could attract substantial demand, pushing its price up rapidly. On top of this, holders will be able to stake the token, earning a passive income that currently equals an APY of 595%. This is hugely bullish, which is why PEPENODE is our best new meme coin to buy today, given its fundamentals and growing popularity. How to Join the PEPENODE Presale Before It Ends Of course, the token also makes use of tried-and-true Pepe memes, something which has also helped it grow its community at such an early stage of development. While the market may be down now, there’s every chance that a wave of altcoin ETF launches could spark a general recovery, which could coincide with PEPENODE’s launch. As such, it could rally strongly when it lists for the first time, with interested investors advised to act early, so that they can buy the token at a discount. They can do so by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. The coin is currently selling at a price of $0.0011546, although this will rise every few days until the sale ends. Once the sale ends, buyers will receive their coins, while PEPENODE will list on exchanges, potentially sending its price flying.

See What Just Happened,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-headed-to-1-50-see-what-just-happened/,"XRP continues to display signs of weakening momentum as sellers maintain pressure on the market. The asset has recorded a slight decline in the past 24 hours and is down by approximately 11% over the last week, reflecting the broader downturn across major cryptocurrencies. Despite this short-term weakness, XRP remains marginally profitable for investors who entered the market at the beginning of the year. The token has gained 2.58% on a year-to-date basis, positioning it alongside BNB and Tron as the only top-10 digital assets still showing positive returns in that period. Most other large-cap cryptocurrencies have surrendered earlier gains due to ongoing corrections. $XRP Lost the previous breakout level. Looks headed back to $1.50 area. pic.twitter.com/8VskyzrPXk — Nebraskangooner (@Nebraskangooner) November 17, 2025 Failed Breakout Raises Concern Market analyst Nebraskangooner has issued a cautious outlook for XRP, indicating that the token may be at risk of extending its downward movement. According to his assessment, XRP’s inability to confirm a breakout from a long-standing technical pattern is a key factor supporting a bearish scenario. He specifically referenced a descending triangle visible on the weekly chart, noting that XRP approached the upper boundary of the formation in late October but failed to secure upward continuation. The chart indicates that the triangle originated after XRP reached its yearly high of $3.66 in July. Subsequent trading activity kept the token within the confines of this formation until recent market conditions pushed it lower. Sellers eventually forced XRP below the triangle’s lower support zone near $2.20, marking a significant shift in structure. Based on this breakdown, Nebraskangooner projects that XRP could decline toward the $1.50 region. This level represents an estimated 30% slide from the current trading price of around $2.09 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Shift in Long-Term Holder Sentiment In addition to technical weakness, changes in investor sentiment may intensify downward pressure. Data from Glassnode suggests that long-term holders have gradually moved away from the optimism observed earlier in the year. Their sentiment has transitioned from strong confidence to a more cautious stance as XRP continues to struggle with sustained upward momentum. This analysis relies on the net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric for long-term holders, which evaluates whether these investors are predominantly sitting on gains or losses. The metric compares the market value of XRP to the realized value to determine the aggregate profitability of this group. Recent readings place long-term holders in the “anxiety” category. This state is characterized by modest unrealized gains but increasing uncertainty about future market direction. The shift toward anxiety implies that long-term participants are becoming more sensitive to price fluctuations. It also signals a greater likelihood of selling activity compared to earlier phases, when unrealized profits were larger and confidence was higher. This transition has appeared as XRP hovers near the $2 threshold, a level that carries psychological relevance for many traders. While the broader sentiment remains cautious, the coming weeks may provide clarity on whether XRP can stabilize above key support zones or whether the downward trend highlighted by analysts will persist. For now, technical indicators and sentiment signals continue to point toward the possibility of additional weakness unless buyers reclaim lost ground.

The initiative, backed by the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) and several influential crypto policy groups, argues that decentralized financial tools could save people up to $30 billion a year in fees, money that is currently lost to what researchers describe as the “poverty premium.” NEW BLOG: Why is the cost of U.S. financial services for lower-income families continuing to rise despite technological advances? DEF's @jenn_rosenthal revisits a phrase coined in the early 2000s — ""the poverty premium"" — and explores the possibility of DeFi as a solution. pic.twitter.com/tScifp647x — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) November 19, 2025 How Much Longer Can the Poor Afford an Expensive Financial System? The renewed push comes as global poverty levels remain stubbornly high. In 2025, an estimated 808 million people are living in extreme poverty on less than $3 a day, according to updated global estimates. Source: pip.worldbank.org Another 887 million are considered to be living in multidimensional poverty. Many of these households face overlapping pressures, including climate-related disasters, political instability, and rising economic fragility. The DeFi Education Fund says the financial system itself is part of the problem. In new research released this year, the group highlighted the long-standing cost gap between rich and poor households in the United States. Source: DEF Roughly 5.6 million U.S. households remain unbanked, and another 14.2% are underbanked, often forced to rely on costly financial alternatives. Cashing a paycheck can cost up to 5% of its value, and fees eat up an average of 7.1% of annual income for low-income families, compared with just 0.2% for wealthier households. These costs add up. DEF argues that removing intermediaries through decentralized financial rails could dramatically reduce basic expenses like remittances, money transfers, and bill payments. One estimate in the group’s proposal suggests DeFi infrastructure could cut global remittance costs by up to 80%, potentially saving the world’s unbanked populations $30 billion per year. Source: DEF The initiative lands at a moment when Americans appear increasingly open to alternatives. A DEF survey conducted with Ipsos found that 42% of Americans would likely try DeFi services if new legislation clarifying crypto privacy protections is passed. Many respondents expressed frustrations with banking delays, unexpected fees, and difficulty accessing their own funds. Across the sample, 56% of adults said they want full control of their money, and 54% said they want control over their financial data. As DeFi’s Real-World Role Grows, DEF Accelerates Washington Advocacy Alongside its economic arguments, the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) has expanded its policy efforts in Washington. In August, the organization launched the DeFi Education Foundation , a nonprofit designed to broaden its advocacy and deepen engagement with lawmakers. Around the same period, DEF and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a regulatory “safe harbor” for blockchain applications. The DeFi Education Fund and Andreeson Horowitz (a16z) are pushing the SEC to create a ""safe harbor"" for blockchain apps. #DeFi #a16z https://t.co/7OCIWRvUgk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 They argued that neutral software interfaces should not be classified as brokers, warning that current interpretations risk forcing developers into unintended regulatory roles and discouraging innovation. DEF also submitted a formal response to the Senate Banking Committee’s draft Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025. In that filing, DEF and several major crypto firms, including Paradigm, Jump Crypto, Multicoin Capital, the Solana Policy Institute, and the Uniswap Foundation, called for clear regulatory separation between software builders and financial intermediaries. @fund_defi has called on the US Senate Banking Committee to take a more measured approach to DeFi regulation. #Regulation #DeFi https://t.co/9pZzvG6gkV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 2, 2025 While debate over DeFi’s long-term value continues, advocates point to practical examples of how digital tools can expand access to financial services. Source: Poverty & Inequality Platform (PIP) In Nigeria and parts of East Africa, crypto-based networks allow users to transact with or without smartphones. In regions facing conflict or hyperinflation, including Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Argentina, digital currencies have been used to move money and preserve savings. Some humanitarian groups have adopted blockchain systems to distribute aid with greater transparency. Still, researchers note that DeFi faces limits. Collateral-heavy lending models, volatile token markets, smart-contract vulnerabilities, and financial literacy barriers have slowed broader adoption. Much of today’s activity remains concentrated in speculative trading rather than real-world economic use. Even in El Salvador, where Bitcoin became legal tender in 2021 , daily usage has remained below expectations. DEF maintains that policymakers should protect the aspects of DeFi that directly reduce costs for consumers. The group argues that open access, low-cost settlement, and user control remain essential to reaching people living at the financial margins.

His hearing was a major moment for the future of digital-asset regulation in the United States. Selig testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee, the agency that supervises the CFTC. Lawmakers grilled him on his previous advisory work with digital-asset firms, his views on DeFi, his regulatory philosophy, and how he plans to stabilize an agency that has been operating with only one commissioner in place for months. His nomination arrived after President Donald Trump withdrew his first selection , Brian Quintenz. The committee is slated to vote on Selig’s nomination in the near future, and the discussion is expected to start on Thursday. The result could determine who will determine the next generation of crypto oversight in the U.S. Selig began by warning lawmakers that the country is at a turning point. He said markets all over the world are shifting rapidly, and the U.S. risks falling behind if regulators rely too heavily on enforcement rather than clear regulations. He argued aggressive actions would push firms overseas and weaken American competitiveness. He described the digital-asset market as a sector that has grown from a small curiosity to a nearly $4 trillion global economy. Senators pose questions to Selig about crypto oversight Committee Chairman John Boozman pressed Selig about how he would enforce rules in the spot digital-commodity market — something Congress is mulling over further inserting under the CFTC’s mandate. The senator cited Selig’s nomination as connected to pending negotiations over a major market-structure bill that would determine how digital assets are classified and what agency oversees them. Selig was asked multiple questions about how decentralized finance works. He said that while “DeFi” is often just a vague term, regulators need to understand how on-chain applications work. He explained that identifying when intermediaries are present and whether applications pose risks similar to traditional financial services requires recognizing them. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the committee’s leading Democrat, voiced concern about the prolonged leadership vacuum within the CFTC. She observed that for months now, the agency has been with only Acting Chair Caroline Pham serving as its single commissioner, even though it typically has five. Klobuchar said this instability has sparked confusion for businesses that rely heavily on steady regulatory oversight. The confusion at the agency, she said, has produced “more chaos for people who depend on the CFTC.” If Selig is confirmed, Pham is expected to resign, leaving the CFTC’s four commissioner seats empty unless the White House fills them up quickly. That would be a way Selig can direct an agency that was left unexpectedly fragile in this context. Selig said it needed more diversity of thought on its commission. He said he would cooperate with whichever commissioners the president nominates and argued that a greater diversity of perspectives bolsters regulatory decisions. What Selig’s nomination means for crypto regulation Selig’s appointment would be a pivotal moment for the digital assets industry, which has never been in a better position. His regulatory approach represents a shift toward one that is more conducive to innovation—and one that attaches greater emphasis to creating formal rules, engaging with the industry rather than relying heavily on enforcement actions. If he assumes such leadership, it would shape how crypto trading platforms function, how decentralized finance is understood and regulated, how U.S. exchanges compete in the global marketplace, and how the CFTC shares functions with the SEC. His viewpoint sharply contrasts with years of friction between crypto companies and American regulators, in part because critics say a perception of uncertainty and unpredictable enforcement has hindered their operations. But Selig’s possible tenure would not be an effort to start without difficulty. The CFTC remains vastly understaffed, and a commission bereft of several members can encounter political resistance and legal trouble when considering such significant regulatory decisions.

The announcements, which came on the same day, show that major record labels and VCs are racing to capitalize on AI music technology after months of litigation, even as fundamental questions about copyright and fair use remain unresolved in the courts. Warner Music and Udio to launch a song creation platform Warner Music’s settlement with Udio makes it the second major label to resolve its dispute with the Massachusetts-based company in less than a month, following Universal Music Group’s October agreement. The companies plan to jointly launch a subscription service in 2026 that will use licensed music from Warner’s catalog to power AI-generated remixes, covers, and new songs featuring participating artists’ voices. “We’re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,” said Robert Kyncl , Warner Music Group’s chief executive officer. The settlement also includes provisions for artist protection, as they can choose to opt in to participate and will receive credit and compensation. Sony Music Group remains the last major label still litigating against Udio. Suno’s valuation rises Suno’s latest funding round was led by Menlo Ventures and also saw participation from other investors, including Nvidia’s NVentures, Lightspeed, Hallwood Media, and Matrix. The raise values the company at $2.45 billion. The platform, which allows users to create full songs using text prompts and has become widely popular among first-time creators and professional producers alike, is also facing copyright litigation with Warner, Universal, and Sony Music. Suno’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Mikey Shulman, said the latest capital will be used to build more sophisticated tools and expand its platform as demand for generative audio continues to accelerate. He added that millions of users have produced music through Suno over the past two years. However, unlike Udio, Suno hasn’t settled or resolved the copyright battles it has with the world’s largest record labels, which allege that the company used protected recordings to train its model and risks flooding music platforms with AI-generated tracks that could “drown out” professional artists. From courtrooms to collaboration In 2024, when the major record labels first took Udio and Suno to court, they alleged that they used protected recordings to train their AI models without permission. The labels accused the companies of copying hundreds of songs from popular musicians to create systems that would “directly compete with, cheapen, and ultimately drown out” human artists. However, both AI startups claimed that they didn’t violate any US copyright law and characterized the lawsuits as attempts to stifle competition. Industry observers had predicted that major labels would seek equity stakes and licensing arrangements rather than pursue lengthy court battles, and that forecast seems to have largely materialized. Part of Universal Music’s settlement with Udio also involves them collaborating to launch a platform for generative AI music trained on authorized and licensed music. Warner Music also announced a separate partnership with Stability AI on Wednesday, November 19, to develop professional-grade AI tools for artists and producers using ethically trained models.

This landmark case sends shockwaves through the crypto privacy sector and raises crucial questions about regulatory boundaries. What Exactly Happened with Samourai Wallet? The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York delivered the sentence after Hill pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Prosecutors presented compelling evidence that the Samourai Wallet service processed over $237 million in illicit funds. This case represents one of the most significant legal actions against cryptocurrency mixing services to date. Authorities argued that Samourai Wallet knowingly facilitated money laundering activities while operating outside regulatory frameworks. The service allowed users to obscure transaction trails, making it difficult for law enforcement to track illegal financial activities. Why Does This Samourai Wallet Case Matter? This sentencing establishes a critical precedent for how regulators approach cryptocurrency privacy tools. The Samourai Wallet case demonstrates that: Cryptocurrency services must comply with money transmission laws Privacy features cannot shield illegal activities Regulators are actively monitoring crypto mixing services The timing is particularly significant as it follows co-founder Keonne Rodriguez’s five-year sentence in August. Together, these cases show coordinated enforcement action against unregistered crypto services. How Does This Affect Crypto Privacy Tools? The Samourai Wallet verdict creates uncertainty for other privacy-focused cryptocurrency services. Many legitimate users value privacy features for personal security reasons. However, regulators clearly view mixing services as potential conduits for illegal activities. This case may prompt other privacy tool developers to reconsider their compliance strategies. Some key implications include: Increased regulatory scrutiny on all mixing services Potential licensing requirements for privacy tools Greater transparency demands from service providers What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Regulation? The Samourai Wallet sentencing signals stronger enforcement of existing financial regulations in the crypto space. Regulators are sending a clear message that anti-money laundering laws apply equally to traditional and digital financial services. This case likely represents just the beginning of increased regulatory attention on cryptocurrency privacy tools. Other mixing services may face similar legal challenges if they operate without proper licensing. Key Takeaways from the Samourai Wallet Case The four-year prison sentence for Samourai Wallet’s co-founder serves as a stark warning to the cryptocurrency industry. Compliance with financial regulations is no longer optional, even for privacy-focused services. This case establishes that: Cryptocurrency services must register as money transmitters Privacy cannot override anti-money laundering requirements Regulators are actively pursuing enforcement actions The Samourai Wallet case will undoubtedly influence how developers build and regulators view cryptocurrency privacy tools moving forward. Frequently Asked Questions What is Samourai Wallet? Samourai Wallet was a Bitcoin mixing service that allowed users to obscure their transaction history for enhanced privacy. Why was the co-founder sentenced to prison? William Lonergan Hill received a four-year prison sentence for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and facilitating money laundering. How much money was involved in the case? Prosecutors stated that Samourai Wallet was used to launder $237 million in illicit funds through its mixing services. What happened to the other co-founder? Keonne Rodriguez, the other Samourai Wallet co-founder, received a five-year prison sentence on August 7th in a related case. Are all cryptocurrency privacy tools illegal? No, but they must comply with money transmission regulations and anti-money laundering requirements to operate legally. What does this mean for other crypto mixing services? This case sets a precedent that may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential legal action against other unregistered mixing services. Found this analysis insightful?

After a series of regulatory filings and updates from major fund issuers, analysts now believe that the debut of the first Spot Dogecoin ETF is just days away. All signs now point to a launch window that could open as early as Monday, bringing the long-anticipated product to market far sooner than many expected . Grayscale Positions Its Dogecoin ETF For A Close Launch The clearest signal came after Grayscale updated its Dogecoin ETF filing, which started a 20-day countdown under the SEC’s new fast-track listing rules. These rules allow certain crypto ETFs to go live without the lengthy and restrictive approval process that previous products faced. Unless the SEC steps in with an objection, the end of this 20-day window will become the launch date of the proposed ETF. Based on the timing of Grayscale’s amendment, the first Spot Dogecoin ETF could debut as early as Monday, November 24. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, provided the clearest timeline so far. He stated: “Based on 20 20-day clock, I believe Grayscale will be out with the first Doge ETF in a week, 11/24.” His comment follows the expectation that the first Dogecoin ETF could go live before the end of November. Balchunas also shared the S-1 document image to show the structure of the filing that initiated the countdown. Solana ETF Approval Shows The New SEC Pathway Is Working The optimism surrounding Dogecoin’s ETF launch grows stronger when looking at what happened with Solana . VanEck successfully launched its Solana ETF this week with staking rewards and temporarily waived fees to attract early inflows. Fidelity also stepped into the arena with its own Solana ETF, FSOL, which recorded $2.07 million in inflows on its first trading day. That product went live under the same SEC listing framework now guiding Dogecoin’s filing. Its smooth debut confirmed that the new process is functioning as intended, with issuers able to bring crypto ETFs to market far more quickly than in earlier cycles. This sets a meaningful precedent because Dogecoin is next in line to benefit from that same pathway. Although Grayscale is expected to launch first, it may not remain the only DOGE ETF for long. Bitwise submitted an amendment to its own DOGE fund earlier in November, which activated a similar 20-day timeline. If the schedule holds, Bitwise’s Spot Dogecoin ETF could list the following week. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1586 , up by 2% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Bitwise|Bloomberg|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Eric Balchunas|FSOL|Grayscale|solana|Spot Dogecoin ETF|Spot Solana ETF|US SEC|vaneck,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 00:00:10

Portnoy, who has a large following of more than 3.7 million users on X, shared the update in a video posted on Monday night. In the same announcement, he revealed that his total spending on digital assets that evening exceeded $2 million, spread across multiple cryptocurrencies. His move quickly drew attention from public figures, including Eric Trump, who described the purchase as a smart decision. Portnoy’s Large XRP Allocation During Market Downturn In the video published on X, Portnoy outlined the sequence of trades he executed on November 17 when the market experienced notable volatility. He stated that at 6:38 PM, he added $500,000 of XRP to his portfolio, followed by a $400,000 allocation to Ethereum and a separate $750,000 order for Bitcoin one minute earlier. Records from his post also show that at 6:36 PM, he placed another order for $500,000 worth of XRP, bringing his total XRP expenditure to $1 million within a two-minute window. He indicated that the scale of the price drop across major cryptocurrencies created conditions that he viewed as favorable for large entries. Portnoy explained that he saw the sharp declines as an opportunity he did not want to overlook. His video highlighted that the purchases were made rapidly and were driven by a desire to take advantage of the broader sell-off occurring that evening. Smart trade @stoolpresidente https://t.co/uIVh0rSGh2 — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) November 19, 2025 Eric Trump Reacts to Portnoy’s Disclosure Following Portnoy’s announcement, Eric Trump responded publicly, expressing support for the decision and characterizing it as a good strategic move. Trump has made comments throughout the year regarding cryptocurrency trends and has regularly encouraged buying during market retracements. Earlier statements from him included predictions that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 by year-end and potentially rise to $1 million over a longer horizon. His endorsement of Portnoy’s investment is consistent with these previously stated views. Portnoy’s purchases came at a time when major cryptocurrencies were posting sustained weekly and monthly losses. XRP’s price has fallen to $2.07 after an 11.66% decline in the past week. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin is currently at $89,719, reflecting a 11.51% weekly decrease, and Ethereum has fallen to $2,940 after dropping 13.66% in the same period. Over the past month, the declines have been more pronounced, with Bitcoin losing 18.97%, Ethereum declining by 25.4%, and XRP dropping 15.66%. Portnoy’s Earlier Comments on XRP Portnoy has previously discussed his views on XRP in interviews. In May, he explained that his interest in the asset stems partly from what he described as strong fear-of-missing-out dynamics. He drew comparisons between XRP’s growth potential and his early experiences with Bitcoin, noting that he is especially attracted to the possibility of rapid gains. He also acknowledged that he does not base his decisions on XRP’s fundamental qualities, but rather on the asset’s perceived capacity for significant upward movement. His history with XRP includes a notable incident earlier in the year. In July, reports indicated that Portnoy sold roughly $3 million worth of XRP after misinterpreting a message from a friend as a warning of negative developments. He closed his position at $2.40, only for XRP to rise to $3.65 afterward. Portnoy later expressed regret over the decision, stating that the unexpected rally left him dissatisfied despite positive outcomes from his positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Portnoy’s latest acquisition underscores his continued interest in major cryptocurrencies despite recent market volatility. The positive reaction from Eric Trump adds a political figure’s endorsement to the discussion, further amplifying attention on the transaction.

Related Reading: Famous Trader Bets $27 Million That The XRP Price Will Crash This decline marks the fourth consecutive day of losses, erasing last week’s recovery and signaling a shift in sentiment as traders increasingly position for a deeper pullback. XMR's price records strong losses on the daily chart. Source: XMRUSD on Tradingview Monero (XMR)’s Selling Pressure Builds Further Fresh derivatives data reflect rising bearish conviction. According to CoinGlass, Monero’s futures Open Interest has fallen over the last 24 hours, while short positions now account for more than 55% of all trades. The drop in OI, now hovering around $78 million, suggests traders are withdrawing capital as fear of further downside builds. Technical indicators support this shift. The RSI has slipped below the midline, showing weakening momentum, while the MACD indicator has flashed a fresh sell signal. Together, these point toward deteriorating buying interest and a growing risk that XMR may not hold its current support levels. Support Threatened as Analysts Eye Breakdown Toward $350 Despite XMR maintaining an overall bullish structure on higher timeframes in recent months, the short-term outlook has flipped decisively bearish. The price is now testing key support zones, with the 50-day EMA at $348 emerging as the next major level to watch. A close below $358, which aligns with the neckline of a double-top pattern, would confirm a bearish breakdown, potentially accelerating losses toward the low-$300 region. Analysts warn that this scenario becomes more likely if market demand continues to weaken, particularly as retail traders rotate into alternative opportunities and risk sentiment remains fragile. Still, not all indicators point south. Analysts note that as long as XMR holds above $373, there remains potential for an intraday rebound toward the $400–$410 resistance range. But with the price already slipping below that threshold, bulls may face an uphill battle to reassert control. Privacy Narrative Remains Strong, but Momentum Falters Despite the near-term weakness, Monero continues to benefit from growing interest in privacy-preserving technologies. Recent upgrades, such as the Fluorine Fermi hard fork, have strengthened network security and improved resistance against surveillance-based threats. Long-term forecasts remain cautiously optimistic, with projections suggesting steady, though moderate, growth through 2030 and beyond.

This dramatic drop signals one of the most pessimistic market environments we’ve seen in recent months, creating both challenges and opportunities for crypto enthusiasts. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market sentiment. It calculates investor emotions using six key factors that provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. Understanding these components helps traders make more informed decisions during volatile periods. The index breaks down into these weighted components: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations Market Momentum/Volume (25%) – Tracks trading activity Social Media (15%) – Analyzes crypto mentions and sentiment Surveys (15%) – Gathers direct investor opinions Dominance (10%) – Monitors Bitcoin’s market share Trends (10%) – Follows Google search volume Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear Levels? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits such low numbers, it often signals potential turning points in the market. Extreme fear typically indicates that many investors are selling their positions, which can create buying opportunities for those with a longer-term perspective. However, it also suggests continued volatility ahead. Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries. The current reading of 11 places us firmly in the “extreme fear” category, which ranges from 0-25 on the scale. This psychological indicator helps traders understand when markets might be oversold or overbought. How Can Traders Navigate This Fearful Market? Navigating markets when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear requires careful strategy. First, consider dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk. Second, maintain a diversified portfolio across different cryptocurrency assets. Third, set clear stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage risk effectively. Remember that market sentiment often swings between extremes. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 11 represents one of these extreme points. While challenging, such environments have historically presented opportunities for patient investors. What’s Next for Crypto Markets? Looking forward, monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index will remain crucial for understanding market direction. As sentiment improves, we typically see the index climb back toward neutral territory around 50. However, sustained recovery requires positive catalysts and improved market fundamentals. The current extreme fear reading suggests markets remain fragile. Therefore, traders should watch for stabilization in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a potential sign of improving conditions. Meanwhile, maintaining risk management practices becomes essential. Key Takeaways from the Current Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 11 highlights several important market dynamics. First, investor psychology plays a massive role in cryptocurrency pricing. Second, extreme readings often signal potential reversal points. Third, understanding these sentiment indicators can help traders avoid emotional decision-making. As we monitor the evolving Crypto Fear & Greed Index, remember that markets move in cycles. The current extreme fear phase will eventually give way to more balanced sentiment, creating new opportunities for prepared investors. Frequently Asked Questions What is considered a normal reading for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A neutral reading typically falls between 40-60. Values below 25 indicate extreme fear, while readings above 75 suggest extreme greed in the market. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing regular insights into changing market sentiment and investor psychology. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market crashes? While it doesn’t predict specific crashes, sustained extreme greed readings often precede corrections, while extreme fear may indicate potential buying opportunities. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reliable for trading decisions? It works best as one tool among many. Combine it with technical analysis, fundamental research, and risk management for comprehensive trading strategies. Does the index cover all cryptocurrencies? While it focuses heavily on Bitcoin due to its market dominance, the index reflects overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. How long do extreme fear periods typically last? There’s no fixed duration. Extreme fear can persist for weeks or resolve quickly, depending on market catalysts and broader economic conditions. Found this analysis helpful?

Russia has taken a strategic and economic interest in AI, but the country’s entrance into the global AI industry will put it far behind established leaders in the industry like America and China. Putin believes AI is a matter of independence President Vladimir Putin recently announced the creation of a national task force at Russia’s flagship AI Journey conference. The purpose of the task force will be to coordinate generative AI development across the country. Putin explained that large language models (LLMs) have become vital tools for shaping public opinion, which means that dependence on foreign AI is a threat to Russia’s technological and value-based independence. He stressed the importance of Russia having its own full suite of generative AI technologies that will all be under the supervision of Russian experts. He also warned against harsh regulations, but said that for national security and intelligence, only Russian-trained models should be used so that their data remains within the country. The task force will promote the building of data centers across Russia. They will be supported by nearby energy sources like small-scale nuclear power stations. During his address, Putin also urged both state institutions and private companies to increase AI adoption. Putin projected that AI could contribute more than 11 trillion rubles (around $136 billion) to Russia’s GDP by 2030. Russia is far behind AI powerhouses like the U.S. and China in terms of technology development, but it already has some homegrown large-language models, including Gigachat, which was developed by Sberbank and Yandex GPT. At the same conference, Sberbank demonstrated upgraded versions of its model, as well as AI-driven products ranging from humanoid robots to health-scanning ATMs. One of the biggest obstacles for Russia’s AI ambition is the Western sanctions on microchips, as it limits Russia’s capacity to scale up its computing infrastructure. Putin’s selective cooperation The Russian President has said repeatedly that he regards foreign AI dominance as a threat to Russian culture and security. As far back as 2023, he warned that Western-trained AI systems could reflect Western values, ignoring or even “canceling” Russian traditions, history, and public policy. However, in late 2024, he announced an “AI Alliance Network” with BRICS members (Brazil, China, India, South Africa) and other nations to develop AI and build alternative regulation and market channels together. In early 2025, he ordered Sberbank and the government to deepen AI cooperation with China. According to recent research , Russia’s lower chamber of parliament, the State Duma, has been working on AI regulation since 2023, and there is reportedly a working group ordered to produce AI laws by 2026.

However, the Bitcoin derivatives market revealed an astonishing story of resilience that defied expectations. This remarkable stability in the face of price pressure offers crucial insights for cryptocurrency investors. What Makes the Bitcoin Derivatives Market So Resilient? The Bitcoin derivatives market has demonstrated exceptional steadiness despite recent price movements. According to Cointelegraph analysis, key metrics continue to show market confidence rather than panic. This stability suggests institutional maturity and growing sophistication among market participants. On November 19th, the monthly BTC futures premium maintained around 4% above spot prices. While slightly below the neutral 5% threshold, this figure indicates controlled optimism rather than excessive fear. The market shows measured responses instead of emotional reactions. How Do Perpetual Futures Signal Market Health? The perpetual futures funding rate for Bitcoin has consistently hovered around 4% annualized. This alignment with the two-week average reveals several important factors: Consistent trader behavior despite price fluctuations Balanced long and short positions Absence of extreme leverage situations Healthy market maker activity These conditions create a stable foundation for the Bitcoin derivatives market to operate efficiently. The funding rate stability prevents sudden liquidations that could trigger cascading effects. Why Does Options Data Matter for Bitcoin Investors? The BTC options delta skew maintained a stable 11% throughout the past week. This crucial metric provides deep insights into trader sentiment and risk assessment. A stable skew indicates that professional traders haven’t significantly altered their risk perceptions. This consistency in the Bitcoin derivatives market options space suggests that experienced participants view recent price movements as normal market behavior rather than fundamental shifts. The data reveals calculated positioning rather than emotional trading. What Does This Stability Mean for Future Bitcoin Price Action? The current Bitcoin derivatives market conditions create a favorable environment for sustainable growth. The absence of extreme fear or greed indicators suggests that any price movements will likely be more gradual and less volatile. This stability provides several advantages: Reduced risk of flash crashes More predictable trading conditions Improved institutional participation Healthier long-term development The Bitcoin derivatives market functioning as a stabilizing force represents significant progress in cryptocurrency market maturation. This development benefits all market participants through reduced volatility and improved liquidity. Key Takeaways from Current Bitcoin Derivatives Market Analysis The remarkable stability in the Bitcoin derivatives market during recent price tests demonstrates growing market sophistication. Traders appear to be learning from past volatility episodes and adjusting their strategies accordingly. This evolution in market behavior suggests we’re witnessing the maturation of cryptocurrency trading. Furthermore, the consistent metrics across futures, perpetuals, and options indicate coordinated market understanding. Participants across different Bitcoin derivatives market segments share similar risk assessments and trading approaches. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Bitcoin derivatives market? The Bitcoin derivatives market includes financial contracts like futures and options that derive their value from Bitcoin’s price. These instruments allow traders to hedge risk or speculate on price movements. Why is derivatives market stability important? Stability in the Bitcoin derivatives market reduces overall volatility, prevents cascading liquidations, and encourages institutional participation. It signals market maturity and sophisticated risk management. How does the futures premium indicate market sentiment? The futures premium shows whether traders are willing to pay more for future Bitcoin delivery. A stable premium around 4-5% suggests balanced optimism without excessive speculation. What does options delta skew measure? Options delta skew measures the difference in implied volatility between put and call options. A stable skew indicates consistent risk assessment among options traders. Can derivatives market stability predict future prices? While not a perfect predictor, derivatives market stability suggests reduced likelihood of extreme volatility. Stable conditions often precede more sustainable price movements. How do perpetual funding rates affect traders? Stable funding rates prevent sudden position liquidations and reduce trading costs. They indicate balanced market conditions between long and short positions. Found this analysis of Bitcoin derivatives market stability helpful?

The move represents one of Washington’s largest tech decisions in the Middle East, enabling both Gulf countries to possess hardware capable of training and running state-of-the-art AI models. U.S. officials say that these approvals entail strict security rules. The conditions are intended to prevent the chips from being sent to China or any other foreign adversary. The approvals also reflect a close partnership between Washington and the two oil-rich countries, which are both committed to becoming global leaders in AI. U.S. tightens control as sales approved The Commerce Department confirmed that G42 (UAE) and Humain (Saudi Arabia) will receive computer-equipped AI chips, comprising Nvidia’s GB300 processors . These are some of the most advanced chips Nvidia has ever produced. Approvals were granted only after both companies committed to “rigorous security and reporting requirements,” the U.S. added. Officials did not provide specifics but said their focus was heavily on preventing technology transfer to high-risk countries, particularly China. That followed months of talks between Washington and the Gulf governments. The talks were part of broader bilateral arrangements that focus on economic cooperation, cybersecurity safeguards, and new commitments to better governance with technology. G42 had already taken measures to appease American concerns. Last year, the Emirati firm committed to ceasing the use of Huawei equipment and unwinding its ties with Chinese companies. That decision paved the way for a $1.5 billion investment from Microsoft, which led to President Brad Smith joining G42’s board of directors. Saudi Arabia’s Humain has publicly stated that it will not buy Huawei gear, following U.S. expectations for secure AI development. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are both racing to build world-class AI industries. These are the new Nvidia approvals that will provide them with the raw computing power necessary to train next-generation AI models, operate large data centers, and entice global tech partners. G42 is growing at a rapid pace across various sectors — from outer space technology to national genomics projects. The company is constructing massive data centers and cloud infrastructure to fund AI labs and government projects all over the Emirates. Humain, in Saudi Arabia, is working towards its own national strategy. It plans to create giant “AI factories” to house hundreds of thousands of GPUs. The facilities are designed to provide power for projects in healthcare, higher education institutions, freight delivery services, transportation authorities, and government agencies. The Nvidia AI chips approvals come as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman strengthens ties with the Trump White House. The UAE, meanwhile, committed earlier this year to spend $1.4 trillion on the American side, further cementing its strategic alliance with Washington. U.S. balances innovation and national security Inside Washington, the decision has inspired debate. Many officials in the Trump administration view the sale as a response to China’s growing presence in the Middle East. U.S. companies, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle, can anchor the region’s AI buildout. It keeps Gulf nations inside America’s technological infrastructure. Nevertheless, some national security officials remain skeptical, as they worry that even with heavy monitoring, powerful AI chips can still be misused. They also worry that Beijing might someday gain access to data centers or research facilities located in the Gulf through commercial, scholarly, or hidden connections. Nonetheless, the American administration believes that strict operational conditions will ensure that the technology remains secure. Washington’s shift also indicates, in effect, that AI hardware is becoming increasingly part of Washington’s diplomatic toolkit. Gulf nations seek to develop AI capacity, while the United States aims to exert influence, maintain oversight, and foster economic cooperation. Nvidia, meanwhile, retains access to two of the world’s fastest-growing markets for high-performance computing. G42 and Humain approvals may be only the start. The two countries are expected to demand even more chips as they seek to emerge as global leaders in artificial intelligence, data infrastructure, and advanced technology manufacturing.

The latest data reveals a significant shift that every crypto investor needs to understand. The Altcoin Season Index has dropped five crucial points to just 26, signaling a potential change in market dynamics that could impact your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market indicator for cryptocurrency investors. This important metric defines an “altcoin season” as a period where 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 26 suggests we’re firmly in Bitcoin season territory. Why Should You Care About This Altcoin Season Index Drop? The five-point decline in the Altcoin Season Index matters because it reflects changing investor sentiment and capital flows. When the index moves lower, it indicates: Bitcoin is outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies Investor confidence may be shifting toward established assets Market risk appetite could be decreasing Capital rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin is occurring How Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Work? Understanding the mechanics behind the Altcoin Season Index helps you make better investment decisions. The index excludes stablecoins and wrapped coins from its calculation, focusing purely on performance comparisons. A score closer to 100 indicates strong altcoin season conditions, while lower scores like the current 26 point toward Bitcoin dominance. What Investment Strategies Make Sense Now? With the Altcoin Season Index sitting at 26, investors should consider several approaches. First, recognize that Bitcoin seasons often precede altcoin rallies. Historical patterns show that after extended Bitcoin dominance, capital typically flows back into altcoins. However, timing these transitions requires careful market observation and risk management. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify strategically rather than abandoning altcoins completely Monitor the Altcoin Season Index weekly for trend changes Focus on fundamentals rather than short-term price movements Set clear entry and exit points for your altcoin positions When Might We See the Next Altcoin Season? Predicting the exact timing of market shifts remains challenging, but the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable clues. The current reading suggests we’re not in altcoin season territory yet. However, market conditions can change rapidly based on several factors including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic trends. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Market Landscape The Altcoin Season Index drop to 26 presents both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. While Bitcoin appears to be dominating currently, this often sets the stage for future altcoin rallies. By understanding what the Altcoin Season Index measures and how to interpret its movements, you can make more informed decisions about your cryptocurrency portfolio allocation and timing. Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 26 mean? An Altcoin Season Index of 26 indicates that Bitcoin is significantly outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies. The index measures how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are beating Bitcoin’s performance over 90 days. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The Altcoin Season Index typically updates regularly as market data becomes available, providing ongoing insights into market dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. While a low Altcoin Season Index suggests Bitcoin dominance, it often precedes altcoin rallies. Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance rather than making reactionary decisions. What’s the difference between Bitcoin season and altcoin season? Bitcoin season occurs when Bitcoin outperforms most altcoins, while altcoin season happens when 75% of top cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict market crashes? The index measures relative performance between assets rather than predicting absolute price movements or market crashes. It’s best used as one of several market analysis tools. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for trading decisions? While valuable for understanding market trends, the index should complement rather than replace comprehensive research and risk management in trading decisions. Found this analysis helpful?

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted a Glassnode chart showing that Dogecoin’s net supply on centralized exchanges has just turned positive, noting on X: “Dogecoin supply on exchanges just turned positive! This shift has marked sharp rebounds before.” Dogecoin Rebound Loading? The chart in his post, “DOGE: Exchange Net Position Change – All Exchanges,” tracks monthly exchange inflows and outflows as a histogram, alongside DOGE’s price in US dollars. Green bars indicate net inflows (more DOGE moving to exchanges than leaving), while red bars show net outflows. From mid-2024 through late 2024, the series alternates between modest red and green periods before a sustained cluster of strong green bars emerges around the fourth quarter of 2024. During that phase, net inflows rise to several billion DOGE per month. At the same time, the price line accelerated from below $0.10 to a local peak to $0.48, illustrating how heavy exchange-side activity accompanied the rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakdown Or Bottom? On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone After that peak, the structure changes. Through early and mid-2025, the histogram becomes more mixed, with smaller positive and negative reads as price oscillates broadly between roughly $0.12 and $0.30. Heading into late 2025, however, the chart shows a pronounced sequence of red bars, with net outflows extending down toward roughly −5 to −6 billion DOGE while the price trends lower from the mid-$0.20s toward the low-$0.20s and below. The final data point, emphasized by a circular highlight on the right edge of the chart, marks a clear break in that pattern: a tall green bar crosses back above the zero line, indicating that net flows have turned positive again. At that moment, the price line sits slightly above the $0.15 mark on the vertical scale. Martinez interprets this as a “major rebound signal,” pointing to previous instances where a similar transition from persistent outflows to strong inflows coincided with sharp directional moves. DOGE On Thin Ice Below $0.16 A second chart he shared, an ATH-partitioned UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), sets out where the current DOGE supply last moved on-chain. A single, dominant bar appears around $0.07392452 and accounts for 28,260,298,271.803 DOGE, or 18.62% of the measured supply. Martinez summarizes this by stating that 27.4 billion DOGE have accumulated at roughly $0.08, calling it the “most significant support level.” Between that $0.07–$0.08 block and approximately $0.16, the URPD shows a shaded “GAP” with only small intermediate bars around levels such as $0.096, $0.125 and $0.155. Above the gap, a smaller but still notable cluster appears at about $0.162633395, containing 4,399,496,300.739 DOGE (2.9% of supply). “Below $0.16, support for Dogecoin $DOGE disappears quickly,” Martinez warns, adding that the “next real demand zone sits at $0.07.” Related Reading: One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst A third chart, a cost-basis distribution heatmap, tracks DOGE’s price against horizontal bands representing where holders’ cost bases are concentrated. It confirms two core cohorts: a lower band between $0.0812497 and $0.08279775 with 27,397,971,652.123432 DOGE, and an upper band from $0.20103297 to $0.20486326 containing 12,156,333,652.493444 DOGE. Together with the newly positive exchange flows, these data points define a market caught between a dense realized floor around $0.08 and a substantial holder cluster near $0.20, with the latest flow reversal now in focus for traders tracking DOGE’s next move. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.158.

54631970,630587,1763600432,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54631970.jpeg,First Bitcoin-Backed Municipal Bond Launches In New Hampshire,https://bitcoinist.com/first-bitcoin-backed-municipal-bond-new-hampshire/,"New Hampshire has authorized the first US municipal security explicitly backed by Bitcoin, approving a $100 million “conduit” bond that uses over-collateralized BTC rather than tax revenues or project cash flows as its primary backstop. The decision by the state’s Business Finance Authority (BFA) positions New Hampshire as an early test bed for integrating digital assets into the roughly $140 trillion global bond market. New Hampshire Continues To Lead US States Into Bitcoin Adoption Governor Kelly Ayotte framed the move as a way to attract capital while insulating residents from balance-sheet risk, saying she is “proud that New Hampshire is once again first in the nation to embrace new technologies with this historic Bitcoin-backed bond,” and calling it “an innovative way to bring more investment opportunities to our state and position us as a leader in digital finance without risking state funds or taxpayer dollars.” The bond follows a standard conduit structure: the BFA authorizes the issuance, but the credit risk rests with the private borrower, not the state’s general fund. What is novel is the collateral package. The borrower must post about 160 percent of the bond’s notional value in Bitcoin, held by digital asset custodian BitGo . If BTC’s price falls and the collateralization ratio approaches roughly 130 percent, automatic liquidation of part of the Bitcoin stack is triggered to protect bondholders and preserve principal. The BFA oversees the framework but does not guarantee repayment. SCOOP: New Hampshire Launches First Bitcoin-Backed Municipal Bond The Granite State just became the first to approve a muni bond backed by $BTC , a milestone that could pave the way for digital assets to enter the $140 trillion global debt market. https://t.co/18XTtMK9Tw — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 19, 2025 The structure was designed by Wave Digital Assets and municipal specialist Rosemawr Management, with BitGo as custodian and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe as legal counsel. Wave co-founder Les Borsai described the transaction as “the opening of a new debt market,” arguing that it shows how “public and private sectors can collaborate to responsibly unlock the value of digital assets.” Orrick partner Orion Mountainspring called it “the first municipal security backed by cryptocurrency” and a potential “game-changer for digital currency and municipal finance.” Fees and any Bitcoin appreciation associated with the transaction will flow into a dedicated Bitcoin Economic Development Fund, intended to support innovation and business growth in the state, rather than the general budget. The bond also dovetails with New Hampshire’s recently authorized Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which allows the state treasury to allocate up to 5 percent of funds into highly capitalized digital assets, in practice making Bitcoin the only viable candidate under today’s market conditions. Republican representative Keith Ammon, the driving force behind much of the state’s Bitcoin legislation, has presented the framework as a controlled way to test BTC as high-grade collateral for public finance without exposing taxpayers to direct losses. Because the bond is not a general-obligation security and relies on over-collateralization plus pre-defined liquidation thresholds, officials argue that Bitcoin’s volatility is ring-fenced within the structure. Whether the model scales beyond this initial authorization will depend on investor demand, pricing and ratings treatment once an actual borrower brings a deal to market. For now, New Hampshire has moved the concept of Bitcoin-backed public debt from theory into the machinery of US municipal finance, creating a live template other states and issuers can study or choose to emulate. At press time, BTC traded at $91,401.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 01:00:32

54633793,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=864645,1763602990,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54633793.jpeg,Semrush joins Adobe to power next-gen generative AI marketing,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/adobe-snaps-up-semrush-to-power-ai-marketing/,"Adobe has reached a deal to acquire Semrush in a cash transaction for approximately $1.9 billion, the companies announced on Wednesday. Adobe’s acquisition is a bold step in the broader effort to develop its generative AI marketing capabilities further and reveal how to make brands more visible across the digital landscape. Adobe says it will purchase Semrush at $12 a share, a premium of roughly 77.5% above Semrush’s recent trading price. Following the announcement, Semrush shares surged more than 74%, suggesting investor enthusiasm was evident. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending approval from regulatory authorities and shareholders. Adobe is acquiring the firm to integrate Semrush’s generative engine optimization and search engine optimization solutions into its Experience Cloud tools, which include Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Analytics. The aim is to help marketers understand not just how its brand looks on more conventional websites, but also how it appears in AI-powered interfaces, including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini . Adobe’s President of Digital Experience, Anil Chakravarthy, presented the acquisition as a response to a new battleground in a rapidly evolving landscape. Generative AI, when deployed to search for and discover brands, is a significant way for companies that don’t adapt to this new “engine” to be left behind, putting them at risk of irrelevance. Semrush’s Chief Executive, Bill Wagner, also stated that the merger will provide marketers with a 360-degree view of the brand’s engagements—whether on owned channels, the broader web, or AI-driven platforms. Semrush powers marketing with big data insights Semrush had been steadily growing ever since. In Semrush’s Q2 2025 earnings report , ARR grew to $435.3 million, representing approximately 15% year-over-year growth, fueled by large customers such as Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and TikTok. Semrush is well-positioned from a financial standpoint, with an ARR exceeding $400M and a non-GAAP operating margin of greater than 12%. The site serves approximately 117,000 clients – including tens of Fortune 500 companies— and still generates substantial revenue. For Adobe, the deal is, to some degree, about tools — it’s a way into systems that help marketing teams decide how and where to advertise online, from the relative tide pools of banner ads, tweets on Twitter, and posts on Facebook. Semrush’s data and platform enable Adobe to serve up something distinct: A look at what is possible with traditional SEO, as well as how GEO is just starting to change. Adobe plans to incorporate Semrush’s functions across its Experience Cloud and new developments – such as Adobe Brand Concierge, which is expected soon- to enable marketers to attend to their marketing needs in one place. This provides Adobe with greater capabilities to help brands work with massive language models and chat-based discovery — not just ranking search engine databases, but also being seen by AIs. This integration between Adobe’s creative offerings and Semrush’s marketing intelligence enables brands to create a seamless content creation process while gaining access to a wealth of visibility information. Integration hurdles could slow Adobe’s plans The deal is significant from a strategic perspective, but it is a tough one. Adobe is paying a steep premium, while Semrush has not yet experienced clear, standalone growth. Analysts say it prioritizes strategic value over short-term financial benefits, rather than immediate profits. To be successful, Adobe must seamlessly integrate Semrush’s platform into a single, unified system that minimizes disruptions to the existing business and customer experience. Buyers of these services are also likely to be sensitive to price increases, as Adobe will own the software. If an acquisition succeeds, it could be a game-changing digital marketing technology, as even competitors such as Ahrefs, Moz, or other SEO platforms would likely compete with Adobe’s AI-first, integrated alternative. This move could also lead to cross-selling opportunities throughout Adobe’s creative, analytics, and marketing platforms, as well as establish its footing as a marketing powerhouse powered by AI.

Large institutional movements often signal upcoming market shifts. Moreover, this particular Bitmain wallet ETH withdrawal could indicate several possibilities: Strategic portfolio rebalancing by Bitmain Preparation for upcoming Ethereum network upgrades Institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value Potential involvement in decentralized finance protocols How Does This Impact Ethereum’s Market Position? The timing of this Bitmain wallet ETH withdrawal coincides with several key market developments. Ethereum has been showing resilience despite broader market fluctuations. Therefore, this massive movement could reinforce positive sentiment around the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Market analysts are closely watching how this Bitmain wallet ETH withdrawal might affect: Short-term price volatility for ETH Institutional adoption trends Exchange liquidity conditions Overall market confidence in major cryptocurrencies What Can We Learn From This Transaction?

Large movements often precede market trends that affect portfolios of all sizes. Understanding these institutional moves helps you: Anticipate potential market shifts Make better timing decisions for your investments Recognize patterns in cryptocurrency adoption Stay informed about major player strategies Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitmain and why is this withdrawal significant? Bitmain is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturers. Their substantial ETH holdings and movements can influence market sentiment and indicate institutional positioning. How was this transaction identified as belonging to Bitmain? Onchain analytics platforms like Onchainlens use pattern recognition, transaction history, and wallet behavior analysis to identify likely ownership of cryptocurrency addresses. Could this large withdrawal affect Ethereum’s price? While single transactions rarely determine market prices, large movements from known entities can influence trader psychology and potentially create short-term volatility. What does withdrawing from BitGo indicate? BitGo is a major institutional cryptocurrency custodian. Moving funds from custody services often signals preparation for active deployment rather than long-term storage. Is this type of large transaction common? While cryptocurrency sees billions in daily transactions, movements of this size from identified institutional wallets remain relatively rare and noteworthy. Should individual investors be concerned about such large movements? Not necessarily concerned, but aware. Understanding institutional behavior helps individual investors make more informed decisions about their own strategies.

This temporary halt in deposits and withdrawals comes as the platform prepares for a significant network upgrade. If you’re holding 0G tokens, understanding this development is essential for managing your digital assets effectively. Why Did Upbit Announce the 0G Suspension? The primary reason behind the Upbit 0G suspension is an upcoming hard fork for the ZeroGravity network. Hard forks represent major protocol changes that require temporary transaction halts. Therefore, Upbit must ensure all systems align with the new network specifications. This precautionary measure protects user funds during the transition period. How Does the Upbit 0G Suspension Impact Traders? The temporary Upbit 0G suspension means traders cannot move their ZeroGravity tokens during the specified period. However, it’s important to note that spot trading typically remains operational. Here’s what you need to know: Deposit and withdrawal functions will be temporarily disabled Existing 0G balances remain secure in your Upbit wallet Trading activities may continue depending on market conditions The suspension period usually lasts until network stability is confirmed What Should You Do During the Upbit 0G Suspension? While the Upbit 0G suspension is in effect, traders should monitor official communications closely. Upbit typically provides regular updates about the resumption timeline. Moreover, this temporary pause offers an opportunity to research the hard fork’s potential impact on 0G’s value proposition. When Will Normal Services Resume After the Upbit 0G Suspension? Exchange officials haven’t specified an exact timeline for lifting the Upbit 0G suspension . Historically, such interruptions last until the network upgrade completes successfully. The exchange will announce resumption through official channels once they verify network stability and security. Why Are Hard Forks Necessary for Cryptocurrencies Like 0G? Hard forks represent crucial evolution points for blockchain networks. The Upbit 0G suspension highlights how exchanges manage these technical transitions. Network upgrades often introduce enhanced features, improved security, or scalability solutions. Consequently, temporary inconveniences lead to long-term benefits for the ecosystem. What Can We Learn From This Upbit 0G Suspension? This Upbit 0G suspension demonstrates the cryptocurrency industry’s maturation. Exchanges now implement proactive measures to ensure user protection during network changes. While temporary, such suspensions reflect the industry’s commitment to security and technological progress. The temporary Upbit 0G suspension serves as a reminder that blockchain technology continues evolving. Though inconvenient for short-term traders, these necessary pauses ensure long-term network health and security. As the cryptocurrency landscape matures, such procedural suspensions become standard practice during significant upgrades. Frequently Asked Questions How long will the Upbit 0G suspension last? The duration varies depending on network upgrade completion. Upbit will announce the exact resumption time through official channels. Can I still trade 0G during the suspension? Spot trading typically continues unless otherwise specified. However, deposit and withdrawal functions remain temporarily disabled. Will my 0G tokens be safe during the suspension? Yes, your tokens remain secure in your Upbit wallet. The suspension primarily affects transaction functions rather than storage security. Why do exchanges suspend services during hard forks? Exchanges pause services to ensure compatibility with new network protocols and prevent potential transaction errors or fund loss. How will I know when services resume? Upbit will make official announcements through their website, social media channels, and app notifications. Should I be worried about the hard fork? Hard forks are routine network upgrades. The temporary suspension demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to user protection during technical transitions. Found this guide helpful?

54633907,630438,1763604029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54633907.jpeg,"Bitmine Keeps Buying Ethereum Despite Market Drop: 21,054 ETH Arrive In New Wallet",https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-keeps-buying-ethereum-despite-market-drop/,"Ethereum has come under heavy selling pressure over the past few days as the broader crypto market entered a deep corrective phase. Yet, despite the volatility and widespread fear, ETH has managed to hold firmly above the key $3,000 level — a zone many analysts consider essential for maintaining the broader bullish structure. Now, as price stabilizes and buyers begin to re-emerge, several market observers are starting to call for a potential recovery, arguing that Ethereum may be nearing the end of its downturn. Adding fuel to this narrative is the continued accumulation from major players, most notably Tom Lee’s Bitmine. Tom Lee — a well-known Wall Street strategist, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, and long-time Bitcoin and Ethereum bull — has been one of the most influential voices in the digital asset market for nearly a decade. His firm Bitmine operates as a large institutional crypto investment entity focused on long-term accumulation, market-making, and strategic positioning during periods of fear. According to recent on-chain data, Bitmine has continued buying ETH even as prices fell, signaling strong conviction in the asset’s long-term outlook. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the broader market, where short-term holders have been capitulating. Bitmine Continues Accumulating ETH Despite Market Weakness According to fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain, accumulation activity around Ethereum is far from slowing down. A newly flagged wallet, 0xE2ed, believed to be associated with Tom Lee’s Bitmine, received 21,054 ETH (worth $66.57 million) from Kraken just a few hours ago. This move reinforces the view that large, sophisticated players are treating the recent correction as an opportunity rather than a threat. The timing of this transfer is notable. Ethereum has been under sustained selling pressure for weeks, with sentiment turning sharply bearish as the market grappled with fear, liquidations, and a broader rotation into stablecoins. Yet despite this environment, Bitmine-linked wallets continue to absorb supply aggressively. This pattern aligns with Bitmine’s broader strategy: accumulating high-quality crypto assets during periods of uncertainty to position for long-term upside. Large inflows to accumulation wallets during drawdowns have historically suggested strong conviction among institutional players, often preceding phases of recovery and renewed strength. Suppose this wallet is indeed tied to Bitmine. In that case, it signals that some of the market’s most well-capitalized participants remain confident in Ethereum’s long-term value, regardless of short-term volatility. ETH Price Analysis: Testing Long-Term Support Amid Heavy Volatility Ethereum’s weekly chart shows the asset navigating a critical zone as price hovers just above $3,000, a level that has historically acted as a major demand area. After weeks of sustained selling pressure, ETH has pulled back from the $4,500 region and is now retesting its long-term moving averages. The 200-week MA, in particular, is positioned closely beneath the current price, acting as a structural anchor that has supported Ethereum in previous cycle corrections, including the deep capitulation seen in mid-2022 and the recovery phase of 2023. The recent candle structure reflects heightened volatility, with long wicks suggesting strong reactions from buyers near the $3,000 threshold. Volume has increased slightly during this downturn, indicating active participation from both sellers locking in profits and buyers positioning for potential reversal. Yet ETH remains below its 50-week MA, showing that short-term momentum continues to lean bearish. Still, the broader pattern resembles earlier cycle pullbacks where Ethereum retraced sharply before forming higher lows and resuming its macro uptrend. If ETH can maintain this support band and reclaim the $3,300–$3,500 region, it may signal renewed strength. But a weekly close below $3,000 risks opening the door to deeper correction targets near $2,700.

As the global financial system moves toward higher costs, weaker currencies, and increasing inefficiencies, BTC is emerging as the most compelling alternative because it works more effectively. Economic Pressure Points That Will Accelerate Bitcoin Uptake In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital finance, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin’s future has often been intertwined with fervent ideological conviction. A media company, known as TFTC on X, has highlighted why BTC adoption won’t be driven by ideology, but rather by economics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Accepted By 4 Million Businesses, Thanks To Jack Dorsey Every merchant today is focused on handing over 2–3% of every transaction to payment processors and lives under the constant threat of chargebacks. Especially for small businesses, those costs and risks compound fast. However, BTC eliminates all of it with no processing fees, no chargebacks, just instant, final settlement straight into the merchant’s wallet. As Miles, a crypto enthusiast, consistently pointed out, the economic incentives are so overwhelmingly strong that adoption becomes inevitable. Merchants save thousands on fees, and they can pass those savings back to their customers through instant cashback rewards for using BTC. This dynamic creates a self-reinforcing flywheel effect, allowing Merchants to lower their operational costs and increase their profit margins. At the same time, consumers would get tangible rewards and better value for their money by simply using BTC. Both sides will benefit immensely, while the BTC network will grow stronger. When the underlying math is this incredibly favorable, adoption is no longer a philosophical stance, but it’s an economic certainty. The Path To Reclaiming Bullish Momentum While the economic incentives will be responsible for Bitcoin’s next rally, analyst Rekt Capital has revealed a historical demand area, marked in orange, which has played a pivotal role in dictating BTC’s next major trend. The first time price tapped this zone, it produced a sharp +20% rebound before breaking down. After this breakdown, the BTC price moved to lower levels to absorb the remaining buy-side liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Bullish Confluence: Death Cross And Key Support Signal Upside Once BTC reclaimed the orange region as support, it triggered a +37% rally to new all-time highs. On the second retest, this same support zone showed signs of strength. Currently, BTC is finding support at this same historical demand area. What would happen next will be critical in determining whether this demand area will continue to strengthen or if signs of weakening will finally emerge. Furthermore, BTC will need to break the multi-week downtrend, marked in black on the chart, to relieve fear of fading support. A rebound from this demand area that fails to break the multi-week downtrend would only result in a yield of +10% move, which suggests that the support zone may be weakening.

Officials say it’s an unprecedented scale mission, even comparing it to the Manhattan Project and the space race. The administration views AI not only as a technological tool but also as a strategic asset vital to national security, economic growth, and global influence. Genesis Mission will enlist national laboratories nationwide to ramp up research on next-generation AI technologies. Officials are also aiming to develop greater alignment among government agencies, tech organizations, and academic institutions through strong public-private partnerships, laying the groundwork for a robust, coordinated ecosystem around the development of artificial intelligence. Its goal, officials note, would be to expedite scientific innovation and put the U.S. at the forefront of the global AI race. The mission will span various fields, including data science and computing, engineering, materials science, and neuroscience, senior officials said. The administration also hopes to drive breakthroughs that will change not only the economy and national defense but also our destiny itself by ensuring that the best research efforts link with industry, federal resources, and its people. Administration moves to centralize AI regulation Alongside the Genesis Mission, the Trump administration is drafting an executive order that will solidify its authority over the regulation of AI within the federal government. It would permit the federal government to challenge state laws it deems unconstitutional and potentially restrict federal funds for states with so-called overly restrictive statutes. A patchwork of state rules, officials say, may hinder innovation, increase costs for companies, and create uncertainty for U.S. AI developers. The centralization of a federal scheme will create a single set of standards, aiming to streamline the regulatory environment and encourage companies to scale technologies rapidly. The order also sends a clear message to the private sector: the federal government will be the primary source of rules governing artificial intelligence nationwide, thereby reducing the potential for disparities across states. Simplified federal oversight is a tool to promote innovation in the digital age while ensuring that AI efforts align with national priorities. At the same time, it portends possible legal and political disputes over federal vs. state power that could loom in the next few months. Trump pushes U.S. to lead the global AI race Genesis Mission is part of a broader plan to keep the United States at the forefront of global AI development. Global competitors, most notably China, claim to have attempted to stoke aggressive growth in AI under more centralized regulatory regimes. The administration views the United States as poised to fall behind technologically and strategically unless it takes proactive steps. These objectives include improving existing research infrastructure while building new data centers and advanced high-tech supercomputing systems. The administration intends to accelerate the deployment of AI through a combination of federal research and private-sector innovations in areas such as scientific discovery, defense, healthcare, and industrial applications. Experts say the efforts are grand, but it has their traps. There will be legal issues with states regarding federal power, and expedited efforts could overlook important ethical considerations, such as data privacy and minimizing bias. However, the administration is presenting Genesis Mission as the most effective solution for protecting our tech future. Genesis Mission, which envisions the United States as being the world’s most innovative, capable, influential, and competitive nation in artificial intelligence, builds state-of-the-art research, regulation, and industrial cooperation at an unprecedented level.

Just hours ago, this pioneering Bitcoin investor transferred his entire remaining holdings of 2,499 BTC to the Kraken exchange, a transaction valued at an astonishing $228 million. This massive transfer from a long-term Bitcoin investor immediately sparked intense speculation across financial markets. Why Would a Bitcoin Investor Make Such a Massive Move? When a seasoned Bitcoin investor moves this amount of cryptocurrency to an exchange, the crypto community takes immediate notice. Large-scale deposits typically signal one thing: potential selling activity. However, experienced Bitcoin investors sometimes have multiple strategies beyond simple liquidation. This particular Bitcoin investor might be considering various options including: Portfolio rebalancing strategies Taking profits after substantial gains Preparing for other investment opportunities Estate planning or wealth management moves The timing of this Bitcoin investor’s decision comes during a period of relative market stability, making the move even more noteworthy for market analysts. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Markets? Market reactions to large transfers from early Bitcoin investors often create immediate ripple effects. When a prominent Bitcoin investor moves hundreds of millions in cryptocurrency, it typically triggers several market responses. Trading volumes often spike as other investors react to the news. Price volatility can increase significantly as market participants interpret the Bitcoin investor’s intentions. However, it’s crucial to remember that not every exchange deposit leads to immediate selling. Some Bitcoin investors use exchanges for other purposes like: Securing assets in exchange wallets Preparing for staking or lending activities Facilitating institutional transactions Diversifying across multiple platforms Understanding Early Bitcoin Investor Psychology Early Bitcoin investors like Owen Gunden possess unique market perspectives having witnessed Bitcoin’s journey from obscurity to mainstream adoption. Their moves often carry significant weight because these Bitcoin investors have demonstrated remarkable patience and conviction through multiple market cycles. When such a Bitcoin investor makes a substantial move, it’s worth examining potential motivations beyond surface-level interpretations. These seasoned Bitcoin investors typically consider factors that newer market participants might overlook. Their decisions often reflect deep understanding of market cycles, regulatory developments, and technological advancements affecting cryptocurrency valuations. Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts This development offers valuable lessons for anyone interested in cryptocurrency markets. The move by this early Bitcoin investor demonstrates several important principles about cryptocurrency investing. Market movements by established Bitcoin investors provide learning opportunities for understanding market dynamics. Large transactions remind us about the importance of having clear investment strategies regardless of market conditions. Moreover, this situation highlights why monitoring blockchain activity through services like Lookonchain has become essential for serious market participants tracking significant Bitcoin investor behavior. Frequently Asked Questions Why do large Bitcoin deposits to exchanges often indicate selling? Exchanges provide the liquidity needed for large sales. When Bitcoin investors move significant amounts to exchanges, they’re typically preparing to convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency or other assets. How early is Owen Gunden as a Bitcoin investor? While specific details about his initial acquisition aren’t public, holding 2,499 BTC suggests very early involvement, potentially dating back to Bitcoin’s earlier years when prices were substantially lower. Could this Bitcoin deposit have other purposes besides selling? Absolutely. While selling is the most common interpretation, Bitcoin investors sometimes use exchanges for staking, lending, or transferring between accounts. Some institutional transactions also require exchange intermediation. How might this affect Bitcoin’s price? Large potential sell pressure can create short-term volatility, but Bitcoin’s market depth has grown significantly. Single transactions, while large, rarely dictate long-term price trends in today’s mature market. Should retail investors follow early Bitcoin investors’ moves? While educational, retail investors should make decisions based on personal research and risk tolerance rather than blindly following any single Bitcoin investor’s actions. How can I track large cryptocurrency movements? Blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Chainalysis, and various on-chain analysis tools allow monitoring of significant cryptocurrency transactions in real-time.

In 2028, $SACHI is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $0.65, with an average price of $0.45. By 2031, $SACHI could trade between $0.60 and $1.35, with an average price of $0.95 SACHI is one of the new players in the Web3 gaming world. The coin combines high-quality Unreal Engine 5 graphics with blockchain-based economies to make a gaming universe that is always available and immersive. SACHI focuses on gameplay first and tokens second. Its “play first, wallet later” philosophy gives its token holders console-quality experiences right away—no wallet, no setup, no hassle—making it one of the easiest Web3 games to get into so far. SACHI is also building the foundation for a modern, seamless, and deeply social gaming world with help from major infrastructure partners like Microsoft Azure and Aethir, as well as real-time pixel-streaming technology. With the recent listing (November 19, 2025) of the $SACHI token on MEXC, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is $SACHI likely to go up? What will $SACHI be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the SACHI price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency SACHI Ticker $SACHI Current Price $0.07495 Market Cap – Trading Volume (24-Hour) $213.45K Circulating Supply 560,000,000 SACHI All-time High – All-time Low – 24-hour High $0.13311 24-hour Low $0.036 $SACHI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.07495 Price Prediction $0.09 Fear & Greed Index – Sentiment – Volatility – Green Days – 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI – $SACHI price analysis $SACHI/USDT price analysis 1-day chart The 1-day chart on Nov 20 shows that $SACHI is very volatile after its MEXC launch. There is a huge change from $0.03600 to $0.13311, and then the price stays stable around $0.074–$0.075. This pattern shows that the initial listing spike has cooled off and the market is now looking for a fair value zone. SACHI/USD chart by mexc.co The price is stable because the candle body is tight and the volume is low. If buyers stay above $0.07, SACHI might try to test the $0.10–$0.13 zone again. But if it drops below $0.06, it could go down even more to $0.045–$0.05. What happens next depends on how much volume comes back. If it doesn’t, $SACHI may trade sideways for a while. $SACHI/USDT price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart for $SACHI shows price movements that happen very early and are very volatile, but there isn’t much structure because it just got listed. The huge green candle that went from $0.036 to $0.13311 suggests that the first breakout was aggressive and was probably caused by listing hype and low liquidity. $ SACHI/USD chart by mexc.co Since then, the price has stayed around $0.074–$0.075, forming small red candles that show momentum is slowing down, but there hasn’t been a clear reversal yet. The market is still figuring out what fair value is because there aren’t any moving averages or trend structures. $SACHI might test $0.10 again if interest rises, and it might test $0.05 support again if interest falls. Expect prices to move up and down until there is more liquidity. $SACHI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 – – SMA 5 – – SMA 10 – – SMA 21 – – SMA 50 – – SMA 100 – – SMA 200 – – Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 – – EMA 5 – – EMA 10 – – EMA 21 – – EMA 50 – – EMA 100 – – EMA 200 – – What to expect from $SACHI price analysis next? SACHI’s price movements show that there will be some early-stage volatility as the token settles down after its debut on MEXC. The market is now looking for a fair value range after a strong start that sent the price up to $0.13311 and then settled around $0.074–$0.08. If more people buy and the listing keeps going up, SACHI could test the $0.10–$0.13 zone again. But because there isn’t much liquidity and there isn’t much historical data, pullbacks to $0.050–$0.060 are still possible. Short-term movement will depend a lot on what happens on the exchanges, how involved the community is, and any announcements about the ecosystem that are coming up. Expect a lot of ups and downs, but also some attempts to go up as more people become aware. Is $SACHI a good investment? SACHI aims to build a big gaming ecosystem on Unreal Engine 5 and get people to sign up by using its “play-first, wallet-later” model and listing on MEXC. It has a lot of potential, but it’s still in the early stages. The token might be worth keeping an eye on if you believe in the execution of its roadmap, the growth of the gaming Web3 space, and SACHI’s community momentum. But if you care more about lower risk or proven fundamentals, SACHI might be too risky right now. What will $SACHI be worth in 2025? By the end of 2025, SACHI is expected to reach a maximum price of $0.09 How much will $SACHI cost in 2030? According to analysts’ predictions, $SACHI Token is predicted to trade at an average price of $0.72, with a maximum price of $1.05 by 2030. Can $SACHI reach $20? SACHI is still very early in its development, so it’s very unlikely that it will reach $20. To reach that level, there would need to be a huge increase in value, a lot of people using it, listings on major exchanges, and a big drop in the amount of coins in circulation. $20 is still way too high for realistic short-term expectations unless SACHI becomes a top-tier gaming ecosystem. Where to buy $SACHI? Users can purchase $SACHI at MEXC Global, which is the main centralized exchange where $SACHI is officially listed and actively traded. You can also find it on some supported markets, like Holder.io, which shows the SACHI/USDT trading pairs. Before you buy, always check the official contract address and make sure you’re using a trusted exchange. Will $SACHI reach $10? It’s very unlikely that SACHI will reach $10 under the current conditions. To reach $10 from its recent range of about $0.07 to $0.08, it would need to grow by more than 100 times, which would require a lot of new users, a lot of new exchanges, and steady growth in the ecosystem. $10 is still very speculative and unlikely to happen in the near future because there are no proven long-term fundamentals or large-scale demand. Will $SACHI reach $100? Under any realistic market conditions, it is almost impossible for SACHI to reach $100. To reach $100 at its current price, it would need to rise by thousands of percent and push its market cap into the tens of billions, which is much higher than what most early-stage gaming tokens can do. For SACHI to get to that level, it would need a lot of people around the world to start using it, a lot of major exchanges to list it, a lot of new users to join, and a lot of coins to be taken out of circulation. None of these things are happening yet. Even though crypto can be unpredictable, $100 is not a reasonable or likely goal for SACHI based on its fundamentals, maturity, and tokenomics. Does $SACHI have a good long-term future? SACHI has a lot of potential if it can make its AAA Web3 gaming universe a reality, get a lot of players, and keep making good partnerships with companies like Microsoft Azure and Aethir. Its “play first, wallet later” model is different and might appeal to regular gamers. But it’s still very early, very speculative, and completely dependent on how well it’s done. There is a chance of long-term success, but it is not certain. Recent news/opinion on $SACHI Recent news about $ SACHI has gotten a lot of attention because the token is at a very important time for its ecosystem. The November 19 listing on MEXC Global lets gamers and traders from all over the world join in. It comes after the token generation event on November 18. The token’s “play-first, wallet-later” Web3 gaming model and community incentives based on airdrops helped it get more attention and gain traction early on. Its partnerships with Microsoft Azure, Aethir, and TokaCity show how big its goals are. But because the project is still in its early stages, is speculative, and has a short trading history, $ SACHI is still a high-risk investment. Community involvement and interest in real-world gaming will be important in figuring out if the hype turns into real value. $SACHI price prediction November 2025 The price of Hedera is expected to be at least $0.05 in November 2025.

SACHI price prediction 2027 By 2027, SACHI’s average market price is projected to reach $0.32, with a possible low of $0.20 and a high of $0.46, driven by gaming adoption and infrastructure upgrades.

SACHI price forecast 2029 By 2029, SACHI’s average price is forecast at $0.58, with a potential low of $0.36 and a high of $0.82, supported by maturing GameFi demand and deeper ecosystem integration. SACHI ($SACHI) price prediction 2030 By 2030, SACHI’s average market price may reach $0.72, with lows around $0.48 and highs of $1.05. However, this is due to sustained Web3 gaming growth at this time. SACHI price prediction 2031 By 2031, SACHI’s average price is expected to be $0.95, with a projected low of $0.60 and a peak potential of $1.35, assuming mass adoption, stable tokenomics, and expansion into mainstream gaming. $SACHI price predictions 2025 – 2030 $SACHI market price prediction: Analysts’ $SACHI price forecast Firm Name 2025 2026 Mexc $0.036 $0.0378 Cryptopolitan’s SACHI ($SACHI) price prediction Cryptopolitan forecasts $SACHI price to range between $0.07 and $0.80 by the end of 2025.

CRCL's business is still heavily reliant on USDC issuance and short-term interest rates, though, making it vulnerable to both falling interest rates and a potential crypto market downturn. While I believe there could still be further downside, I am now more neutral on Circle's stock after the recent decline. Circle's ( CRCL ) third-quarter results were strong, with efforts to diversify revenue beginning to pay off. This will only play out slowly, though, and in the meantime there is little to prevent a complete implosion of Circle's business in the event of a recession. I previously highlighted the enormous risks Circle was facing, and its share price is down over 40% since then. Short-term interest rates continue to fall, although this has been fairly modest so far. Bitcoin's price is also down materially in recent weeks, which could temper demand for stablecoins. Despite this, I am now more neutral on Circle's stock after the recent decline, as the longer term narrative remains fairly compelling. Having said that, there will little to support Circle's share price if macro conditions continue to deteriorate. Market Conditions The most important recent development for stablecoins is the introduction of a far more favorable regulatory environment. While the full impact likely won't be felt for some time, Circle is best positioned to capitalize on this situation due to its focus on compliance. Stablecoins in circulation increased 59% YoY in Q3, supported by surging markets. Circle’s market share also increased to 29% in the quarter. Stablecoin transaction volumes were reportedly up around 130% YoY, with USDC’s share growing to 40%. While this is positive, the recent market pullback is likely to temper demand for stablecoins in the short term. If this situation evolves into a bear market or recession, USDC's market capitalization could drop significantly, despite secular tailwinds. Figure 1: Bitcoin Price and USDC Market Capitalization (source: Created by author using data from) Circle Business Updates Circle's business continues to be dominated by the issuance of USDC, a US-dollar-denominated stablecoin. Circle also now offers the EURC stablecoin, but its market cap is still negligible. This is important as it means that Circle's revenue is predominantly dependent on short-term interest rates. Circle is building financial infrastructure that extends well beyond just USDC, though. This includes the Arc layer-1 blockchain, which is tailored for stablecoins. Circle recently launched the Arc public testnet with more than 100 participants. While this is an interesting strategic move, it is not guaranteed to be successful. Arc faces fierce competition, and it is a late entrant into the market. This must be weighed against the fact that Circle has a distribution advantage and could use incentives to drive adoption. For example, Circle is already considering introducing a native token on the Arc Network. Circle also offers CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol), an infrastructure solution that enables the movement of USDC across blockchains, improving liquidity and the user experience. CCTP volume reached 31.3 billion USD in Q3, up 640% YoY. Circle has suggested that this represented around 47% of the bridged volumes that it tracks. Circle also has the Circle Payments Network, a stablecoin payments solution targeted at financial institutions. It abstracts the complexity of the underlying blockchain system and enables fast, low-cost, and compliant global payments. CPN was only launched in May 2025 but is already seeing significant transaction volume growth. Support for 5 new chains was added in the quarter, and Circle continues to expand the CPN product portfolio. This includes CPN Console, a self-service solution for CPN members, and CPN Payouts, which enables automated stablecoin payouts on CPN. There are now 29 network members and a pipeline of 500 financial institutions waiting to join. CPN transaction volume is currently at around a 3.4 billion USD annual run rate. The other important part of Circle's business at the moment is USYC, a tokenized money market fund. Circle acquired this product to support the rising use of yield-bearing digital assets as collateral in margin trading. USYC is now the second largest TMMF globally, with roughly 1 billion USD AUM. Financial Analysis USDC in circulation reached almost 74 billion USD in the third quarter, an increase of 108% YoY. Onchain transactions using USDC also grew 580% YoY to 9.6 trillion USD. Revenue and reserve income was only up 66% to 740 million USD though, with lower interest rates offsetting a substantial portion of the volume increase (return on reserves of ~4.15%). Transaction revenue totaled 4.7 million USD in the quarter. Other revenue was 29 million USD in Q3, up from less than 1 million USD in the prior year's comparable quarter. Subscription and services revenue totaled 23.6 million USD, which primarily relates to blockchain network partnerships. Circle hasn't given specific near-term revenue guidance. USDC in circulation is expected to grow at a 40% CAGR over a multi-year period, though, which probably puts revenue growth at less than a 30% CAGR. Circle also now expects 90-100 million USD Other Revenue in 2025, which would mean that Other Revenue is fairly flat sequentially. Given the underlying trends in the business, this guidance appears overly conservative. Figure 2: Circle Revenue (source: Created by author using data from Circle) Total distribution and transaction and other costs increased 74% YoY in Q3 to 448 million USD. The increase was driven by distribution incentives and growth of USDC balances held on Coinbase's platform. As a result, Circle's RLDC margin declined to 39.5%. Circle's adjusted operating expenses only increased 35% YoY to 131 million USD though, with adjusted EBITDA reaching 166 million USD at a 22% margin. While Circle has a highly profitable business, this would soon change if interest rates were to drop significantly. Figure 3: Circle Margins (source: Created by author using data from Circle) Conclusion I remain skeptical of Circle's business due to its current dependence on interest rates and cryptocurrency speculation. The company is moving in the right direction, though, with its infrastructure solutions and tokenized money market fund continuing to grow rapidly. It will likely be years before these alternative revenue sources are large enough to justify Circle's current market capitalization. In the meantime, weakening economic conditions continue to present a serious threat to Circle's share price. Despite this, I am now more neutral on Circle's stock, as it could soon find support after the recent decline.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-20 02:32:22

Speaking at the Devconnect conference, Buterin expressed deep concerns that institutional money might compromise the very Ethereum values that made the network revolutionary. Why Are Ethereum Values So Important? Ethereum values represent the foundational principles that distinguish the network from traditional financial systems. These include decentralization, permissionless access, and censorship resistance. However, Buterin warns that these core Ethereum values face unprecedented challenges from institutional investors seeking to reshape the ecosystem for their own benefit. The Two Major Threats to Ethereum’s Future Buterin outlined two critical dangers that could emerge from excessive institutional influence: Community Exodus: The original builders and developers who created Ethereum’s infrastructure might abandon the project if it becomes merely a tool for large corporations Decentralization Collapse: Regular users and node operators could be priced out if technology development focuses exclusively on institutional needs How Can We Protect Ethereum Values? Buterin emphasized that preserving these essential Ethereum values requires conscious effort and strategic planning. The solution lies in developing protocols that remain: Global and accessible to everyone Permissionless without gatekeepers Censorship-resistant against external control What Makes a Strong Ethereum Community? A dedicated community committed to Ethereum values serves as the network’s first line of defense. This community must actively participate in governance, run nodes, and develop applications that serve diverse users rather than just institutional interests. The strength of these Ethereum values depends on everyday users maintaining control. The Path Forward for Ethereum Values Maintaining authentic Ethereum values requires balancing growth with principles. While institutional investment brings capital and legitimacy, it must not come at the cost of the network’s founding ideals. The community must remain vigilant in protecting the Ethereum values that make the platform unique in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions What are the core Ethereum values Buterin mentioned? The core Ethereum values include decentralization, permissionless access, censorship resistance, and community-driven development that serves diverse users rather than concentrated interests. How could institutional investors threaten Ethereum? Institutions might push for changes that prioritize their needs over regular users, potentially making node operation too expensive for individuals and centralizing control. What solutions did Buterin propose? Buterin emphasized developing global, permissionless protocols and strengthening community commitment to Ethereum’s original principles. Can Ethereum survive without institutional money? Yes, Ethereum initially grew through community support. While institutions bring benefits, the network’s survival depends on maintaining its core values above all. How can regular users help protect Ethereum values? Users can run nodes, participate in governance, support decentralized applications, and advocate for policies that maintain accessibility. Is this concern unique to Ethereum? While all decentralized networks face similar challenges, Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract platform makes it particularly vulnerable to institutional capture.

Analysts Weigh In After ETF Momentum Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/can-xrp-really-overtake-ethereum-analysts-weigh-in-after-etf-momentum-builds/,"The crypto market is buzzing after the launch of the first U.S. spot XRP ETFs, a development that has injected fresh institutional energy into the asset. Related Reading: Famous Trader Bets $27 Million That The XRP Price Will Crash With multiple high-performing firms entering the race, including Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale, a bold question is resurfacing across the industry: Can XRP realistically challenge Ethereum for the No. 2 spot in the global cryptocurrency rankings? XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP ETFs Ignite Institutional Momentum The launch of XRP ETFs in November 2025 marked a historic moment for the asset. Canary Capital’s XRPC debuted with over $58 million in first-day volume, the strongest ETF opening among hundreds launched this year. Franklin Templeton has now filed its Form 8-A to list the Franklin XRP ETF on NYSE Arca, signaling that another major player is just days away from going live. This influx of institutional interest mirrors the early phases of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF rollouts, characterized by short-term volatility followed by broader adoption. Though XRP’s price consolidated around the $2.12–$2.17 zone after the initial spike, analysts argue that ETF inflows operate with settlement lags through OTC desks. In other words, the actual impact on market price may not be realized until later. Can XRP Truly Compete With Ethereum’s Dominance? Despite XRP’s explosive year, marked by record utility, rising XRPL adoption, and Ripple’s $500 million strategic investment, the asset still faces a steep climb if it hopes to overtake Ethereum. Ethereum remains firmly in second place with a $373 billion market cap, supported by a massive ecosystem of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and tokenized assets. XRP, currently around $129 billion, operates on a network optimized for payments rather than programmable applications. Analysts note that while XRP’s institutional use cases are deepening, particularly in cross-border settlement, tokenization, and banking infrastructure, the lack of a native smart-contract layer limits its ability to mirror Ethereum’s developer-driven demand. For now, experts say that overtaking Ethereum is unlikely in the short to medium term. But with expanding utility, ETF-driven accumulation, and growing adoption in Japan, the U.S., and global banks, XRP’s market cap could still climb substantially. Price Outlook: Volatility Now, Bigger Moves Later From a technical standpoint, XRP is sitting at a critical support zone near $2.12, repeatedly testing the 0.382 Fibonacci level. Selling pressure remains present, with capital outflows and lower highs on the chart. Yet open interest has surged from $1 billion to over $6 billion since October, signaling strong trader engagement.

54635894,630766,1763607637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54635894.jpeg,$201M SOL Sell-Off Sparks More Fear: Can Solana Hold Above the $130 Support Zone?,https://bitcoinist.com/201m-sol-sell-off-sparks-more-fear-can-solana-hold/,"Solana (SOL) is under intense market pressure after a massive $201 million token transfer on November 17 sparked concerns about further losses. While institutional interest in Solana-based ETFs remains strong, technical indicators point to a fragile market structure that could send SOL toward the $125–$120 region if buyers fail to regain momentum. $201M Dump Raises Alarms as Solana Extends Downtrend Forward Industries, Solana’s largest corporate holder, moved 1.44 million SOL, worth roughly $201.34 million, to Coinbase Prime earlier this week, according to Onchain Lens . The transfer triggered speculation of an impending major sell-off, especially as Solana has already declined nearly 50% over the past two months. Although it remains unclear whether the tokens were sold or repositioned, the market reaction was swift. SOL briefly dipped to $128 before recovering to the $137 range. Trading volume, however, has declined by 38% to $5.65 billion, indicating elevated trader anxiety and aggressive repositioning. Technically, SOL remains in a confirmed downtrend after losing the critical $155 support level. Indicators such as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.18 and a bearish Supertrend signal show persistent selling pressure. If the price remains below the current consolidation zone, analysts warn of a potential 16% drop, placing $120 firmly in sight. Institutional Inflows Persist Despite Price Weakness The irony in Solana’s current situation is striking. Despite a weekly drop of 11%, institutional confidence is slowly picking up pace. Solana ETFs have rapidly expanded across major U.S. exchanges, with Fidelity, Canary, VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise all launching new SOL products in recent days. Fidelity’s $FSOL recorded $2.07 million in day-one inflows, while total net inflows across all U.S. Solana ETFs have soared to $420.4 million. Meanwhile, November 18 marked the 15th consecutive day of positive ETF inflows, totaling $26.2 million, led by Bitwise’s BSOL. This reflects a deeper narrative: institutional investors see Solana’s long-term fundamentals, speed, developer activity, and staking yields as compelling despite short-term volatility. Key Levels: Can SOL Hold Above $130? Analysts now highlight $125 and $120 as the most critical support zones. A failure to defend $130 could accelerate losses toward $120, with a deeper floor at $115. Conversely, a reclaim of $145, and ideally $160, would signal the first meaningful reversal in weeks. For now, Solana sits at a crossroads. Heavy selling pressure on one side, surging institutional conviction on the other. The next few days may determine whether SOL stabilizes or slides deeper into bearish territory.

His latest commentary presents the view that the broader crypto environment has entered a structural shift, one where assumptions are no longer reliable indicators of future performance. Rather than relying on historical patterns, he argues that new drivers now shape the direction of leading assets. ETF Influence and XRP’s Position At the center of his analysis is the belief that multiple exchange-traded funds dedicated to a single cryptocurrency fundamentally alter how that asset behaves. According to the researcher, once an asset reaches that stage, it is no longer confined to Bitcoin’s movements or the influence of cyclical trends that once defined the entire industry. He emphasizes that ETFs rely on liquidity, activity, and market demand. Not on adherence to legacy expectations about Bitcoin’s dominance or the traditional four-year cycle. Ripple Bull Winkle presents XRP as an example of this evolving structure. He suggests that even in the event of a Bitcoin downturn, XRP’s performance could remain unaffected. The reasoning behind this outlook lies in the presence of institutional participation and regulatory clarity , which he views as the primary factors driving modern market behavior. THE BREAKAWAY MOMENT HAS BEGUN Bitcoin can fall into a full bear market… and XRP will still be completely fine. Because once an asset gets multiple ETFs, it stops living under Bitcoin’s shadow. ETFs follow liquidity, not tradition. The four-year cycle everyone… — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 17, 2025 A Shift Away from Uniform Market Behavior The comparison he draws to the stock market underscores his point. In his view, the market is moving toward a landscape in which cryptocurrencies operate as distinct asset classes with unique catalysts, investor profiles, and liquidity conditions. He notes that major companies in traditional markets do not move in unison simply because they exist within the same sector. He expects digital assets to adopt the pattern. By this logic, XRP’s trajectory does not need to align with Bitcoin’s trends. He states that the introduction of ETFs has changed the market’s script, ushering in an era in which Bitcoin’s dominance gradually weakens while assets supported by utility and liquidity assume clearer, independent price structures. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions and Perspectives The discussion prompted responses from community members who shared similar interpretations of this evolving market framework. One commenter stated that comparing Bitcoin and XRP is inappropriate due to their differing purposes, adding that XRP’s long-term utility positions it differently within the market. Another user noted that ETF-driven assets should not be expected to follow Bitcoin’s historical bull and bear cycles, suggesting that future price action may resemble traditional market behavior rather than the halving-based patterns observed in previous years. Ripple Bull Winkle frames this moment as the beginning of a new phase for digital assets. His view positions XRP among the assets moving into a more defined and independent market identity, shaped by institutional mechanisms and real-world demand rather than legacy cycles.

Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,150 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $3,050 and entered a bearish zone. The decline gathered pace below $3,000 and the price dipped below $2,950. A low was formed at $2,870 and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,165 swing high to the $2,870 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $3,050 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,165 swing high to the $2,870 low. The next key resistance is near the $3,100 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,100 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,150 level. A clear move above the $3,150 resistance might send the price toward the $3,200 resistance. An upside break above the $3,200 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,320 resistance zone or even $3,350 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,100 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,000 level. The first major support sits near the $2,940 zone. A clear move below the $2,940 support might push the price toward the $2,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,820 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,750 and $2,740. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

The preferred shares all trading at a discount to par likely limit Strategy's ability to use those products for continued BTC purchases. Worse than that, Strategy likely has about $80 million in cash and roughly $150 million in dividend obligations due before the end of the year. The market seems to be daring the company to sell Bitcoin. I suspect it will simply keep diluting the common instead. Shares of Strategy ( MSTR ) have been in freefall since early October . MSTR falling in price is not something that I'm particularly surprised by given the declines in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I've been stressing caution through my MSTR coverage on Seeking Alpha for well over a year. Perhaps more important than the MSTR declines, Strategy's preferred stocks ( STRK )( STRF )( STRD )( STRC ) are now also collapsing. This directly challenges my prior thinking, and in this update, I'll detail why I think the market has lost confidence in Strategy's Bitcoin flywheel. The Preferred Stocks Are Unraveling Strategy Stocks (Seeking Alpha) As of writing, each of Strategy's preferred stocks is down significantly during intraday trading. These stocks are down between 3% and 8%. For income investments, these are absolutely massive moves. In recent months, I've made the case for why I felt one of Strategy's income-based products could conceivably do well when Bitcoin's price went down. In reality, the opposite has been true, and I'm now forced to reassess my thinking. While I have not been bullish on either the STRK or STRD shares in the past, I have been bullish on the STRF shares. To be clear, I do still hold STRF shares. But I also see some serious problems that I think warrant trimming that position. First, STRD and STRK are now trading below IPO price. Beyond that, STRF has fallen below $100 per share for the first time since June and is currently at its lowest price level since May. What this means is that every single dollar-based preferred stock that Strategy offers is currently trading below par. Since MSTR shares are also trading at a sizable discount to mNAV, it puts Strategy in a very precarious position with limited options as the company's December dividend payment due date quickly approaches. The Problem For those who have followed either my work or the stock itself, this shouldn't be a surprise. Strategy does not actually generate positive income from operating its software business. We have to strip out gains or losses on digital assets that were purchased years prior to get a real assessment of the company's software business operations. On a trailing twelve-month basis, Strategy's adjusted operating loss is over $42 million: Millions Q3-24 Q4-24 Q1-25 Q2-25 Q3-25 Revenue $116.1 $120.7 $111.1 $114.5 $128.7 Cost of Revenue $34.3 $34.2 $34.0 $35.8 $38.0 SG&A $68.9 $72.4 $68.1 $70.2 $68.1 R&D $33.3 $25.7 $24.4 $24.1 $22.6 Operating Income -$20.4 -$11.6 -$15.4 -$15.6 $0.0 Source: Seeking Alpha The only reason Strategy has been able to buy Bitcoin to the degree that it has is due to the company's ability to raise capital through various instruments, including convertible notes, preferred stocks, and good old-fashioned common stock dilution. Raising money to buy BTC was easy when MSTR traded at a significant premium to mNAV. BTC buys vs MSTR mNAV (Strategy & BitcoinTreasuries, Analyst's Chart) That is no longer the case, and we can see in the chart above how weekly acquisitions have fallen in line with MSTR mNAV compression. Anecdotally, it is quite obvious that MSTR shareholder appetite for more dilution of the common is virtually gone, judging by sentiment online. But it's important to keep in mind that 89% of the Bitcoin purchase capital raised since preferred stock ATMs launched in March has actually come from the common ATM. Strategy can just switch to issuing more preferred stock through ATMs then? Maybe not, actually. To illustrate why, let's look at one of Strategy's recent Bitcoin acquisition filings: November 10th Filing (Strategy) I've crudely circled the nominal value versus net proceeds for each of the four preferred ATM raises during the week of November 3rd. Strategy was really only able to utilize STRF and STRC because those were the two products that it could use to generate greater proceeds from the stock issuance than the nominal value of the obligation it was creating. That was not the case for STRK or STRD, which is why those raises were so much smaller by comparison. The point is, Strategy does not want to issue $6.4 million in preferred stocks to generate just $5.5 million in proceeds. It would much rather do the opposite. Now it can't. At the end of September, Strategy had $54.3 million in cash and equivalents. Since then, the company has raised about $318 million through its ATM programs and purchased almost $292 million in BTC with that capital. That leaves, at best, $80 million or so in cash to pay out nearly $150 million in dividend obligations before the end of the year. Preferred Class Shares Dividend/Shr Divis Due EOY STRK (Due Dec) 13,974,912 $2.00 $27,949,824 STRF (Due Dec) 12,676,383 $2.50 $31,690,958 STRD (Due Dec) 12,344,308 $3.06 $37,724,205 STRC (Due Nov+Dec) 29,587,063 $0.88 $51,777,360 Total Dividends Due by EOY $149,142,347 Source: Strategy, Analyst's Calculations, estimated dividend payments To be sure, Strategy could simply not pay the STRD dividends in December, though I suspect doing so would irreparably damage the company's ability to continue raising capital should it wish to continue doing so in the future. But even if it doesn't pay STRD shareholders in December, the company would still have a dividend shortfall through the other three products. Strategy's Next Move There are a variety of ways Executive Chairman Michael Saylor and company could play the precarious situation that Strategy now finds itself in. But I think these three are the most straight forward: Keep raising capital through preferred stocks Sell Bitcoin to pay dividends Continue diluting common stock holders I think option 1 is unlikely due to what I just laid out in the section above. Strategy cannot tap the preferred ATMs while all four of them are under par without severely damaging trust in his income products, in my opinion. However, if STRF recovers from current levels and retakes par, we could see Strategy begin to lean on that instrument a bit more despite its relatively small ATM. Option 2 is also unlikely because it goes counter to what Saylor has been saying for years. The time to sell BTC to pay the dividends was a month ago when Bitcoin was well over $110 per coin. Given the weakness in the market, Strategy selling BTC could trigger a deeper cascade lower in the asset. Which would result in bigger problems for the company. Option 3 seems like the easiest 'kick the can down the road' path. Thus, it seems to me to be the most likely. Closing Summary Again, I have to stress that Strategy had already been heavily relying on MSTR dilution to fund purchases to this point. Given the market dynamics currently on display in the preferred stocks, Strategy's ability to raise through its income products going forward is likely minimal. Frankly, I think the market is actually daring the company to sell Bitcoin to pay its preferred obligations in December. Furthermore, at a basic mNAV of 0.9, one could argue it behooves the company to sell Bitcoin to buy back its common stock to close its own mNAV discount. While I highly doubt buying back MSTR is something the company is considering doing, I have to imagine there is at least some internal discussion about buying back some of the preferred stocks while they're under par to minimize the company's perpetual dividend obligations. I could certainly be wrong for being bullish on STRF earlier this year. But I don't think I'm going to be wrong on continuing to avoid MSTR.",MSTR|STRF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-20 03:10:13

In an X post on Thursday, the WLFI team said some wallets were breached before the platform went live, either through phishing attacks or exposed seed phrases. It said that the incident did not stem from flaws in WLFI’s own platform or smart contracts, and blamed third-party security lapses that allowed attackers to take control of private wallets. The project said it responded by freezing affected wallets in September and verifying ownership. WLFI Rolls Out KYC Checks And New Wallet Process To Secure User Funds Users who reported compromise were asked to complete fresh know-your-customer (KYC) checks and submit new wallet addresses, so funds could be moved to safer accounts. 1/ Prior to WLFI’s launch, a relatively small subset of user wallets were compromised via phishing attacks or exposed seed phrases. Since then, we’ve tested new smart contract logic to safely reallocate user funds and verified users’ identity via KYC checks. Shortly, users who… — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) November 19, 2025 In parallel, engineers built and tested new smart contract logic to handle bulk reallocations. The team said reallocations will now begin for users who opened support tickets and passed the required verification steps, while wallets linked to users who have not yet engaged will remain frozen. Those users can still start the process through the help centre. WLFI framed the slow rollout as deliberate, saying it chose to prioritise the safety of funds over speed, even though the root cause lay outside its own systems. The message aimed to reassure holders who saw wallets locked for weeks while the team designed and tested the migration process. WLFI Trading Exploded On Binance With Nearly $1B Volume In First Hour The security issue arrives only weeks after WLFI’s high-profile debut. World Liberty Financial launched its WLFI token on Sept. 1, following teasers earlier in 2024. Trading began on decentralized venues with sharp swings, including a drop of more than 15% on launch day . Momentum then shifted to major exchanges. Trading volumes surged on Binance and elsewhere, with about $1b worth of tokens changing hands in the first hour, according to CoinMarketCap. Prices moved between $0.24 and $0.30, roughly in line with futures pricing ahead of the listing. At the top of that range, the Trump family’s stake, reported as 22.5b tokens out of a 100b supply, carried a paper value of more than $6b , making WLFI its single largest asset, the Wall Street Journal reported. The run-up gave the project instant visibility across both political and crypto circles. WLFI Stake Drops To $3.15B As Token Trades Well Below Launch Levels Market conditions have since cooled. As of Nov. 20, the family’s WLFI holdings are worth about $3.15b on paper, based on a token price of $0.13 and the same 22.5b token stake. These are locked governance tokens that confer voting rights and a share of revenue from presales, estimated at $400m to $500m realized so far, rather than full economic claims on the business. Phishing links, fake support channels and poor key storage remain the weakest points in consumer-facing crypto, even on projects with high visibility and substantial resources.

FIGR's Q3 revenue surged 55% year-over-year to $156.4 million, far exceeding Wall Street expectations, driven by ecosystem and technology fees. The company boasts >50% adjusted EBITDA margins, rapid loan origination growth, and a successful new crypto exchange product launched in August 2024. Reiterating a buy rating, I recommend using near-term dips as buying opportunities given FIGR's profitability and long-term market potential. Amid the sharp correction in the stock market from recent highs, crypto assets are also facing a correlated reckoning, with Bitcoin now sitting stubbornly under $100k. The sharp and highly visible crash in the world's largest crypto asset has also taken down a number of very attractive stocks in the blockchain space, like Circle ( CRCL ) and Figure ( FIGR ), which have little to do with crypto speculation and enjoy long-term secular tailwinds from the blockchain's capacity to dramatically improve our payments infrastructure. Figure, in particular, just reported its first earnings quarter since going public in September at $25 per share. Though Figure is up from post-IPO levels, the stock is down about 25% from highs above $49 reached in August, technically putting the stock in a bear market. In my view, it's a great time for investors who are unfamiliar with this name to take a look at this stock with fresh eyes. Data by YCharts I last wrote a buy article on Figure in September, shortly after the IPO, when Figure was trading in the mid $30s. Since then, I've gained on my position, but a number of positive fundamental factors have also moved in Figure's favor. Its recently opened exchange product is delivering substantial revenue growth, and may actually benefit from recent crypto market volatility. Meanwhile, its core loan origination product is also showcasing rapid growth, while diversifying Figure away from its original base of HELOC loans. And perhaps most importantly, Figure is minting incredible adjusted EBITDA profits, which make the stock's slide more irresistible. I'm reiterating my buy rating here. As a reminder for investors who are newer to Figure, here is what I consider to be the core bull case drivers for the stock in the long haul: Figure is a vast improvement over existing lending infrastructure. Per the company's own estimates, the company provides 93% savings versus the cost to originate a traditional loan, and an 80% reduction in due diligence costs for securitizing collateralized products. Transactional and recurring revenue. The company's core lending products earn an upfront 3% origination fee on all loans originated through the Figure platform, while the company also earns traditional mortgage servicing revenue for all the debt under its administration. Figure Exchange opportunity. The company launched its own crypto trading exchange in August 2024, which is driving substantial revenue growth for the company. Stablecoin issuer. The company also offers a regulated, yield-bearing stablecoin (YLDS), which can benefit from continued interest in holding digital assets that serve as a means of payment and don't fluctuate in value. Unlike rival Circle ( CRCL ), which sponsors the much larger USDC coin, net interest income is just a small slice of Figure's overall revenue, meaning that Figure won't be hugely impacted if the Fed keeps cutting short-term rates. Already immensely profitable. Though Figure is still in the early stages of addressing what it believes to be a $2 trillion market opportunity in lending and $4 trillion in crypto and digital assets, the company is already generating a >50% adjusted EBITDA margin. Stay long here and use any near-term dips as a buying opportunity. Q3 download In mid-November, Figure released Q3 results, which were the first earnings results since the company went public in September. Though the stock is down since the print, the big beat to consensus expectations is a strong indicator of positive sentiment for the stock going forward. The Q3 earnings summary is shown below: Figure Q3 results (Figure Q3 earnings deck) Figure's revenue grew 55% y/y to $156.4 million, absolutely crushing Wall Street's expectations of $119.5 million (+18% y/y) by a massive margin. Of course, Figure is a very complex business with multiple income streams, so we need to take it piece by piece. The top contributor to growth is the company's ""ecosystem and technology fees"", which grew about ~5x y/y to $35.7 million, or 23% of the company's total. This was driven by the launch of Figure Exchange, which only had a small and partial-quarter contribution in Q3 of last year. We do expect this revenue line to decelerate in Q4 and beyond as Figure starts to comp last year's launch against full-quarter contributions. Still, we think Figure Exchange's broadening selection of cryptocurrencies as well as increasing interest in Bitcoin, especially given recent volatility, are all positive indicators for Figure. As a side note here: though Figure doesn't provide monthly metrics, many other exchanges do, giving us possible insight into how crypto market trading activity is moving past the close of Q3. Robinhood (HOOD) recently released trading activity for the completed month of October, which indicates that nominal crypto trading volumes on the Robinhood app (excluding the recent purchase of Bitstamp) rose 49% y/y to $13.9 billion, and nominally higher than September: which is a strong indication that we should expect Figure to have healthy trading revenue in Q4. Robinhood October trading activity (Robinhood October metrics release) Meanwhile, in the company's core lending arm, loan origination fees grew 13% y/y to $21.4 million, and servicing fees grew 22% y/y to $7.9 million. The company notes in the chart below that its total consumer loan volume grew 70% y/y to $2.47 billion in originations in Q3, which was driven by additional patents in the network and a broadening scope beyond HELOC loans. Figure key metrics (Figure Q3 earnings deck) The company notes that partners are increasingly turning to Figure to help originate first-lien loans, and not just HELOCs. Per CEO Michael Tannenbaum's remarks on the Q3 earnings call: Total consumer loan marketplace volume reached almost $2.5 billion in the third quarter, representing a 70% increase year-over-year. This growth reflects continued expansion across our origination partner network and increased utilization of Figure Connect for liquidity. As more partners leverage the platform to fund and sell loans, we're seeing meaningful gains in both scale and efficiency. A standout example being first lien lending, where adoption has accelerated sharply among both new and existing partners. Firstly, volumes nearly tripled year-over-year, making it one of our fastest-growing products this quarter. Partners are leaning into Figure Connect as a liquidity solution, enabling faster funding, improved execution and lower cost versus traditional channels."" We note that interest income also supplemented Figure's results, with interest growing 40% y/y to $17.9 million (11% of company revenue) despite compression in interest rates, thanks to growing issuance of YLDS. We note here that Figure has a nice counterweight and hedge against interest rates: if rates go up, Figure will see better net interest spreads, but if rates come down as they are highly expected to do, Figure should benefit from greater loan origination activity that will help to offset softer net interest spreads. Figure is also showcasing immense profitability chops. Adjusted EBITDA, as shown in the chart below, jumped 75% y/y to $86.4 million, reflecting a 55.4% margin that improved 10 points y/y: Figure adjusted EBITDA bridge (Figure Q3 earnings deck) Valuation and key takeaways At current post-earnings share prices near $37, Figure trades at an $8.22 billion market cap. Netting off the $1.79 billion of cash, restricted cash, loans held for immediate sale and investments on Figure's balance sheet against $466 million of debt gives the company an enterprise value of $6.90 billion. For next year, FY26, Wall Street analysts peg Figure's revenue at $604.6 million, or 24% y/y growth. If we conservatively assume a 48% adjusted EBITDA margin against that revenue profile (flat to YTD 2025 actuals, and lower than the 55% margin that Figure notched in Q3, given that Q2-Q3 tend to be seasonal peaks for loan originations), adjusted EBITDA would be $290 million.

The Bitcoin Layer 2 project BOB has just unveiled its token distribution plan, and the numbers are turning heads across the cryptocurrency community. With nearly half of the total supply dedicated to ecosystem growth and community development, this approach represents a significant shift in how blockchain projects value their supporters. What Makes BOB Tokenomics So Special? The BOB tokenomics model stands out for its community-first approach. The project will release 10 billion tokens total, with a massive 44.76% allocated directly to the ecosystem and community. This substantial allocation demonstrates the team’s commitment to building a truly decentralized network where users have real ownership and influence. Why does this matter? Traditional crypto projects often reserve the lion’s share for insiders and early investors. However, BOB tokenomics flips this model by prioritizing long-term community growth over short-term profits. This strategic decision could potentially create stronger network effects and more sustainable development. Breaking Down the BOB Token Distribution Let’s examine the complete BOB tokenomics breakdown in detail: Ecosystem and Community : 44.76% (4.476 billion tokens) Early Backers : 20.09% (2.009 billion tokens) Core Contributors : 19% (1.9 billion tokens) Foundation : 10% (1 billion tokens) Initial Claims : 4.15% (415 million tokens) Community Sale : 2% (200 million tokens) This transparent BOB tokenomics structure ensures that no single group dominates the network. The careful balancing act between different stakeholders creates a healthy distribution that supports both initial development and long-term sustainability. How Will the Community Allocation Work? The massive 44.76% community allocation in BOB tokenomics serves multiple purposes. This portion will likely fund various initiatives including: Community governance programs Ecosystem development grants User rewards and incentives Network security enhancements Educational initiatives This approach to BOB tokenomics ensures that the community has both the resources and the influence to shape the project’s future direction. It represents a fundamental shift from traditional corporate structures to truly decentralized community governance. What Challenges Might This BOB Tokenomics Model Face? While the BOB tokenomics model appears promising, it’s not without potential challenges. Managing such a large community allocation requires sophisticated governance mechanisms and transparent decision-making processes. The project must ensure that these tokens are distributed fairly and used effectively to benefit the entire ecosystem. Moreover, the success of this BOB tokenomics approach depends heavily on community engagement and participation. Without active involvement from token holders, even the most generous allocation could fail to achieve its intended purpose of creating a vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystem. Why This BOB Tokenomics Approach Matters for Bitcoin Layer 2 The innovative BOB tokenomics model could set a new standard for Bitcoin Layer 2 projects. By prioritizing community ownership and ecosystem development, BOB demonstrates how Layer 2 solutions can build sustainable networks that complement Bitcoin’s security and decentralization principles. This forward-thinking BOB tokenomics strategy aligns perfectly with the core values of the Bitcoin ecosystem while introducing modern token distribution mechanisms that reward participation and contribution. It represents a bridge between Bitcoin’s proven security model and innovative token economic designs. Conclusion: A New Era in Token Distribution The revolutionary BOB tokenomics model marks a significant step forward in how cryptocurrency projects approach community building and token distribution. With 44.76% of tokens dedicated to ecosystem and community growth, BOB sets a powerful precedent for future Bitcoin Layer 2 projects. This community-centric approach not only rewards early supporters but also creates a foundation for long-term, sustainable growth that benefits all participants in the ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What is the total supply of BOB tokens? The total supply is 10 billion BOB tokens, with detailed allocations across six different categories including ecosystem, community, and core contributors. How does the 44.76% community allocation compare to other projects? This allocation is significantly higher than many traditional crypto projects, demonstrating BOB’s strong commitment to community-led growth and decentralized governance. When will the community sale occur? Specific dates for the community sale haven’t been announced yet, but the allocation represents 2% of the total supply for this purpose. What benefits do community token holders receive? Community token holders can participate in governance, earn rewards, and help shape the project’s future direction through various ecosystem initiatives. How does BOB’s tokenomics support the Bitcoin ecosystem? As a Bitcoin Layer 2 project, BOB’s tokenomics are designed to complement Bitcoin’s security while enabling new functionality and community participation. What mechanisms ensure fair distribution of community tokens? While specific mechanisms haven’t been detailed, the foundation allocation and structured distribution suggest careful planning for fair and transparent token distribution.

Massive crypto liquidations totaling $464 million swept through perpetual futures markets, with Ethereum taking the hardest hit. This dramatic event highlights the extreme volatility that continues to define digital asset trading. What Triggered These Massive Crypto Liquidations? When prices move rapidly against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close trades to prevent further losses. This process creates a cascade effect that amplifies market moves. The recent crypto liquidations demonstrate how quickly conditions can change in digital asset markets. Ethereum bore the brunt of this storm with $222 million in forced position closures. Surprisingly, 87% of these ETH liquidations were long positions, indicating most traders were betting on price increases before the downturn hit. How Did Major Cryptocurrencies Fare? The crypto liquidations distribution reveals important market patterns: Ethereum (ETH) : $222 million liquidated, 87.03% long positions Bitcoin (BTC) : $170 million liquidated, 74.97% long positions Zcash (ZEC) : $72.62 million liquidated, 94.99% short positions This data shows that most traders were positioned for upward moves in major assets like Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, Zcash presented a different story where the vast majority of liquidations affected short sellers. Why Do Crypto Liquidations Matter to Traders? Understanding crypto liquidations is crucial for risk management. These forced closures can create domino effects that push prices even lower. When long positions get liquidated, it often means selling pressure increases, potentially triggering more liquidations. The scale of recent crypto liquidations serves as a stark reminder about leverage risks. Traders using high leverage become vulnerable to sudden price swings that can wipe out their positions in minutes. What Can We Learn From This Volatility? Market events like these crypto liquidations provide valuable lessons. First, they emphasize the importance of proper position sizing and risk management. Second, they show how sentiment can shift rapidly in cryptocurrency markets. The concentration of crypto liquidations in long positions suggests many traders were caught off guard by the price movement. This pattern often occurs when market sentiment becomes overly optimistic without fundamental support. How to Protect Yourself From Future Liquidations Surviving periods of heavy crypto liquidations requires strategic planning: Use conservative leverage ratios Set stop-loss orders appropriately Diversify across different assets Monitor market conditions regularly Maintain adequate margin buffers These crypto liquidations demonstrate that even experienced traders can get caught in sudden market moves. Therefore, preparation remains your best defense against unexpected volatility. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Liquidation Landscape The recent $464 million in crypto liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of market risks. While Ethereum led this particular downturn, the phenomenon affects the entire digital asset ecosystem. Understanding these mechanisms helps traders make informed decisions and manage exposure effectively. As cryptocurrency markets mature, we may see reduced volatility over time. However, for now, crypto liquidations remain an integral part of the trading landscape that demands respect and careful navigation. Frequently Asked Questions What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close leveraged positions that have lost too much value, preventing further losses beyond a trader’s initial margin. Why did Ethereum have the highest liquidation volume? Ethereum likely had the highest liquidation volume due to its large market capitalization, high trading volume, and significant leverage usage by traders betting on price movements. How can I avoid getting liquidated? You can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, setting appropriate stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and closely monitoring your positions during volatile periods. Do liquidations always make prices drop further? While long position liquidations typically create selling pressure that pushes prices lower, short position liquidations can have the opposite effect by forcing buybacks. How often do large liquidation events occur? Significant liquidation events tend to happen during periods of high volatility, which can occur multiple times per year depending on market conditions and catalyst events. Are liquidations bad for the cryptocurrency market? While liquidations cause short-term pain for affected traders, they help maintain market stability by preventing uncontrolled losses and excessive leverage buildup in the system.

The Bitcoin options market is flashing warning signs that every trader should understand. According to Glassnode’s latest analysis, bearish sentiment is taking hold as implied volatility approaches levels not seen since the October 10 mass liquidation event. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Options Market Shift? The current Bitcoin options market reflects growing concern among traders. When Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90,000, implied volatility surged dramatically. This spike was particularly noticeable in short-term contracts, indicating heightened sensitivity to immediate risks. Glassnode identifies two key factors behind this volatility expansion: Increased demand for downside protection through put options Unwinding of short gamma positions that suffer during volatility spikes Why Are Put Options Trading at a Premium? The most telling signal from the Bitcoin options market comes from put option pricing. Currently, one-week put options trade at approximately 14% premium over calls. This means traders are willing to pay significantly more for protection against potential price declines. This premium indicates several market realities: Traders anticipate potential downside movement Hedging activity has increased substantially Market participants are preparing for volatility How Does Implied Volatility Impact Your Trading Strategy? Implied volatility serves as the market’s fear gauge. When IV rises in the Bitcoin options market, it signals uncertainty and potential price swings. The current levels mirror those seen during significant correction periods, suggesting traders should exercise caution. Consider these implications for your trading approach: Option premiums become more expensive during high IV periods Hedging strategies may require larger capital allocations Risk management becomes increasingly important What Can We Learn from Current Market Positioning? The Bitcoin options market provides valuable insights into trader sentiment and potential price direction. The current put premium suggests that experienced traders are positioning for possible declines. However, remember that options markets can sometimes act as contrarian indicators when extremes are reached. Key takeaways for informed decision-making: Monitor IV levels for timing entries and exits Consider the cost of protection in your risk calculations Watch for sentiment shifts that might signal reversal opportunities Navigating the Current Bitcoin Options Market Environment Understanding the dynamics of the Bitcoin options market helps traders make better decisions. The current bearish positioning doesn’t guarantee downward movement, but it does highlight market concerns. Successful traders use this information to adjust their strategies rather than following the crowd. Remember these principles when analyzing options data: Options markets often anticipate moves before spot markets Extreme positioning can sometimes precede reversals Always combine options data with other technical and fundamental analysis FAQs: Bitcoin Options Market Questions Answered What does put option premium indicate? When put options trade at a premium, it shows traders are willing to pay more for downside protection, indicating bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin options market. How does implied volatility affect option prices? Higher implied volatility increases option premiums because it suggests larger expected price moves, making both puts and calls more expensive. Why are short-term contracts more volatile? Short-term options in the Bitcoin options market react faster to price movements and news events, making them more sensitive to immediate market conditions. What is gamma positioning? Gamma measures how quickly an option’s delta changes as the underlying price moves. Short gamma positions lose money during volatility expansions. Can options data predict Bitcoin price direction? While the Bitcoin options market provides sentiment indicators, it shouldn’t be used alone for price predictions. Combine it with other analysis methods. How often should I monitor options market data? Regular monitoring of the Bitcoin options market helps identify sentiment shifts, but avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Ripple is exploring exactly that possibility with a groundbreaking proposal to introduce XRP staking to the XRP Ledger. This potential development could fundamentally change how users interact with one of cryptocurrency’s most established networks. What Exactly is XRP Staking and Why Does It Matter? XRP staking represents a potential evolution in how the XRP Ledger operates. Currently, XRP holders cannot earn rewards through traditional staking mechanisms like other cryptocurrencies. However, Ripple’s engineering team, led by J. Ayo Akinyele, is actively discussing how to implement this feature. The proposed XRP staking system would allow token holders to participate in network security while earning rewards. This approach aligns with growing demand for passive income opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. Moreover, it could significantly enhance XRP’s utility within the decentralized finance ecosystem. How Would XRP Staking Benefit the Network? Implementing XRP staking offers multiple advantages for both the network and its participants. First, it creates stronger incentives for long-term holding. Second, it enhances network security by rewarding users who help maintain consensus. Enhanced network security through increased participation Passive income opportunities for XRP holders Improved decentralization of the XRP Ledger Stronger DeFi integration capabilities Therefore, the introduction of XRP staking could address several key challenges facing the network while opening new possibilities for growth. What Challenges Might Ripple Face with XRP Staking Implementation? While the benefits are compelling, implementing XRP staking presents technical and regulatory considerations.

However, the engineering team appears confident they can navigate these challenges successfully. Their approach focuses on maintaining the network’s efficiency while adding staking capabilities. How Could XRP Staking Transform the Cryptocurrency Landscape? The potential introduction of XRP staking represents more than just a feature update—it signals Ripple’s commitment to evolving with market demands. As decentralized finance continues growing, staking capabilities become increasingly valuable. This move could position XRP more competitively against other major cryptocurrencies that already offer staking. Furthermore, it demonstrates Ripple’s proactive approach to enhancing token utility beyond payment functionality. What Does This Mean for Current XRP Holders? For existing XRP investors, the staking proposal offers exciting possibilities. It provides a pathway to generate returns beyond price appreciation. Additionally, it strengthens the fundamental value proposition of holding XRP long-term. New revenue streams without selling tokens Enhanced network participation opportunities Increased token utility and demand drivers Stronger community engagement through active involvement Consequently, the XRP staking feature could fundamentally reshape investment strategies for XRP enthusiasts. Frequently Asked Questions About XRP Staking When will XRP staking become available? No official timeline exists yet. Ripple is currently in discussion and research phases regarding XRP staking implementation. How would XRP staking work technically? While details remain unclear, it would likely involve validating transactions and maintaining network consensus in exchange for rewards. Will XRP staking affect transaction speed?

Dogecoin CBD Points To $0.08 As Strongest Support In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin support is looking from the perspective of the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). The CBD is an indicator created by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode that tells us about the amount of DOGE supply that was last purchased or transacted at the various price levels that the coin has visited in its history. Generally, investors are sensitive to retests of their cost basis and can be prone to showing some kind of reaction during one. The more holders that have their cost basis at the same level, the larger the market reaction upon a retest. Thus, the levels that the CBD identifies as being dense with supply could potentially be significant ones for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Panic: 65,200 BTC Sent To Exchanges At Loss Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Dogecoin CBD over the past couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, a major Dogecoin cost basis level is located around $0.20, hosting the break-even level of 12.1 billion DOGE. The latest bearish momentum, however, has meant that the memecoin has plunged under this mark, putting all these investors into a state of loss. Underwater holders may look forward to a retest of their cost basis so that they can exit with their entire investment back. This can make large supply zones above the asset’s price potential resistance barriers. Considering that the $0.20 level is so huge, it’s possible that DOGE may find notable impedance at it, should a retest take place in the near future. In the scenario that Dogecoin continues to decline, it might have to find support at a major cost basis center below. Such investors who were in profit prior to the retest may decide to buy more at their break-even level, thinking it to be a profitable entry point to accumulate more. From the chart, it’s visible that at the levels below, there aren’t any large cost basis zones until all the way down to $0.08, implying support may be thin for the asset. Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin Now In “Good Buy Zone,” Says Analytics Firm The $0.08 level, though, is extraordinary in the amount of supply that it hosts the acquisition point of: 27.4 billion DOGE. The analyst has noted that this makes the line DOGE’s “most significant support level.” It now remains to be seen how Dogecoin will develop in the near term and whether a retest of one of the big cost basis centers will take place. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.158, down 10% over the last week.

54638417,630667,1763611240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54638417.jpeg,XRP Long-Term Holders Shift From Euphoria to Anxiety as NUPL Signals Trouble,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-long-term-holder-shift-from-euphoria-to-anxiety/,"XRP is under heavy selling pressure as fear spreads across the crypto market, pushing sentiment into one of its most fragile stages of the cycle. What was once a euphoric rally earlier this year has steadily shifted into denial among long-term holders — and now anxiety is beginning to dominate. With XRP flirting dangerously with a drop below the $2 mark, investors are watching closely, aware that this level carries major psychological and structural weight. For now, XRP has managed to hold above $2, but the defense of this threshold is becoming increasingly difficult as liquidity thins and macro uncertainty intensifies. A break below this zone could trigger a deeper reset, while a successful rebound would reinforce it as a key long-term demand area. This shift in sentiment is also reflected in on-chain metrics : long-term holders, previously sitting comfortably in profit, are now watching their unrealized gains compress. Historically, transitions from euphoria to denial and into anxiety have often preceded major market inflection points, making the current moment especially significant. XRP NUPL Signals Growing Market Anxiety Analyst Ali Martinez shared new data showing that XRP’s Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) has now dropped below 0.5 — a level that historically marks a transition from confidence to growing anxiety among holders. NUPL measures the difference between the total unrealized profit and loss in the network, helping identify where investors stand emotionally within the market cycle. When NUPL is above 0.5, it typically reflects optimism or belief, often associated with rising prices and strong conviction. But when it falls below 0.5, sentiment weakens, indicating that investors are no longer comfortably in profit. XRP dipping below this threshold means a significant portion of the market is losing confidence as unrealized gains shrink. Investors who were previously sitting on sizable profits are now seeing those margins erode, pushing them into a more defensive psychological state. Historically, this signals that the market is shifting toward anxiety — a stage where many holders begin doubting whether upside momentum will return. This decline in NUPL aligns with XRP’s current price behavior near the $2 support level, emphasizing how fragile the market has become. While anxiety can fuel panic selling, it has also marked the beginning of long-term accumulation phases in past cycles. The next move for XRP may depend on whether fear intensifies — or whether strong hands step in to absorb supply. Testing Critical Support as Selling Pressure Deepens XRP continues to trade under heavy selling pressure, with the chart showing a clear series of lower highs and persistent failures to reclaim key moving averages. The price is now hovering near $2.14, testing a crucial support zone that has repeatedly acted as a psychological and structural level for buyers throughout the year. Each attempt to break above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages has been met with rejection, signaling that momentum remains firmly on the side of the sellers. Volume has gradually increased during recent downswings, suggesting that the sell-offs are driven more by capitulation than simple profit-taking. The sharp decline toward $1.20 in October still stands out as a sign of extreme volatility and liquidity stress, and although XRP quickly recovered from that anomaly, it highlighted how fragile the market structure had become. Since then, price has failed to establish a sustained uptrend, instead forming a tighter and more compressed consolidation beneath the major moving averages. If the $2 support level breaks decisively, XRP could revisit deeper liquidity pockets around $1.75–$1.90, where buyers previously stepped in during September. However, holding above $2 would keep the possibility of a recovery alive, especially if market sentiment stabilizes.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $77.09 million in net inflows on November 19th, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. This surprising reversal comes at a crucial time for digital asset investors seeking stability and growth opportunities. What Drove This Bitcoin ETFs Inflow Surge? The recent inflow data reveals fascinating patterns about institutional behavior. BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with an impressive $62.23 million inflow, demonstrating strong confidence from major players. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Mini BTC followed closely with $53.84 million, showing diversified interest across different Bitcoin ETFs products. However, the picture wasn’t uniformly positive. Fidelity’s FBTC experienced $21.35 million in outflows, while VanEck’s HODL saw $17.63 million leave. This mixed performance highlights how investors are carefully selecting their Bitcoin ETFs exposure rather than making blanket decisions. Why Should Investors Care About Bitcoin ETFs Movements? Tracking Bitcoin ETFs flows provides crucial insights into institutional sentiment. These investment vehicles have become barometers for professional money managers’ views on cryptocurrency. When Bitcoin ETFs see consistent inflows, it typically indicates: Growing institutional confidence in digital assets Increased mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency Potential price support for Bitcoin markets Enhanced market liquidity and stability How Do Bitcoin ETFs Impact Broader Crypto Markets? The relationship between Bitcoin ETFs and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem is increasingly important. Significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs often precede positive momentum across digital assets. This occurs because institutional money flowing into regulated Bitcoin ETFs products creates a foundation of stability that benefits the entire market. Moreover, the end of the five-day outflow streak suggests that professional investors might be seeing current price levels as attractive entry points. This could signal a broader market recovery ahead, making Bitcoin ETFs a key indicator to watch. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs Investors? Looking forward, several factors could influence Bitcoin ETFs performance. Regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and Bitcoin’s inherent volatility will continue to play significant roles. However, the recent inflow reversal demonstrates the resilience of institutional interest in cryptocurrency through regulated Bitcoin ETFs channels. For investors considering Bitcoin ETFs, this data provides valuable context. The mixed flows among different providers suggest that due diligence remains essential when selecting specific Bitcoin ETFs products for your portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track Bitcoin’s price, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly holding cryptocurrency. Why did Bitcoin ETFs see outflows for five days? Market volatility, profit-taking, and macroeconomic concerns typically drive short-term outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. How significant is $77 million for Bitcoin ETFs? While not massive in isolation, breaking a five-day outflow streak signals important sentiment shifts among institutional investors. Should I invest in Bitcoin ETFs now? Investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and portfolio strategy, though the recent inflow reversal suggests renewed institutional interest. Which Bitcoin ETFs performed best? BlackRock’s IBIT led with $62.23 million inflows, followed by Grayscale’s Mini BTC with $53.84 million. How often do Bitcoin ETFs flow data update?

Technical Signals Show Change in Momentum Analyst Ali Martinez reported a bullish divergence between ADA’s price and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The price has continued to post lower lows, but the RSI is rising. This divergence may reflect a loss of selling strength. A TD Sequential “9” buy signal has also appeared on the daily chart. These setups are often monitored for early trend shifts. Martinez commented, “ A rebound is coming! ” as long as the divergence remains intact. In addition, ADA is trading slightly below its 4-hour 9-period simple moving average (SMA), which stands at $0.47. The asset has moved sideways since mid-November, narrowing its range. This shows that momentum remains weak but stable. Source: TradingView The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and the histogram has reversed to positive. Though the signal is still forming, it implies that the latest sell-off might be losing its strength. On-Chain Flows Remain Negative Recent on-chain data shows continued outflows from spot exchanges. On November 19, net outflows totaled $1.80 million, according to CoinGlass. Traders appear to be withdrawing ADA from exchanges, possibly for long-term holding. Source: CoinGlass Despite these outflows, ADA’s price has continued to fall. This trend points to weak demand, with buyers not stepping in despite the lower available supply. Outflows alone have not supported a recovery in price. Sentiment and Whale Activity Remain Mixed Platform data from Market Prophit shows that public sentiment toward ADA is currently negative, while its internal model indicates a bullish outlook. This reflects a split view across participants.

This persistent trend raises important questions about investor sentiment toward Ethereum-based investment products and their future trajectory in the digital asset space. Why Are ETH ETFs Experiencing Continuous Outflows? The consistent withdrawal pattern from ETH ETFs suggests investors are reevaluating their positions in Ethereum-focused funds. Market analysts point to several potential factors driving this trend, including regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and shifting investment strategies. The seven-day outflow streak represents one of the longest continuous withdrawal periods for cryptocurrency ETFs this year. Data compiled by TraderT reveals the depth of this investor retreat. The outflows aren’t isolated to a single fund but represent a broader market sentiment affecting multiple ETH ETF providers simultaneously. This pattern indicates systemic concerns rather than issues specific to individual fund management. Which ETH ETFs Are Leading the Outflow Trend? The outflow distribution reveals significant concentration among major players: BlackRock’s ETHA led the exodus with $26.14 million in withdrawals Grayscale’s ETHE followed with $15.69 million exiting the fund Invesco’s QETH stood alone with $2.93 million in net inflows All other ETH ETFs reported no net changes in flows This distribution pattern highlights how even established financial giants like BlackRock aren’t immune to the current market sentiment affecting ETH ETFs. The concentration of outflows in these major funds suggests institutional investors might be driving this trend. What Does This Mean for ETH ETF Investors? For current and prospective ETH ETF investors, this seven-day outflow streak serves as a crucial market indicator. The persistent withdrawals could signal several market dynamics at play. However, it’s essential to consider this within the broader context of cryptocurrency market cycles and institutional adoption patterns. Investment professionals recommend monitoring these key aspects when evaluating ETH ETFs during outflow periods: Long-term adoption trends versus short-term market movements Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency funds Overall market liquidity and trading volumes Comparative performance against other digital asset classes Is There Hope for ETH ETFs Recovery? Despite the concerning outflow trend, some positive signals emerged from the November 19 data. Invesco’s QETH managed to attract $2.93 million in net inflows, demonstrating that not all investors are abandoning ETH ETFs. This divergence in performance among different funds suggests that specific fund characteristics and management strategies might influence investor decisions. The current situation with ETH ETFs reflects the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investments. While short-term outflows create headlines, the fundamental value proposition of Ethereum and its ecosystem continues to develop. Institutional interest in blockchain technology and decentralized applications remains strong, potentially supporting future recovery for ETH ETFs. Key Takeaways from the ETH ETFs Outflow Data The seventh consecutive day of outflows from ETH ETFs presents both challenges and opportunities for market participants. The $38.9 million withdrawal on November 19, combined with the preceding six days of outflows, creates a significant pattern that demands attention from investors and analysts alike. However, market veterans understand that cryptocurrency investments often move in cycles. The current outflow trend from ETH ETFs might represent a temporary adjustment rather than a long-term shift in investor sentiment. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the role of ETH ETFs in portfolio diversification and institutional access remains fundamentally important. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the ETH ETFs outflows? The outflows likely resulted from combined factors including market volatility, regulatory concerns, and portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors. How long has this outflow trend been happening? The November 19 outflow marked the seventh consecutive trading day of net withdrawals from ETH ETFs. Which ETH ETF performed best during this period? Invesco’s QETH was the only fund to record net inflows, attracting $2.93 million while others experienced outflows. Should I be concerned about investing in ETH ETFs? Like all investments, ETH ETFs carry risk. The current outflows represent short-term market sentiment rather than fundamental issues with Ethereum’s technology. How do ETH ETFs differ from direct Ethereum ownership? ETH ETFs provide regulated exposure to Ethereum price movements without requiring direct cryptocurrency ownership or storage. Will this outflow trend continue? Market trends are unpredictable, but historical patterns suggest cryptocurrency investments often experience cycles of inflows and outflows.

The Japanese yen’s alarming plunge to a 10-month low has sent shockwaves through currency markets, while other Asian currencies struggle to find stable footing. This developing situation presents both risks and opportunities for informed traders. How Did Asia FX React to the Fed Minutes? The latest Federal Reserve meeting minutes revealed deep divisions among policymakers, creating volatility across Asia FX markets. While most Asian currencies showed initial stability after recent declines, the underlying tension remains palpable. The split within the Fed indicates ongoing debate about the timing and pace of future interest rate adjustments, directly impacting currency valuations worldwide. Why the Yen Hit a 10-Month Low The Japanese yen’s dramatic decline represents one of the most significant movements in recent forex market history. Several factors contributed to this collapse: Diverging monetary policies between Japan and the United States Stronger-than-expected US economic data Bank of Japan’s continued accommodative stance Reduced safe-haven demand amid global market recovery Understanding Forex Market Dynamics Post-Fed Announcement The forex market typically experiences heightened volatility following major central bank announcements. The current situation demonstrates how currency trading strategies must adapt to changing monetary policy expectations. Traders are closely monitoring: Currency Pair Current Trend Key Support Level USD/JPY Bullish 148.50 EUR/JPY Neutral-Bullish 158.00 AUD/USD Bearish 0.6350 USD/CNY Range-bound 7.3000 Currency Trading Strategies in Volatile Markets Successful currency trading during periods of central bank uncertainty requires careful risk management and strategic positioning. The current Asia FX environment demands: Increased position sizing awareness Broader stop-loss placements Focus on fundamental analysis over technical signals Regular monitoring of central bank communications What’s Next for Asian Currencies? The path forward for Asia FX markets depends heavily on several key factors. The Federal Reserve’s eventual policy direction will play a crucial role, but regional economic developments and geopolitical considerations will also influence currency movements. Traders should prepare for continued volatility while watching for potential breakout opportunities. The dramatic movements in Asia FX markets, particularly the yen’s concerning decline, highlight the fragile balance in global currency markets. As central banks navigate complex economic landscapes, currency traders face both significant risks and potential rewards. The divided Fed message serves as a powerful reminder that in forex markets, uncertainty often creates the most compelling opportunities for those prepared to act strategically. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the yen to hit a 10-month low? The yen’s decline resulted from monetary policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan , combined with reduced safe-haven demand. How do Fed minutes affect currency markets? Federal Reserve minutes provide insights into policymakers’ thinking, influencing interest rate expectations and currency valuations globally. Which Asian currencies are most affected by Fed policy? Currencies with high correlation to US interest rates, particularly the Japanese yen, South Korean won, and Singapore dollar, show strongest reactions. What is the outlook for Asia FX markets? Markets expect continued volatility as traders assess the timing of potential Fed rate cuts and regional economic performance. How should traders approach current market conditions? Emphasize risk management, monitor central bank communications closely, and maintain flexibility in trading strategies.

While each asset has seen short-term relief after steep declines, analysts warn that failure to clear nearby hurdles could trigger another leg lower. Bitcoin attempts recovery but faces heavy resistance Bitcoin found support near $88,500 after an extended decline pushed the market leader below the $92,000 threshold earlier in the week. Bears remained active as BTC slipped beneath $93,000 and $92,500, ultimately reaching a low of $88,570. The cryptocurrency has since staged a modest recovery, climbing above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downswing from $93,747 to $88,570. BTC is still trading below $93,000 and remains capped by the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. An additional challenge is forming on the hourly chart: a bearish trend line with resistance near $93,500. Analysts note that even if Bitcoin attempts another recovery wave, selling pressure could reappear near the $92,500 area, which aligns with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline. A successful close above $93,750 would be needed to regain upward momentum, potentially allowing BTC to test $94,500 and even $95,000. Further gains could open the path toward $95,500 and $96,200. However, failure to break the $93,500 barrier may lead to renewed weakness. Immediate support lies at $91,150, followed by a more substantial zone around $90,500. A sustained move below $90,000 would increase downside risks, potentially dragging Bitcoin back toward $88,500. The major support for the asset sits at $86,500, a level that could accelerate losses if breached. Technical indicators reflect a market at a turning point. The hourly MACD is losing momentum in the bearish zone, while the RSI has climbed above 50, signaling an attempt by buyers to regain control. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $92,700. XRP rebound stalls as key technical barriers hold XRP mirrored Bitcoin’s price action, attempting a recovery after dropping sharply below $2.150 and $2.120. A low formed at $2.025, and while the token has since moved higher, it remains capped below the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. The latest rebound brought XRP toward the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline from $2.525 to $2.025, but a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.150 continues to limit upside attempts. A break above this level is viewed as essential for shifting near-term sentiment. The first significant resistance sits at $2.20. If cleared, XRP may rise toward $2.250 and then $2.2750—near the 50% retracement of the recent decline. Further gains could target $2.320, $2.350, and ultimately $2.420, though these levels remain distant given current conditions. On the downside, failure to overcome $2.150 risks another drop. Initial support is located at $2.050, followed by $2.020. A close below $2.020 would expose XRP to deeper losses toward $1.9650 and $1.920, with the potential to extend declines to $1.880. The token was trading at $2.13 at press time. Both Bitcoin and XRP are at critical junctures as traders watch whether recovery efforts can overcome entrenched resistance levels. While momentum indicators suggest attempts at stabilization, the broader trend remains fragile. A rejection at key barriers could reignite selling pressure, leaving the market vulnerable to further downside in the near term.

A Bitwise representative claimed that despite the selling pressure in recent weeks, Bitcoin is still very close to bottoming out and that current prices represent an “opportunity zone for long-term investors.” According to the analyst, the large outflows from Bitcoin ETFs were one of the key drivers of the risk-off movement that began in mid-October. However, there's also a shared view that a return to these funds will accelerate the recovery. Bitwise, noting the continued interest from institutional investors, believes Bitcoin will lead the recovery, just as it has typically led the way in declines. While the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs is seen as a major institutionalization step for the sector, analysts argue that it has a double-edged effect. Greater liquidity also enables faster declines. “New players, hedge funds, and large portfolio managers engaging in arbitrage are entering and exiting the market. This increases volatility, especially during periods of uncertainty,” he said. The longer-term picture is different. Bitwise argues that volatility is declining on a 10-year trend and that Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly institutional asset thanks to new investor profiles entering the market. The company states that asset managers and financial advisors, in particular, are regularly adding Bitcoin to their model portfolios, generating stable and long-term demand. It's reported that there's been a significant slowdown in corporate treasury purchases, which played a significant role in the first half of this year. “This weakening demand was one of the factors that accelerated the decline in October. However, low prices always present an opportunity for long-term institutions,” the report stated. Another focus of the markets is the Fed's interest rate decisions. Despite Bitcoin being described as a “store of value independent of the fiat currency system,” its recent high correlation with macroeconomic expectations has sparked debate. A Bitwise analyst stated that Bitcoin will inevitably be affected by Fed policies in the short term due to its increasing “cyclical dominance” since the pandemic. Related News: Bitcoin Price Continues to Fall - So What's Behind This Relentless Decline? Experts Weigh In The market has largely priced in the possibility of a December interest rate cut. The analyst noted that Bitcoin's recent bottoming at $90,000 and its subsequent recovery alongside other risk assets support this view. While Bitwise hasn't officially announced a target for 2025, it has shared a clear forecast for 2026: $200,000. This expectation is based on the prediction that institutional demand will increase exponentially. The company argues that a broad wave of institutional investors, from industry funds and university endowments to pension funds and corporate balance sheets, is “inevitable.” Harvard's Bitcoin purchase was cited as a symbolic example of this trend. *This is not investment advice.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the world’s leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at $93,017.81 on the Binance USDT market, marking one of the most significant Bitcoin price surge events in recent history. What’s Driving This Massive Bitcoin Price Surge? The cryptocurrency market is experiencing unprecedented momentum as Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory. This Bitcoin price surge represents more than just numbers on a chart—it signals growing institutional confidence and mainstream adoption. Several key factors are contributing to this remarkable performance: Institutional investment continues to pour into Bitcoin ETFs and direct holdings Global economic uncertainty is driving safe-haven asset demand Technological advancements in the Bitcoin network are enhancing utility Regulatory clarity in major markets is boosting investor confidence How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Movement? Breaking the $93,000 level represents a psychological barrier that many analysts considered crucial for sustained bullish momentum. This Bitcoin price surge demonstrates the cryptocurrency’s resilience and growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Moreover, the consistent upward movement suggests strong underlying fundamentals rather than speculative trading alone. The current trading volume on major exchanges like Binance indicates substantial institutional participation. This Bitcoin price surge is particularly noteworthy because it comes amid broader market stability, suggesting organic growth rather than reactionary movements. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For both seasoned traders and new investors, this Bitcoin price surge presents important considerations. The market’s strength at these levels indicates potential for continued growth, but also highlights the importance of strategic planning. Here are key takeaways for investors: Diversification remains crucial despite Bitcoin’s strong performance Risk management strategies should be reviewed and updated regularly Long-term perspective often outperforms short-term trading in volatile markets Stay informed about regulatory developments and market trends Will the Bitcoin Price Surge Continue? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the current market dynamics suggest continued positive momentum. The Bitcoin price surge we’re witnessing is supported by strong fundamentals including: Increasing adoption by traditional financial institutions Growing recognition as an inflation hedge Technological improvements enhancing network efficiency Expanding global acceptance as payment method However, investors should remain cautious and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and while this Bitcoin price surge is impressive, market corrections are natural and expected. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $93,000? The Bitcoin price surge is driven by multiple factors including increased institutional investment, growing mainstream adoption, positive regulatory developments, and global economic conditions favoring alternative assets. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at $93,000? While Bitcoin has reached new highs, many analysts believe there’s still potential for growth. However, investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon, and never invest more than they can afford to lose. How does this Bitcoin price surge compare to previous bull markets? This Bitcoin price surge differs from previous cycles due to greater institutional participation, improved regulatory clarity, and more sophisticated market infrastructure, potentially indicating more sustainable growth. What’s the next major resistance level for Bitcoin? Analysts are watching the $100,000 psychological barrier as the next major milestone, though market movements depend on various economic and regulatory factors. Should I be concerned about a price correction? Price corrections are normal in any financial market. Long-term investors typically focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value rather than short-term price fluctuations. How can I stay updated on Bitcoin price movements?

This update links new state-level exposure, a billion-dollar on-chain transfer and a fragile bounce into one picture of where the market stands. Four Governments Confirm New Channels for Holding Bitcoin Four governments have recently disclosed Bitcoin exposure through mining programs, direct purchases, ETFs and test portfolios. The United Arab Emirates, El Salvador, Luxembourg and the Czech Republic now all appear in public records as nation states with some form of BTC on their books. Four Nations Add Bitcoin Exposure. Source: The Bitcoin Historian In the UAE, blockchain analysts traced several thousand BTC to wallets tied to a government-backed mining operation. The coins come from mined rewards rather than exchange buys, yet the holdings still sit under state control and now show up in on-chain data. El Salvador continues to add Bitcoin directly to its national stash. Officials have announced new acquisitions worth around $100 million in recent weeks, extending a policy of buying BTC during market pullbacks and holding it as part of the country’s long-term strategy. Luxembourg is using a fund structure instead of spot coins. Its Intergenerational Sovereign Wealth Fund plans to place a small share of assets into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and related products, giving the state price exposure while custodians handle the underlying assets. The Czech Republic has taken a more experimental route. The Czech National Bank built a $1 million test portfolio that includes Bitcoin, a U.S. dollar stablecoin and a tokenized deposit. Officials say the basket sits outside formal foreign-exchange reserves and serves mainly as a research tool, yet it still marks disclosed central-bank exposure to BTC. While governments adjust their policies, large holders on-chain are also on the move. Whale Address Receives 10,145 BTC From BitMEX Cold Wallet Meanwhile, on-chain data show a whale address has received 10,145 BTC, valued near $1 billion at recent prices. A portfolio view for address 3JBM969wvpxEnfYLQ3LYayB3DVk52ZZpGq records a single inflow of 10.145K BTC from a BitMEX cold wallet roughly five hours ago, placing the full stack under that wallet’s control. Satoshi Era Whale 10,145 BTC Move. Source: 0xNobler As a result, traders are already debating whether the move signals long-term accumulation or simple internal rebalancing. The transfer has also revived speculation about whether a “Satoshi-era” holder is positioning for a market bottom, even though the transaction alone does not reveal the whale’s strategy. Analyst Says Bitcoin Bounce Shows Early Stabilization but Volatility Remains Elevated Bitcoin’s rebound h as offered the first signs of stabilization, even as volatility stays elevated, according to analyst Michaël van de Poppe. He noted that the recent drop left markets “overextended to the downside,” and the latest bounce reflects early attempts to find footing in a key support zone. Bitcoin Support Zone Analysis. Source: CryptoMichNL At the same time, he cautioned that reversals rarely happen quickly. Poppe expects Bitcoin to move sideways for a period as the market builds a new base following the sharp decline. The chart shows liquidity already cleared below recent lows, leaving room for consolidation before any sustained upward move can begin. He added that the current price region remains attractive for long-term positioning, emphasizing that accumulation in this zone could prove beneficial over the coming years.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 05:26:24

Pseudonymous crypto market analyst Axel Bitblaze has now found that the asset’s latest decline appears to be forming the pattern seen in the first quarter of 2025, when the asset topped in January and fell 17% while the S&P 500 continued to hit new highs. At the time, he noted that many believed Bitcoin was simply cooling off. However, four weeks later, the S&P 500 also peaked, and both markets plunged in tandem, which ended up triggering a six-week stretch in which BTC dropped 25% and the index slid 21%. One Last Bearish Trigger? Bitblaze argued that current conditions look strikingly similar. Bitcoin peaked on October 6 and has already fallen about 18% in recent weeks, while the S&P 500 has only now begun to turn lower. According to this breakdown, the sequence resembles the same cycle – Bitcoin begins to fall early without a clear bearish catalyst; equities continue to rise because they typically lag; investors eventually sense broader weakness and stocks break down; BTC’s sell-off briefly intensifies; Bitcoin regains strength sooner than equities; a final market spill follows; and then a reversal takes shape. Bitblaze said the market is likely in phase three or four of this pattern, with most of Bitcoin’s downside already realized. The analyst added that if markets are waiting for one last bearish trigger, it may already be forming, while pointing to rising Japanese bond yields, liquidity pressures at smaller US banks, and market sensitivity to rumors involving high-profile political figures. As such, the current downturn is mostly tied to the first two factors, which are potentially “slow burn” problems that often erupt without warning. “So yeah… feels like we’re close to the end of the damage, not the start. But one more shakeout wouldn’t surprise me at all.” Bearish Forces Still Dominate Despite a slight improvement in short-term signals, another analyst, Axel Adler Junior, believes the BTC market structure remains clearly bearish. The fast version of the Bull-Bear Structure Index has climbed from a critical reading of -41.89 on November 17 to -27.82, which indicates that bearish pressure has eased as prices stabilize near $91,000. However, he noted that the indicator is still well below the -25% threshold, and shows negative taker flow, derivatives pressure, and ETF outflows continue to dominate. Meanwhile, the slow, smoothed version of the index has weakened further after falling from -14.04 to -21.90, which means that deeper structural bearish trends are still gaining strength. Additionally, Coinbase Premium Gap has dropped to -$90, which happens to be one of its lowest levels this year. This signals weakened institutional participation. The premium typically rises when major players accumulate BTC, but the current negative reading shows retail-dominated trading on Binance is setting the tone.

At the same time, analysts expect the end of the US government shutdown to pave the way for a surge of new crypto ETF approvals in 2026. Even though current ETFs are dealing with major outflows and pressure on prices, some analysts believe a new regulatory cycle could lead to renewed institutional participation and innovation in the sector. ADIC Expands Bitcoin Position The Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC) escalated its exposure to Bitcoin by almost tripling its holdings in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) during the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg report . The move is being interpreted as a strong signal that institutional appetite for digital assets is still strong across the United Arab Emirates, even during a turbulent period for Bitcoin’s price. ADIC is an investment arm of Mubadala Investment Company, and reportedly increased its IBIT position from 2.4 million shares to nearly 8 million by the end of September. At the time, the position was valued at around $520 million based on IBIT’s closing price of $65 per share. The buying spree happened just before a dramatic surge in Bitcoin that pushed the asset to an all-time high of above $126,000 on Oct. 5. Since then, Bitcoin has retreated sharply, and recently even fell below $90,000 before stabilizing close to $92,089. This downturn dragged IBIT’s price down as well, with the ETF closing Wednesday at $50.71, This is roughly 23% lower than its value at the end of Q3. iShares Bitcoin Trus ETF price (Source: Google Finance ) Despite the pullback, many in the industry see ADIC’s aggressive accumulation as a clear sign of long-term conviction. The council told Bloomberg that it views Bitcoin as the digital equivalent of gold, which is a narrative that is increasingly embraced by institutional allocators looking for alternative stores of value. M2 treasury manager Zayed Aleem described the move as “fantastic to see,” and argued that it is a big step forward for the UAE to become a global digital-asset hub. Crypto commentator MartyParty also called ADIC’s position a strategic play on Bitcoin’s long-term store-of-value role. However, IBIT’s recent performance raised eyebrows. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the fund is currently undergoing an “ugly stretch,” and pointed to a wave of outflows that has intensified alongside Bitcoin’s price correction. On Tuesday, IBIT logged its largest single-day outflow since launch at $523.2 million, which contributed to $3.3 billion in outflows from Bitcoin ETFs over the past month. Despite this, year-to-date flows are still strong at +$25 billion, and since its January 2024 launch, IBIT has accumulated over $63 million in net inflows. For now, analysts are still split on Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. Some warn of sustained volatility, while others argue that the current range represents a prime accumulation opportunity. Analysts See ETF Boom Ahead Meanwhile, the end of the US government shutdown and the return to a normal legislative calendar could open the door to a wave of new crypto ETF approvals in 2026, according to several market analysts. Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan told CNBC that demand for crypto ETFs and exchange-traded products is “huge,” and he expects a major expansion of offerings once the SEC resumes a full regulatory pace. Hougan predicted a surge of more than 100 new products, ranging from single-asset funds to index-based crypto ETPs. He explained that index-focused products will likely become especially popular as investors look for simple, passive ways to gain exposure to the digital asset market. Matt Hougan’s interview with CNBC However, the current ETF environment is still a bit challenging. Despite strong investor interest, crypto ETFs have been facing major outflows that are adding even more pressure to already-weakened cryptocurrency prices. Canary Capital’s new XRP ETF, XRPC launched on Thursday with $58 million in first-day trading volume, but XRP still fell roughly 13% over the past week. Bitcoin ETFs are showing similar strain, with around $1.1 billion in outflows so far in November, putting them on track for their worst month since launch. Bitcoin’s drop below the average ETF cost basis of roughly $89,600 left many ETF investors holding unrealized losses. Analysts noticed that Bitcoin ETF holders largely stayed resilient through October’s market crash, with only about $1 billion in outflows following the sell-off. Eric Balchunas said long-term Bitcoin whales, rather than ETF retail investors, were responsible for most selling pressure in October and early November. Since then, the market downturn has deepened and ETF outflows have continued to accelerate. Despite this, some analysts are still optimistic that renewed regulatory activity in 2026 could unlock a fresh phase of ETF innovation and institutional participation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 05:30:00

This strategic move represents a significant leap forward for institutional participation in blockchain-based finance. But what makes this USDG0 stablecoin integration so revolutionary for the RWA sector? Why USDG0 Stablecoin Marks a Turning Point for RWAs The USDG0 stablecoin brings something crucial to the table that previous solutions lacked: regulatory clarity combined with advanced technical infrastructure. Built on LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, this USDG0 stablecoin offers seamless cross-chain functionality while maintaining the regulatory compliance that institutions demand. This combination addresses two major hurdles that have traditionally slowed institutional adoption. Plume’s decision to integrate the USDG0 stablecoin signals a maturation of the entire RWA ecosystem. The platform recognizes that for real-world assets to truly flourish on-chain, they need stable, regulated settlement layers. The USDG0 stablecoin provides exactly this foundation, enabling more sophisticated financial instruments and smoother transactions. How Does This USDG0 Stablecoin Integration Benefit Investors? The adoption of USDG0 stablecoin brings multiple advantages to the Plume ecosystem: Enhanced regulatory compliance through Paxos’ established framework Improved cross-chain interoperability via LayerZero technology Greater institutional confidence in RWA transactions Reduced settlement risks with regulated stablecoin infrastructure Expanded accessibility to real-world asset investments This USDG0 stablecoin integration means that institutions can now participate in RWA markets with the same level of regulatory comfort they experience in traditional finance. The move demonstrates how seriously Plume is taking institutional requirements while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized finance. What Challenges Does the USDG0 Stablecoin Overcome? Traditional RWA platforms have struggled with several key issues that the USDG0 stablecoin directly addresses. Regulatory uncertainty has been a major barrier, with many institutions hesitant to engage with unregulated stablecoins. The USDG0 stablecoin, being Paxos-issued, brings established regulatory oversight that changes this dynamic completely. Technical limitations have also hampered previous efforts. The Omnichain Fungible Token standard underlying the USDG0 stablecoin eliminates fragmentation across different blockchain networks. This means assets can move seamlessly between ecosystems while maintaining their value and properties – a crucial requirement for sophisticated financial operations. The Future Impact of USDG0 Stablecoin Adoption Looking ahead, the integration of USDG0 stablecoin could catalyze several important developments. We may see increased institutional capital flowing into RWA markets as compliance concerns diminish. The proven success of this USDG0 stablecoin implementation could also encourage other platforms to follow Plume’s lead, creating a domino effect across the industry. Moreover, the technical foundation provided by the USDG0 stablecoin opens doors to more complex financial products. Think tokenized real estate, compliant securities trading, and institutional-grade lending protocols – all operating with the stability and regulatory clarity that the USDG0 stablecoin provides. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Blockchain Participation The adoption of USDG0 stablecoin by Plume represents more than just another partnership announcement. It signals the beginning of a new phase where regulated, institutional-grade infrastructure becomes the standard rather than the exception. This move demonstrates that the blockchain industry is maturing rapidly, addressing real-world needs with sophisticated solutions like the USDG0 stablecoin that balance innovation with compliance. Frequently Asked Questions What is the USDG0 stablecoin? The USDG0 stablecoin is a regulated digital currency issued by Paxos and built on LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, designed for cross-chain functionality and institutional use. Why is Plume adopting USDG0? Plume is integrating USDG0 to expand regulated stablecoin infrastructure within its RWA ecosystem and facilitate greater institutional participation in real-world asset markets. How does USDG0 differ from other stablecoins? USDG0 combines Paxos’ regulatory compliance with LayerZero’s cross-chain technology, making it uniquely suited for institutional RWA applications that require both regulatory clarity and technical interoperability. What benefits does USDG0 bring to RWA markets? The stablecoin provides regulated settlement layers, reduced counterparty risk, improved cross-chain functionality, and greater institutional confidence in blockchain-based real-world asset transactions. When will USDG0 be fully integrated into Plume? While the announcement has been made, specific timeline details for full integration are typically released gradually as development milestones are achieved. Can retail investors access USDG0 through Plume? While primarily designed for institutional use, the integration aims to benefit the entire ecosystem, though specific access details may vary based on jurisdictional regulations.

Market sentiment remains mixed, but there is now more clear liquidity shifting toward projects displaying transparency in development, practical utility, and community engagement. Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana have each seen notable technical setups, while early stage PayFi project Remittix has emerged on the radar for its real-world payment architecture and fast-paced presale progress. As market volatility begins to pick up, longer-term investors are assessing which digital assets represent the most sound fundamentals and credible roadmaps. Below is a look at the best crypto to buy now as traders diversify beyond Bitcoin. 1. Remittix (RTX) Remittix stands out from the sea of projects as investors rotate to utility-driven assets, and it secures a top position on this list due to a focus on real-world financial infrastructure rather than speculative momentum. The project is building a full PayFi ecosystem that integrates crypto-to-fiat transfers, remittances, and daily payments into one seamless application targeted at the 19 trillion USD global payments market. The presale continues to accelerate, now with total funds raised at 28,165,960.66 USD and 686,111,564.44 tokens sold at a price of 0.1166 USD. This steady growth reflects the rise in demand from crypto investors who value transparency, potential adoption, and verified development practices. One of Remittix’s core strengths is its live beta wallet , which allows users to test early PayFi functions ahead of the full launch. Development updates are informed directly by community feedback, reinforcing a practical user centered approach. Security remains a major focus, with Remittix completing both a CertiK audit and full team KYC verification. The project has also confirmed multiple upcoming CEX listings, including BitMart, strengthening its long term accessibility. With its clear financial utility and structured development timeline, Remittix stands out as one of the best crypto presales to buy now. Key RTX Features • 28.16 million USD raised in the presale • 686 million tokens sold • CertiK audited and KYC verified team • Beta wallet live and actively updated • Crypto to fiat conversions, transfers, and payments in one app • Multiple CEX listings secured, including BitMart • Targeting the global payments market 2. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, while remaining one of the foundational assets to the crypto market, recent price movement shows signs of short-term weakness. ETH changeS hands for 2,941.11 USD, down 6.76 percent in the past 24 hours, with a market capitalization of 354.5 billion USD. Trading volume is 32.3 billion USD, down 36.91 percent as investors scale back for the time being. Ethereum needs to recover the 3,200 USD level to set up a meaningful recovery, says Innovator of Afrika. In that respect, a move above this threshold can re-open upside targets between 3,400-3,600 USD. As the biggest smart contract platform, Ethereum remains particularly integral to blockchain technology. It powers thousands of decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces-core components of Web3 development. The architecture also sees growing institutional adoption-with staking infrastructure and layer 2 scaling networks in place to better facilitate efficiency. Ethereum’s strong network effects and further developing ecosystem keep long-term investors tuned in. Short-term market sentiment may remain conservative, but Ethereum is one of the best altcoins anyone can buy now, especially for those wanting digital asset exposure with true sustainable utility. 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is presenting an important technical setup as it enters what analysts describe as the final corrective leg. Currently, the asset changes hands at 0.4523 USD, down 5.99 percent in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of 16.22 billion USD. Trading volume has jumped significantly to 847.92 million USD, up 34.82 percent, indicating a growing interest by traders. According to analysis by GainMuse, ADA is interacting with a crucial demand block close to the 0.45 USD level, which has consistently absorbed sell side pressure. If the support can hold, it might form a recovery towards the upper trendline, while a deeper dip might delay progress given that the token is still in a falling channel. Cardano remains a favorite project among longer-term crypto investors because of its academic development model, peer-reviewed research framework, and keen focus on secure, scalable blockchain technology. The network continues to grow in smart contract functionality, opening up fresh use cases in DeFi, identity solutions, and on-chain governance. While the short-term price structure for ADA is cautious, the longer-term fundamentals of this project continue to be attractive to those investors who like their blockchain platforms to grow more slowly and methodically rather than in volatile, hype-driven jumps. Cardano’s disciplined approach makes it a notable contender among today’s best crypto to buy now. 4. Solana (SOL) Solana is maintaining investor attention as it attempts to stabilize after retesting a key structural boundary. SOL is priced at 133.08 USD, down 5.57 percent in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of 73.78 billion USD and trading volume at 5.24 billion USD, down 40.89 percent. Recent analysis from GainMuse indicates that Solana produced a bullish daily candle after tagging the lower boundary of its descending channel, suggesting early signs of strength. Analysts note that a failure to hold above recent reaction lows could delay a potential climb toward the 160 USD region. Solana remains one of the most active and developer friendly smart contract ecosystems in the cryptocurrency market. Its high throughput, low transaction fees, and growing network of decentralized finance applications have made it a popular choice for blockchain developers and Web3 builders. Solana’s ability to deliver fast, scalable performance supports growing interest from both institutional and retail crypto investors. Although market fluctuations continue, Solana maintains strong long term potential and stands as one of the best altcoins to buy now as investors rotate out of Bitcoin and explore faster, application driven networks.

Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, commented, “We’re rolling out easy access to DEX trading in Brazil now in the Coinbase app. Our US users have been enjoying this product and are excited to bring it to new markets! Onchain trading is getting more and more accessible.” The DeFi Mullet service first launched in the US on October 8 to streamline the DeFi experience. Armstrong, at the time, had pledged to expand to other countries and networks. Crypto community members describe Coinbase’s decision as promising In its Wednesday press release, Coinbase explained that its DEX integration eliminates the typical DeFi complications and provides a seamless, straightforward path into onchain trading. The firm also wrote, “Using our DEX integration, users can trade on popular DEXs, like Aerodrome and Uniswap, without leaving the familiar ease of the Coinbase interface. When users submit a trade, DEX aggregators automatically scan the available liquidity across top DEXs to find the best prices.” Moreover, with a self-custody wallet, people can trade without being charged by the network, while still retaining complete control over their tokens, it added. However, it hasn’t yet shared a date for the Brazil launch. Aibra, an X user, commented on Coinbase’s decision, expressing approval of its path forward while suggesting more alignment with the Base app is needed. He noted the campaign could have included deposits from a Base app wallet without issue. Another commenter noted that Coinbase’s development into new markets was encouraging, adding that it shows global ambitions are taking shape. One by the domain name Alex Dulub, remarked , “Great to see this expanding! Every time onchain access reaches a new market, the expectations around reliability and safety rise with it. That is how real adoption compounds.” Brazil is still to implement a new regulatory framework for crypto assets by February 2026. The country’s central bank rolled out new anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing rules aimed at cracking down on illegal activity. Once enforced, all virtual asset service providers, including custodians and intermediaries, will be required to secure authorization from the central bank to operate their businesses. Crypto providers must also follow strict guidelines on transparency, governance, internal controls, and cybersecurity—similar to those expected of banks. Despite the regulatory developments, Brazil has become one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets in Latin America, with its adoption rate steadily increasing over the past few years. More than 10% of the country’s population already owns some form of digital asset, according to recent data, a figure above the global average. Interest is soaring as concerns about inflation, currency volatility, and a growing fintech ecosystem make accessing cryptocurrency easier than ever. The country is evaluating whether to tax international crypto transactions as it prepares to implement the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, which is now backed by over 70 nations. Coinbase’s stock has dropped by over 25% in October In Q3, Coinbase reported that Base saw growing use across trading, payments, lending, and social platforms, and also introduced Flashblocks for ultra-fast block confirmations of 200ms. The company is steadily building a Bitcoin treasury, increasing its holdings by 2,772 BTC in the third quarter to a total of 14,548 BTC, currently valued at $1.3 billion. Its net income surged to $432.6 million, more than five times higher than a year ago, as revenue rose 55% to $1.9 billion. Despite earlier gains, Coinbase stock has fallen 25.2% in the past month to $257.29, trading almost at its 2025 starting level, compared with MARA and Strategy, which are down 33.8% and 35.6%.

The massive Bitcoin withdrawal from BitGo involves 1,300 BTC valued at approximately $120 million, all moving within just six hours. This enormous transaction has cryptocurrency analysts and investors buzzing with questions about what this could mean for the market. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal Mean? The blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain first spotted this significant activity. The new address, starting with 3AXFhi, began moving these substantial funds in a coordinated pattern. This Bitcoin withdrawal represents one of the largest single movements from a major custodian like BitGo in recent months. The timing and scale of this transaction have naturally raised eyebrows across the crypto community. When we see a Bitcoin withdrawal of this magnitude, several questions immediately come to mind. Is this an institutional player repositioning assets? Could it be a whale preparing for a major market move? The concentrated nature of this Bitcoin withdrawal suggests careful planning rather than random activity. Why Are Large Bitcoin Withdrawals Significant? Major Bitcoin withdrawals often signal important market developments. Here’s what makes this particular transaction so noteworthy: Market Impact Potential : $120 million represents substantial buying or selling power Custodian Behavior : Movements from established platforms like BitGo carry different weight than exchange transfers Timing Patterns : The six-hour window suggests urgency or specific timing requirements Address History : The new address lacking transaction history adds mystery This Bitcoin withdrawal follows a pattern we’ve observed with institutional players who often move large sums in coordinated batches. However, the complete anonymity of the receiving address makes this case particularly intriguing. How Do Major Bitcoin Withdrawals Affect Market Sentiment? Large-scale Bitcoin withdrawals can influence market psychology in several ways. When substantial amounts leave custodial services, it often indicates one of two scenarios: either investors are moving to cold storage for long-term holding, or they’re preparing to deploy capital elsewhere. This specific Bitcoin withdrawal comes at a time when the market is particularly sensitive to large movements. The cryptocurrency community is closely watching how this Bitcoin withdrawal might affect: Short-term price volatility Exchange liquidity levels Institutional investment patterns Market confidence indicators Historical data shows that massive Bitcoin withdrawals often precede significant price movements, though the direction isn’t always predictable. What Should Investors Watch After This Bitcoin Withdrawal? Following this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal, market participants should monitor several key indicators. Track whether the withdrawn Bitcoin remains in the new address or gets distributed to multiple wallets. Observe if similar large Bitcoin withdrawals occur from other major custodians. Watch for any unusual trading patterns that might connect to this movement. The most crucial aspect is understanding that while individual transactions can be dramatic, they form part of larger market patterns. This Bitcoin withdrawal, while impressive, should be considered alongside other market fundamentals and technical indicators. Key Takeaways from This Major Bitcoin Movement This $120 million Bitcoin withdrawal serves as a powerful reminder of several cryptocurrency market realities. Large players continue to move significant amounts, demonstrating ongoing institutional interest. The efficiency of blockchain technology enables tracking of these substantial movements in real-time. Most importantly, single transactions rarely tell the complete story – context and follow-up activity provide the full picture. As we continue monitoring this Bitcoin withdrawal and its aftermath, remember that cryptocurrency markets thrive on both transparency and mystery. The ability to track transactions publicly while maintaining participant privacy creates the dynamic environment that makes this space so fascinating. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin withdrawal? A Bitcoin withdrawal refers to moving Bitcoin from one wallet or exchange to another. This particular Bitcoin withdrawal involved transferring funds from BitGo’s custodial services to a new external address. Why is this Bitcoin withdrawal significant? This Bitcoin withdrawal is notable due to its large size ($120 million), the short time frame (6 hours), and the mystery surrounding the receiving address, which had no previous transaction history. How can I track large Bitcoin transactions? You can monitor large Bitcoin withdrawals using blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or specialized analytics platforms like Lookonchain, which detected this particular transaction. Does a large Bitcoin withdrawal always affect prices? Not necessarily. While large Bitcoin withdrawals can indicate major player movements, price impact depends on whether the Bitcoin gets sold, held, or redistributed to other addresses. What is BitGo? BitGo is a leading digital asset trust company and security platform that provides custodial services for institutional investors holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Should I be concerned about large Bitcoin withdrawals? Large Bitcoin withdrawals are normal market activity. While interesting to observe, they typically represent portfolio management rather than market manipulation when occurring from regulated custodians.

The token traded in a tight range as some dip buyers returned, but crypto volumes stayed cautious with traders still wary of macro risk and the next batch of US data. The dollar edged higher ahead of a long-delayed jobs report, keeping risk appetite contained even as equities bounced.

Speaking to Fox Business, Saylor argued that Bitcoin’s price swings have actually narrowed over time as institutional adoption has increased. “We are getting a lot less volatility,” he said, adding that “Bitcoin is stronger than ever.” Michael @Saylor has pushed back against concerns that Wall Street’s growing presence in Bitcoin has amplified the asset’s volatility. #Strategy #Bitcoin https://t.co/ttN5ApxrDY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 19, 2025 AI Chip Optimism Fuels Asia Equity Surge With Japan And Korea Leading Gains Equity markets took their cue from Nvidia. Tech-heavy markets in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan led the charge after chief executive Jensen Huang talked up powerful demand for the firm’s AI chips from major cloud providers and brushed aside worries about an AI bubble. MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 1.2%, rebounding from a one month low, while futures linked to the S&P 500 climbed roughly 1.3%. Wall Street had already snapped a four day losing streak on Wednesday as investors began to question whether the latest anxiety over AI valuations had gone too far. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped around 3.2% and South Korea’s Kospi surged about 2.6 per cent, fuelled by sharp gains in chipmakers and tech suppliers tied to Nvidia’s boom. Names such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Advantest rallied between 4%-9% in local trade. SoftBank Group gained about 3.5% even after fully exiting its stake in Nvidia in October, reflecting the broader bid for tech risk. Weakness In Chinese Tech And EV Names Leaves Hong Kong Trailing Regional Gains Not every market joined the party. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped around 0.1% and a key mainland gauge erased an earlier rise of roughly 0.7% to trade flat, with losses in electric vehicle makers and mixed moves in Chinese tech firms. Xiaomi continued to fall after signalling higher global smartphone prices because of rising chip costs, while worries about slowing EV demand after the expiry of subsidies kept pressure on the sector. Attention now turns back to Washington. Investors are waiting for September’s delayed jobs report, due later in the global session, to gauge the health of the US labour market and the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Minutes from the Fed’s October meeting, released on Wednesday, showed policymakers cut interest rates while warning that moving too far could risk entrenched inflation and a loss of public trust in the central bank.

As Ethereum continues to evolve beyond just a cryptocurrency into a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem, investors worldwide are asking the critical question: Can ETH realistically reach $10,000? Our comprehensive Ethereum price prediction analysis examines the technical indicators, market fundamentals, and emerging trends that could propel ETH to new heights by 2030. What Factors Influence Ethereum Price Prediction? Understanding ETH price analysis requires examining multiple dimensions. The transition to proof-of-stake through Ethereum 2.0 has fundamentally changed the network’s economics. Reduced issuance and increased staking rewards create structural support for higher prices. Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are driving adoption while reducing transaction costs, making Ethereum more accessible to millions of new users. Technical Analysis for Ethereum Forecast Our cryptocurrency forecast methodology combines traditional technical analysis with blockchain-specific metrics. Key resistance levels at $4,000 and $6,800 represent significant psychological barriers. The 200-week moving average has consistently provided strong support during market downturns. On-chain data reveals that long-term holder accumulation accelerates during price corrections, indicating strong conviction among institutional investors. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Key Indicators Indicator Current Status Bullish Signal RSI Neutral Not overbought MACD Positive Upward momentum Volume Increasing Growing interest Staking Ratio 25% Reduced selling pressure Market Trends Driving ETH Value The evolving Ethereum market trends showcase several positive developments. Institutional adoption through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations continues to grow. The DeFi ecosystem, despite occasional setbacks, maintains Ethereum’s position as the dominant smart contract platform. NFT markets, while volatile, demonstrate Ethereum’s cultural relevance beyond pure financial applications. 2025-2030 Price Projections: Realistic Expectations Our Ethereum price prediction model considers three primary scenarios: Conservative: $6,500-$8,000 by 2025 Moderate: $8,000-$12,000 by 2027 Bullish: $15,000+ by 2030 The path to $10,000 requires sustained network growth, continued institutional adoption, and favorable regulatory developments. Each successful Ethereum upgrade improves scalability and reduces environmental concerns, addressing key criticisms that previously limited mainstream acceptance. Risks and Challenges in ETH Price Analysis While our ETH price analysis remains optimistic, several challenges could impact the trajectory. Regulatory uncertainty remains the single largest risk factor. Competition from alternative layer-1 blockchains continues to intensify. Technological risks associated with complex upgrades could create temporary setbacks. However, Ethereum’s first-mover advantage and robust developer community provide significant defensive characteristics. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on our comprehensive cryptocurrency forecast , strategic accumulation during market corrections appears prudent. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to Ethereum’s long-term potential. Monitoring key technical levels and fundamental developments helps investors make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions to short-term price movements. Conclusion: The Path to $10,000 Ethereum’s journey to $10,000 represents more than just price appreciation—it symbolizes the maturation of decentralized technology into mainstream finance. While the path may include volatility and temporary setbacks, the fundamental case for Ethereum’s long-term growth remains compelling. The combination of technological innovation, growing adoption, and evolving tokenomics creates a foundation for sustained value creation that could potentially exceed even the most optimistic Ethereum price prediction models.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-binance-announces-it-will-support-this-altcoins-network-upgrade-here-are-the-details-8/,"Binance has announced that it will temporarily halt certain transactions on November 20, 2025, to support a planned upgrade to the THORChain (RUNE) network. Binance to Support THORChain (RUNE) Network Upgrade: Transactions to Be Temporarily Suspended on November 20 As part of the preparation for technical work to maintain the highest level of user experience, the exchange will suspend deposits and withdrawals for all tokens on the THORChain network as of 20:00. The network upgrade is expected to occur around 9:00 PM, once block height 23,761,879 is reached. Binance emphasized that all technical steps necessary for the upgrade process will be handled automatically by the exchange, eliminating the need for users to perform any manual actions. According to the statement made by the exchange, trading of tokens on the THORChain network will not be affected during the upgrade and spot trading pairs will continue to operate normally. Binance will reactivate deposits and withdrawals once the upgrade is complete and the network is confirmed to be stable. No further announcements will be made for this phase. While THORChain's upcoming network update is stated to aim to increase network functionality and performance, the support provided by Binance in this process is critical to protecting users' asset security. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s Days Under $90K May Be Over,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/the-final-dip-bitcoins-days-under-90k-may-be-over/,"Bitcoin slid below the $92,000 mark on Wednesday, trading at $91,500 at press time after a one-day drop of 5% that left the token down 17% in the last 30 days. Related Reading: With 42% Of XRP Holders Underwater, Analysts Say The Altcoin Could Crash Even Further Market players were rattled after a stretch of heavy swings that began with a peak early in October. According to market trackers, price pressure has pushed sentiment into deep fear as investors reassess risk. Winklevoss Sees Opportunity According to posts on X by Cameron Winklevoss, prices under $90,000 may not last long. “This is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy bitcoin below $90k!” he said. Cameron and his brother Tyler have long compared Bitcoin to modern gold and have suggested it could one day reach $1 million, a view that frames the current pullback as a buy window rather than a lasting setback. Some industry leaders echoed that view, calling the fall a chance for long-term buyers to accumulate. This is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy bitcoin below $90k! — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) November 18, 2025 October Shock Still Echoes Bitcoin’s recent slide followed a new high of $126,200 on October 6, 2025, and heavy liquidations four days later that erased close to $20 billion in leveraged positions. Analysts tracking market cycles say this pullback fits a common pattern after the April 2024 halving, with major peaks often arriving 400–600 days afterward. Reports from The Kobeissi Letter suggest much of the current weakness looks like a routine unwinding of margin positions rather than a collapse in underlying demand. Whales Are Accumulating According to Glassnode, wallets holding 1,000 BTC rose from 1,354 on October 27 to 1,384 on November 17, an increase of 2.5%. At the same time, smaller holders moved away; addresses with less than one BTC dropped from 980,577 to 977,420 in the same period. Markus Thielen of 10X Research said large holders have been buying while absorbing selling pressure. Some of the buying activity has been quietly taking place, and it is being watched closely by analysts.

Here’s how the figure compares for Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP Retail Realized Price Puts Profit Margin Around 60% In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how retail profitability compares between the top assets in the sector: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Retail investors refer to the smallest of entities in the market, who don’t hold a significant balance on an individual level (typically less than $1,000). To calculate the profit-loss balance of this cohort, Glassnode has made use of the Realized Price indicator. The Realized Price measures the average cost basis or acquisition level of a given segment of the network. When the asset’s spot price trades above this level, it means the group is in a state of net unrealized gain. On the other hand, it being under the metric implies the dominance of loss among the cohort members. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price for the retail investors on the XRP network: As displayed in the above graph, XRP has witnessed bearish price action recently, but its price still has a notable gap over the Realized Price of the retail entities. More specifically, this group is in an average profit of 60% right now. Ethereum retail holders are also in the green, but their profitability isn’t quite as good, sitting at 40%. Both XRP and Ethereum, however, pale in comparison to Bitcoin. Even after the price crash , BTC retail addresses are still in an average profit of more than 100%. Now, what are retail investors doing with their profits? On-chain analytics firm Santiment has shed light on the matter in an X post . As the chart below for the holdings of this cohort shows, selling has occurred on all three networks recently. Bitcoin retail was accumulating until the latest price plunge, but this bearish wave has spooked them into selling 0.36% of their supply over the last five days, which is the highest rate of distribution in two months. Ethereum retail has been exiting for a while now, and the trend has only continued during the past month as the cohort’s holdings have gone down by 0.90%. XRP’s small hands have shown a more mixed behavior, first participating in a sharp selloff, and then following on with slight accumulation. Overall, the group’s supply is down 1.38% since the start of November. “Prices move the opposite direction of small wallets’ behavior,” noted Santiment. “So we’re keeping an eye on retail traders continuing to panic sell as a positive sign for crypto’s recovery.” XRP Price XRP has fallen alongside the rest of the market as its price has returned to $2.13.",XRP|bitcoin|btc|ETH|Ethereum|XRP Profit|XRP Retail|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 06:00:34

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-the-pendulum-has-swung-in-xrps-favour-heres-why/,"XRP spent years facing doubt from traders and analysts. Many expected that institutional interest would remain limited. That expectation is now fading. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto commentator on X, highlighted this change. He shared a recent discussion between Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and Scott Melker. His post pointed to a clear shift in tone as the industry begins to treat XRP as a serious focus. It’s crazy watching the narrative flip in real-time… They were skeptical of $XRP for YEARS now they're openly calling the XRP community “huge, committed, and excited The pendulum has swung. The tone shifted from “XRP? Nah” ➜ to “XRP is a priority focus. pic.twitter.com/4QCulzm1W3 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 16, 2025 A Clear Change From Industry Leaders In the video he shared, Melker dubbed XRP’s base a “huge community that is excited.” Hougan described XRP as “a reasonable project.” He said he is not surprised that recent XRP product launches show strong engagement because there are people who love XRP. The remarks showed how sentiment has moved. Hougan acknowledged that some crypto investors still view XRP with skepticism. However, he stressed that this does not affect the asset’s momentum. He pointed to a huge committed community that continues to drive demand. Xaif used the conversation to show how different the market now sounds compared to previous years. The language has shifted from hesitation to recognition. Institutional Entry Builds Ahead of a Key Launch This moment arrives as Bitwise prepares to launch its XRP ETF between November 19 and 20. The firm plans to enter the market with the lowest fee among competing XRP funds. The pricing is a deliberate move to capture early interest from investors seeking efficient exposure. It also shows Bitwise’s confidence in the asset’s demand profile. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Xaif’s post ties this development into the larger trend. XRP is no longer treated as a fringe product. Major firms are positioning themselves to compete for market share . The timing, combined with rising institutional attention, marks the real change in how XRP fits into the wider investment landscape. Community Support Shapes the Asset’s Momentum Community support remains central to this shift. Both Hougan and Melker acknowledged the active and loyal XRP user base. Their remarks align with what long-time holders have demonstrated through years of market cycles. As Xaif noted, “It’s crazy watching the narrative flip in real-time.’ The community stayed present even during difficult periods. Institutions now see stability as a strategic advantage. Xaif highlighted this point as part of his broader message. The negative sentiment that once surrounded XRP has weakened. The community’s consistency, combined with upcoming institutional products, has increased XRP’s market relevance.

South Korean exchange giant Coinone just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s creating waves across the crypto community. The platform revealed plans for a significant Band Protocol rebranding initiative that promises to reshape how investors perceive and interact with this innovative blockchain project. What Does the Band Protocol Rebranding Actually Mean? The Band Protocol rebranding represents more than just a cosmetic change. Coinone confirmed they’re streamlining the project’s name from ‘Band Protocol’ to simply ‘Band,’ while maintaining the familiar BAND ticker symbol. This strategic move aims to create a cleaner, more memorable brand identity in the crowded cryptocurrency marketplace. Think about it – simpler names often stick better in people’s minds. The updated logo will complement this new direction, though specific design details remain under wraps. This isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about positioning Band for broader adoption and recognition. Why Would Coinone Initiate This Rebranding Now? Market evolution drives strategic decisions, and the Band Protocol rebranding comes at a pivotal time. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, projects need clear, distinctive identities that resonate with both seasoned traders and newcomers. Consider these key benefits driving this change: Enhanced brand recognition – Simpler names are easier to remember and share Market positioning – Standing out in a competitive landscape User accessibility – Reducing complexity for new investors Future growth – Preparing for expanded adoption and use cases How Will This Band Protocol Rebranding Affect Investors? If you’re holding BAND tokens, you might wonder how this Band Protocol rebranding impacts your investments. The good news is that the fundamental technology and tokenomics remain unchanged. Your BAND tokens will continue functioning exactly as before, with the same utility and value proposition. However, successful rebranding often brings increased visibility and potentially broader adoption. As more people recognize and understand the project through its simplified identity, demand could naturally increase. This strategic move demonstrates the team’s commitment to growth and market relevance. What Challenges Might This Rebranding Face? While the Band Protocol rebranding offers numerous advantages, it’s not without potential hurdles. Transition periods can create confusion among existing community members and investors accustomed to the original branding. Clear communication and consistent messaging will be crucial during this phase. Additionally, the crypto community is known for its strong attachments to established brands. Winning over skeptics and ensuring smooth transition across all platforms and exchanges will require coordinated effort and transparent execution. Looking Ahead: The Future After Band Protocol Rebranding This bold Band Protocol rebranding initiative signals confidence and forward-thinking strategy. By simplifying their identity while maintaining core functionality, Band positions itself for the next phase of blockchain adoption. The move suggests the team is thinking long-term about market positioning and user experience. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues evolving, such strategic pivots become increasingly important. Projects that adapt and refine their messaging while delivering solid technology tend to thrive in competitive markets. Frequently Asked Questions Will the BAND token ticker change? No, the BAND ticker symbol will remain unchanged across all exchanges and trading platforms. When will the Band Protocol rebranding take effect? Coinone hasn’t announced specific dates, but typically such transitions happen over several weeks to ensure smooth implementation. Do I need to do anything with my BAND tokens? No action is required from token holders. Your existing BAND tokens will automatically reflect the new branding across supported platforms. Will this affect Band Protocol’s technology or partnerships? The rebranding is purely cosmetic and doesn’t impact the underlying technology, existing partnerships, or development roadmap. Why keep the BAND ticker if changing the name? Maintaining the BAND ticker ensures continuity for traders and prevents confusion in markets where the symbol is already established. Will other exchanges follow Coinone’s lead? While not confirmed, it’s common for major exchanges to coordinate on significant branding changes to maintain consistency across platforms.

The company will begin by developing its own data centers in Texas and New York City in partnership with Fluidstack. The first facilities are scheduled to open in 2026. The project is expected to create thousands of jobs and strengthen the U.S. position in the global technology race. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told CNBC that the investment will help build “more powerful AI systems” capable of driving major scientific breakthroughs. Rising AI Spending Sparks Bubble Concerns The scale of financial commitments in the industry has reached unprecedented levels. Oracle has reportedly concluded a $300 billion cloud-services contract with OpenAI, while Meta, recognized as an extremist organization in Russia plans to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. Yet these investments remain far ahead of actual earnings. According to the Financial Times, the combined valuations of ten leading AI startups, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI — have surged by nearly $1 trillion in just a year, despite most of them still operating at a loss. Investor Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2008 mortgage crisis, recently closed his hedge fund Scion Capital, saying its valuation models were “no longer in sync with the markets.” On X, Burry accused major tech firms of artificially boosting profits by using overly aggressive depreciation schedules on AI hardware, which typically lasts only two to three years. He estimates this could understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, inflating Oracle's and Meta’s profits by over 20%. Jared Bernstein, former chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers, also warned that an AI bubble is a “likely outcome,” citing extreme valuations and a widening gap between investment and credible revenue expectations. He noted that the share of economic activity flowing into AI investment is now nearly a third higher than what flowed into the internet sector during the dot-com bubble. Harris Kupperman, founder of Praetorian Capital, estimates that AI data centers built in 2025 will face $40 billion in annual depreciation while generating only $15–20 billion in revenue. Optimists See a Foundation, Not a Bubble Not everyone sees a looming collapse. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC that massive spending on AI infrastructure is essential for maintaining U.S. competitiveness. “Investing in AI means not only buying GPUs and chips, but also investing in cooling systems, IT infrastructure, electrical networks, and power supplies,” Fink said. Physical limits, such as power grid capacity, construction bottlenecks, and chip availability could naturally slow down industry expansion, preventing purely speculative overreach. Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst, added a broader perspective: “Of course there’s a bubble. Bubbles are healthy. They channel capital and talent into a new trend, create losses, but also give birth to long-lasting companies that change the world.” Anthropic’s $50 billion commitment reflects the company’s belief in AI as a transformative force. Whether this marks the beginning of a technological renaissance or the inflation of a new financial bubble remains to be seen.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 06:14:11

This surprising scenario is playing out across America’s wealth management landscape. According to a groundbreaking survey, 35% of young, high-net-worth investors have made this exact move – all because their previous firms failed to provide adequate cryptocurrency access. Why Is Cryptocurrency Access Becoming a Deal-Breaker? The recent survey conducted by stablecoin infrastructure startup Zerohash reveals a seismic shift in investor priorities. When researchers polled 500 wealthy U.S. investors, they discovered that cryptocurrency access now ranks among the top criteria for choosing financial advisors. Young investors particularly value exposure to digital assets, viewing them as essential components of a diversified portfolio. This trend highlights a growing divide between traditional financial institutions and modern investor expectations. Many established firms still hesitate to embrace digital assets, creating opportunities for more agile competitors. The message from investors is clear: adapt or risk losing valuable clients. What Do the Numbers Reveal About Future Crypto Adoption? The survey findings extend far beyond advisor switching. Consider these compelling statistics: 84% of respondents plan to increase cryptocurrency holdings within the next year Younger investors (under 45) show the strongest demand for digital asset exposure High-net-worth individuals seek professional guidance for cryptocurrency investments The average portfolio allocation to digital assets continues to grow steadily These numbers suggest we’re witnessing just the beginning of a major transformation in wealth management. Financial professionals who recognize this shift early will likely capture significant market share. How Can Financial Advisors Adapt to the Crypto Revolution? Forward-thinking financial advisors are responding to this demand in several ways. First, they’re educating themselves about blockchain technology and digital assets. Many are pursuing specialized certifications in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Others are partnering with crypto-native firms to offer their clients secure exposure to this emerging asset class. The most successful advisors recognize that cryptocurrency access isn’t just about buying Bitcoin. It involves understanding decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and emerging Web3 technologies. They’re positioning themselves as comprehensive digital asset guides rather than just traditional investment managers. What Challenges Do Investors Face When Seeking Crypto Exposure? Despite growing demand, investors encounter several obstacles when pursuing cryptocurrency access through traditional channels. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern for many financial institutions. Security worries and technological complexity also create barriers to entry. However, these challenges are gradually diminishing as infrastructure improves and regulatory frameworks evolve. The survey results indicate that investors are becoming increasingly comfortable with digital assets, viewing short-term volatility as part of the normal investment landscape. The Future of Wealth Management Includes Digital Assets The message from wealthy investors couldn’t be clearer: cryptocurrency access is no longer optional. Financial advisors who fail to provide this service risk losing substantial business to more adaptable competitors. The 35% switching rate represents just the tip of the iceberg, with 84% planning increased allocations signaling sustained growth ahead. This transformation represents more than just a passing trend. It marks a fundamental shift in how younger generations view wealth preservation and growth. Digital assets have moved from the fringe to the mainstream, and financial professionals must evolve accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions Why are wealthy investors so interested in cryptocurrency access? Wealthy investors see digital assets as diversification tools and growth opportunities. Many believe blockchain technology will transform multiple industries and want exposure to this innovation. What percentage of investors are switching advisors over crypto? 35% of young, high-net-worth U.S. investors have changed financial advisors because their previous firms didn’t offer cryptocurrency access. How many investors plan to increase crypto holdings? The survey found that 84% of respondents intend to increase their cryptocurrency investments over the next twelve months. Are traditional financial institutions adapting to this demand? Some are, but many remain cautious due to regulatory uncertainty and technological challenges. This creates opportunities for more agile competitors. What should investors look for in a crypto-friendly advisor? Seek professionals with proven cryptocurrency expertise, secure custody solutions, and comprehensive digital asset strategies beyond basic Bitcoin exposure. Is this trend limited to younger investors? While strongest among investors under 45, interest in digital assets is growing across all age groups as awareness and infrastructure improve.

Key Takeaways: Thirty-five percent of young wealthy US investors have already moved money away from advisers who don’t offer crypto exposure. Institutional adoption from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity has boosted confidence. 92% of surveyed investors want access to a broader range of digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. A study released Wednesday by crypto payments firm Zerohash surveyed 500 U.S. investors aged 18 to 40 with annual incomes between $100,000 and $1 million. The findings showed that 35% have already moved money away from advisers who do not offer crypto exposure, and more than half of those shifts involved between $250,000 and $1 million. Institutional Adoption Boosts Young Investors’ Confidence in Crypto The trend reflects how quickly crypto has moved from fringe to mainstream for younger investors. Zerohash noted that more than four-fifths of respondents said their confidence in digital assets increased as major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, embraced the sector over the past year. Investors at the upper end of the income spectrum appear to be the most impatient. Among respondents earning $500,000 or more, half said they had already switched advisers due to a lack of crypto offerings. The survey also pointed to robust demand ahead: 84% plan to increase their crypto holdings over the next 12 months, with nearly half saying they intend to “increase their allocations significantly.” Zerohash said the results show that crypto has become “essential to modern portfolio strategy,” and warned that wealth advisers who fail to adapt may lose clients to platforms offering broader digital asset access. “Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” the firm said. Crypto is officially shaking up Wall Street A recent survey by Zerohash shows that 35% of wealthy U.S. investors aged 18–40 ditched their financial institutions because their advisors didn’t offer crypto. Yep, no Bitcoin, no loyalty. Most of them moved $250K to $1M, and… pic.twitter.com/2UKbjAIwTP — Seven Crypto (@SevenWinse) November 20, 2025 Respondents were clear about their expectations: they want crypto integrated into their existing portfolios, with insured custody and compliant access. The demand goes beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ninety-two percent said access to a wider range of digital assets is important, a trend reflected in the growing menu of exchange-traded products tied to altcoins such as Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. Staking Products Gaining Momentum Asset managers are increasingly rolling out more complex offerings, including staking-based products that generate yield for users who lock up tokens. BlackRock appears to be preparing to enter that market as well, filing for a staked Ether ETF in Delaware this week. Meanwhile, 21Shares has launched its new 21Shares Solana ETF (TSOL) on the CBOE, giving U.S. investors direct exposure to the spot price of SOL without holding the token themselves. The fund debuted with $100 million in assets under management, joining a growing wave of Solana-focused products entering the US market. TSOL follows 21Shares’ earlier US launches, including its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (now above $8 billion AUM) and its spot Ethereum ETF. The firm already runs the world’s largest Solana ETP in Europe, with more than $1 billion in assets. With Fidelity, Bitwise, VanEck and Grayscale also pushing into spot Solana products, the segment has drawn over $420 million in inflows, underscoring rising demand for institutional-grade SOL exposure.

37365,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=129511,1763621981,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37365.jpeg,Flow coin price prediction 2025-2031: Is FLOW a good investment?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/flow-coin-price-prediction/,"Key takeaways: Flow coin price prediction for 2025 could reach a maximum value of $ 0.7975. By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.2656 Market Cap $430.49M Trading Volume $9.7M Circulating Supply 1.62B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.157 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2649 24-hour Low $0.2511 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.70% (Medium) 50-Day SMA $0.2901 14-Day RSI 43.95 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 11 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.3736 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow is stabilising around $0.265 with tightening volatility and early signs of a momentum turnaround. The short-term momentum supports bullish recovery, with the Alligator lines beginning to expand upward. Flow coin 1-day price analysis Flow’s 1-day chart for November 20 shows the coin holding at $0.265, hovering right on the mid-Bollinger band at $0.262, a sign that the market is trying to stabilise after a multi-day downtrend. The narrowing Bollinger bands indicate reduced volatility, and this compression typically precedes a stronger directional move. Should the coin close above $0.266–$0.270, the upper band at $0.291 becomes the next target, but failure to sustain this level risks a slip back to $0.250–0.240, where support recently formed. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram has flattened near zero, and the signal lines are converging, hinting at a potential bullish crossover if buyers push slightly harder. Meanwhile, RSI sits around 47, climbing slowly. This neutral zone is still favorable for upward extension if momentum increases. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, Flow has printed a clear bullish leg back to $0.266, with strong green candles reclaiming short-term moving averages. The Alligator lines are beginning to fan upward again, signalling the early phase of a potential trend reversal. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The last bullish impulse broke the recent sequence of lower highs, and if price holds above $0.262, buyers may attempt another push toward $0.270–0.274. The MACD sits above zero and is turning upward, confirming the intraday shift in momentum. Volume via PVT is no longer declining, which supports the validity of this upward impulse. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3133 SELL SMA 5 $0.2886 SELL SMA 10 $0.2790 SELL SMA 21 $0.2680 SELL SMA 50 $0.2901 SELL SMA 100 $0.3405 SELL SMA 200 $0.3736 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2735 SELL EMA 5 $0.2907 SELL EMA 10 $0.3232 SELL EMA 21 $0.3523 SELL EMA 50 $0.3693 SELL EMA 100 $0.3797 SELL EMA 200 $0.4204 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow appears to be transitioning from exhaustion to early recovery. If buyers defend $0.260 and momentum holds, a short-term rally toward $0.274–0.280 is likely. A failure to hold the mid-range could re-expose FLOW to support near $0.250. Overall, bias leans mildly bullish unless the coin breaks $0.258 in the meantime. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

54644485,631048,1763622009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54644485.jpeg,Hyperliquid At Risk In Democrats’ Crypto Crackdown? ZachXBT Warns Of Potential Risks,https://bitcoinist.com/hyperliquid-at-risk-in-democrats-crypto-crackdown/,"The recent crypto crackdown from the Democratic party, spearheaded by crypto-skeptic Senator Elizabeth Warren, may cast a shadow over the future of the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid (HYPE). This heightened scrutiny stems from concerns surrounding the crypto ventures associated with President Donald Trump’s family, specifically focusing on World Liberty Financial (WLFI). National Security Concerns Over WLFI’s Sales In a letter dated Tuesday, US Senators Warren and Jack Reed, who serve on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, expressed apprehensions that WLFI might pose national security risks. The letter, which was exclusively obtained by CNBC and addressed to Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, outlined the senators’ belief that World Liberty Financial lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent malicious actors from manipulating funds or exerting influence over its governance. The senators referenced a report by the nonprofit watchdog Accountable.US, which indicated that WLFI had sold its WLFI tokens to “various highly suspicious entities.” On-chain sleuth ZachXBT brought attention to the fact that WLFI raised an impressive $550 million during its token sale, but the senators accused it of having raised around $10,000 from illicit sources. ZachXBT noted that this figure represents merely 0.0018% of the total World Liberty Financial token sale, highlighting the disproportionate nature of the allegations. The investigator expressed concern over the potential misuse of “weak illicit funds” arguments by US regulators against the crypto industry. He suggested that if the actions against WLFI prove successful, Hyperliquid could become a target next. While ZachXBT did not provide specific reasons for why Hyperliquid might be affected, speculation surrounds WLFI’s native token trading on the Hyperliquid platform. Moreover, Hyperliquid recently incurred a loss of $4.9 million due to the external manipulation of the POPCAT token, where attackers artificially inflated the token’s price using $3 million in Circle’s USDC stablecoin, which could also catch the Senator’s attention if any action against the exchange materializes. Hyperliquid Unveils ‘Growth Mode Despite the challenges, Hyperliquid introduced a new feature under its HIP-3 upgrade framework, aimed at significantly reducing trading fees for newly launched markets. Dubbed “growth mode,” this upgrade reduces all-in taker fees by more than 90%, a move designed to accelerate liquidity formation and incentivize market makers engaging in nascent perpetual contracts. Since its launch, Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE , has experienced notable growth, skyrocketing by 1,000%. This surge has elevated Hyperliquid to rank as the 18th largest cryptocurrency in the world, boasting a market capitalization of $10 billion. However, when writing, HYPE trades at $37.31, recording losses of over 9% in the past fourteen days. After reaching a record high of $59.30 earlier this year, the token has retraced by almost 37%, in line with the broader crypto market’s correction.

The sudden Bitcoin price movement has left many traders wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several factors that could be influencing this downward trend.

Key factors affecting the current Bitcoin price include: Market sentiment shifts among institutional investors Global economic uncertainty impacting risk assets Technical trading patterns and resistance levels Regulatory developments in major markets How Significant is This Bitcoin Price Movement? While any drop in Bitcoin price below key psychological levels grabs attention, context matters. The current Bitcoin price of $91,988.81 represents a notable decline, but historical patterns show that Bitcoin has weathered much larger fluctuations. Therefore, long-term investors often view these movements as normal market behavior. The current Bitcoin price situation presents both challenges and opportunities: For short-term traders: Increased volatility means higher risk but also potential quick gains For long-term holders: Price dips can represent buying opportunities For new investors: Lower entry points might be attractive for portfolio diversification What Should Investors Do About the Falling Bitcoin Price? When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, having a clear strategy becomes crucial. Rather than making emotional decisions, consider your investment goals and risk tolerance. Many experts suggest that reacting to short-term Bitcoin price changes often leads to poor investment outcomes. Actionable insights for navigating the current Bitcoin price environment: Review your portfolio allocation and risk exposure Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks Stay informed about market fundamentals rather than focusing solely on price Set clear entry and exit strategies based on your investment horizon Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Buying Opportunity?

However, every investment decision should align with individual financial goals and risk capacity. Remember that the Bitcoin price has historically recovered from much larger declines. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, understanding market cycles can provide valuable perspective when evaluating the current Bitcoin price situation. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $92,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from combined factors including market sentiment, technical trading patterns, and broader economic conditions affecting risk assets.

This performance follows the announcement of a key partnership with Durrah AlFodah Holding to promote the growth of blockchain technology in Saudi Arabia. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims $140 As Second Wave Of SOL ETFs Debut – Is A Rebound Coming? WhiteBIT Secures Strategic Collab In Saudi Arabia On Tuesday, top crypto exchange WhiteBIT unveiled it had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Durrah AlFodah Holding, represented by His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, aiming to drive the Kingdom’s development in blockchain technology, digital finance, and data infrastructure. According to the announcement, the partnership aligns with the strategic pillars of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 program, which seeks to foster economic diversification, technological innovation, and digital transformation across the Kingdom’s public and private sectors. Therefore, it will set the foundation for key projects within the Kingdom, including stock market tokenization, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) guidance, and the creation of national data computing and mining centers. Under the agreement, WhiteBIT will provide technological expertise and infrastructure design, while Durrah AlFodah will facilitate the crypto exchange’s market entry, regulatory engagement, and partnership development across Saudi Arabia. The move follows the exchange’s expansion to multiple jurisdictions, including Australia, Croatia, Italy, and Kazakhstan, as well as its recent dual entry into the Argentine and Brazilian markets, after key regulatory advancements in the two largest countries in South America. The collaboration reportedly envisions the creation of a joint venture company between WhiteBIT and Durrah AlFodah to manage and scale its national-scale initiatives. Volodymyr Nosov, Founder and President of W Group, the global fintech ecosystem that includes WhiteBIT, affirmed: It is an honor to work alongside the Holding of His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud to build the foundations of Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation. Together, we aim to establish secure and sovereign blockchain systems that will shape the Kingdom’s technological future. WBT Leads Mid-Week Altcoin Market Following the news, WhiteBIT’s WBT token jumped from the $51 level to a new all-time high (ATH) of $62.96 before stabilizing between the $60-$61 area. This performance builds on the remarkable WBT’s price action during the recent market volatility, which has seen many leading cryptocurrencies reach multi-month lows. Notably, the altcoin rallied to new highs in late June and consolidated within its $40-$47 range during the broader market rally between July and October. However, as the market entered a corrective phase in early November, WBT went against the current and broke out of its local range, hitting a new ATH at the time.

Moreover, the altcoin, which ranks 13th among all cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, is currently the only token with double-digit gains among the top 20 cryptocurrencies. As of this writing, WBT is trading at $60.62, a 9.8% increase for the altcoin in the weekly timeframe.

It is a tool banks can use today. With 15 years of Ripple technology, Aljarrah expects a major rally within 6 to 24 months. Fast Cross-Border Payments Aljarrah explained that RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity unravel slow international payments. Banks typically maintain funds in multiple accounts globally. This locks cash and slows transfers. XRP works differently. Banks convert local money into XRP and send it instantly. The receiving bank converts XRP into local money. Aljarrah pointed out that this lowers cost and risk. He noted that real money moves daily through active corridors in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. A liquidity crisis is approaching, and $XRP is uniquely positioned to provide instant cross-border settlement. With 15 years of @Ripple infrastructure in place, banks can leverage it immediately.

Aljarrah pointed out that Ripple has licenses in Singapore, the EU, and the UAE. He also highlighted the ruling from a U.S. judge that XRP is not a security . This lets banks use XRP safely. Aljarrah described old lawsuits as temporary noise. New rules, such as the EU’s MiCA and Abu Dhabi’s FSRA, match XRP. This legal clarity speeds up global adoption . Central Banks and Digital Money Central banks are also testing XRP and Ripple’s technology. Aljarrah stated that digital money needs fast, neutral ways to settle payments.

As more banks adopt these systems, demand for the asset will grow. Aljarrah believes XRP will become a key part of global real-time settlements. Liquidity and Immediate Market Impact XRP’s value comes from its use. Large transfers need high XRP liquidity. Banks and market makers must hold billions to maintain instant payments. Aljarrah estimated that $1 trillion in daily transfers could require $100 billion in XRP. Each new corridor or digital market adds demand. He stressed that price rises are due to need, not speculation. Aljarrah expects market effects within 6 to 24 months.

As blockchain technology continues to evolve and reshape our digital future, investors worldwide are watching SOL’s trajectory with intense interest. This comprehensive Solana price prediction analyzes every factor that could propel SOL to new heights between 2025 and 2030. Understanding Solana Price Prediction Fundamentals Solana has established itself as a leading blockchain platform known for its incredible speed and scalability. The SOL price reflects not just market sentiment but fundamental technological advantages. When examining any cryptocurrency prediction, it’s crucial to consider both technical analysis and real-world adoption metrics. The current SOL price movement suggests growing institutional confidence in Solana’s long-term viability. Key Factors Driving Solana 2025 Price Targets Several critical elements will influence whether Solana reaches $500 by 2025. Network upgrades, developer activity, and mainstream adoption all play significant roles in this cryptocurrency prediction. The expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications built on Solana creates inherent value for SOL tokens. Market analysts closely monitor transaction volume and staking participation as indicators of network health.

Chart patterns, moving averages, and trading volume all contribute to understanding potential SOL price trajectories. The current blockchain technology adoption curve suggests increasing utility demand for Solana’s high-throughput capabilities. Historical resistance and support levels help identify key price zones that could accelerate movement toward $500. Challenges in Cryptocurrency Prediction Accuracy While optimistic about Solana’s potential, responsible investing requires acknowledging prediction uncertainties. Regulatory developments, market volatility, and technological competition all impact SOL price stability. This cryptocurrency prediction considers multiple scenarios, including bear market conditions that could temporarily depress prices. Diversification remains essential when investing in any digital asset, regardless of promising forecasts. Network scalability and transaction speed advantages Growing decentralized finance ecosystem Institutional investment patterns Global regulatory landscape evolution Competitive blockchain technology developments Why Solana 2025 Projections Generate Excitement The roadmap for Solana development includes significant upgrades that could dramatically increase network efficiency and utility.

Current development activity suggests the Solana ecosystem will continue expanding through 2025 and beyond. Frequently Asked Questions What makes Solana different from other cryptocurrencies? Solana stands out for its exceptional transaction speed and low costs, leveraging unique consensus mechanisms that enable scalability unmatched by many competitors. How reliable are long-term cryptocurrency predictions? While educated projections provide valuable insights, all long-term predictions carry inherent uncertainty due to market volatility and unforeseen technological or regulatory developments. Who leads Solana development? Solana Labs, co-founded by Anatoly Yakovenko , drives much of Solana’s core development, while a growing community of developers contributes to ecosystem expansion. What companies are building on Solana? Major projects include FTX (before its collapse), Serum , and numerous NFT marketplaces and DeFi protocols leveraging Solana’s high-speed infrastructure. How does Solana compare to Ethereum? While Ethereum pioneered smart contracts, Solana offers significantly higher transactions per second and lower fees, though with different decentralization trade-offs. As we’ve explored, the path to $500 for Solana involves multiple converging factors – technological advancement, market adoption, and broader cryptocurrency acceptance. While predictions provide valuable frameworks, the dynamic nature of digital assets means investors should maintain balanced perspectives and risk management strategies.

South Korea’s leading exchange Upbit has announced a crucial service interruption that affects your digital asset management. The platform will temporarily suspend all Upbit crypto deposits and withdrawals for approximately two hours this November. Here’s everything you need to know to prepare for this brief maintenance window. When Exactly Will Upbit Crypto Deposits and Withdrawals Stop? The scheduled maintenance begins precisely at 4:00 a.m. UTC on November 25. During this period, you cannot process any Upbit crypto deposits or withdrawal requests. The exchange estimates the service interruption will last about two hours, meaning normal operations should resume around 6:00 a.m. UTC. Therefore, plan your trading activities accordingly to avoid any inconvenience. Why Is Upbit Temporarily Halting Services? The suspension stems from essential server maintenance for VerifyVASP, a critical compliance system. VerifyVASP ensures secure transaction monitoring and regulatory compliance across virtual asset service providers. This maintenance demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to: Enhanced security protocols Regulatory compliance standards System reliability improvements User protection measures What Should Upbit Users Do During the Maintenance? While Upbit crypto deposits and withdrawals will be unavailable, most other exchange functions remain operational. You can still access your account, monitor market prices, and place limit orders. However, we recommend completing any urgent transactions before the maintenance window begins. Remember that other crypto exchanges continue operating normally, so you might consider alternative platforms for time-sensitive trades. How Does This Affect Your Crypto Trading Strategy? Brief maintenance periods typically cause minimal market impact, but prudent traders always prepare for contingencies. The temporary halt on Upbit crypto deposits might affect traders who: Rely on quick deposit confirmations for arbitrage opportunities Need immediate withdrawal capabilities for other investments Plan to transfer assets between exchanges during this window Fortunately, the two-hour duration falls during relatively low trading volume hours for Asian markets, potentially minimizing disruption. What Makes This Upbit Maintenance Different? Unlike routine system updates, this maintenance specifically targets VerifyVASP infrastructure. This system plays a vital role in preventing money laundering and ensuring transaction transparency. The upgrade likely incorporates new regulatory requirements or security enhancements that benefit all users in the long term. Regular maintenance like this actually strengthens the platform’s reliability and compliance standing. Key Takeaways for Upbit Users The temporary suspension of Upbit crypto deposits and withdrawals represents standard operational procedure for maintaining a secure trading environment. While briefly inconvenient, such maintenance ultimately protects your assets and ensures regulatory compliance. The exchange has provided ample notice, allowing users to adjust their trading schedules accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions Will I be able to trade during the Upbit maintenance? Yes, trading functions will remain available. Only deposit and withdrawal services will be temporarily suspended. What happens if I initiate a transfer right before maintenance begins? Complete any transactions well before the 4:00 a.m. UTC start time. Pending transactions might be delayed until services resume. Will this affect cryptocurrency prices on Upbit? Typically, brief maintenance windows don’t significantly impact prices, but reduced liquidity might cause slight volatility. How often does Upbit perform such maintenance? Regular maintenance occurs periodically, usually announced several days in advance to minimize user disruption. Can I still access my funds during this period? Yes, your funds remain secure in your account. Only the transfer functionality will be temporarily unavailable. What if the maintenance takes longer than two hours? Upbit has established a strong track record of completing maintenance within announced timeframes, but monitor official channels for updates. Share This Important Update Help fellow crypto traders stay informed! Share this article on your social media channels to ensure everyone in the Upbit community prepares for the temporary service interruption.

Currently, Ripple is considering adding a staking feature to the XRP Ledger. Ripple is discussing introducing a staking feature for XRP Ledger (XRPL) to increase XRP's use in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, according to Decrypt. RippleX Senior Director of Engineering J. Ayo Akinyele said in a recent blog post that introducing staking to the XRP Ledger could improve network security by incentivizing long-term participation and rewarding users who help maintain consensus. “Considering how XRP’s usage can expand with new features, the need for staking naturally arises. Staking can incentivize long-term participation and provide rewards to participants who help maintain consensus, which can strengthen network security.” The introduction of staking has been noted to have the potential to increase utility through increased network security and participant rewards. However, it was also stated that it is difficult to adopt in the short term due to technical difficulties and risks. Akinyele stated that the XRP Ledger was initially designed to provide efficient global value transfer and liquidity, particularly for cross-border payments, and that this concept will help XRP maintain its dominance once it is adopted by digital asset treasuries and exchange-traded funds. However, the introduction of staking would challenge fundamental principles of the ledger, such as the Proof of Relationship mechanism, which prioritizes trust and stability over financial incentives. XRP is trading at $2.13, according to CoinMarketCap data. *This is not investment advice.

The SHIB token is expanding its digital asset utilities and gaining attention with its technical movements. More and more digital fans are expecting partnerships to increase SHIB’s utility more, and partnerships are being formed. At the same time, the presale of Mutuum Finance is expected to be one of the quickest to be completed as the market and users are seeing the expected utility. These two digital assets are expected to be the top digital assets to pay attention to as the 2026 year commences. Shiba Inu Sustains Dedication to Recent Collaborations Due to recent integrations Shiba Inu is showing strong signs of recovery. Recent integrations with Unity Nodes allow SHIB to have true utility within the telecom infrastructure. This integration allows customers to purchase nodes and licenses using SHIB. This grants customers the ability to earn in SHIB which in turn creates a circular economy. Additionally, this is a positive fundamental development considering the asset in question. Recent 4 hour time frame data shows a bullish reversal head and shoulders bottom consolidation. If the price breaks the resistance head and shoulders neckline, expect SHIB to target $0.00001025. For the fundamentalist investor considering what crypto to buy today with the best short term potential however, SHIB falls behind utility based tokens like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale is Almost Sold Out As SHIB works on trying to recover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing what demand truly is, as their ongoing presale is nothing short of amazing. We are now in Phase 6 of the presale, and the phase is almost sold out. Here, investors can purchase MUTM tokens for $0.035 which is a great deal before Phase 7 when the presale price increases by almost 20%. With the project having raised over $18.8 million, it is clear that investors are confident in this project. With presale success like this, Mutuum Finance will most certainly be one of the next big cryptocurrencies, and people in this current phase can expect more than a 400% return based on the price predicted for when the project officially launches. Given the current demand, the opportunity will be gone in the blink of an eye. Multi-Purpose Lending Architecture Provides Incredible Flexibility One of the many reasons people are so excited with the advancements in the Mutuum Finance ecosystem is the popularity of the dual lending model. The dual lending model caters to a number of different users with varying levels in their risk acceptance profile, making Mutuum Finance a versatile defi crypto platform. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows customers of the platform to deposit stable major assets like ETH, and USDT to a pooled liquidity from which depositors earn yield automation in a secured shared pool environment. At the same time, the platform has a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending that allows borrowers to negotiate loans directly with lenders on less liquid or exotic assets, allowing more control over the loan with institutional and advanced users. The dual model architecture allows mainstream and niche assets to find an efficient market, and provides countless opportunities to lenders, borrowers, and lends a solid ground to the architecture for new sustainable growth. The Buy and Distribute Mechanism and Sustainable Value Given the finance lending market, Mutuum Finance incorporates a unique ecological tokenomic feature, the buy-and-distribute mechanism, which establishes an alliance between the token value and the intensity of the platform usage. A fraction of the total revenue from protocol fees is circumvented to buy back MUTM tokens from the market. The acquired tokens are distributed to stakers of mtTokens, the liquidity providing interest-bearing receipts. Consequently, a sustainable feedback loop is created, whereby increased user engagement and fee collection amplify the buying pressure on the MUTM token and the constant stakers receive higher progressive rewards. This model unique to the protocol is a token holder value proposition. It is thereby one of the tokens to buy for those looking for crypto with embedded appreciation mechanisms. How to Position in The Most Valuable Assets By early 2026, the story is already in progress, as Mutuum Finance is using its community to build tangible utility, and has built a product and is demonstrating the power of a well-structured presale. With the Mutuum Finance presale window rapidly closing, there is a positive opportunity to take an investment in a project built for a positive investment outcome to a new level and a new height from where you currently stand. With its dual lending model, along with its innovative tokenomics, Mutuum Finance is definitely the best crypto to buy now for the upcoming quarter. It is the final opportunity to take part in Phase 6.

Over the past 12 hours, though, the bulls managed to reclaim some lost ground, and now the question is whether the asset can surpass $100,000 again this month or if this is only a “dead cat bounce.” To gain a clearer perspective, we asked four of the most popular AI chatbots for their two cents on the matter. Are the Bulls Coming Back? According to ChatGPT, a rebound above $100,000 would be “big” but not unusual for BTC’s volatility. The chatbot reminded that, historically, the primary cryptocurrency has snapped back with increases of 10-20% mere days after sharp corrections and liquidations. It noted that long-term holders remain unfazed by the crash, predicting that a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve, which suggests further rate cuts, could boost the asset. “Once BTC approaches $95-$97K again, FOMO can reignite aggressively and push the price towards the six-figure mark,” it added. Additionally, ChatGPT reminded that November is one of the strongest months for Bitcoin. While the asset has indeed registered solid increases during this period, the picture is somewhat different when November follows a halving year. The last two halvings occurred in 2020 and 2024. In November 2021, BTC slipped by approximately 7%, and since the beginning of the current month, its valuation is down by over 16%. Grok estimated that the chance of a rise above $100K before the start of December is around 40-50%. Similar to ChatGPT, it claimed that the approach of America’s central bank on interest rates will be of utmost importance to the recovery of the entire crypto market. “If you’re long-term bullish, dips like this are gifts – stack sats, hedge with options, and watch $90K as the ultimate support,” it stated. More Optimistic Opinions Perplexity said a rise beyond $100,000 as early as this month is likely and would coincide with the bullish expectations of some proponents of the digital asset. It warned that volatility might increase on the path towards that goal and predicted a further rise to $120,000 in December. Google’s Gemini claimed that a rise above that milestone is possible once BTC clears the $95,000 support zone. It also mentioned the recent decline in interest in spot BTC ETFs, suggesting that the return of institutional investors would be beneficial for a potential renewed rally.

These mining companies are shifting their focus towards AI and data center operations to capitalize on GPU demand, rather than relying entirely on cryptocurrency mining. IREN shifted part of its operations from traditional Bitcoin mining towards providing a data center for AI workloads. The firm recently signed a $9.7 billion multi-year deal with Microsoft to deliver Nvidia-based GPU compute from its North American facilities. The deal established Microsoft as IREN’s largest customer. IREN acquires Nvidia equipment from Dell Technologies to support the deployment of high-performing GPU clusters. IREN and Cipher Mining stock jumps over 10% after hours IREN stock rallied to $50.45 after hours following the announcement of better-than-expected Nvidia’s Q3 earnings as the firm expands its cloud-AI infrastructure backed by an extensive secured power portfolio. The stock price represented a 10.08% jump before today’s drawdown, reaching $45.83, which represents a $6.18% drop. IREN stock has grown over ten times its starting price at the beginning of 2025, with a 366.7% year-to-date growth, reflecting a growing investor conviction that miners are repositioning themselves as AI compute providers. Cipher Mining, which signed a 10-year AI hosting deal with Fluidstack, a Google-based firm, to use its data centers for AI purposes, also experienced a stock rally after hours. So far, Cipher Mining is upgrading some of its facilities to support Nvidia’s H100 and Blackwell GPUs. The firm’s stock rallied to $16.51, representing a 12.93% gain after hours. The CIFR stock has so far experienced a drawdown to $14.62, representing a 0.27% gain on the daily chart. Just like IREN, Cipher stock has experienced more than ten times growth this year with a 215.09% gain year to date, underscoring the conviction among investors that miners are repositioning their computing capacity to provide AI workload services. Nvidia’s Q3 earnings validated the current trend, driven by its data center GPUs’ support for the ongoing demand for AI compute. Miners are positioning themselves to benefit by offering that capacity. According to Nvidia’s press release , the firm recorded $57 billion in Q3 revenue, up 22% from Q2 and 62% growth year over year. The data center business generated $ 51.2 billion, representing a 25% increase from Q2 and a 66% year-over-year increase. Earnings per share were $1.3, and the GAAP gross margin was 73.4%. Nvidia projects a $65 billion revenue in Q4 Based on Nvidia’s projections, Q4 is expected to generate approximately $65 billion in revenue, with a non-GAAP gross margin of roughly 75%. Jensen Huang, the company CEO, revealed that the demand for its Blackwell chips and cloud GPUs fueled the results as AI compute demand continues to increase. IREN, on the other hand, has so far recorded $501 million in revenue in fiscal year 2025, with its AI cloud business growing rapidly. The firm has also secured a 2,910 MW power capacity to host more GPUs and scale its AI workload operations in its data center in British Columbia and Texas. The halving process of the Bitcoin network triggered the shift towards AI workloads among Bitcoin miners. According to a Cryptopolitan report , after the 2024 Bitcoin halving, which reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC, miners experienced squeezed revenues, which added to rising network difficulty and slow transaction volumes, drying up profits. Despite Bitcoin reaching new highs of $126,000 per Bitcoin, unit economics could not work as previously. Power costs have dramatically increased, squeezing returns and prompting miners to diversify their energy usage towards AI workloads to continue generating profits. For miners like IREN and Cipher, the shift represents leveraging the existing power, space, and cooling infrastructure to capitalize on high-demand computing services.

In an X thread posted on Wednesday, the President Trump family-affiliated company revealed that attackers gained access to wallets through external lapses tied to third-party tools or malicious schemes that tricked users into exposing private keys during its launch on September 1. The affected wallets were reportedly frozen after users reported suspicious activity, and they were asked to complete identity checks again so the company could confirm ownership and return recovered funds to the correct recipients. WLFI said it also “built and tested new smart contract logic to handle bulk reallocations,” noting that most of the compromises were caused by phishing and exposed credentials. WLFI executes emergency burn for reallocation According to the company’s statement expounding on the source of the breach, the launch of Ethereum’s EIP-7702 Pectra upgrade saw attackers placing malicious contracts into already compromised accounts, later enabling token drains once WLFI went live. 1/ Prior to WLFI’s launch, a relatively small subset of user wallets were compromised via phishing attacks or exposed seed phrases. Since then, we’ve tested new smart contract logic to safely reallocate user funds and verified users’ identity via KYC checks. Shortly, users who… — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) November 19, 2025 World Liberty Financial froze 272 wallets affected by the breach and warned users that fake support accounts and scam recovery services were in circulation at the time. Although the number of impacted users was limited, the company insisted on stringent verification requirements to avoid sending tokens to the wrong parties. Yesterday, the Web 3 platform executed an emergency contract function that burned 166.667 million WLFI tokens, valued at about $22.14 million, from addresses involved in the hack. A market watcher going by the username Emmet Gallic shared a photo of the explanation given for the token burn function from the contract, which read: Image from token burn contract. Source: Emmett Gallic on X. WLFI confirmed from its X post that reallocations will begin shortly for wallets that have completed the required checks. Tokens belonging to users who have not yet contacted the company will be frozen until they go through the verification process, and they can start the procedure through its help center anytime until claims are resolved. “Thank you to everyone who showed patience and trust throughout this process. We’re proud to protect our community, and ready to keep building,” the platform’s social media team concluded. World Liberty Financial’s token trading opened on decentralized exchanges, dropping more than 15% shortly after going live and denting the profits of several holders like social media influencer Andrew Tate, Cryptopolitan reported . At the top of that band, the Trump family’s reported stake of 22.5 billion tokens carried a paper valuation exceeding $6 billion, per the Wall Street Journal’s feature. World Liberty Financial’s website lists Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Barron Trump as co-founders, while US President Donald Trump is noted as a “Co-Founder Emeritus.” US President Donald Trump’s ties to WLFI spark congressional probe A report by the watchdog Accountable.US said the company sold $10,000 worth of WLFI to traders who had interacted with a blockchain address now sanctioned for ties to the North Korean Lazarus hacking group. Acting on what they perceive as “actionable intel,” two US Senators have asked federal officials to examine World Liberty Financial’s activities. In a letter sent Tuesday, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jack Reed, both members of the Senate Banking Committee, claimed WLFI is a national security risk with links to bad actors from North Korea, Russia, and Iran. The lawmakers cited the Accountable.US report, which alleged that WLFI tokens were sold to individuals tied to a sanctioned Russian ruble-based sanctions evasion network, an Iranian crypto exchange, and Tornado Cash, a service the US has sanctioned for money laundering. World Liberty Financial rejected the allegations in a statement to CNBC, saying: “There is no conflict of interest between World Liberty Financial. We conducted rigorous AML/KYC checks on every pre-sale purchaser of the $WLFI governance token and turned down millions of dollars from potential purchasers who failed the tests.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|ETH|USD|WLFI,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-20 07:55:15

The PI token has exploded by over 12% in the past 24 hours, and it topped $0.25 for the second time since the start of this otherwise bearish month for the digital asset industry. Pi Network’s (PI) Price on CoinGecko On the question of why it has defied the overall trend and posted such a massive increase, the most obvious answer comes from a regulatory standpoint. Numerous accounts dedicated to covering news regarding the project updated that Pi Network has achieved full compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The revised whitepaper, published on November 19, explains this change, which opens the door for the PI token to be listed on regulated EU-based exchanges. According to Kim H Wong, the MiCA approval “ reduces regulatory uncertainty – a major adoption barrier – potentially increasing liquidity and institutional interest. Token utility (payments within Pi’s ecosystem) gains legitimacy, driving demand.” Tony Cruz was bullish on the asset’s immediate price uptick, suggesting that the next wave to $0.30 is imminent as PI is “making a big comeback.” Other possible reasons behind the token’s impressive resurgance could be related to the overall updates and network development recently announced by the team. As reported over the weekend, the Core Team outlined updates in regards to the Pi App Studio, which allowed users with all types of experience to enhance their app creation process. They can now download their apps from the Pi Studio, make changes on their local devices, and then re-upload them for deployment or further improvements.

This turmoil is exemplified by the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which experienced its largest single-day withdrawal since launch, further contributing to the decline in Bitcoin’s price. Profit-Taking And Caution The recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF highlight the severity of the current selloff within the Bitcoin market, which has experienced a substantial correction below the crucial $100,000 mark following a record high reached in October. Related Reading: Kraken Achieves $20 Billion Valuation With $200 Million Investment From Citadel This downturn emphasizes the widespread pullback affecting various risk assets, while gold has notably remained resilient. Some analysts suggest that these developments indicate a trend of investors shifting their exposure from Bitcoin to gold. “The crypto market entered a hangover in August,” said Thomas Perfumo, Global Economist at Kraken, in a recent interview with Reuters, noting that much of the earlier demand for Bitcoin had been fueled by borrowed funds. He added, “Momentum seemingly peaked during the summer. But the truth is this hangover trend started months ago.” Analysts have also pointed to profit-taking behaviors among long-term holders and increasing caution among Bitcoin ETF funds and digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which had previously ramped up their acquisitions throughout the year. Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, stated that Bitcoin treasury companies had collectively purchased nearly $50 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past year. Recently, however, many of these firms have begun trading at a discount to their net asset value, which could dampen market expectations for new Bitcoin purchases in the near term. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Plummet This shift occurs amid rising concerns among heavyweight investors regarding inflated valuations across various asset classes. José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, noted that “an ongoing lack of speculative spirits is weighing on Bitcoin.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Dips Below $90,000—Yet Altcoins Remain Unscathed: Here’s Why Despite managing over $73 billion in assets, IBIT has seen a decline of 19% in the current quarter. Data from SoSoValue indicates that spot Bitcoin ETF funds collectively have recorded $2.59 billion in outflows this month alone. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which has experienced $1.78 billion in outflows in November alone. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) ranks second, with nearly $540 million in outflows. The turbulence isn’t limited to Bitcoin; the Ethereum exchange-traded fund sector also faced outflows, totaling approximately $74.2 million yesterday, with BlackRock selling off $165.1 million. On a more positive note, Solana spot ETFs reported net inflows of $30.09 million on Tuesday, primarily driven by Bitwise’s BSOL. This marks a major streak of 15 consecutive days of inflows for Solana.

Ethereum DAT Project By Leading Asian Whales Has Been Canned Last month, Bloomberg reported that some influential investors in Asia were gearing up to launch an Ethereum trust. The group involved the likes of Li Lin, founder of Huobi cryptocurrency exchange, Shen Bo, co-founder of Fenbushi Capital, and Xiao Feng, chairman and CEO of HashKey Group. At the time, the investors were in talks to acquire a NASDAQ-listed entity to facilitate the digital-asset treasury (DAT) structure, with the project already boasting a backing of $1 billion. According to a report from Wu Blockchain , however, that project has now been cancelled. “The US$1 billion Ethereum DAT proposed by leading Asian crypto investors has been shelved, and the committed capital has been returned,” wrote Wu Blockchain. Of the $1 billion backing, $200 million came from investment firm Avenir Capital alone, of which Huobi’s Li is a chairman. Another $500 million was provided by Asian institutional investors like HongShan Capital Group. Popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a DAT company is a public entity that makes a digital-asset reserve its main business. Earlier, firms mostly focused on using Bitcoin in this type of strategy, but 2025 has seen a push into altcoins like Ethereum and Solana. BitMine , which is currently the largest ETH DAT and second-largest overall after Strategy, adopted its ETH reserve strategy in June of this year. According to a Monday press release , the company holds 3,559,879 tokens, bought for a total of $11.1 billion. Unlike BitMine, the Asia-led DAT project appears to have been halted before it could launch. “Sources said the plan was halted mainly due to the market downturn following the sharp October 11 sell-off,” revealed Wu Blockchain. Ethereum has been in freefall alongside the wider cryptocurrency sector since this crash, with its price being down over 38% compared to its October high. As a result, BitMine’s holdings have gone underwater. At the current exchange rate, its holdings are valued at $10.3 billion, roughly 7% below cost basis. The ETH network as a whole has its average cost basis (“ Realized Price “) located at $2,316, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post . Given this, the average investor is still in a profit of about 24%. Earlier, when Ethereum was trading around its high, profitability reached an extreme level. So compared to that, there has been a bit of a cooldown. “Momentum is cooling off as the market takes a breather,” noted Maartunn. ETH Price Ethereum has suffered another 5% drop in the past day that has sent its price to $2,880.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum DAT|Ethereum treasury|ETHUSDT|HashKey|huobi,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 08:00:18

The “Pay like a local” feature, powered by Noah, enables users to pay directly to local shops through Mercado Pago and PIX using their stablecoin balances. Opera announced the update during the Ethereum Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and it is now available for the MiniPay wallet’s over 10 million users. The Noah-powered “Pay like a local” feature connects to the users’ MiniPay balances through Mercado Pago in Argentina and PIX in Brazil. In Argentina, Mercado Pago’s digital wallet has over 72 million active users and a 68% market share in the country’s payment ecosystem. In Brazil, the dominant financial “operating system” PIX is used by 76% of the population and processes 80% more transactions than credit and debit cards combined. By connecting to both, Opera says MiniPay is providing a bridge for digital dollar holders and travelers to pay like locals in economies where foreign cards often fail. Opera is using the new feature to enable instant utility for crypto users in these markets. Spark says this is about unlocking true spending power Murray Spark, the Head of Commerce at MiniPay, said his company is turning a stablecoin into a powerful and reliable tool for local spending. He added that this is about unlocking true spending power and delivering the smooth payment experience that travelers in the region want. Spark emphasized that the new feature will bridge MiniPay users’ stablecoin balances to the payment infrastructure that is central to Latin America’s commerce. Spark said that with the new feature, users will initiate transfers in MiniPay, see the quoted amount in USD, and MiniPay will handle the conversion and disbursement in local currencies (Brazilian Real or Argentine Peso) through the Noah integration. He further noted that MiniPay helps avoid card rejections, hidden fees, and unfavorable exchange rates. It also delivers a fast, transparent, and predictable way to spend stablecoin balances locally. “Once you’ve topped up your wallet, it’s important to be able to make real time payments with it.” – Murray Spark , Head of Commerce at MiniPay Spark also said MiniPay will now enable users to send and receive USDT with sub-cent fees, no gas management, and a phone number-linked experience. All these new real-time payment methods were rolled out during Devconnect, enabling a majority of crypto users attending the conference to make local payments. MiniPay plans expansion with El Dorado and Alfred integrations MiniPay also plans to integrate El Dorado, a P2P on- and off-ramp partner in the region. El Dorado helps users convert local fiat currency into USDT in minutes. It also facilitates instant money transfers and transparent pricing across six countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Opera also stated that Alfred will complement this footprint with compliant liquidity and cash-in/cash-out options across Latin America. Meanwhile, Paytrie, a Canadian MSB registered with FINTRAC, links Canada into the network to enable low-cost cross-border transfers between Canada, the U.S., and Latin America. Opera claims MiniPay is expanding its on- and off-ramp coverage in Latin America by onboarding the two additional ramp partners. The multi-ramp approach will provide users with consistent options to transfer value between local currencies and stablecoins across LATAM . Julia Syzndzielorz, Opera’s Director of Global Comms, also said support for PIX payments via QR code is set to be rolled out in the near future. The integration is designed to allow users to scan local QR codes and pay from their MiniPay wallets, instead of converting to USDT manually or relying on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Syzndzielorz pointed out that her company’s latest moves reflect a focused shift in the direction of crypto, away from speculation and toward real-world utility.

The semiconductor giant reported record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter ended Oct. 26, a 62% climb year-over-year and significantly above the $54.7 billion expected by analysts. Nvidia also announced quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, up 65% from last year, with full-year forecasts indicating demand for AI-related products remains robust. The upbeat report arrived amid a stretch of weakness for tech equities, as investors feared the sector’s rapid AI-driven gains could be unsustainable. Crypto and Tech Stocks Move Higher After Hours Shares of Nvidia climbed more than 5% to $196 in post-market trading after closing the session at $186.52. The positive earnings surprise triggered a broader rebound across crypto-linked companies, with Coinbase, Strategy and Circle Internet Group all seeing modest after-hours increases following declines earlier in the day. Crypto exchange Bullish also gained about 1% after the bell, reversing a portion of its 3.7% drop despite reporting its strongest quarter since going public. Major tech stocks including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta likewise moved higher in extended trading, reflecting improved sentiment across the broader sector. Bitcoin and Ether Recover from Intraday Lows The upbeat earnings report provided a lift to Bitcoin, which has suffered more than 10% losses over the past week during a broader market downturn. Bitcoin dipped to $88,540 late Wednesday, its first time below $89,000 since late April. The world’s largest cryptocurrency later climbed back toward $91,500 shortly after Nvidia released its earnings, easing some downward pressure. Ether experienced a similar trajectory, falling to $2,873 — its lowest level since mid-July — before recovering above $3,000. Analysts say the correlation between crypto assets and tech stocks appears to have strengthened as investors continue to treat both sectors as high-risk plays responsive to macro conditions. Nvidia’s robust results, they say, may offer short-term relief to markets that have been rattled by concerns over rate policy, slowing growth and potential froth in AI-driven valuations.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-20 08:06:17

The court ruling prohibits Maple from launching its competing product, syrupBTC, and from dealing in CORE tokens pending arbitration, while finding serious merit in Core’s claims of misuse of confidential information and exclusivity violations. The dispute stems from a partnership formed in early 2025 to create lstBTC, a product that enables Bitcoin holders to earn yield while maintaining their assets with institutional custodians like BitGo. Core Foundation alleges that by mid-2025, Maple began secretly developing syrupBTC, a rival offering that violated their 24-month exclusivity agreement, while continuing to accept Core’s capital, resources, and confidential information. https://t.co/p7qEjG6nq5 — Core DAO (@Coredao_Org) November 19, 2025 From Partnership Success to Alleged Betrayal Core Foundation and Maple Finance announced their lstBTC partnership at Consensus Hong Kong in February 2025, targeting Bitcoin investors seeking yield without sacrificing custody security. Core invested substantially in technical development, marketing, and subsidies, while Maple launched with under $500 million in assets. The Bitcoin Yield offering’s April 2025 launch catalyzed explosive growth for Maple, securing over $150 million in Bitcoin through an early over-the-counter version of lstBTC. That early traction demonstrated strong product-market fit for a Core-powered Bitcoin yield product, which Core claims became the catalyst for Maple’s alleged pivot to competing infrastructure. Core alleges that by mid-2025, Maple began misusing confidential information and work product while continuing to accept resources to develop syrupBTC, a rival offering that violated their 24-month exclusivity agreement. On September 26, 2025, Justice Jalil Asif KC ruled that there is a serious issue regarding Maple’s alleged breach of exclusivity and misuse of confidential information, with the judgment published on October 30, 2025. Court Rules Damages Insufficient The court determined that monetary damages would be inadequate due to the risk that Maple would dispose of CORE tokens and the irreversible head-start advantage a competing product launch would provide. The injunction prohibits Maple from using Core’s confidential information, launching syrupBTC or similar products, and dealing in CORE tokens without written consent. Rich Rines of Core DOA urged Bitcoin Yield lenders to “ strongly consider seeking independent legal advice ” before signing Maple agreements. To @maplefinance BTC Yield lenders: Before signing any agreement or waiver Maple sends you, strongly consider seeking independent legal advice. We do not believe they have a right to impair your BTC.

Questions Over Lender Asset Access Maple indicated it needs to declare impairment worth millions of dollars against Bitcoin Yield lenders, raising questions about asset accessibility and legal authority. Core maintains the Bitcoin should be held safely with reputable custodians in a bankruptcy-remote segregated portfolio, a structure Core specifically required during initial contracting to ensure assets remained ring-fenced and could never cover other Maple liabilities or exposures. The lstBTC product featured hedged protection, with CORE price volatility managed through put options procured from third parties, with Core Foundation serving as one provider. Core honored every put expiry for months, paying out millions of dollars, until it determined that it was directly subsidizing a competitive product following Maple’s alleged material breaches. As a result of this discovery, BitcoinYield removed Maple from its tracking database, citing potential fund losses and pending litigation, while Maple has also removed the Bitcoin Yield product from its website. However, Maple denies wrongdoing and pledges to pursue “ all available remedies aggressively, ” while Core maintains it will take legal action “ as far as necessary to protect the community. “ Maple Finance stands firmly in defense of lender rights and confirms there is no impact to our broader business operations as a result of the recent Core Foundation statement. The dispute is strictly limited to the pilot program conducted in partnership with Core Foundation for… — Maple (@maplefinance) November 19, 2025 The crypto sector has witnessed similar disputes in recent years, including Citadel Securities suing Swiss start-up Portofino Technologies in 2023 over alleged trade secret theft.

Its presence in central bank pilots, payment infrastructure, and regulated environments has expanded in visible ways. This progress prompted Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto commentator, to reshare a video about its future. In the video, he explained why he believes XRP’s position supports a long-term move toward $500. WAKE UP!!! This is why I believe in $XRP A digital asset infiltrating the global financial system like a virus silently, rapidly, and unstoppable. Even the maxis are getting nervous https://t.co/14AitchpAO pic.twitter.com/lKuvWA998a — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 17, 2025 Why Xaif Calls XRP a Strategic Asset Xaif opened with a direct claim. He said XRP is “quietly infiltrating the global financial system.” He called it a “10-year-old coin that the elites have written off,” yet argued that it now operates inside high-level financial infrastructure . He rejected the idea that XRP is only useful for cheap cross-border payments. He believes that this view ignores its expanding role across global settlement systems . He pointed to Ripple’s work with more than 70 central banks. He described XRP as a liquidity bridge that links fiat currencies, CBDCs, and tokenized assets. He also noted its integration into the ISO 20022 messaging standard. These developments suggest XRP’s participation in real settlement frameworks rather than speculative ecosystems. Regulatory Progress Xaif highlighted Ripple’s regulatory progress in the U.S. He referenced Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license and Federal Reserve master account access. He also drew attention to RLUSD’s presence and the upcoming automated market maker. He said these steps position Ripple to fit U.S. regulatory expectations. They also allow XRP to operate in regulated environments, further expanding its reach. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Tracking Integrations Inside Global Finance Xaif supported his view by pointing to active pilots. He mentioned Brazil’s CBDC test on the XRP Ledger and the Bank of England’s digital pound trial using Ripple’s technology. He added that the UAE and Saudi Arabia relied on Ripple tech in Project Aber. He also cited institutions such as Santander, SBI Japan, and Bank of America. These integrations place XRP inside established financial systems that manage regulated money movement. He contrasted this progress with issues he sees in competing networks. Xaif noted Ethereum struggles with layer 2 fragmentation and unclear regulation. This limits its use in banking, while XRP benefits from clear compliance and active institutional adoption . Why He Believes XRP Can Reach $500 Xaif linked XRP’s price potential to market structure. He noted that it must reach $40 to match Bitcoin and $5 to surpass Ethereum. He drew attention to its role in central bank pilots, regulated payment systems, and institutional programs. When combined with regulatory clarity and active integrations, these can help XRP reach $500. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

First is XRP, which is having an extremely hard time trying to break the resistance at $2.30. Currently, it is showing signs of bearish control while the intraday momentum weakens. If this price continues to consolidate, it could run the risk of further losses if support levels get too weak. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is having explosive growth and is garnering the attention of countless investors. The presale is selling out quickly and is now in Phase 6, which is 90% sold out. It is also showing the kind of demand that continues to put it ahead of the other major cryptocurrencies that have gone stagnant. This is a new cryptocurrency that continues to show potential and market presence while the other coins are struggling. XRP’s Bearish Battle XRP has renewed selling pressure and cannot sustain above recovery of vital selling pressure zones. Recently, the price leveling at $2.320 was swiftly retraced, dropping bearish sentiment at $2.250. The price is tragically now below each of the Simple Moving Average, of technical indicators, with traders signal retraced higher risk. The price has a bearish trend line on each of the hour’s charts with a recovery cap of $2.2550. With each minor price uptick, sellers have taken the price on each of their downtrends to satisfy the defensive market position. The price’s immediate future must maintain support at $2.150. If the price loses this level, the price downtrends fast towards $2.050. Mutuum Finance Presale Continues Amidst stagnation in XRP, investors can look to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto opportunity as well as its successful structured presale that has raised funds totaling $18,820,000 selling to 18,110 holders, growing at a fast clip. With its selling price at $0,035, MUTM is currently in Phase 6 and selling per token for 250% more than the original price in Phase 1. However, the current phase is 90% complete with price per token at $0.035 and primed to close fast. Phase 7 price will be $0.040 for a near 20% price increase. This is the last opportunity for investors to acquire tokens at a price lower than Phase 7. With such a positive presale transaction increase, investors are anticipating a price increase to $0.06 at launch. With such a fast closing presale, a positive crypto growth opportunity can be easily estimated, making many to view this as the best crypto buy opportunity. MUTM Leaderboard and V1 Protocol One of the key features recently introduced on the platform is a daily leaderboard within the 24-hour period that documents the top 50 holders, adding visibility and healthy competition during the presale period. Each day, the leader is rewarded with a bonus of $500 MUTM for everyday they complete a transaction during that 24-hour period. In addition, accessibility is improved at Mutuum Finance and surpasses a purchase threshold by implementing the ability to directly buy MUTM tokens with a card, simplifying the actions necessary to enroll new investors. Overall, the project’s foundation is robust since it has a set date for the V1 protocol’s introduction on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 . The operational milestone will include a live liquidity pool, mtTokens, both a debt-token and liquidator bot, which will facilitate lending and borrowing using either ETH or USDT as collateral. MUTM is now within the ranks of the top defi crypto projects, which reflects the operational milestone’s credibility and the project’s foundation’s tangible progress. A Definite Opportunity for Growth There is a stark contrast that can be observed. Currently, the price action for XRP is moving sideways, and its current price structure is bearish, giving traders very little to be excited about in the short term. In stark contrast to this, however, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining substantial momentum with its presale, which is expected to enter the next stage in record time. There is a substantial investment case to be made with the time left to purchase at the price of $0.035, the unique features and security of the project and the time left before this opportunity is expected to be gone. For investor planning the best possible course of action for investing for the highest potential for growth, the accelerating presale of this new cryptocurrency is gaining a huge amount of attention and is in need of immediate attention and action. Phase 6 will be the last opportunity to join cheaply before price hike, join now.

The level has acted as a cycle indicator in previous downturns, including the 2018 and 2021 bear markets. Analysts say the breakdown last week has raised questions about a possible shift in market momentum. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $91,974, suggesting a 0.82% increase in the last 24 hours. The market mood reflects that concern. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plunged to 10, mirroring panic conditions last seen in early and mid-2022. Over the past month, more than $700 billion has been wiped from the broader crypto market. The sharp reversal comes after Bitcoin’s second drop below $100,000 within a week, a move that triggered a wave of alarms across trading desks. On-chain signals strengthen those concerns. Bitcoin is now trading below the realized price for coins held for six to twelve months, which sits near $94,600. This group represents conviction buyers who typically accumulate in bullish phases. Trading below their cost basis suggests growing unrealized losses and the potential for forced selling if pressure intensifies. Futures markets also show rising stress. Perpetual futures open interest saw its largest weekly jump since April, adding more than $3.3 billion. Many traders placed dip-buying orders as Bitcoin slipped under $98,000. Those orders filled as the price dropped, adding leveraged long positions into a declining market and increasing liquidation risk if the downtrend continues. Technical Signals Split Analysts Veteran trader Peter Brandt has added weight to the bearish view. He pointed to a sweeping reversal pattern on November 11, followed by eight sessions of lower highs and the formation of a broadening top. His projected downside targets are $81,000 and $58,000. These levels align with prior structural support zones that marked key turning points in earlier cycles. Still, not all indicators confirm the start of a full bear market. Several analysts argue that Bitcoin is experiencing a mid-cycle breakdown, a period of instability within a longer bullish trend. They say the market needs additional confirmation before declaring a broader trend reversal. The next phase will depend on whether selling pressure accelerates and whether key support levels hold. Despite weak sentiment, one trend challenges the bearish narrative. Whale accumulation has increased during the decline. Addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC have grown in number, suggesting that large investors and institutions view current prices as attractive. This behavior has historically aligned with accumulation zones rather than capitulation phases. Macro Liquidity Counters Bearish Bias Macro conditions offer further support for the bullish case. Global liquidity remains high, with more than 80% of central banks currently easing policy. Broad monetary loosening has often benefited risk assets, and cryptocurrencies typically react strongly to expanding liquidity. Analysts point to the present environment as similar to pre-bull markets, where short-term corrections occurred even as liquidity conditions improved. Data from the Bank for International Settlements shows rising credit growth. US dollar credit expanded 6% year-over-year through the second quarter of 2025, while euro credit rose 13%. Expanding credit availability has historically supported asset valuations and increased market resilience during periods of volatility. Many macro strategists argue that as long as central banks continue to cut rates and increase liquidity, risk assets retain structural support. They note that cryptocurrencies, as frontier assets, tend to experience amplified gains during liquidity cycles. The current backdrop aligns with those past patterns.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 09:30:07

54649976,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=855951,1763631120,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54649976.jpeg,Why Bitcoin Hyper’s $28M Presale Has Next 1000x Crypto Potential,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/next-1000x-crypto-bitcoin-hyper-hits-28-million-upscales-bitcoin/,"What to Know: Bitcoin Hyper aims to turn Bitcoin into a fast, smart-contract-ready Layer 2 using SVM, canonical bridging, and ZK-secured rollups. The $HYPER presale has raised over $28.16M at roughly $0.013305 per token, with strong whale entries and active retail demand. Stakers can lock $HYPER for around 41% APY, with over a billion tokens already committed, aligning early holders with long-term network growth. Price models suggest multi-X potential if the roadmap lands, but competition, delivery risk, and market shocks make $HYPER a high-risk, high-reward bet. Bitcoin is at $92K now, but it doesn’t exactly feel like victory lap season. Price action is choppy, majors are flashing double-digit red, and on-chain data keeps reminding everyone that the original crypto is still slow, expensive, and allergic to smart contracts. Bitcoin processes around seven transactions per second, fees spike whenever activity returns, and most of DeFi, NFTs, and on-chain experimentation still lives on faster networks like Solana. That leaves a strange gap: the most valuable asset in crypto is mostly sidelined from the high-growth side of Web3. That gap is exactly what new Bitcoin Layer-2 projects are trying to close. Among them, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quietly pushed its presale past $28M at ~$0.013305/token, just as the market shifts back from panic to cautious dip-buying. Multiple market roundups now place it in the micro-cap, infrastructure-narrative bucket that speculators scan when they hunt the next 1000x crypto. Bitcoin Hyper’s pitch is simple but aggressive: turn Bitcoin into a high-throughput, smart-contract-ready Layer 2 while keeping Bitcoin-grade security. Under the hood, that means a Solana-style virtual machine, a canonical bridge for wrapped $BTC, and a rollup design secured with zero-knowledge proofs. Early investors have already staked over a billion $HYPER for yields around 41% APY, and whale buys in the hundreds of thousands of dollars ($500K just 6 days ago) suggest larger players are at least testing the waters. With the presale now past the $28M mark, the obvious question is whether Bitcoin Hyper is just another cycle narrative… or a serious contender for the next breakout Layer-2 play. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Bitcoin Into A DeFi-Capable Layer 2 At its core, Bitcoin Hyper is a rollup-style Layer-2 built specifically for Bitcoin. Users send $BTC to a monitored address on the main chain; an SVM-based smart contract verifies the deposit and mints an equivalent amount of $BTC on the Hyper network. Once bridged, that wrapped $BTC moves on a high-throughput chain with near-instant finality and sub-cent fees. Instead of forcing Bitcoin itself to run complex logic, Bitcoin Hyper batches transactions off-chain and periodically commits state back to Layer 1 using zero-knowledge proofs. That keeps the heavy security properties where they belong while shifting day-to-day activity to a faster execution layer. In practice, it lets Bitcoin behave like a settlement engine while Bitcoin Hyper handles payments, trading, and app activity. The Solana Virtual Machine is a key part of that design. By leaning on SVM tooling, Bitcoin Hyper lets developers deploy DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, games, and order-book DEXs with a familiar stack. Rust devs who already know Solana don’t need to relearn everything just to build on a Bitcoin-settled rollup. That cuts friction and gives the project a realistic path to a working ecosystem instead of a ghost chain. For anyone who wants exposure tied to Bitcoin and access to DeFi yields, NFT rails, and meme coin experiments, a $BTC-anchored Layer-2 like this is a clean narrative. If that thesis plays out and Bitcoin Hyper actually ships at scale, $HYPER stops being just a meme-wrapped token and starts looking like the core asset of a new Bitcoin DeFi stack. 📚 Read more about what Bitcoin Hyper is planning in our guide. Bitcoin Hyper Breaks $28M, Whales Continue Buying Stacks On the numbers side, $HYPER has already raised over $28M, placing $HYPER firmly in the early micro-cap bracket. The current stage price is $0.013305, up roughly 15% from the initial $0.0115, with fresh funding still flowing in despite broader market volatility. Presale buyers can also stake their tokens for 41% APY now, but this will drop as more people stake tokens. On the upside math, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction outlines a 2026 high around $0.08625, assuming the roadmap is delivered and liquidity lands on major exchanges. From today’s presale price of $0.013305, that implies roughly a 6.5x to the 2026 high if everything clicks. Longer term, $HYPER could push a 2030 high near $0.253, which would be a 20x-plus move versus early presale levels. 🤑 Here’s how to buy $HYPER before it hits $30M. This is exactly type of asymmetric setup presale hunters look for. A Bitcoin-settled rollup with audited contracts, a live staking program, and more than $28M already committed has a very different risk profile from pure meme plays with no tech. Some analysts are already tagging $HYPER as a potential high-beta proxy on Bitcoin’s evolution, and in a market obsessed with the next 1000x crypto narrative, that combination of real infrastructure and early-stage pricing is why it keeps popping up on watchlists.

The surge marked an all-time high in crypto-collateralized borrowing, but the market’s leverage is now better collateralized than during the 2021-2022 cycle. The analytics firm revealed that the surge was mainly driven by on-chain lending, which now accounts for about 66.9% of all crypto-collateralized debt. On-chain borrowing has surged from 48.6% at the previous peak four years ago, driven by collateralized debt positions (CDPs), stablecoins such as DAI, and lending applications. Borrowers abandon uncollateralized lending and shift to full-collateral models Data from Galaxy Research also showed that DeFi lending alone increased by 55% to an all-time high of $41 billion. According to the analytics firm, the surge was supported by points-driven user incentives and improved collateral types such as Pendle Principal Tokens. Centralized lending also grew by 37% to $24.4 billion. However, the centralized lending market remains a third smaller than its 2022 peak. The researchers noted that borrowers from the last cycle have largely abandoned uncollateralized lending and shifted toward full-collateral models. Galaxy Research believes lenders are moving towards collateralized models as they seek institutional capital or public listings. On-chan data revealed that Tether remains the dominant CeFi lender, holding nearly 60% of tracked loans. The USDT issuer also recorded its best quarter ever in terms of absolute loan book growth, expanding its book by almost $630 million. DeFi also saw a decisive shift in the third quarter, with lending apps now capturing more than 80% of the on-chain market. CDP-backed stablecoins shrank to 16% during the same period. “This is a notable shift away from synthetic, crypto-backed stablecoins towards the lending out of centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC.” – Zack Pokorny , Research Associate at Galaxy Research. Galaxy Research noted that new chain deployments, including Aave and Fluid on Plasma, helped fuel the activity. The firm found that Plasma attracted more than $3 billion in borrowings within five weeks of launch. On-chain data also showed that a leverage-induced wipeout occurred shortly after the end of Q3, resulting in the liquidation of more than $19 billion worth of perp positions. The October 10 wipeout was the largest single-day drop in crypto futures history. Hyperliquid recorded the most liquidations, totaling $10.08 billion over the 24 hours. Bybit and Binance also reported $4.58 billion and $2.31 billion, respectively. However, Galaxy’s report still claims the liquidation event showed no signs of broader credit deterioration. The firm argued that most positions were mechanically de-risked as exchanges’ auto-deleveraging systems kicked in. Corporate DAT strategies continue to rely on leverage The report also revealed that corporate digital-asset treasury (DAT) strategies continue to rely on leverage. Galaxy Research said it’s tracking more than $12 billion in outstanding debt tied to crypto-acquiring firms. On-chain data showed that total industry debt, including DAT issuance, hit a record $86.3 billion. Galaxy’s report revealed that the debt outstanding has remained stagnant through most of the year, with just $422 million added in the previous quarter. Galaxy also noted a 41.46% QoQ surge in futures Open Interest (OI), including perpetual futures, from $132.75 billion to $187.79 billion on September 30. Futures OI reached an all-time high of $220.37 billion on October 6. The drop in perps on October 10 also saw OI plummet 30% overnight from $207.62 billion the previous day to $146.06 billion by the end of the wipeout day. Galaxy Research stated that it tracked $24.37 billion of open CeFi borrows as of September 30. The firm also noted that CeFi borrowing has surged by $6.6 billion, or 37.11%, quarter-over-quarter, and $17.19 billion (+239.4%) since the bear market of $7.18 billion in Q4 2023.

The final prediction at this point came from Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson. Appearing on CNBC's Squawk Box program, Charles Hoskinson predicted $250,000 for Bitcoin (BTC). While this prediction comes amidst ongoing uncertainty for Bitcoin, Hoskinson said Bitcoin will regain its lost bullish ground and eventually reach unprecedented prices. Hoskinson believes that the cryptocurrency market will overcome the recent negativity and experience a strong recovery. At this point, he noted, Bitcoin will recoup most of the current 26.6% pullback in the next two quarters and reach $250,000 in about 12 months, namely towards the end of 2026. This prediction from Hoskinson indicates growth of approximately 170% from the current market price, pushing Bitcoin's value to $4.98 trillion. This is not the first time Hoskinson has predicted a $250,000 price for Bitcoin. Hoskinson, who has consistently stuck to Bitcoin's $250,000 price target, said last month that the timeline for Bitcoin to reach that price target was mid-2026. Now, he's just pushing the timeline forward a bit, stating that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2026. *This is not investment advice.

This innovative project represents a significant milestone in India’s journey toward digital currency adoption, blending traditional finance with cutting-edge blockchain technology. What Makes This Rupee-Linked Digital Asset So Revolutionary? The ARC project marks a pivotal moment for digital finance in India. Developed through a strategic partnership between blockchain giant Polygon and fintech startup Anq, this rupee-linked digital asset is designed to operate within the regulatory framework established by the Reserve Bank of India. The collaboration brings together Polygon’s extensive blockchain expertise with Anq’s innovative financial technology solutions. This rupee-linked digital asset represents more than just another cryptocurrency entry. It’s a carefully crafted digital representation of the Indian rupee, intended to provide stability while leveraging blockchain’s advantages. The limited initial operation scope demonstrates the cautious yet progressive approach regulators are taking toward digital assets. How Will ARC Transform India’s Financial Ecosystem? The introduction of this rupee-linked digital asset offers numerous potential benefits for India’s economy and its citizens. Here are the key advantages: Enhanced financial inclusion for millions of unbanked Indians Reduced transaction costs for cross-border payments Improved transparency in financial transactions Faster settlement times compared to traditional banking Regulatory compliance ensuring user protection Moreover, this rupee-linked digital asset could serve as a model for other emerging economies considering similar digital currency initiatives. The RBI’s involvement ensures that ARC will maintain the stability and trust associated with traditional currency while embracing digital innovation. What Challenges Does This Rupee-Linked Digital Asset Face? Despite the excitement surrounding ARC’s launch, several challenges remain. Technical infrastructure requirements, user adoption barriers, and maintaining price stability are significant considerations. The limited initial operation suggests a phased approach to address these concerns systematically. Security measures will be paramount for this rupee-linked digital asset. Polygon’s proven blockchain technology provides a solid foundation, but continuous monitoring and updates will be essential to protect against potential threats and ensure system integrity.

The most promising altcoins to buy now, based on investors' interest, are the Solana coin, TRX crypto and Digitap ($TAP) . Boasting significant upside potential—the recent launch of ETFs adds to its appeal—SOL is arguably the best crypto to buy now among the top altcoins. Additionally, TRON is set for a new peak, surpassing previous highs. Finally, $TAP, a low-cap coin at the intersection of DeFi and TradFi, is a must-have. By blurring the line between cash and crypto and having plenty of room to run, it has been hailed as the most profitable crypto presale of 2025. Digitap: Betting on the Next Big Thing – Why Are Whales Buying? Digitap's appeal spans its significant growth prospects and unique offering as an innovative payment solution. As an emerging cryptocurrency, its upside potential is staggering, prompting experts to hail it as the most promising crypto presale of Q4. Additionally, by enabling users to spend cash like crypto through a globally accepted Visa card, it is a game-changer. Its virtual and physical cards are co-branded by Visa for global acceptance online and in-store. Furthermore, these cards are fully integrated with Google Pay and Apple Pay, allowing users to tap to pay for a seamless payment experience. Equally important, as the world’s first omni-bank, users can hold more than one asset and spend from a unified balance. Amid imminent mainstream adoption, whales have been stacking up, pushing early funding past $1.8 million in record time. A 4,000% gain is projected this year after its market debut later this year, making it arguably the best crypto presale of 2025. USE THE CODE “DIGITAP15” FOR 15% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES Solana Coin to $1,000? Probably the Best Crypto to Buy Now The Solana coin, ranking among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, trades above $150 . Set for a breakout as sentiment tilts toward bullishness in Q4, analysts have hailed it as the best crypto to buy now. CryptoCurb, a top analyst with over 50,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), predicts the Solana coin will reach $1,000 , a bare minimum in their view. At its current price, it offers a low entry, making it a compelling investment option this year. Bulls pushing the altcoin price above its January all-time high of $294 may be the start of a significant uptrend. Additionally, substantial inflows into SOL ETFs will contribute to this surge in the Solana coin price. TRX Coin to Surpass Previous Highs? A Promising Wave Not to Miss TRX crypto is another altcoin on whales’ radars. In the top ten, it is a favorite among both institutional investors and small-scale traders. A 4% gain this week pushed the Layer-1 coin above $0.29, approaching a breakout above its 30-day high of $0.32. As one of the best penny cryptos of 2025, TRX crypto has substantial growth prospects. Its low cost makes it a favorite among retailers, considering they don’t have to break the bank before positioning for significant gains. This adds to its appeal as one of the most promising altcoins to buy in November. Stiven09, via a post on X, hints that the TRX crypto may surpass $0.36 and $0.45 in the near term . A breakout above this level will push the Layer-1 coin above its 2024 all-time high of $0.44 and may soar higher, placing it on the list of high-potential altcoins to buy ahead of the explosive Q4 rally. SOL, TRX & $TAP – Must-Have Cryptos in Q4 While the Solana coin and TRX crypto may enter price discovery, Digitap has more room to run as a low-cap coin. Besides the projected 4,000% rally after its market debut, the expected 371% gain at the launch price of $0.14 (the current price is $0.0297 in the second ICO round) makes it a must-have. Additionally, its blend of DeFi and TradFi, combined with its novelty as the world’s first omni-bank, positions it as the most promising crypto presale of 2025.

Unemployment held steady at 4.3%, the highest it’s been in four years. The job gains came in slightly better than August’s pathetic 22,000, but it’s still nowhere near what the economy used to crank out. This data came straight from the Labor Department’s delayed monthly jobs report, which was pushed back after the U.S. government froze for 43 days, the longest shutdown in history, and the delay came with consequences. October’s employment data is now gone. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, couldn’t run the household survey it uses to track the unemployment rate, so October’s figures were scrapped completely. The agency said it’ll combine October and November into one big dump now scheduled for December 16. Before that blackout even hit, the BLS had already estimated the U.S. created 911,000 fewer jobs between March 2024 and March 2025 than it had originally reported. Economists expect low hiring to stick around The slowdown wasn’t a surprise to Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University. “The labor market is clearly slowing, the assumption is that the trend is going to continue,” Sung said . “We’re going to be scratching the bottom for a while, but I don’t think we are going into recession.” The September job figure was pulled from a Reuters survey of economists who expected a slight pickup from August’s low number. But even that August number, economists argued, was likely pushed down by a seasonal data issue and could be revised upward later. Still, the general view is that the labor market doesn’t need to be adding much anymore. Between 30,000 to 50,000 jobs a month is now enough to match the working-age population’s pace, a sharp drop from the 150,000 monthly average needed in 2024. That drop-off is partly blamed on immigration policy. The flow of immigrants started slowing in Joe Biden’s last year in office and got worse under Trump’s current administration. That decline in immigration has shrunk the available labor pool, squeezing the job market from the supply side. Meanwhile, unemployment stayed mostly stuck between 4.1% and 4.2% throughout the year, only ticking up slightly in August. Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander U.S. Capital Markets, tied it all to labor supply. “This strongly suggests that the sagging pace of job growth is mostly, though not entirely, reflecting the shift in labor supply and that the labor market broadly has slackened slightly but not to a substantial degree,” Stephen said. AI, tariffs, and the Fed are shaping the jobs story AI is putting fresh pressure on the labor force, especially at the entry-level. Most of the jobs being cut are the ones meant for new graduates, locking many out of their first shot at full-time work. Economists are calling it jobless growth, where the economy might be expanding, but companies aren’t hiring. Trump’s trade policies are also being blamed. Business owners, particularly small ones, say the unstable trade environment is making it harder to hire. That chaos got a spotlight this month as the Supreme Court heard arguments over Trump’s use of tariffs , with justices questioning whether the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act gave him the right to impose them. Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College, said smaller companies are taking the brunt of it. “The environment is particularly detrimental to small and medium-sized enterprises; that’s where we’ve seen most of the employment losses,” Brian said. “This is a highly polarized economy.” September’s numbers could still matter for the Federal Reserve’s December 9–10 meeting, depending on how things look closer to then. The Fed won’t even have November’s job report in time, since it got delayed to December 16. That puts pressure on September’s data to tell the story. Minutes from the Fed’s October 28–29 meeting show policymakers are getting nervous about cutting interest rates again. Many warned that doing so could ruin their fight against inflation. Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale, said, “The Fed is itchy about cutting further. If you see a really weak report, that might move the Fed, but it would take a pretty weak report.” That weak report might already be here. And if not, we’re getting closer.

With fiscal policies hanging in the balance, GBP volatility has become a major concern for traders and investors alike. This comprehensive analysis explores how UK budget uncertainty continues to exert pound pressure across global financial markets. How UK Budget Uncertainty Creates Pound Pressure The current UK budget uncertainty stems from multiple unresolved fiscal decisions that directly impact sterling’s stability. Government spending plans, tax policies, and economic stimulus measures remain unclear, creating an environment of GBP volatility that traders must navigate carefully. This pound pressure reflects market concerns about the UK’s economic direction and fiscal responsibility. Understanding GBP Volatility in Current Markets GBP volatility has intensified as traders react to each new development in the budget negotiations. The sterling decline we’re witnessing isn’t just about numbers—it’s about confidence in the UK’s economic management. Several factors contribute to this situation: Unclear taxation policies affecting business investment Uncertain government spending priorities Mixed signals about deficit reduction targets Political divisions impacting fiscal decision-making Fiscal Policy Decisions Driving Sterling Decline The current fiscal policy landscape reveals why sterling decline has become so pronounced. Without clear direction on key economic matters, markets struggle to price the pound accurately. The table below shows recent GBP performance against major currencies: Currency Pair Recent Change Primary Driver GBP/USD -2.3% Budget uncertainty GBP/EUR -1.8% Fiscal policy concerns GBP/JPY -3.1% Risk aversion Navigating Pound Pressure as a Forex Trader For forex traders, understanding pound pressure dynamics is crucial for developing effective strategies. The current UK budget uncertainty requires careful risk management and position sizing. Consider these approaches: Monitor parliamentary debates and committee meetings Watch for official statements from the Treasury Track economic indicators that might influence budget decisions Use appropriate stop-loss orders to manage GBP volatility The Ripple Effects of Sterling Decline The ongoing sterling decline affects more than just currency markets. UK businesses face higher import costs, while exporters benefit from more competitive pricing. This creates a complex economic environment where fiscal policy decisions have far-reaching consequences beyond simple exchange rate movements. FAQs About UK Budget Uncertainty and Pound Pressure How does UK budget uncertainty affect cryptocurrency markets? UK budget uncertainty can influence cryptocurrency markets through several channels. When traditional currencies like GBP experience volatility, some investors seek alternative assets, potentially increasing crypto demand. However, the relationship is complex and depends on multiple factors. Which government entities are involved in UK budget decisions? The HM Treasury leads budget preparation, while Parliament must approve fiscal measures. The Bank of England monitors how budget decisions affect monetary policy and financial stability. What historical precedents exist for pound pressure during budget uncertainty? Previous episodes of budget uncertainty, such as during coalition governments or Brexit negotiations, have similarly caused GBP volatility. Markets typically react negatively to fiscal uncertainty until clear policies emerge. How long might the current pound pressure last? The duration of pound pressure depends on how quickly the government resolves budget uncertainties. Historical patterns suggest volatility could persist for several weeks or until clear fiscal direction is established. The alarming pressure on the pound underscores how crucial budget certainty is for currency stability. As UK budget uncertainty continues, traders must remain vigilant about GBP volatility and adapt their strategies accordingly. The sterling decline we’re witnessing serves as a powerful reminder that fiscal policy decisions have immediate and significant market consequences.

While BTC traded sideways, locked in a stalemate between bulls and bears around a key range, investors actively focused on structural opportunities within the Bitcoin ecosystem, Solana DEXs, and the L1/L2 scaling sectors. HTX data from November 10 to 17 show that high-quality assets across multiple sectors performed exceptionally, highlighted by BANK’s remarkable 97% surge in a single week. Bitcoin Ecosystem: BANK Leads With a 97% Weekly Gain The Bitcoin ecosystem was clearly in the spotlight this week. Momentum in the sector continued to build in the fourth quarter, driven both by the strengthening BTC Layer 2 narrative and active support for ecosystem assets from major centralized exchanges (CEXs). BANK’s exceptional performance also reflects the market’s strong conviction in the “next major breakout within the Bitcoin sector.” ● BANK (Lorenzo Protocol) : A modular Bitcoin L2 infrastructure built on Babylon. First launched on HTX in May, BANK surged 97% this week, fueled by community enthusiasm and an upgraded ecosystem narrative, securing its position as the top gainer of the week. L1/L2 Sector: SOON and STRK Rise as Funds Return The L1 public chain and Layer 2 sectors regained investor attention this week, leading to a general uptick in trading activity. Investor sentiment shifted toward “high-growth narratives and high-elasticity assets”. Compared to volatile meme coins or one-off spike tokens, the L1/L2 sectors showed a clear move toward a more sustainable growth trajectory. ● SOON : Up 80% for the week. Progress in ecosystem rollout and performance enhancements fueled renewed short-term interest, making SOON the top L1 performer of the week. ● STRK (StarkNet) : Gained 50% this week and stands out as the most representative growth asset in the L2 sector.

Meteora is a dynamic liquidity pool protocol on Solana that supports Automated Market Makers and token trading through its Dynamic Liquidity Management Mechanism (DLMM). This week’s gain reflects continued native ecosystem value discovery. ● ASTER (Aster) : Rose 20% this week, a standout performer in decentralized perpetuals (PerpDEX). The PerpDEX sector is largely driven by trading volume and market volatility. Privacy Sector: ZEC and DASH Post Solid Gains Privacy-focused assets often act as a risk-off hedge during periods of market volatility. With signs of regional regulatory stabilization, the sector is attracting renewed interest. The strong performance of ZEC and DASH underscores investor confidence in secure, forward-looking assets. ● ZEC (Zcash) : Up 12% for the week. As one of the pioneering privacy tokens, ZEC is built on zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARKs) technology and continues to provide foundational support for on-chain privacy protection. ● DASH (Dash) : Gained 10% this week.

Digitap ($TAP): New Omni-Bank Model With 500x Potential Digitap is an omni-bank that connects crypto wallets and fiat payments in one platform. It targets the gap between traditional banking and Web3, providing users with a single account that manages savings, yield, payments, and more. The appeal of this new approach to finance has already prompted $1.8 million of whale investment, especially since $TAP retails at just $0.0297, 80% discounted from its confirmed $0.14 listing price. The protocol further reinvests 50% of platform profits into token burns and staking rewards, creating sustainable value for long-term holders. Analysts suggest that if adoption scales as planned, a 500x return could be possible — taking $TAP toward $15 in the lng term. That projection depends on user growth and platform utility, but even a fraction of that target would make Digitap one of the best cryptos to buy now. The 500x projection from analysts is no doubt linked to $TAP’s global appeal. With light-touch compliance and zero-KYC access, anybody can download the application from iOS or Android today to send money to family, make payments at local stores, send invoices, etc. This opens the doors to the 1.4B globally unbanked, alongside first-world residents who are frustrated with the cost and intrusiveness of traditional finance. XRP’s Price History And Current Position XRP continues to serve its purpose in global payments, but most analysts agree its risk-reward balance is now modest. A further 3x or 4x might occur with broader adoption, yet the explosive gains that defined its early years are gone. XRP has grown from a launch price near $0.005 in 2013 to its current $2.45 — an impressive 490x return across a decade. Despite that, growth has slowed sharply since its last peak in 2018. Regulatory battles, changing liquidity channels, and limited retail inflow have capped price momentum. Many investors have started scanning for altcoins to buy with earlier-stage pricing and scalable ecosystems that can deliver faster growth. Long-term holders still view XRP as a reliable bridge asset for remittances, but its future gains are likely to be incremental rather than transformative. Institutional demand may stabilize price volatility, yet serious ROI now lies in emerging tokens that mirror Ripple’s early-stage potential. So while XRP might yet hit $10, an increase of nearly 4x, this is not something that will happen in the months or years to come. After experiencing explosive price rises from 2024 to 2025, it needs time to consolidate before reaching new highs. And even these highs will not compare to the price potential of better altcoins to buy in the crypto presale industry. The Gap Between Legacy And Growth XRP’s current valuation reflects maturity. It is widely used, liquid, and relatively stable — yet its upside is limited compared to earlier periods. Digitap, meanwhile, is still pre-launch and priced for growth, with the flexibility to capture market share in multiple sectors. Among active crypto presale projects, few offer the same mix of adoption, tokenomics, and revenue. This widening divide between legacy coins and adaptive banking protocols underlines a major market rotation. Institutional portfolios are diversifying into presales that mimic fintech models, where real revenue feeds token demand. That’s a dynamic that XRP can't easily replicate within its existing framework, catering mainly to large banks. Investors must consider that XRP is not particularly retail-friendly, with a primary focus on corporations and institutions. It lacks retail appeal and is therefore less marketable to certain demographics that require a functional product that seamlessly integrates fiat and crypto into one easy-to-use platform. So we could see both retail and institutional investors pivot to Digitap. Institutions for the upside potential, and retail users for its real-world utility as a live omni-bank that accepts payments at any Visa-compatible point of sale terminal. The Best Altcoin To Buy: Valuation-Based Investing Returns Investors tracking crypto to buy now trends are increasingly applying valuation analysis rather than sentiment. In that sense, Digitap’s early pricing resembles XRP’s in 2014, but with compliance, developed token mechanics, market appeal, and delivered utility. In contrast, XRP offers stability, not acceleration. The shift in capital preference shows a growing appetite for early crypto presales like Digitap, where risk is balanced by the possibility of triple-digit returns. Its 124% APY, 80% token discount, massive addressable market, and Visa-compatibility are unique USPs that could together serve to increase adoption and price. The bottom line is that XRP has already seen a 490x. Only $TAP can realistically offer similar returns to investors, with a 500x positioning it around the $15 mark. XRP might have been the best altcoin to buy around 2013, but $TAP is the best altcoin to buy now. Digitap is Live NOW.

Bitcoin Hyper introduces a modular Bitcoin Layer-2 using SVM, delivering extremely low-latency smart contract execution and Solana-style performance anchored to Bitcoin security. The most recent whale buys of a combined $134K have pushed the $HYPER presale past $28.1M, currently with a token price of $0.013305 and a staking APY of 41%. $HYPER targets a release window of Q4 2025/Q1 2026 and eyes a 1,801% return rate by 2030. Bitcoin has a new subplot. While $BTC relentlessly grinds onwards toward previous highs and ETF flows dominate headlines, the real structural shift is happening in infrastructure. Capital is rotating from meme coin-driven trades into base layers, rollups, and execution environments that can handle the next wave of users. That shift matters because Bitcoin, despite its $1.8T+ market cap, still settles around just seven transactions per second . Fees routinely spike during congestion. Native smart contracts remain limited, so most DeFi volume lives on alternative Layer-1s or Ethereum rollups – not on Bitcoin itself. Solana, on the other hand, processes thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality. Ethereum rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are capturing billions in TVL by acting as execution layers. Over the last year, several teams have tried to bridge that gap, from general-purpose sidechains to Lightning-based experiments. That is the backdrop against which Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is gaining attention. The Layer-2 project will combine Bitcoin’s settlement guarantees with a Solana-style execution layer that integrates the Solana Virtual Machine , aiming to give $BTC holders a full DeFi stack without migrating to other chains. The presale has already raised $28.1M, with tokens currently priced at $0.013305 and staking at 41% APY. And it’s going strong, targeting a Q4 2025/Q1 2026 release window. Whales have been circling the sale too. In the past 24 hours alone, two whales contributed a combined $134K to the presale tally. Meanwhile, the largest recorded whale buy so far is a hefty $502.6K , which came in less than a week ago. Discover more about this Layer-2 project in our Bitcoin Hyper review. Whales Like the Sound of Bitcoin Hyper Bringing SVM Speed To Bitcoin’s Trusted Network At the core of Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) design is a modular architecture, with Bitcoin Layer-1 used purely as a settlement layer and a real-time SVM-based Layer-2 handling execution. Transactions batch on the Layer-2 while state roots anchor back to Bitcoin at intervals, giving you Bitcoin’s finality while keeping throughput unconstrained at the execution layer. On Hyper’s Layer-2, the Solana Virtual Machine runs smart contracts written in Rust, a proven environment that already powers high-frequency trading bots, NFT marketplaces, and gaming primitives. Think ultra-fast smart contract execution and high throughput. Then there’s the canonical bridge , which will mint your $BTC onto the Hyper layer with near-instant execution. That means you’ll be able to transact in wrapped $BTC with low fees and near-instant confirmations, while relying on Bitcoin’s Layer-1 for settlement security. These tools make Bitcoin Hyper stand out – and whales are taking notice. Compared with other attempts to scale Bitcoin, such as Lightning or sidechains like Rootstock, the differentiation lies in execution speed and developer experience. Lightning excels at peer-to-peer payments, but struggles with complex applications. Rootstock brings EVM compatibility, yet has not achieved the throughput required for Solana-style trading environments. Bitcoin Hyper will handle both high-frequency DeFi and composable dApps from day one, contributing to a faster, cheaper, more scalable, and overall more performant Bitcoin ecosystem. For infrastructure-focused investors, that is why the raised amount and whale activity matter less as hype and more as a signal. $HYPER Presale Momentum Fuels Bitcoin Layer-2 Price Speculation With the Bitcoin Hyper presale already above $28.1 million at a token price of $0.013305, the obvious question is how the market could value a Bitcoin-focused SVM Layer-2 once mainnet liquidity arrives. Comparisons to existing ecosystems give a starting framework rather than a guarantee. Solana’s fully diluted valuation has topped tens of billions during peak cycles, supported by high throughput and a vibrant dApp ecosystem. Ethereum rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism each reached multibillion valuations while still in early adoption. If this SVM-based Layer-2 captures even 3% of the aggregate value currently locked across Bitcoin-adjacent scaling solutions and competing DeFi chains, a plausible scenario emerges. Under that assumption, our $HYPER price prediction suggests a potential 2026 price point of $0.08625, a 548% ROI over the course of 12 months. By 2030, we’re looking at a potential target of $0.253 or higher, 1,801% up from the current presale price. These projections assume several things: sustained $BTC strength, successful mainnet deployment, developer traction for Rust-based dApps, and a functioning decentralized canonical bridge for wrapped $BTC flows. Community hype will also help. Check out our step-by-step guide to buying $HYPER. For you as a participant, the important takeaway is not the exact target but the structural setup. The token is tied to a clear utility, staking yields are integrated into the network’s security and governance model, and the use of the SVM narrows execution risk by leveraging a battle-tested virtual machine. If Hyper manages to achieve its post-launch goals fast and the token lives up to its hype, $HYPER could become one of the best crypto presales of 2025. For traders seeking asymmetric exposure to the Bitcoin Layer-2 narrative, the combination of modular design, SVM execution, and wrapped $BTC use cases positions $HYPER among the best altcoins as well. However, if you want to support the project and diversify your portfolio, the opportunity window is closing fast. The launch of Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2 is imminent. Head to the official presale page and buy your $HYPER today. Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice. Always do your own research and invest wisely.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin may stay locked between $60K and $80K if the Fed holds rates steady in December. Falling cut expectations have already drained liquidity from risk assets, pushing Bitcoin below $90K. A record $72.2B in stablecoin reserves signals strong sidelined liquidity. The December FOMC is shaping up to be one of the most unpredictable in years. After the US government shutdown forced the Bureau of Labor Statistics to cancel the October jobs report and delay both October and November data, policymakers will head into the meeting with limited visibility. Fed Rate-Cut Odds Collapse to 40–50% as Officials Split Rate-cut expectations, once comfortably above 70%, have now fallen into the 40%–50% range, with Fed minutes revealing a sharply divided committee. A pause would signal that the Fed is wary of easing while inflation hovers near 3% and key labor indicators remain missing. Historically, tight monetary conditions drain liquidity from risk assets, a pattern already seen earlier this month when falling cut expectations triggered sharp drawdowns across equities and crypto. Bitcoin reacted immediately. As cut odds slipped, the asset fell below $90,000, erasing weeks of gains. Bitcoin Range Outlook if the Fed Does Not Cut Rates in December “If the Fed does not cut in December, Bitcoin likely trades between 60,000 and 80,000 dollars into year-end.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/u4gNtzIrhM — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 20, 2025 Analysts say the same dynamic is likely if the Fed stays cautious in December, with leveraged positions becoming more vulnerable in a low-liquidity environment. However, beneath the surface, there’s fuel for a rebound. Stablecoin reserves on exchanges have climbed to an all-time high of $72.2 billion, according to the chart shared by XWIN. Every major rally in 2025 has started with a similar build-up, sidelined liquidity waiting for a macro green light. If no rate cut materializes, XWIN expects Bitcoin to consolidate between $60,000 and $80,000 through year-end. Downward pressure comes from muted risk appetite, while upside remains capped until traders get clarity from the Fed. The key question is whether stablecoin reserves stay parked or begin rotating into Bitcoin once the December policy risk passes. Experts Reject ‘Crypto Winter’ Fears, Point to Stronger Market Foundations Despite the recent pullback, several analysts have told Cryptonews that the current downturn looks more like a macro-driven correction than the start of a prolonged freeze, pointing to institutional adoption, regulatory progress, and sector resilience as signs the foundation remains strong. Bitwise’s Danny Nelson and HashKey’s Tim Sun both argued that the market is far from a full-blown winter. They noted that, unlike previous collapses, the current cycle has not seen a catastrophic event like FTX, and that infrastructure improvements, from tokenization to stablecoin expansion, continue to strengthen the ecosystem. Other analysts highlighted that the absence of a euphoric peak and the impact of global liquidity make this downturn different from historical bear markets. As reported, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has also urged investors to look past Bitcoin’s sharp pullback, arguing that the cryptocurrency’s long-term value has little to do with its recent slide and everything to do with the service it provides.

Hill was sentenced for his role in operating a Bitcoin mixing platform that authorities say processed more than $237 million in known criminal proceeds. Hill was sentenced on November 19, just weeks after Samourai CEO Keonne Rodriguez received the maximum five-year term for the same scheme . Source: DOJ Court Records Show Samourai Wallet Team Promoted Mixing Tools to Hackers, Darknet Users According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, both men knowingly operated Samourai Wallet as a money-transmitting business designed to conceal illicit transactions. The company’s two core products, the Whirlpool mixing tool and the Ricochet transaction-hopping service, processed over 80,000 Bitcoin, valued at more than $2 billion at the time of the transactions. Prosecutors said the funds were linked to drug trafficking rings, darknet markets, cyber intrusions, fraud schemes, sanctioned jurisdictions, murder-for-hire operations, and a child pornography website. In court filings, the DOJ said Samourai’s founders not only understood how their tools were being used but also actively encouraged criminal users to adopt them. Hill promoted the mixer on the darknet forum Dread, assuring one user seeking to “clean dirty BTC” that Whirlpool was a superior tool for making funds untraceable. Rodriguez was also cited for publicly urging hackers on Twitter in July 2020 to send stolen funds into Samourai’s system. In private WhatsApp messages, he described mixing as “money laundering for Bitcoin.” Judge Denise L. Cote sentenced Rodriguez on November 6 to five years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, along with a $250,000 fine. Hill received the same fine and supervised release conditions. Both men have already forfeited more than $6.3 million in fees earned from Samourai operations, and the DOJ said the forfeiture satisfied an order seeking over $237 million in traceable criminal proceeds. DOJ Tightens Grip on Crypto Platforms Linked to Illicit Finance The sentencing caps a turbulent legal process. Earlier this year, lawyers for the founders accused prosecutors of withholding FinCEN guidance stating that Samourai, as a non-custodial wallet, did not require a money transmitter license. Prosecutors nevertheless maintained that the platform exerted “functional control” over user assets and proceeded with the case. @SamouraiWallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill are set to reverse their plea to “guilty” in a high-profile crypto privacy case, according to New York court filings. #SamouraiWallet #CryptoMixers https://t.co/8aHVgJKESf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 Rodriguez and Hill ultimately pleaded guilty in July to conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business after facing an initial set of charges that included money laundering and sanctions violations. The Samourai case lands amid a wave of high-profile prosecutions targeting crypto founders and privacy tool developers. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao received a four-month prison sentence in 2023 after pleading guilty to anti-money-laundering violations . He has, however, been granted a presidential pardon . FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence , while BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed were charged for failing to implement AML controls . Russian operator Alexander Vinnik, Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht , and the husband-and-wife duo behind the Bitfinex hack, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan , have all faced major laundering charges. More recently, Virtual Assets LLC founder Firas Isa was indicted for allegedly running a crypto ATM network that laundered at least $10 million in fraud and drug proceeds . The DOJ’s focus comes as new data highlights the speed and scale of crypto laundering. A Global Ledger report found that $3 billion in digital assets were stolen in the first half of 2025 alone, with one-quarter of cases seeing funds fully laundered before any public alert. Investigators warn that stolen assets can now move through laundering pathways in minutes , narrowing the window for recovery to near zero. Hackers are stealing more crypto and moving it faster. One laundering process took only 2 minutes 57 seconds. Can the industry cope? #CryptoSecurity #Web3 #Blockchain #DeFi https://t.co/lGwutYsT6Q — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 12, 2025 For U.S. authorities, the sentencing of Samourai’s founders is another signal that the government intends to aggressively pursue developers whose platforms become conduits for criminal finance, regardless of whether the technology is open-source or non-custodial.

54650919,631211,1763632732,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54650919.jpeg,Dogecoin’s On-Chain Turnaround Is Putting the Best Meme Coins Back on the Menu,https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-to-watch-as-dogecoin-signals-market-shift/,"Quick Facts: Dogecoin’s improving net position change and MFI profile hint at renewed meme-coin demand and potential accumulation. Further pushing this demand is the highly anticipated launch of Grayscale’s ETF that tracks Dogecoin, expected to start trading next week. Apart from $DOGE, several new meme coins are also drawing attention as the market rotates to riskier assets. Among these are Maxi Doge, which turns high-leverage trading culture into on-chain staking, leaderboards, and a well-funded treasury structure, and PEPENODE, whose mine-to-earn design uses gamified virtual nodes to distribute tokens and drive user engagement. Dogecoin’s ($DOGE) on-chain profile is quietly shifting, while most traders stare at Bitcoin’s ($BTC) range. The coin’s Money Flow Index (MFI) is currently hovering below 40 , which is a level institutions and whales typically start accumulating. While this doesn’t signal a reversal yet, it could spark one when other traders catch on and FOMO builds up. Net spot flows remain negative , but the pace of outflows is slowing, and large holders appear to be absorbing liquidity rather than dumping into strength. On the other hand, institutional interest in $DOGE remains strong. In particular, traders have their eyes on Grayscale’s Dogecoin-tracking ETF, which could start trading next week . For traders watching the rotation, this is where things get interesting. When legacy memes stabilize and whales quietly add, the next phase often belongs to higher-beta plays further out on the risk curve, such as best meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) and PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , along with the ever-faithful $DOGE. Read on to learn more about each coin below: 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Leverage Culture Wrapped in a Meme Economy Maxi Doge takes that resurgent meme demand and targets a specific behavior pattern: high-conviction, high-leverage retail trading. Instead of promising utility it can’t deliver, Maxi Doge leans into the 1000x mentality that already dominates perp exchanges. The project brands itself as a 240-pound canine powerhouse, a caricature of the trader who never skips leg day and never skips a pump. That framing matters, because it informs how the ecosystem is structured. Get a full lowdown on the project in our ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ page. From a capital formation perspective, the project has already raised over $4.1M in its ongoing presale at a token price of $0.000269. That figure is important. It signals meaningful retail participation without yet pushing valuations into late-cycle territory. Learn how you can get your share of $MAXI tokens in our Maxi Doge buying guide . Helping the project stand out is its culture turned into an on-chain structure. Holder-only trading competitions reward top ROI performers rather than simply rewarding size. Leaderboards and meme-first gym-bro marketing push users toward active trading, ‘lift, trade, repeat’ behavior, and social bragging rights. In practical terms, Maxi Doge is building a vertically integrated meme and trading community rather than a static token. You can also stake your purchased tokens if you prefer. The staking rewards are set at 74% APY at the moment, which can still change as more tokens are locked in the staking pool. Go for max gains. Join the Maxi Doge presale. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine-to-Earn Approach to Meme Distribution PEPENODE attacks the same meme liquidity window from a different angle, focusing on gamified mining economics instead of leverage culture. Billed as the world’s first ‘mine-to-earn’ meme coin, PEPENODE wraps token distribution inside a virtual mining framework. When the platform launches, you’ll be able to spin up virtual nodes, climb through tiers, and earn rewards based on participation intensity rather than simple buy-and-hold behavior. The experience feels closer to a browser game with on-chain rewards than a standard ERC-20 launch. Powering the project is its native $PEPENODE token. Right now, you can buy these tokens via the PEPENODE presale page for $0.0011546 each. Using this token, you’ll be able to upgrade your rig and enjoy governance rights. Holding it will also give you the chance to receive additional bonuses in the form of famous meme coins like Pepe and Fartcoin. Want to join the PEPENODE presale? Read our guide on how to buy $PEPENODE for more details. To date, the presale has already raised over $2.1M. It’s a clear stamp of approval among investors about the project’s promise. Staking is available at a whopping 594% APY, and if you HODL, our PEPENODE price prediction puts its potential value between $0.0021 and $0.0072 by the end of 2026. However, this will largely depend on its presale performance, the game’s successful launch, and CEX and DEX listings. Don’t be left behind. Buy $PEPENODE tokens today. 3. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – Legacy Liquidity and Payment Utility Dogecoin still sets the reference point for meme-coin liquidity and depth. Launched in 2013 as a joke, it evolved into a peer-to-peer asset used for low-fee, quick payments, tipping, and microtransactions across social platforms and merchant gateways. Transaction fees have typically been a fraction of a cent with confirmations arriving in about a minute, which keeps it usable even outside speculative cycles. Since its launch, many meme coins have tried to emulate $DOGE’s success. Currently, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has been the closest to succeeding, but with newer players like $MAXI, time will tell how long Dogecoin can remain on the throne. $DOGE’s strength is its network effect. It enjoys broad exchange support, from tier-one spot venues to major derivatives platforms, which means deep order books and efficient price discovery during volatility spikes. The coin’s influence also expanded, thanks to the likes of Elon Musk, who occasionally posts mysterious Doge-related posts on his X page. This typically leads to $DOGE pumping time and again. Large holders and institutional products, including new investment vehicles reported by mainstream financial outlets, have started to treat it as the beta play on wider retail sentiment. When net position change moves back into positive territory and MFI signals accumulation, it often precedes multi-week periods where $DOGE outperforms majors on a risk-adjusted basis. In that environment, smaller memes that echo its cultural appeal can see disproportionate inflows as traders look for higher torque. If you track market structure first, Dogecoin remains the benchmark to watch. Buy $DOGE on Binance. As Dogecoin’s net position change turns positive and MFI hints at quiet accumulation, meme risk is back on traders’ dashboards. Dogecoin anchors liquidity, Maxi Doge channels high-leverage trading culture into on-chain competitions, and PEPENODE experiments with mine-to-earn mechanics. This combination of the OG along with new meme coins can be a potent mix in anyone’s portfolio once riskier investments make a comeback.

This entire cycle, BTC has respected the 50-week moving average, but now Bitcoin has lost this level, and sentiment is the worst it has been since February. The Fear and Greed Index reads 10 (Extreme Fear ), and retail investors are getting cold feet. But even in this environment, crushing animal spirits, flows are gravitating towards strong crypto presales. Digitap ($TAP) has smashed $2 million raised, and $TAP is up more than 150% from its first round price of $0.0125. Markets are rotating into utility and searching for relative strength. Digitap’s omni-banking app, Visa card, and user adoption are providing the winning ticket. The best altcoins to buy all have cash flows and value accrual built into tokenomics. While everyone is flipping bearish, here’s why Digitap could be among the best cryptos to buy now heading into 2026. Bitcoin Bear Market Begins: What Losing the 50-week Moving Average Means The 50-week moving average has functioned as the ultimate support for this entire cycle. Losing this key level changes the entire rhythm, and it appears that the four-year cycle believers were correct. Bitcoin needs to reverse quickly; otherwise, this weekly close will likely mark the beginning of another bear market. ETH inflows have drastically reversed with institutions selling aggressively, and doubts about the AI supertrend, along with the probability for a rate cut falling below 50% add to macro pressures. If equities roll over here, BTC could easily target $84,000, and as distribution begins in earnest, that’s why smart investors are rushing into utility-led crypto presales. Digitap Raises $2 Million in Record Time Digitap inflows haven’t appeared out of thin air. The team has already shipped a working app available on iOS and Android. They have issued virtual and physical Visa cards, including non-KYC virtual issuance, with same-day support for Apple Pay and Google Pay. But what is Digitap? This omni-banking app offers a single account with multiple rails, supporting both crypto and fiat. No more silos, just a fluid experience for managing all forms of value. It taps digital-first finance (how the majority of Gen Z and Millennials manage their money) and aims to disrupt several trillion-dollar industries simultaneously, such as remittances and cross-border payments, by using a dual approach. Under the hood, Digitap operates a multi-rail architecture: established banking corridors (SWIFT, SEPA, ACH, Faster Payments) sit alongside public blockchains. An AI-powered routing brain selects the corridor that clears best in terms of speed, fees, and FX. The end result for users is an interface that feels like a modern neobank but with all the crypto firepower underneath. Why Digitap Leads the Pack of Altcoins to Buy in a Risk-Off Environment This market clearly wants prudcits with distribution, cash flows, and outsized growth potential in market-agnostic sectors like payments. Digitap blending fiat and crypto and unlocking better settlement for an industry that processes trillions of dollars in volume annually is an enormous growth surface. This is the type of real-world utility that can flourish in a risk-off environment. Digitap is also supported by the secular tailwinds of stablecoin growth and booming demand for remittances and cross-border payments, which remain in secular bull markets. The $TAP token design is also next-gen. Instead of a useless governance token, $TAP accrues real value. The total supply is fixed at 2 billion, and Digitap dedicates 50% of platform profits to purchase and burn $TAP as well as reward stakers. This means automatic buy pressure and passive income for holders. That’s why the current price of $0.0313 looks undervalued, and $TAP ranks among the best cryptos to buy now for investors bullish on cash flows and value capture. Digitap’s Crypto Presale Offers Safe Haven While BTC Bear Market Begins The market can be bearish, and the top altcoins to buy can still perform excellently. This is a classic sign of a maturing market as asset selection becomes more important. BTC breaking the 50-week moving average will force traders and investors to reassess their positioning. Digitap raising $2 million in this environment shouldn’t be ignored, and this crypto presale is showing clear relative strength. While most altcoins look ready to print fresh lows, Digitap’s omni-banking services are ready to usher in a new era of digital finance. $TAP looks like one of the best cryptos to buy now, and early presale momentum vindicates this view. With a confirmed listing price of $0.14, investors will have to move fast to lock in the current price. Digitap is Live NOW.

According to a press statement released by GoMining on Thursday, the new program will help users start mining immediately with just a fraction of the miner’s cost, while spreading the remaining payments over three months. Much similar to the buy now, pay later concept used to buy goods in traditional markets, GoMining wants to help more miners who lack the resources to solve Bitcoin’s cryptographic equations by reducing upfront costs and simplifying payment schedules. GoMining to offer mining resources after a 25% down payment The Mine Now, Pay Later model requires users to pay a 25% down payment for a digital miner, with the balance distributed over monthly installments for up to 90 days. The program is structured to be interest-free, so the total payments will never exceed the standard miner purchase price. Users can also pay off the remaining balance early if they wish, either by clearing the full sum at once or by prepaying upcoming installments. Once the first payment is made, miners begin generating Bitcoin, which GoMining insists they can “withdraw immediately.” However, some advanced features like miner upgrades are only available after the full balance is cleared, and the miner will become fully transferable and tradable following a 90-day clearance period. The payment model is embedded on Ecommpay, a global full-stack payment service provider for growing, mid-sized, and large financial firms. Miners purchased via MNPL are eligible for additional perks, including access to GoMining’s VIP program ; However, the option is not available in regions with card restrictions or compliance limitations. “Digital miners purchased through GoMining are virtual representations of physical mining equipment. Each miner corresponds to a specific unit of computing power operated within GoMining’s infrastructure across data centers in the US, Africa, and Central Asia. Ownership grants users the right to receive real Bitcoin output,” the company wrote in its statement. Mark Zalan, CEO of GoMining, said the program would lift the weight of the heavy initial cost that new and small-scale miners have been facing. “For many people interested in mining, the biggest barrier has always been the initial cost. Mine Now, Pay Later’ directly addresses that. It allows users to participate in the mining economy immediately while spreading the cost gradually and transparently,” CEO Zalan surmised. Bitcoin mining profit margin below 50%, is it still worth it? Bitcoin mining is not as profitable as it was a decade ago due to its rising network difficulty, and the energy demands of running competitive hardware that come with it. According to data from Coinwarz, the current Bitcoin difficulty is 152.27 T, with an expected adjustment to 149.04 T in late November. The level of difficulty and operational costs has made solo mining largely unprofitable for individual operators, while institutional entities count about 41% returns from their investments in mining rigs and warehouses. Last week, market analytics firm Luxor reported that Bitcoin’s hashprice has dropped to a five-year low of $38.2 per PH/s. A Hashprice is the expected daily revenue a miner can earn for each terahash per second of computing power. Bitcoin’s network hashrate is also at near record levels, averaging over 1.1 ZH/s over the past seven days. The king coin’s market slump this week has dragged it down to around $91,000, 30% lesser than its October all-time high above $126,000. A price pullback could cause a demand effect that could drive more miners to power up their rigs, which would cause the network to increase the difficulty to restore the 10-minute interval at the next adjustment. GoMining CEO Zalan agrees it is “no longer profitable to operate on your own,” but it is still lucrative when done using shared resources as the company’s new program proposes. “Our goal is to make Bitcoin mining accessible for regular people. We’re Bitcoin maxis, true believers in BTC, and we want to expand towards bringing other economic benefits on top of Bitcoin,” he said during the European Blockchain Conference held in late October.

His Truth Social posts make or break crypto markets, and he’s even launched his own meme coin ($TRUMP). Best of all, much of the current market’s bullish momentum is due to Trump’s pro-crypto agenda.

From Tokenized Trump Hotels to SUBBD Token: Real-World Assets Meet Trump Crypto November 20, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Trump’s Maldives hotel deal with Saudi Arabia’s Dar Global is all about turning a luxury resort with roughly 80 villas into tokenized slices of ownership, so investors can get in at the development phase instead of waiting for ribbon-cutting day. At the same time, Saudi Arabia has registered over 4,000 blockchain firms in 2025 , grown that base by 51% year-on-year, and pushed $48 billion in crypto transactions across 3 million active users, while also planning a tokenized stock market. That kind of scale shows tokenization isn’t a side quest anymore; it’s becoming the default way capital moves. If you want exposure to that shift without tying everything to one region or property, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) leans into the same on-chain ownership trend for the creator economy instead. It powers a Web3 subscription and content platform, with staking, AI-driven creator tools, and audits backing the smart contracts, while its presale has already raised $1.35+ at just $0.056975 per token, leaving plenty of asymmetry if adoption ramps. Read more about SUBBD Token in our guide. AI-Fueled Nvidia Rally, Bitcoin Hyper Presale, and the Trump Crypto Rotation Trade November 20, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Nvidia just printed blockbuster Q3 numbers and helped pull $BTC back above $91,000 after a dip below $89,000, proving AI risk appetite is still very much alive even as a Bank of America survey shows 45% of fund managers see an AI bubble as the top market threat. At the same time, the global crypto market has erased over $1T in value in six weeks, roughly a 25% drawdown, reminding you that high-beta narratives cut both ways. When correlations between crypto and big tech climb, liquidity tends to favor infrastructure that can actually handle the next wave of throughput, not just fresh memes. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets that lane directly as a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, shifting $BTC from ~7 TPS to a high-throughput, seconds-level execution environment while a canonical bridge lets you deploy bridged Bitcoin into DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. With security audits completed and $28.16M+ already raised at $0.013305, you’re effectively paying a presale price to front-run a potential liquidity rotation into Bitcoin scaling if the AI–crypto risk trade stays in play. Buy $HYPER before the next price increase.

54651034,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90129,1763632840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Mutuum Finance Dominates Whale Attention as Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Momentum in November 2025,https://timestabloid.com/mutuum-finance-dominates-whale-attention-as-shiba-inu-shib-loses/,"November 2025 has brought a noticeable shift in the crypto whale market, as long-time favorites like Shiba Inu (SHIB) begin showing signs of fading momentum. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to maintain traction amid cooling hype and a broader market slowdown, whales are increasingly turning their attention to promising new crypto projects that combine early-stage opportunity with real utility. One such project capturing the spotlight is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with over 90% already sold out, MUTM is emerging as one of the top cryptocurrencies attracting serious investor interest. Its innovative DeFi protocol, growing community of over 18,000 holders, and imminent V1 testnet launch on Sepolia are positioning MUTM as a potential breakout token, drawing capital away from older, stagnating memecoins and signaling a new era of strategic whale investment. Shiba Inu Eyes Short-Term Bounce Amid Market Uncertainty Shiba Inu (SHIB) is attempting a rebound after finding support near $0.00000900, forming a tightening triangle pattern following a prolonged downtrend. Technical indicators suggest a short-term bullish bias, with a confirmed breakout above $0.00001050 potentially propelling momentum toward the $0.00001200 target line. Traders are closely watching this setup, aware that failure to hold the $0.00000900 support could trigger a retest of $0.00000850 before another rebound attempt. While SHIB navigates this delicate phase, the shifting focus of market participants towards Mutuum Finance, a new crypto with real DeFi utility, highlights the increasing attention on innovative opportunities like those emerging in the current market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Last Opportunity to Buy at $0.035 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is experiencing tremendous presale activity, emerging as one of the top cryptocurrencies with high potential gains. So far, the presale has raised over $18.8 million and attracted more than 18,080 unique holders. The presale is currently in Phase 6, the last and crucial phase, with tokens priced at $0.035. Phase 6 is now over 90% sold out, making this the final opportunity for interested investors to purchase tokens at this exclusive pricing. Once Phase 6 concludes, Phase 7 will begin as an advanced stage, with token prices set to increase. This progression gives investors a clear chance to buy now at a lower, affordable rate before the next price adjustment. This presale positioning, combined with strong community interest and increasing token value, establishes Mutuum Finance as one of the top cryptocurrencies and a must-watch new crypto for 2025. Mutuum Finance Development: Sepolia Testnet Launch The development of Mutuum Finance’s platform is progressing smoothly and on schedule, achieving critical technical milestones. The first iteration of the lending and borrowing platform is advancing well, setting the stage for the highly anticipated Sepolia testnet , expected this quarter. The Sepolia testnet will play a crucial role in validating the platform’s overall functionality. It will demonstrate essential DeFi features, including lending, borrowing, and yield farming, and provide the development team with the opportunity to fine-tune and optimize these functionalities ahead of the mainnet launch. Mutuum Finance is committed to delivering a robust, functional, and utility-focused DeFi platform. By integrating all essential features, it aims to meet the needs of a broad user base and reinforce its status as a high-potential new crypto project attracting unprecedented attention in the DeFi ecosystem. Top DeFi Crypto to Buy Before Phase 6 Sells Out Mutuum Finance has raised over $18.8 million, attracted more than 18,080 investors, and sold over 90% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. With Phase 7 set to increase the price, this represents the final opportunity to secure tokens at early-stage pricing. The platform’s imminent V1 launch on the Sepolia testnet, combined with real Ethereum-based DeFi utility, lending and borrowing functionality, and a growing community, positions MUTM as one of the top cryptocurrencies for 2025. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now should act quickly to participate before Phase 6 sells out, capturing exposure to a potential breakout DeFi token attracting whale-level attention, and establishing MUTM as the new crypto with unmatched early-stage potential.

This bold forecast, made in April, came at a time when Bitcoin was trading at $77,000 after achieving a record high of $109,000 in January. Hoskinson’s Optimistic Bitcoin Price Forecast Hoskinson’s optimism was based on his belief that international negotiations, particularly between the US and China, would favor Bitcoin’s growth. The Cardano founder suggested that easing tariffs would lead to a positive market reaction and bolster adoption, particularly with the anticipated passage of the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law by President Trump a few months later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dips Below $90,000—Yet Altcoins Remain Unscathed: Here’s Why However, the current market realities have raised doubts about Hoskinson’s prediction. Since then, Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations, briefly regaining momentum to reach $126,000 mid-October, only to see the broader crypto market subsequently shed over $1 trillion in total market cap. This downturn has largely been attributed to persistent selling pressure by concerned investors, and substantial outflows from the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector, with nearly $2 billion sold over since October. As it stands, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $89,300, marking a nearly 30% decline from its recently achieved all-time highs. In light of this, Jacob King, CEO of Swandesk, publicly dismissed Hoskinson’s $250,000 price target, characterizing it as unrealistic. Is Bitcoin In A New Bear Market Cycle? In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), King stated that such lofty price predictions are “pulled out of thin air” and reflect a market still grappling with “delusions.” King elaborated on his viewpoint, suggesting that the industry is in the early stages of a new bear market cycle. He is not alone in this assessment. Market expert Lark Davis recently noted that, based on the classic four-year Bitcoin price cycle, the cryptocurrency has officially entered bear market territory. Davis commented that this scenario leaves two possibilities: either the established four-year cycle is no longer relevant, or the market has indeed shifted into a bearish phase. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, he leans toward the latter interpretation.

An analyst known as Mr. Wall Street has recently speculated that the Bitcoin price peaked at $126,000. The analyst believes that this may mark the zenith for this cycle, predicting that the Bitcoin price could next face significant downward pressure, potentially slipping to a range between $74,000 and $82,000. He further forecasts a possible decline to levels between $54,000 and $60,000 by the fourth quarter of 2026.

The shifts signal a readiness to take profits or restructure portfolios, as BTC is once again seeking direction. BTC flows to exchanges remained elevated in November, with a total of 580,000 BTC flowing to centralized markets. Compared to last year’s period, exchange flows are smaller. However, the recent shift to spot trading and exchange deposits arrives as BTC has made several dips below $90,000. Binance still leads in deposit volumes, with 163,800 BTC moving in. Coinbase absorbed 130,000 BTC. As the recent balance on exchanges shifted, BTC traded just below $92,000. The recent dips as low as $88,000 were once again linked to liquidating long positions, rather than signs of selling pressure or capitulation. Binance switched to BTC inflows in November On Binance, BTC started flowing back to the exchange since the end of October, after a boost for spot trading. The inflows coincided with BTC price weakness, as the leading coin lost its previous positions above $110,000. Smaller markets like Bybit and OKX did not see a spike in BTC deposits. Some of the reasons may include coin movements from US-based investors, who are the most active in Q4. Additionally, the Coinbase flows are linked to institutional platforms, absorbing some of the recent ETF selling. BTC reserves on Binance started climbing since late October, signaling a switch to spot trading, along with a rise in whale activity. | Source: CryptoQuant . Binance has also originated the most significant sales during BTC downturns, often deepening the slide and causing a wave of liquidations. The exchange absorbs BTC both during bullish periods for profit-taking, and for active trading. Binance also carries a record supply of stablecoins, offering significant exit liquidity. Some of the BTC deposited may also be held as collateral to open derivative positions. BTC is moving on-chain BTC started shifting on-chain since September, increasing the Coin Days Destroyed metric . The moving supply accelerated in the past two months, coinciding with a period of more volatile trading. Some of the reasons may include ETF turnover, exchange arbitrage, or posting collaterals. The on-chain movements also coincided with the rise of perpetual futures DEXs, which also require collaterals. The increased inflow of coins does not coincide with an increase in active addresses. The deposits originate from a relatively small number of wallets. The recent activity is usually connected to whales, especially new wallets making strategic moves. BTC orders also reflected the increasing influence of whales. Since the beginning of October, BTC order sizes have increased, signaling ongoing whale activity. The shift arrived after a period of neutral or retail-based buying in October. The market switched to whale orders in November, as the price weakness led to attempts to re-buy BTC at a lower range. | Source: CryptoQuant . The recent whale activity also gives hopes of re-accumulation and restructuring, before continuing with another BTC bull cycle. So far, even at an unfavorable cost basis, most BTC owners are not capitulating from their spot positions. The 2025 market also offers additional hedging opportunities, with peak open interest and volumes for options trading, and increased derivative trading activity.

According to the analysis, XRP’s latest climb was expected near the anticipated subwave 3 low. XRP Climbs Off Critical Fib Level The asset also met its RSI support trendline, which indicated conditions for a possible short-term bounce, and that a move back to $2.26 is still possible. Despite the volatility, the analyst stated that such chop is typical of overlapping Wave 4 structures, and the focus remains on the larger trend. XRP hovers above the macro 0.5 Fibonacci support at $2.03, which is being described as one of the most significant levels in the ongoing correction. CasiTrades stated that $2.03 could serve as the final low of the entire wave 2 correction, especially if Bitcoin simultaneously reaches its own support at $88,000, thereby creating a strong confluence for a potential macro bottom and the beginning of a larger Wave 3 that could push XRP to new all-time highs. However, the analysis also outlines an alternate scenario where the altcoin breaks below $2.03 and extends its decline to the macro 0.618 level at $1.65. In that case, the analyst expects a bounce near $1.84, followed by a move back to $2.00 to retest it as resistance before a final drop toward $1.65. Under this deeper correction path, Bitcoin would likely continue downward toward its macro 0.382 retracement at $80,000. Despite these possibilities, the analyst maintains that the broader structure remains intact and that a macro Wave 3 for XRP could realistically begin within the month. XRP ETF Lineup Expands On the institutional side of things, Bitwise Asset Management has confirmed that its new spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking XRP will launch on Thursday under the ticker “XRP.” The fund is scheduled to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. This follows Canary Capital’s XRPC ETF, which launched on November 13 and attracted almost $250 million in inflows on its opening day. Despite the strong start, XRPC’s momentum slowed this week as it managed to bring its total net inflow to just over $292 million, according to SoSoValue. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s EZRP also entered the market on November 18, further adding to the growing list of XRP-focused funds. Additional products from 21Shares and CoinShares are expected to debut later this week.

This crucial development comes at a pivotal moment for traders navigating the complex interplay between traditional monetary policy and digital asset performance. Why Did the Dollar Steady After Fed Minutes? The dollar’s stabilization represents a significant shift in market sentiment following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy revelations. Market participants had been anticipating more aggressive rate cuts, but the minutes revealed a more measured approach from central bankers. This cautious stance provided the foundation for the dollar to steady against major currency pairs, creating important implications for cross-asset correlations including cryptocurrency markets. Fed Minutes Analysis: What Traders Need to Know The recently released Fed minutes highlighted several key factors influencing the dollar’s performance: Committee members expressed concerns about premature rate cuts Inflation projections remain above the 2% target Labor market strength continues to support hawkish positioning Global economic uncertainties warrant careful policy calibration USD Strength and Its Market Impact The renewed USD strength following the Fed minutes has created both challenges and opportunities across financial markets. Traditional forex pairs have shown predictable reactions, while cryptocurrency assets have demonstrated more complex correlation patterns. The table below illustrates key currency movements: Currency Pair Pre-Minutes Post-Minutes Change EUR/USD 1.0850 1.0820 -0.28% GBP/USD 1.2700 1.2675 -0.20% USD/JPY 148.50 149.20 +0.47% USD/CAD 1.3450 1.3480 +0.22% Forex Market Reactions to Monetary Policy The forex market has responded with calculated precision to the Fed’s communications. Major currency pairs have adjusted their positioning based on the revised interest rate expectations. This recalibration affects not only spot trading but also forward contracts and options pricing, creating cascading effects across global liquidity pools. Federal Reserve Policy Outlook Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve appears committed to data-dependent decision making. The minutes suggest that future policy moves will hinge on incoming economic data rather than predetermined timelines. This approach provides flexibility but also introduces uncertainty, requiring market participants to maintain vigilant monitoring of key indicators. Actionable Trading Insights Traders can leverage several strategies in the current environment: Monitor dollar index (DXY) for broader USD direction Watch for divergence between Fed rhetoric and economic data Consider correlation patterns between traditional and digital assets Implement risk management protocols for volatility spikes FAQs What do the latest Fed minutes reveal about future rate decisions? The minutes indicate the Federal Reserve maintains a cautious approach toward rate cuts, emphasizing data dependency and inflation concerns over predetermined timing. How does USD strength affect cryptocurrency markets? Historically, strong USD periods have created headwinds for cryptocurrency valuations, though correlation patterns have shown increasing complexity in recent market cycles. Which Federal Reserve officials were most influential in the latest meeting? While all members contribute to policy decisions, markets closely watch commentary from Chair Jerome Powell and regional bank presidents for policy signals. What economic indicators should traders monitor following the Fed minutes? Key indicators include CPI data, employment reports, and manufacturing surveys that influence Federal Reserve decision-making. How long might the dollar’s steady period last? Currency stability typically persists until the next significant data release or Fed communication, making ongoing monitoring essential for position management. The dollar’s stabilization following the Fed minutes represents a critical inflection point for global markets. This development underscores the enduring influence of traditional monetary policy on asset valuations across both conventional and digital ecosystems. As markets digest these implications, the measured approach from the Federal Reserve provides both stability and strategic opportunities for informed participants.

Read This As the Bitcoin price struggles to reclaim $100,000, the crypto analyst warns that it is more likely to crash further, highlighting the $74,000-$82,000 level as the next major point of interest. This would mean that Bitcoin could see a more than 10% drop in price from this level. However, the analyst doesn’t stop there ,as it seems the Bitcoin price is headed into another stretch of bear market. The year is already rapidly coming to an end, and the crypto analyst expects the year 2026 to be even more bearish. By next year, Mr. Wall Street believes that the Bitcoin price could fall below $60,000, reaching as low as $54,000. The timeframe for this is set in the last quarter of 2026, but this would also mark the bottom. Given this, the analyst believes that the $54,000-$60,000 will be the best time to get into the asset to position for the next wave of upward movements. Head And Shoulders Pattern Supports Decline The bearish sentiment is echoed by others such as Leshka.eth, whose recent analysis also points to a possible drop in price. The analyst shows that Bitcoin completed a head and shoulders pattern, with the neckline firmly in place. Given this, the price has entered into a state of reset, and this reset is far from over.

This was highlighted in an earlier post that predicts that BTC is headed for as low as $40,000. The timeline also suggests that this will happen sometime in 2026, before a bottom is established.

According to ARK’s latest daily trade disclosure, the firm executed a combined $42 million in purchases across its flagship ETFs, marking one of its most aggressive single-day crypto allocations this month. Here's every move Cathie Wood and Ark Invest made in the stock market today 11/19 pic.twitter.com/gEJcqlwxXn — Ark Invest Tracker (@ArkkDaily) November 20, 2025 The move extends ARK’s pattern of buying into weakness after a wave of red hit both crypto assets and crypto-linked equities throughout November. Why Is Cathie Wood Buying the Dip Again as Crypto Stocks Crash? ARK’s largest commitment once again went to Bullish, the Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange whose stock has been under heavy pressure in recent weeks. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) accumulated 322,917 shares, while ARKW bought 92,670 and ARKF added 48,011, bringing Wednesday’s total Bullish purchase to roughly $16.8 million. The investment arrived as Bullish shares slid another 3.63% during the session to close at $36.39 before recovering slightly in after-hours trading. Source: Google Finance The firm also continued its accumulation of Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin and one of ARK’s fastest-growing crypto exposures. ARKK acquired 150,518 shares, while ARKW bought 43,174 and ARKF added 22,327, amounting to around $15 million in new Circle holdings. Circle’s stock was one of the worst performers among crypto-exposed equities on Wednesday, falling nearly 9% to $69.72 before staging a mild after-hours rebound. ARK rounded out the day with increased exposure to BitMine Immersion Technologies, purchasing a combined 260,651 shares across the three ETFs, valued at roughly $7.6 million. BitMine, whose business has shifted toward accumulating Ethereum on its balance sheet, dropped 9.5% to $29.18 before recovering more than 6% in late trading. Source: Google Finance The latest buys come just days after ARK made a $10.2 million acquisition of BitMine shares on Monday, when the stock hit a fresh record low. The firm had also purchased $10.2 million in Bullish stock earlier this week, timed one day before the exchange’s third-quarter earnings report. Bullish’s earnings had previously shown weaker revenue but improving profitability, and the back-to-back allocations were interpreted as a sign that ARK expects the exchange’s fundamentals to strengthen once market volatility eases. This week’s trades also add to a broader pattern seen throughout November. ARK Invest’s Crypto Exposure Tops $2.15B as It Continues Buying Bullish ARK has repeatedly increased its exposure to Bullish, including an additional $11.98 million purchase earlier this month . @ARKInvest , led by @CathieDWood , has acquired another $12M in @Bullish shares despite the stock's recent decline since its NYSE debut. https://t.co/YR2RfkIXKc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 4, 2025 Notably, that purchase pushed its total Bullish position above $209 million since the exchange’s public debut in August. Bullish shares remain down roughly 47% from their listing price despite periodic rebounds. ARK initially invested $172 million at $37 per share when the exchange listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The renewed wave of buying follows what has been one of the toughest stretches for crypto equities since early 2024. Bitcoin remained off its October highs as the broader market continued to unwind, and crypto-exposed stocks mirrored the downturn. Circle and BitMine suffered some of the sharpest declines, while Bullish extended a months-long slowdown. Even large-cap names faced pressure: Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury company, Strategy, dropped 9.82% during Wednesday’s session before recovering some losses after hours. Source: Google Finance ARK’s accumulation trend also highlights how deeply integrated crypto has become across its ETFs. As of early November, ARK’s combined crypto exposure through ARKF, ARKW, and ARKK had surpassed $2.15 billion, driven by positions in companies such as Coinbase, Robinhood, Circle, Bullish, and BitMine. Source: Stockcircle Its portfolio also extends to Ether and Solana staking products through ETFs such as ETHQ/U and SOLQ/U. ARKF maintains the highest allocation to crypto-related assets at 29%, followed by ARKW at 25.7% and ARKK at 17.7%.

This spike in whale activity comes as the cryptocurrency’s price tests critical support levels, dropping to around $91,700 and stirring debate about whether this is a final shakeout before a recovery. A Market Divergence While the broader market sentiment has been quite negative, data from analytics firm Santiment showed more than 102,900 Bitcoin transactions above $100,000 and over 29,000 above $1 million so far this week, calling it a strong candidate for the most active whale week of 2025, with flows shifting from dumping to accumulating. This suggests that well-funded investors are using the recent price drops as a buying opportunity. One notable example from trader Kyle Chassé highlighted a single purchase of 1,300 BTC, worth approximately $121 million, from custodian BitGo. The activity matches with on-chain analysis from MorenoDV_, who noted that a specific cohort of long-term, “price-insensitive” holders has absorbed 186,000 BTC since October 6. While it is the largest accumulation spike in recent cycles, it has seen prices move south instead of triggering a typical rally, a rare anomaly that has stumped market observers. At the time of writing, BTC had fallen about 28% from its all-time high of around $126,000 set on October 6, with an 11.5% drop in just the last week. Interpreting the Signals The conflicting signals have created a split in market interpretation. Some analysts see the aggressive accumulation as a foundation for a strong rally once retail capitulation is complete and available supply dries up. However, others warned that it could represent a “catching falling knives” scenario, with the potential for further downside if key support levels break. According to technical analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin is currently testing the 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on its monthly chart, a level that has separated bull markets from bear markets in the past. Holding above this level would suggest the bull market structure remains intact. Still, commentators like Axel Adler Jr. have noted that bearish pressure in the futures market and a market sentiment index reading of -89 are creating maximum stress, making the possibility of a swift recovery difficult without a positive catalyst. His assessment is similar to another analysis that suggests the current pattern mirrors a shakeout seen in Q1 2025, potentially putting the market in the final stages of a downturn before a reversal takes shape.

The crypto investigator’s findings showed that the attacker used a flaw in the project’s smart contract to steal tokens. They then moved them through Tornado Cash and other networks to set up money laundering operations. “GANA’s interaction contract has been targeted by an external attack, resulting in unauthorized asset theft…We will continue to provide updates on the investigation progress and subsequent actions through official channels,” the DeFi platform wrote on X earlier today. Several cybersecurity platforms on X, including OnChain Lens, reported that the exploit began when the attacker transferred 1,140 BNB, valued at approximately $1.04 million, into Tornado Cash on BSC. The stolen assets were subsequently bridged to Ethereum, where another 346 ETH, worth $1.05 million, was deposited into the crypto mixer purportedly for laundering. Blockchain records shared by ZachXBT show the Ethereum address used for laundering was 0x7a503e3ab9433ebf13afb4f7f1793c25733b3cca. The original theft addresses on BSC were identified as 0x2e8a…aae5c38 and 0xd10e…cc8fa4d. Hacker exploited GANA’s ‘unstake function’ to steal coins According to Web3 security firm HashDit, the ownership of the exploited contract had been altered, which the hacker used to manipulate reward rates and invoke the unstake function, receiving more GANA tokens than intended. 🚨HashDit Alert🚨 HashDit has monitored that @GANA_PayFi has been compromised for ~$3.1m $GANA . Users should NOT trade with the $GANA token for the time being, and await for team announcement! Funds have been deposited into TC: https://t.co/rtdjnMvYpI Root cause: Ownership of… pic.twitter.com/XZzuoMmf8D — HashDit | now with Pro Extension (@HashDit) November 20, 2025 The perpetrator then rapidly sold the tokens on decentralized exchanges, significantly devaluing the project’s currency. A total amount of 346 ETH held in the Ethereum address remained dormant for several hours. However, beginning an hour ago, the hacker resumed laundering the funds through Tornado Cash in incremental batches of 1 ETH, 10 ETH, and 100 ETH, a method used by thieves during DeFi attacks to “shake-off” security researchers’ trail of stolen funds. GANA Payment is a relatively small-scale payment token project built around the BEP-20 GANA token. Its operations are decentralized and use liquidity pools and exchanges, but Cryptopolitan has not found any publicly available technical documentation. The project, which launched in early November, has yet to publish formal audits or detailed security analyses. In the aftermath of the hack, data from GeckoTerminal showed that GANA’s token value dropped more than 90%. DeFi exploits on BSC, Ethereum cooled in October According to DefiLlama’s hack tracker, smaller BSC-based projects have collectively lost over $100 million in 2025 alone. The hack on GANA has taken the tally to almost $10 million in the last two months, including network breaches on OlaXBT, Evoq Finance, Seedify and GriffinAI. Cryptopolitan reported in October that total losses from hacks amounted to just $18.18 million in about 15 incidents, an 85.7% drop from September’s $127.06 million. Major incidents that took place during the month included hacks at Garden Finance, Typus Finance, and Abracadabra, which together accounted for $16.2 million in stolen funds. Abracadabra, a decentralized lending protocol and maker of the Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin, suffered a $1.8 million loss when attackers used flaws in how the contract handled actions within the same transaction. Typus Finance lost $3.4 million due to access control weaknesses in its custom price oracle, while Garden Finance experienced an $11 million loss through a single solver connected to several blockchain networks. This month, Balancer was hit with one of the largest DeFi hacks of 2025, where wrapped ETH and other assets from multiple networks were swindled for several hours. Blockchain investigators had estimated losses of about $70 million, but when the network’s developers took back control, the bleeding had gone north of $116 million. The following day, multi-chain lending protocol Moonwell was exploited via flawed oracle data, losing around $1 million. The attacker took advantage of price discrepancies to borrow and trade specific wrapped ETH assets, pocketing 295 ETH. Per DefiLlama data , cross-chain bridge hacks in 2025 had resulted in over $1.5 billion in stolen funds by mid-2025, while reentrancy bugs accounted for $325 million in losses, particularly from older or forked contracts. Oracle manipulation accounted for 13% of attacks, while liquidity pool drains caused $103 million in stolen assets.

Some analysts take a careful approach, while others push bold targets to motivate long-term commitment. Time Traveler (@Traveler2236), a crypto enthusiast on X, belongs to that second group. His latest post aims to shift how holders view their current position and what their future could look like. He opened by reminding readers that “Everyone is different in the XRP holders world.” He then established firm price levels that he believes could significantly impact personal financial outcomes. Everyone is different in the XRP holders world. $100 XRP will make few people millionaires. $1000 XRP will make all holders at least A millionaire. $2000+ XRP would make it so that every person who held XRP at anytime from the years 2012-2027, a multimillionaire with no need… — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) November 18, 2025 XRP Will Make Millionaires He laid out how different price levels could affect holders. In his view, a move to $100 would only turn a small number of people into millionaires. He said that $1000 would be enough to make every holder a millionaire. He also argued that anything above $2000 would turn anyone who held XRP at any point between 2012 and 2027 into a multimillionaire. These statements aim to shift the mindset of holders toward long-term confidence. He repeated that theme when he wrote, “YOU ARE ALREADY RICH if you hold XRP (T O D A Y).” What His Message Means for XRP’s Position Time Traveler’s post focuses on the belief in XRP’s long-term potential . He predicted that a rise to $100 to $500 is “absolutely guaranteed.” While this remains his personal forecast, it reveals his belief in XRP’s potential. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His message suggests that holders should see value even before the asset reaches extreme price levels. He argued that early gains could give room to plan for larger targets. He wrote that a move to mid-range prices would give holders “the chance to reinvest, market, and structure” their lives for the higher points he expects. A Positive Signal for Long-Term Holders Following the $1,000 target, he sees XRP going to $10,000 . This prediction matches that of many other experts. A wide section of the community is convinced that XRP can reach this level. His final prediction is a price point of $73,000, which would make XRP holders unbelievably rich. Time Traveler’s approach treats XRP as a long-term asset rather than a short-term trade. He wants holders to feel grounded in their current positions. By telling them they are “already rich,” he makes today’s holdings meaningful , not speculative. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $92,184, beginning a bearish trend to $85,743. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling demand as buyers failed to push the price above Fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , miners sent a total of 210K BTC to exchanges in October, while the past week saw 122,000 coins flow into Binance. Bitcoin price prediction November 2025 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $103K due to the market crash in October. However, it is now facing heavy accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around November 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction November 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-20 11:49:57

More than 1,500 investors participated in the first session. The derivatives are based on indices reflecting the price movements of the two cryptocurrencies with the largest market capitalization. Over 400 million rubles’ worth of crypto index futures traded on MOEX The total trading volume in the new crypto-based futures contracts launched by the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) surpassed 418 million rubles in the first day of trading (close to $5.2 million), Russian media reported. The figure includes three contracts expiring in the last weeks of December, January, and February, respectively, which were offered by Russia’s largest stock market this week. They are all cash-settled futures contracts on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) indices – Bitcoin index (MOEXBTC) and Ethereum index (MOEXETH). Their tickers are BCZ5, BCF6, BCG6, ETZ5, ETF6, and ETG6. The Bitcoin index futures trading volume was almost six times higher than that of the Ethereum index futures, the TASS news agency estimated on Wednesday, quoting stats published by MOEX. The MOEXBTC futures accounted for 356.79 million rubles, including around 352 million rubles worth of contracts maturing on December 26, RBC broke down the numbers further. The trading volume in the MOEXETH index futures amounted to 61.27 million rubles, 53 million rubles of which were for the December futures, the business news outlet also noted. MOEXBTC reflects price movements of BTC and is calculated based on a weighted average of perpetual futures and swaps (BTCUSDT) from four crypto exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget), and is updated once daily. The MOEXETH index tracks the price of Ethereum and is calculated similarly. Only professional investors have access to the new crypto index futures. On the day of their debut, 1,214 investors took part in the trading of the Bitcoin-based product, and 320 traded the Ethereum one, RBC detailed and remarked: “Notably, corporate traders predominantly held short positions (betting on a price decline), while individuals held more long positions (betting on a rise).” Russia is expanding its market for crypto derivatives The Moscow Exchange already offers professional investors cash-settled futures on the shares of investment funds tracking the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The contract based on the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was launched in June, and the one tracking the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) appeared in August. MOEX has previously reported significant investor interest in its crypto futures contracts on shares of funds investing in crypto. The average daily trading volume for these instruments on the leading Russian stock exchange reached 1.2 billion rubles last month (almost $15 million). Also in October, Russia’s second-largest stock market, the St. Petersburg Exchange (SPB), presented its own Bitcoin futures of this type, too. On Tuesday, the Managing Director of the Derivatives Market at Moscow Exchange Maria Patrikeeva was quoted as stating: “The launch of direct index futures on Bitcoin and Ethereum is a logical extension of the line of crypto derivatives available to traders in rubles and in a regulated Russian jurisdiction, without the need to purchase digital assets on foreign exchanges.” With the announcement of these instruments on November 18, the exchange emphasized they do not involve delivery of the underlying assets or trading and storing cryptocurrencies in foreign jurisdictions. While reluctant to allow investments in cryptocurrencies themselves, the Central Bank of Russia authorized financial firms to offer crypto derivatives on the Russian market in May. Only “highly qualified” investors have access to these products that track either the performance of foreign ETFs or cryptocurrency indices. However, the monetary authority now plans to permit the offering of derivative instruments directly tied to crypto prices, according to a recent media report, confirmed by a representative of the regulator.

The company’s concentrated Bitmine ETH strategy has resulted in approximately $3.7 billion in unrealized losses, creating serious concerns about the sustainability of their cryptocurrency accumulation plan. What’s Putting Bitmine’s ETH Strategy at Risk? According to analysis from 10x Research, Ethereum’s current trading price sits about $1,000 below Bitmine’s average purchase price of $4,051. This significant gap creates substantial pressure on the company’s financial position and raises questions about their investment timing. The recent market downturn has exposed critical vulnerabilities in Bitmine’s approach. Their heavy concentration in Ethereum means they lack the diversification that could cushion against such price declines. How Does the mNAV Ratio Impact Bitmine’s Future? The market-to-net asset value ratio (mNAV) has become a crucial indicator for Digital Asset Treasury companies. Currently, Bitmine’s mNAV has plummeted to 0.77, with their diluted mNAV at 0.92. This creates several immediate challenges: Difficulty attracting new investors to the company Existing shareholders facing potential losses if they exit Inability to raise capital through new share issuances Limited capacity for additional cryptocurrency purchases An mNAV above 1 is essential for companies to raise fresh capital through stock offerings. Bitmine’s current position makes this impossible, effectively freezing their ability to expand their cryptocurrency holdings. Is This Just a Bitmine Problem or Industry-Wide? The analysis reveals that Bitmine isn’t alone in facing these challenges. Other major DAT firms are experiencing similar mNAV declines, including: Strategy (MSTR) Metaplanet SharpLink Gaming This suggests broader industry pressures rather than company-specific issues. However, Bitmine’s heavy Ethereum focus makes them particularly vulnerable compared to more diversified competitors. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? The situation with Bitmine’s ETH strategy serves as a cautionary tale for institutional cryptocurrency investors. It highlights several important considerations: The risks of concentrated positions in single cryptocurrencies The importance of entry timing and average cost basis How market conditions can quickly turn favorable positions into losses The interconnectedness of company valuation and cryptocurrency performance Moreover, the inability to raise new capital could have ripple effects across the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially reducing institutional demand at a time when the market needs it most. Can Bitmine Recover From This ETH Strategy Setback? Recovery depends on several factors, primarily Ethereum’s price performance. If ETH can rally above Bitmine’s average purchase price, the unrealized losses would transform into gains. However, this requires significant market momentum. Alternatively, Bitmine might need to reconsider their investment approach. This could involve diversifying into other cryptocurrencies or adjusting their accumulation strategy to better manage risk. The company’s future also hinges on maintaining shareholder confidence during this challenging period. Transparent communication about their strategy adjustments will be crucial for investor retention. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors The Bitmine ETH strategy situation offers valuable lessons for all cryptocurrency market participants. It demonstrates that even publicly-traded companies face substantial risks in this volatile space. The $3.7 billion unrealized loss figure underscores how quickly market conditions can change investment outcomes. Furthermore, the mNAV challenges highlight how cryptocurrency investments directly impact company valuations and fundraising capabilities. This interconnected relationship means that poor crypto performance can severely limit a company’s strategic options. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitmine’s current unrealized loss on Ethereum? Bitmine faces approximately $3.7 billion in unrealized losses due to Ethereum trading about $1,000 below their average purchase price of $4,051. What does mNAV mean for cryptocurrency companies? mNAV (market-to-net asset value ratio) measures how the market values a company relative to its cryptocurrency holdings. Values below 1 indicate the market values the company less than its crypto assets. Can Bitmine still buy more cryptocurrency? Currently, Bitmine cannot raise capital through new share issuances because their mNAV is below 1, making it difficult to fund additional cryptocurrency purchases. Are other companies facing similar issues? Yes, other Digital Asset Treasury companies including Strategy (MSTR), Metaplanet, and SharpLink Gaming are experiencing similar mNAV declines. What happens if Ethereum’s price recovers? If Ethereum rises above Bitmine’s average purchase price, their unrealized losses would turn into gains, improving their financial position and mNAV ratio. How does this affect individual Ethereum investors? While individual investors aren’t directly affected, large institutional losses can impact market sentiment and potentially influence Ethereum’s price momentum. Found this analysis insightful?

Following this, on November 19th, co-founder William Hill received a four-year prison sentence for their roles in facilitating illegal transactions through their platform. Samourai Wallet Founders Charged According to the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, Samourai Wallet was implicated in enabling over $237 million in illicit transactions. Rodriguez, serving as the Chief Executive Officer, and Hill, the Chief Technology Officer, participated in a conspiracy that operated as a money transmitting business, knowingly transmitting criminal proceeds, according to the complaint. The funds laundered through Samourai were linked to various criminal activities, including drug trafficking, cyber intrusions, fraud, operations in sanctioned jurisdictions, murder-for-hire schemes, and a child pornography website. Prosecutors alleged that both Rodriguez and Hill actively promoted Samourai to criminal users and encouraged illegal activities. Hill marketed the mixer as a service for transmitting criminal proceeds on Dread , a darknet forum where discussions around illegal activities are common. In one exchange, a user sought advice on how to make their Bitcoin (BTC) “untraceable” and “clean.” Hill suggested that Samourai’s Whirlpool feature was a superior option compared to its competitors for such purposes. Similarly, in an X (previously Twitter) interaction back in July 2020, Rodriguez encouraged hackers to “feed” their gains into Samourai’s Whirlpool , expressing disappointment when those hackers opted for a different mixing service. ‘Money Laundering For Bitcoin’ Evidence presented in court indicated that both defendants were well aware that Samourai Wallet was being used for money laundering . In a WhatsApp conversation, when asked about the concept of “mixing,” Rodriguez described it as “money laundering for Bitcoin.” Furthermore, the company’s marketing materials acknowledged that their customer base would include individuals from “Dark/Grey Market participants” seeking to move proceeds from illicit activities. Alongside their prison sentences, Rodriguez and Hill were each given three years of supervised release and fined $250,000. They also agreed to forfeit little over $6.3 million, representing the fees generated by Samourai Wallet, as part of a forfeiture order that totals more than $237 million in traceable criminal proceeds. “The sentences handed down to the defendants serve as a stern warning that laundering known criminal proceeds—no matter the technology used or the form of the assets—will incur serious legal repercussions,” stated US Attorney Nicolas Roos. He emphasized the detrimental effects that money laundering services have on victims, making it nearly impossible to recover stolen funds.

At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at 188 billion. TLDR: The crypto market capitalisation is largely unchanged on Thursday morning (UTC); 65 of the top 100 coins and 8 of the top 10 coins decreased today; BTC increased by 0.4% to $91,757, and ETH fell by 2.2% to $3,008; BTC fell to its lowest level in months and could decrease further; The market is reacting to wider economic uncertainty; The market is searching for stability: demand can re-emerge or bear could appear; Large BTC holders are still buying, which is a sign of underlying strength; Kenya has rolled out Bitcoin ATMs inside major Nairobi malls; US BTC spot ETFs broke the read streak with $75.47 million in inflows, while ETH spot ETFs saw $37.35 million in outflows; There’s likely to be a surge of new ETFs in 2026; Bitwise’s Matt Hougan said that demand for regulated crypto products is ‘huge’; Crypto market sentiment dropped again within the extreme fear territory. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, only two of the 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices rise over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated by 0.4% since this time yesterday, meaning it’s mostly unchanged, currently trading at $91,757. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is down by 2.2%, now changing hands at $3,008. This is the second-highest drop in the category. The highest decrease is 2.3% by Binance Coin (BNB) , which currently stands at $900. The only other green coins is Solana (SOL) , which appreciated 1.9% to $142. When it comes to the top 100 coins, 65 are red at the time of writing. Among these, one saw a double-digit gain. Cosmos Hub (ATOM) appreciated by 13.5% to the price of $3.1. It’s followed by Zcash (ZEC) , which is up 8.7%, trading at $670. On the other hand, Canton (CC) fell the most in this category: 13.8% to $0.094. Cronos (CRO) is in the second place, having dropped 3.8% to $0.1081.

Moreover, “there is potential for it to decrease further.” “The market is reacting to wider economic uncertainty, in particular concerns about a potential AI-driven stock correction and diminishing hopes for interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve,” Kral writes. However, large BTC holders are still buying. “This is a sign of underlying strength and confidence in the project, even though the price is falling. For some, this could be a chance to enter the market at a lower price than we’ve seen recently. Therefore, it is important to recognise the risks. Volatility is high and the macro environment can change quickly.” Kral concludes that “in times like these, remaining informed and taking a thoughtful, steady approach is far more effective than trying to react to every big market shift.” Moreover, Björn Schmidtke, Chief Executive Officer of Aurelion , Nasdaq’s first Tether Gold treasury, stated that the recent volatility across digital asset markets has renewed focus on foundational assets. “While market sentiment frequently fluctuates, this shift presents a strategic opportunity to capitalize on proven value and structural resilience,” says Schmidtke, adding that the future will see gold and digital assets converging, not competing. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC stood at $91,757. The coin moved between the intraday high of $92,943 and the low of $88,540. This dip into the $88,000 territory was brief though, with the price swiftly recovering to the current level. BTC is now down 11.5% in a week and 14.8% in a month. Additionally, it’s 27.1% away from its all-time high. If BTC manages to break through to the $99,000 level, it could retest $115,000. However, should it move lower, it could test critical zones between $83,800 and $75,000. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,008. Over the past day, it has moved within the range of $2,872 and $3,103. Overall, the coin is now down nearly 15% in a week, 22.6% in a month, and 39% from the ATH. ETH could move above $3,100, further breaking through the $3,250 zone, should the bulls run the market. Conversely, the price could decrease to the $2,800 level and then towards $2,730.

The crypto fear and greed index has gone back to 15 today , compared to 16 yesterday. The last time the level was this low was in mid-April 2025. It seems that both new and old hands are selling this time around. Many are concerned over the dropping prices, worried about an incoming bear market. That said, once oversold, the market may be ready for a rebound. ETFs See Mixed Picture On Wednesday, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke the latest outflow streak with $75.47 million in inflows. This raised the total net inflow slightly to $58.3 billion. Two of the 12 BTC ETFs saw positive flows, and two recorded negative flows.

Schiff prevede la bancarotta di MicroStrategy mentre Bitcoin crolla,https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-nei-guai-schiff-prevede-la-bancarotta-di-microstrategy-mentre-bitcoin-crolla/,"La strategia aggressiva su Bitcoin di Michael Saylor è finita sotto la lente d’ingrandimento dopo il recente crollo del mercato. Si rincorrono le speculazioni sul futuro della sua azienda, MicroStrategy (MSTR) , e sul destino del suo enorme tesoro in BTC se la principale criptovaluta dovesse continuare a scendere. Peter Schiff: “MicroStrategy fallirà comunque” Il noto economista Peter Schiff ha lanciato un attacco durissimo su X (ex Twitter) , definendo l’azienda di Saylor una “truffa” e prevedendo che finirà in bancarotta, a prescindere da cosa farà il prezzo di Bitcoin. Ma perché c’è tanta preoccupazione? Il motivo è tecnico, ma cerchiamo di comprenderlo nel modo più semplice possibile: Immaginate MicroStrategy come una cassaforte piena di Bitcoin. In passato (Situazione Normale): Gli investitori si fidavano così tanto di Saylor che erano disposti a pagare le azioni dell’azienda più del valore dei Bitcoin contenuti nella cassaforte. Questo si chiama “pagare un premio”. Cosa sta succedendo ora: La situazione si è ribaltata. Il valore delle azioni in borsa è sceso al di sotto del valore effettivo dei Bitcoin che l’azienda possiede. Perché è un brutto segno? È come se qualcuno vendesse una scatola contenente 100€, ma chiedesse solo 90€ per comprarla. Quando il mercato “sconta” così tanto il prezzo di un’azienda, significa che gli investitori vedono rischi enormi all’orizzonte e non credono più che la strategia di Saylor sia sostenibile. Schiff sostiene che questo sia l’inizio della fine per il modello di business dell’azienda. Acquisti record nonostante le perdite Con il mNAV ora scambiato sotto la parità (sotto a 1), crescono i timori sulla tenuta dell’azienda in un mercato ribassista prolungato. La scorsa settimana, Arkham Intelligence aveva suggerito che Saylor stesse vendendo BTC, voci che il CEO ha prontamente smentito come false. Al contrario, Saylor ha rilanciato: ha dichiarato che l’azienda ha acquistato Bitcoin ogni giorno la scorsa settimana, confermando la notizia con l’annuncio di un acquisto massiccio da 835 milioni di dollari . Si tratta dell’operazione più grande da luglio (quando comprarono 2,46 miliardi in BTC). Il problema? Il prezzo. Questi ultimi acquisti sono stati effettuati a un prezzo medio di $102.171 , ben al di sopra delle quotazioni attuali. Questo ha portato una fetta significativa delle riserve di MicroStrategy in rosso. Secondo i dati di CryptoQuant : Il 43% dei Bitcoin detenuti dall’azienda è attualmente in perdita. Il 57% è ancora in profitto. Il prezzo medio di acquisto dell’intero portafoglio si attesta ora a $74.433 . Bitcoin potrebbe scendere sotto il prezzo medio di carico? Il veterano del trading Peter Brandt ha lanciato un avvertimento severo: Bitcoin potrebbe crollare sotto i $50.000 . Se ciò accadesse, l’intero portafoglio di Saylor finirebbe sott’acqua (in perdita). Brandt ha spiegato che la recente violazione del trend parabolico rialzista suggerisce una correzione profonda, che metterebbe a dura prova la resilienza di MicroStrategy. Se il prezzo di BTC dovesse scendere sotto la media di acquisto dell’azienda ($74.433) e rimanerci, i rischi diventerebbero concreti: Dom Kwok , esperto crypto, sostiene che l’azienda potrebbe essere costretta a vendere BTC per pagare gli interessi sul debito. Ha sottolineato che le “treasury companies” non possono operare a lungo quando il mNAV scende sotto a 1, rischiando l’insolvenza. L’analista Mana ha rincarato la dose, avvertendo che il mercato sta per assistere al “crollo di MicroStrategy”, consigliando agli investitori di scaricare le azioni MSTR mentre gli utili dell’azienda soffrono. Al momento della scrittura, Bitcoin ha mostrato un segnale di ripresa, scambiando intorno ai $91.800 , in rialzo nelle ultime 24 ore secondo i dati di CoinMarketCap.

Could this be a genuine pivot? W pattern confirming a bottom? Source: TradingView Rather like in the case for Bitcoin, the $SOL price is in a descending channel. It has retested the bottom of that channel, which is acting as support along with a major horizontal level, and a major trendline. The price has just emerged through the neckline of a W pattern and is currently testing it as support. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator has just broken through a trendline and is also confirming the breakout. If this confirms, the W pattern will also confirm in the price action, and vice versa. Multiple convergence of supports Source: TradingView The daily chart gives a much better view of the enormous supports underneath the $SOL price . The 0.786 Fibonacci, which is the deepest level that price normally goes down to, has been tagged. This lines up pretty well with the horizontal support level, and of course, we also have the major ascending trendline, plus the bottom of the descending channel. If ever a bounce was going to take place, it was from here. The RSI in this daily time frame shows an even longer descending trendline. The indicator line is right up against this now. Will it break through and send the $SOL price back to the top of the descending channel? Big rally about to commence? Source: TradingView The $SOL price may have taken a 49% dip, but that’s still not as bad as the previous 67.5% plunge that followed the January 2025 all-time high. Assuming this is the bottom, a higher low has been made, and now $SOL could be on a journey back to a higher high and a new all-time high. The RSI in this time frame has a bull market support level at 40.00. It can be seen that the indicator is currently turning around at this level. All looks set for the next big rally.

He argues that XRP may be quietly building toward a major breakout — one that few seem ready for. At its current trading price of $2.11, his thesis suggests the potential for a multi-year structural move that could dramatically change how investors view XRP’s long-term trajectory. The Technical Setup: A Decades-Long Squeeze Central to BLOCK BULL’s argument is the formation of a multi-year descending triangle on XRP’s weekly XRP/USDT chart. This pattern is formed by progressively lower highs compressing against a relatively flat support line. Such formations often signal a buildup of pressure. In his view, XRP’s recent trading at around $2.11 marks a critical moment: the asset is coiling, and the tension is mounting. Nobodys Prepared for this playing out $XRP pic.twitter.com/oS2FqEoGBJ — BLOCK BULL (@TheBlockBull) November 19, 2025 Why the $27–$40 Target? BLOCK BULL’s target range of $27–$40 by 2026–2027 may sound bold, but he grounds it in long-term chart work. His projection uses a logarithmic scale, which better reflects percentage growth across large price ranges. This isn’t just speculative hype — it’s a technical extrapolation of the descending triangle’s measured move over time. While not all analysts go as high, others have expressed similarly dramatic long-term potential. Risks to Consider Before Buying In That said, the thesis carries significant risk. Descending triangles can fail, and a breakdown could trigger lower prices instead of a rally. Some analysts have warned that XRP could face pressure if key support levels don’t hold. On‑chain behavior could also surprise: long-term holders might take profits aggressively, especially if XRP begins to run. External factors such as macro uncertainty, regulatory shifts, or liquidity shocks could derail the breakout altogether. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Warning Hits Differently What makes BLOCK BULL’s message resonate is the conviction behind it: “nobody is prepared for this”, he claims. Many in the XRP ecosystem focus on short-term triggers — ETF filings, on‑chain flows, or legal news. But he asks them to pause and consider something deeper: a structural technical resolution that could reshape XRP’s valuation in the long run. Strategic Implications for Holders For long-term holders, his analysis argues for patience and discipline. If you believe in this setup, now may be the time to slowly build positions, rather than chasing short-term momentum. Risk management is critical: setting clear entry zones, stop‑loss levels, and profit objectives could protect against unexpected reversals. For traders, the thesis offers a deeply asymmetric trade — very high reward, but with a long timeline and real uncertainty. In sum, BLOCK BULL’s chart isn’t just another optimistic forecast. It’s a warning and a call to action. If his descent triangle thesis materializes, XRP could be positioned for a generational move . But that outcome is far from guaranteed — and those who listen now may have an edge fifty times the size of today’s price.

Jorge Toledo, the EU’s ambassador to China, spoke today at a panel event in Beijing, saying that the EU region’s high-level summit with Chinese leaders in the summer has seen little to no improvement. According to Toledo, the ongoing challenges around export controls, supply chain security, and rare-earth materials reveal no meaningful improvement. Toledo says EU–China relations remain strained despite easing of mineral controls Based on a recent Cryptopolitan report , China suspended some export controls on rare-earth materials for one year, which Toledo described as good news and a potential starting point for more cooperation between the EU and China. Despite saying it was good news, Toledo acknowledged that things have not improved since the summer summit. According to a Bloomberg report , Beijing’s previous restrictions on the materials raised serious concerns among companies in the European region, which rely heavily on Chinese supply. Toledo’s remarks also touched on what he considered unfair criticism of the EU in Chinese media. He noted that the bloc was being blamed for broad political tensions, urging Beijing to acknowledge that the EU represents a unified political entity, not just a loose alliance of states. He noted that the EU is no different from the union of its member states, adding that ignoring the existence of a political union would be a risky move. Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, has also spoken on the rare-earth material issue, publicly criticizing China’s export restrictions on critical minerals. According to Kallas, the restrictions have disrupted operations across European manufacturing firms. She called on China to put an end to the distortive practices, noting that they pose significant risks to European companies and endanger the reliability of global supply chains. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi defended the export restriction as a legitimate control over the dual use of materials, which have both civilian and military applications. He told China Daily Asia that, under the current rules, normal trade channels remain open for European firms. EU presses China for tangible trade mechanisms to protect the bloc’s companies Barely a month ago, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen revealed that Europe was ready to consider broader responses if China was not willing to restore predictable and open trade in rare earth materials , reflecting a deeper imbalance between the two nations. Toledo’s remarks today reinforce the previous agreements between the EU and China, which focused on cooperation and appear to have stalled, as industrial concerns continue to mount. China controls the largest share of critical mineral production, and Europe’s dependence creates strategic vulnerabilities. Despite mounting concerns, China has since reassured European firms that it has established a “fast track” mechanism for rare-earth export licenses to EU companies, raising questions about how reliable the mechanism will function in practice. Based on the Bloomberg report, any reset so far will require more than diplomatic signals; it will also necessitate tangible mechanisms, stable export licensing, supply-chain diversification, and more transparent trade rules. The lack of such practical mechanisms may expose the EU’s industrial base, particularly in the high-tech and green energy sectors, to geopolitical and economic risks. Toledo’s remarks demonstrated a direct attempt by the EU to reconfigure relations between the two sides while maintaining open channels of communication. On the contrary, the remarks may be viewed as frustration that past promises of cooperation have yet to be actionable, further eroding the level of trust between the nations.

The latest catalyst comes from Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, who told his 1.6 million viewers on X : “This is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy bitcoin below $90K.” His comment arrives as Bitcoin tests deeper support after a sharp multi-week pullback. This is the last time you'll ever be able to buy bitcoin below $90k! — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) November 18, 2025 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Market Setup and Key Levels Bitcoin price prediction still remains bearish as BTC retreat from its $124,000 high has accelerated, punctuated by a break below the long-term ascending trendline that held since early 2025. This shift marks a meaningful change in structure, replacing months of higher lows with sustained downside pressure. Recent daily candles resemble a controlled series of lower closes, and the RSI near 30 reflects oversold conditions last seen during prior accumulation phases. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The correction is driving BTC directly into a broad $83,800–$90,000 demand zone, an area that previously fueled April’s recovery. The region overlaps with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, strengthening its importance for both tactical buyers and long-term allocators. Key nearby levels traders are tracking: Support: $90,000, $83,800, $74,600 Resistance: $96,000, $111,000, $124,000 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Reversal Signals to Watch Chart structure suggests Bitcoin may be approaching a stabilization zone. A decisive drop toward $84,000 could set the stage for a technical reaction if buyers step in with conviction. Traders will be watching for signatures of exhaustion: a bullish engulfing candle, long lower shadows, or an RSI divergence against new lows. If BTC rebounds, the first checkpoint lies near $96,000, followed by a potential climb toward $111,000, where a cluster of past rejections and the broken trendline converge. A close above this band would rebuild bullish momentum and open the path back to the $124,000 ceiling. BTC Price Forecast: Can Bulls Regain Control? A reversal inside the $84K–$90K zone remains the highest-probability scenario for now. A confirmed recovery, paired with a 20-EMA reclaim, could launch a multi-week rebound, particularly if macro liquidity conditions improve into early 2026. For long-term investors, this setup aligns with Winklevoss’s warning: Bitcoin is now retesting one of the last deep-value zones before supply scarcity tightens further. Should momentum return, BTC could reapproach the six-figure range sooner than markets expect. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $28 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013295 before the next increase.

CryptoQuant Reveals the Most Negative Outlook and Critical Levels!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-will-the-feds-december-interest-rate-decision-affect-bitcoin-cryptoquant-reveals-the-most-negative-outlook-and-critical-levels/,"While the US government shutdown negatively impacts many sectors and institutions, including cryptocurrencies, the Fed is among those most affected. This is because the Fed couldn't access the economic data it bases its interest rate decisions on. Just as the government shutdown ended and data was expected to arrive, the BLS officially canceled the October Employment Report. Nonfarm payrolls data was included in the additionally delayed November report, which will be released on December 16th, following the FOMC meeting. There is no October NFP report, and with November data not arriving on time, the Fed will make its December decision blindly. At this point, the FED is priced in with 33.8% of interest rates cuts in December, while leaving them unchanged is priced in with 66.2%. This situation brings up one question: “What could happen to Bitcoin if the FED doesn't lower interest rates?” How Will the Fed's December Decision Affect Bitcoin? CryptoQuant analyst with the nickname XWIN Research answered this question, but investors will not like it at all. CryptoQuant analysts stated that if the Fed does not cut interest rates in December, Bitcoin could fall to between $60,000 and $80,000 by the end of the year. The analyst noted that if the Fed keeps interest rates steady in December, the BTC price could trade in the $60,000-$80,000 range by the end of the year. XWIN Research stated that without a rate cut, tightening pressure in global financial markets will continue and demand for risk assets will weaken. Noting that Bitcoin tends to react sensitively to such macroeconomic changes, the analyst argued that interest rate cut expectations have diminished and the sharp decline experienced for risk assets in early November could be repeated. “The Fed is entering its December meeting with limited visibility due to the lack of key economic data. The Fed is making a distinction. If the Fed chooses not to cut interest rates, the logic is simple: inflation remains around 3%, officials are concerned about cutting rates too soon, and incomplete data makes policymakers more cautious. This scenario typically keeps liquidity tight and risk appetite low. It also paints a negative picture for Bitcoin. When interest rate cut expectations faded in early November, risk assets sold off, sending Bitcoin plummeting. If the Fed remains cautious and holds interest rates steady in December, similar pressures could continue. In this context, if the Fed does not cut interest rates in December, Bitcoin is likely to trade between $60,000 and $80,000 by the end of the year. Conversely, the analyst also observed that stablecoin reserves on exchanges have reached an all-time high of $72 billion, suggesting that while market liquidity is sufficient for a rally, macroeconomic variables are currently limiting bullish momentum. *This is not investment advice.

Fundstrat CIO and Bitcoin Chairman Tom Lee has now declared that the ETH bottom is likely in, following the $2,800 support test that immediately resulted in a rebound above $3,000 at press time. Speaking on CNBC, Tom Lee told reporters that he remains bullish on Ethereum because of the significant innovation taking place on the network, including stablecoin creation and Larry Fink and BlackRock choosing it to tokenize real-world assets . JUST IN: Tom Lee Says #Ethereum Will Bottom This Week pic.twitter.com/7JH6gggYjQ — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) November 17, 2025 Lee said that “ this will bring stocks, bonds, real estate onto the blockchain, and it requires a neutral and a 100% uptime blockchain, and that’s Ethereum.” Tom Lee Says ETH Bottom Is In, Target $7K by Q1 2026 Lee added that the price of Ethereum fluctuates because crypto is still in its adoption stage, which brings a lot of volatility, and ETH isn’t spared from it. He admitted that Ethereum has been in a downtrend “unfortunately” ; however, he believes the bottom is in and ETH should break out towards $7,000 going into Q1 2026. Analysts at CryptoQuant also observed that Ethereum’s fall to $2.87k has brought in a local bottom. The analyst added that the $2.8k area is likely to act as an important on-chain support level for Ethereum, as this zone aligns with the realized price clusters of both retail investors and whales. Source: CryptoQuant “Historically, realized price levels have often marked cycle bottoms, suggesting that this range could once again provide a foundation for a short-term rebound.” Crypto analyst CryptoMe also added that Ethereum’s slip towards $2,800 means that ETH is at the average cost of what diamond-hand whales paid for it four months ago. According to him, “In that case, an investor can buy slowly, gradually, in steps, calmly, and always remember: this is a long-term plan, not a short-term trade.” Whales and institutions like BlackRock are now going all in on Ethereum. Yesterday, the leading asset manager revealed its plan to file for a Staked Ethereum ETF , as per the Delaware name registration under the ’33 Act. BlackRock is planning to file for a Staked Ethereum ETF, as per the Delaware name registration. '33 Act. Filing coming soon. pic.twitter.com/NmAsQhcq5D — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 19, 2025 This means BlackRock will have not one but two ETH ETFs. Aside from the current iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) , a new Ethereum ETF solely focused on staking would be launched to offer a 99% staking option for the fund, where investors will receive a higher real yield. And for every $1 of ETH staked, it adds 3x equivalent value to Ethereum’s market cap at the peak bull run. Plus, institutions are much more likely to buy into the staked ETF than the non-staked version because APR is what they all crave. Source: Token Terminal This institutional demand and relentless bid from DATs and retail investors is expected to send ETH to new highs around $7k. Fibonacci Extensions Point to $5.75K–$6.5K Breakout Zone On the technical front, the 3-day chart shows ETH breaking down from a local distribution range and pulling back into a major demand zone around the 50% retracement level at roughly $4,150–$3,900. Price is currently sitting just above the $3,000 support, with a broader liquidity pocket extending toward the 100% retracement near $3,350. Above the price, the fib extension cluster between $5,750 and $5,950 stands out as the next major magnet. The circled region around the –50% and –61.8% extensions shows clear confluence, suggesting that if ETH successfully reclaims $4,150 and rotates upward, that zone becomes the most probable medium-term target. The higher extensions toward $6,565 and beyond only activate after a decisive break and retest of the $4,950 mid-range level.

This, in turn, has affected the broader market, causing altcoins to suffer major losses during this time. While there are still hopes for a quick recovery, analysts have warned investors that the Bitcoin price is more likely to crash further before it rebounds. Nevertheless, expectations remain that the digital asset will hit a bottom and rally again. Why A Bitcoin Price Crash Is Likely Before A Recovery Pseudonymous crypto analyst Setupsfx has shared a possible roadmap that the Bitcoin price could follow in order to clear $126,000 again and rally to new all-time highs. Unlike those expecting a quick rebound, the crypto analyst has warned that it is likely that the digital asset will see a major crash first before there is any green on the chart. With the Bitcoin price having already breached $90,000, the optics continue to remain weak for the pioneer cryptocurrency. As a result, the analyst forecasts further decline as profit-taking exacerbates. The next major levels now lie at $60,000-$70,000, which would mean an over 20% crash for the Bitcoin price again . However, the crash to $60,000 does play into the next bullish trend as the analyst expects this to be the bottom. Thus, buying BTC around the $60,000-$70,000 level would be ideal, Setupsfx explained. This is because once the relief rally begins, the analyst expects the price to hit as high as $150,000 as a result. Nevertheless, the crypto analyst warns investors to always take the volatility of the Bitcoin price into account when investing. So, it is important to have adequate risk management practices in place, as there is no guarantee that the digital asset could play out as expected. Analysts Bearish In The Short-Term Only The Bitcoin price crash before a recovery theory is also seconded by crypto analyst Hyperkane, who also shared their own expectations for the cryptocurrency. The analyst also sees the Bitcoin price crashing down below $70,000 before a bottom is established. Across the board, though, the consensus looks to be that the Bitcoin price could start to rebound once it’s down around 40% from its all-time high. Therefore, it is highly likely that the sell-offs will continue as investors dump their BTC in the hopes that they will get to buy back the cryptocurrency at a much lower price.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 13:30:27

This comparison points to a potential, though not yet certain, launch into a period of exponential growth for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. A Historical Blueprint for a Bull Run In a detailed analysis, CrediBULL Crypto drew parallels between Bitcoin’s current price action and the S&P 500’s behavior between 2000 and 2008. The expert noted that both markets experienced mid-cycle tops characterized by extended periods of consolidation without a dramatic peak, called “flat corrections,” before starting the next major upward move. Following these phases, the S&P 500 suffered a 61% drop, while Bitcoin saw a 76% decline, before each started its final, explosive rally. CrediBULL now says that BTC is at a stage similar to where the S&P 500 was just before it went parabolic, which was followed by a 200% price increase. “On the SPX, just before we went parabolic, we saw a 37% correction to the downside. Which was immediately followed by new ATH and a 200+% rally off the lows to where we are today,” wrote the technician. This optimistic outlook is coming at a time when the OG crypto is trying to find stability, currently trading around $92,000 after a difficult month that saw it fall over 14%. The comparison offers a counter-narrative to the bearish sentiment prevailing in the market, suggesting the recent downturn may be a typical, though sharp, correction within a larger bull cycle rather than its end. CrediBULL insisted that a break of a short-term ascending trend line does not signify a breakdown in overall market structure, cautioning that traders who exited the S&P 500 on a similar technical break missed the huge rally that followed. For Bitcoin, the trader highlighted $74,000 as the line that truly matters, telling one follower that the “trend line isn’t relevant – 74k is.” Until then, they see BTC “hugging” its main trendline rather than starting the vertical part of the move. Market Sentiment and Diverging Views The analyst community is divided on BTC’s immediate future. While the historical pattern offers a hopeful framework, other experts have pointed to lingering headwinds. One of them, Axel Bitblaze, observed that Bitcoin’s recent decline is quite similar to a pattern from early 2025, which ended in a final sharp shakeout. According to him, rising Japanese bond yields and liquidity issues at smaller U.S. banks could serve as potential catalysts for another downturn. The market is also witnessing a flight of retail investors, with data from November 19 showing that small Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP wallets have been reducing their holdings, a behavior that, ironically, has often happened just before market recoveries. Ultimately, the debate centers on whether Bitcoin is completing a final bearish shakeout or is on the cusp of a historic breakout. CrediBULL argues that the cryptocurrency, being a younger and faster-moving asset, could replicate the S&P’s parabolic move in a much shorter timeframe.

54658187,631678,1763645682,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54658187.jpeg,Bitcoin Whale Activity Signals a New Phase for Bitcoin Layer-2s Like $HYPER,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-pumps-as-bitcoin-whale-activity-may-peak-this-week/,"Quick Facts: Elevated whale accumulation during price weakness suggests Bitcoin supply is rotating from short‑term traders to long‑term balance sheets. Bitcoin’s base layer remains constrained by low throughput, long block times, and volatile fees, limiting complex DeFi and high‑frequency use cases. Bitcoin Hyper uses an SVM‑based Layer 2 with BTC settlement anchoring to target low‑latency smart contracts around native Bitcoin liquidity. The $HYPER token presale has attracted a lot of attention from whales, helping push its raised amount to over $28.1M and counting. Bitcoin ($BTC) is still in limbo at around $91K, which could lead to the year’s most active whale week. Market intelligence platform Santiment showed over 102K transactions above $100K and roughly 29K transfers exceeding $1M during a recent drawdown window. That concentration of high‑value flows often appears when institutions, desks, and long‑horizon funds reposition. That shift matters. When price falls but whales buy, the market is signaling a rotation in who controls future supply. Bitcoin ownership slowly migrates from short‑term traders to balance sheets that think in multi‑year timeframes, not hourly candles. For infrastructure builders watching these flows, the message is straightforward. A growing base of large, patient $BTC holders will eventually demand more than simple cold storage and occasional transfers. They will want yield, composability, and institutional‑grade execution without sacrificing Bitcoin’s settlement security. That is the gap that newer Bitcoin Layer-2 designs are trying to fill. In particular, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a project aiming to give the Bitcoin ecosystem a much-needed boost with high-speed and low-cost transactions, as well as expanded $BTC utility. Whales Are Accumulating While Bitcoin’s Base Layer Stagnates When large holders buy dips, they are rarely chasing short‑term percentage moves. They are positioning for the next structural phase: ETF flows, macro cycles, or new yield sources built on top of existing Bitcoin liquidity. Currently, Bitcoin’s base layer can process only seven transactions per second (TPS), resulting in network congestion and high fees. In contrast, Solana can handle up to 65K TPS . You can see the tension in exchange and custodial behavior. Many institutions still prefer to keep $BTC idle on centralized venues because moving size on-chain during peak congestion means accepting delays, volatile fee markets, and a lack of programmability. To fill that gap, several scaling paths have emerged. Among these, Bitcoin Hyper enters the conversation with a solution that treats Bitcoin as the final ledger, while shifting heavy computation elsewhere and syncing its state periodically back to L1. Bitcoin Hyper Bets on SVM Speed Anchored to Bitcoin Security Bitcoin Hyper takes a modular approach that separates execution from settlement. Bitcoin remains the base settlement layer, while a high-throughput Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) environment handles transaction processing and smart contract logic in real-time. In practical terms, that means programmable activity in an SVM Layer 2 while periodically committing state roots back to Bitcoin. This results in Solana-level transaction speeds and low costs, while retaining Bitcoin’s robust security. On the asset side, Bitcoin Hyper uses a canonical bridge to move $BTC into the Layer-2 environment as wrapped assets. Once bridged, those tokens can flow through SVM smart contracts for swaps, lending, and staking, with SPL‑style token standards adapted for the L2. This architecture directly addresses the three pain points that have constrained Bitcoin-native DeFi: slow block times, high Layer-1 (L1) fees, and the absence of modern smart contract support. Want to learn more about the project? Be sure to read our ‘What Is Bitcoin Hyper?’ page. With its solid premise, the project has attracted a lot of attention from investors. Its presale has already raised over $28.1M at a $HYPER token price of $0.013305. It also offers a 41% APY in staking rewards to attract long-term investors. Smart money has also started probing exposure. Whales have begun pouring serious money into Bitcoin Hyper, including one worth over $500K less than a week ago, and then one yesterday that’s worth over $75K . For traders who track positioning, those allocations are not decisive on their own, but they are consistent with a broader shift toward infrastructure plays that closely track Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Find out how you can get your share of $HYPER tokens in our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide . Looking forward, the value proposition is simple. If Bitcoin remains the dominant settlement asset for institutions and long‑term holders, the winning infrastructure layers will be the ones that enable programmable yield, high‑speed payments, and composable DeFi around BTC itself. For now, the narrative is less about short‑term price targets and more about whether SVM‑based execution anchored to Bitcoin can attract durable liquidity, builders, and users as whale accumulation reshapes the ownership base. In this aspect, Bitcoin Hyper is taking solid steps to ensure that it becomes an important player in the Bitcoin L2 scene. It’s no wonder that its $HYPER token has the potential to reach a high of $0.20 based on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction . Don’t be left behind. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.

The attacker successfully laundered a significant portion of the stolen funds through Tornado Cash on both BSC and Ethereum networks, while roughly $1 million remains dormant on the Ethereum blockchain. According to information shared by ZachXBT on his Telegram channel, the exploiter consolidated the theft at address 0x2e8***5c38 before depositing 1,140 BNB , valued at $1.04 million, into Tornado Cash on BSC. According to Zach ( @zachxbt ), the GANA Payment’ project was exploited for over $3.1M on BSC earlier today.

The… pic.twitter.com/q7DL8Mdpzf — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) November 20, 2025 The attacker then bridged funds to Ethereum and moved another 346.8 ETH worth $1.05 million through the privacy mixer, though 346 ETH currently sits untouched at address 0x7a503***b3cca. Technical Breakdown Reveals Contract Ownership Manipulation Blockchain security firm HashDit quickly identified the root cause behind the breach after monitoring the suspicious activity. The ownership of GANA’s exploited contract was maliciously changed, granting the hacker unauthorized control over the protocol’s staking mechanism and allowing them to manipulate reward rates. This ownership transfer allowed the attacker to invoke unstake functions and receive substantially more GANA tokens than the system intended to distribute.

HashDit issued an urgent warning advising users to avoid trading GANA tokens until the team provides official guidance on the situation. The exploit adds another entry to BSC’s security record, which had seen relatively few major incidents throughout recent months. While BNB Chain experienced a 70% reduction in losses from $161 million in 2023 to $47 million in 2024, according to joint analysis from BNB Chain and Hacken, isolated attacks continue to test the network’s defenses despite enhanced security protocols implemented across the ecosystem. Earlier incidents on the network include a September phishing attack that drained $13.5 million from a Venus Protocol user after they approved a malicious transaction. However, the protocol’s smart contracts remained secure. In February, meme coin platform Four.Meme also suffered a $183,000 security breach through what appeared to be a sandwich attack, losing approximately 125 BNB during the incident that followed volatility around its Test token. Recovery Plan Announced as Team Launches Investigation GANA’s official team responded with an urgent announcement acknowledging the external attack on their interaction contract and confirming unauthorized asset theft. GANA Urgent Announcement GANA’s interaction contract has been targeted by an external attack, resulting in unauthorized asset theft. Our technical team, together with an independent third-party security firm, has initiated an emergency investigation to analyze the attack vector,… — GANA Payment (@GANA_PayFi) November 20, 2025 The team emphasized they have partnered with an independent third-party security firm to conduct an emergency investigation, analyzing the attack vector, identifying vulnerabilities, and assessing the complete scope of impact. The project pledged to activate a comprehensive reboot plan, including the complete mapping of all user asset addresses and their associated permissions. GANA apologized for the inconvenience caused by the incident and promised to share detailed recovery plans and timelines through official channels shortly. This exploit surfaced just after the crypto industry recorded its lowest monthly loss figures of the year, with only $18.18 million stolen across 15 separate incidents in October, according to PeckShield data . That represented an 85.7% decline from September’s $127.06 million in losses , though security experts warned that threat actors continue evolving their tactics at the same pace as protocols strengthen defenses. Notably, the GANA breach follows an even larger attack earlier this month when Balancer Protocol suffered losses exceeding $128 million across multiple chains . $116M in Crypto Assets Gone – Balancer Suffers One of DeFi’s Largest Exploits Over $116 million in crypto assets have been drained from Balancer Protocol, marking one of the most severe decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits of 2025.

While the liquid staking protocol StakeWise recovered $19.3 million in osETH through a contract call , reducing total losses to approximately $98 million, the incident caused Balancer’s total value locked to plummet from $442 million to $214.52 million within a single day.

Key Takeaways: Aztec launched Ignition Chain, claiming the first fully decentralized Layer-2 on Ethereum with programmable privacy. The network uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable private computation, with more than 500 validators registered at launch. Early demand for the AZTEC token is strong, with over $2.5 million in bids ahead of the public auction on December 2. The rollout comes days after the start of Aztec’s AZTEC token sale, which will power staking, governance, and block rewards across the new system. “Aztec just shipped the Ignition Chain,” the team wrote in a post on X on Wednesday, adding that the launch activates the decentralized consensus layer underpinning the entire network. Aztec’s Ignition Chain Brings Programmable Privacy to Ethereum The debut follows the public testnet introduced in May, where developers stress-tested the privacy infrastructure ahead of mainnet deployment. Ignition Chain introduces programmable privacy to Ethereum, aiming to solve one of the ecosystem’s long-standing trade-offs: transparency versus confidentiality. The network uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable private computation while maintaining verifiability. According to Aztec, validator registrations reached 500 this week, the threshold required for block production to begin on Ethereum mainnet. The project’s long-term ambition is a “private world computer” where developers can build DeFi applications that keep user data confidential by default. “2025–2035 will be Privacy’s turn of the wheel,” Aztec co-founder Zac Williamson said. A first in Ethereum history: At 1 am last night, the milestone was hit when the validator queue reached 500, triggering block production on the Ethereum mainnet. pic.twitter.com/gWB4ZZm2qd — Aztec (@aztecnetwork) November 19, 2025 He predicted a shift toward services that rely on distributed ledgers for settlement and privacy tech for execution, arguing that user data will move out of centralized Web2 platforms and into cryptographic systems controlled by individuals. Aztec’s momentum builds on its 2022 Series B raise, where it secured $100 million in funding led by a16z to advance zero-knowledge research and infrastructure. The network’s native AZTEC token will secure Ignition Chain through staking, with validators required to lock up 200,000 tokens to become active participants. Early interest in the token sale has been strong. Registration opened last week, drawing approximately $2.5 million across 2,088 bids from nearly 2,000 unique participants. Public auction bidding for the AZTEC token is scheduled to open on December 2. Aztec Unveils StealthNote, a Zero-Knowledge Whistleblowing Platform In April, Aztec Network introduced StealthNote , a zero-knowledge whistleblowing platform that lets employees anonymously report workplace concerns while proving they belong to a verified company domain. The tool uses ZK-proofs to validate Google-issued authentication tokens without revealing the user’s identity, ensuring both trust and confidentiality. The platform has been under development since late 2022 and has already gathered support from contributors across the Ethereum ecosystem, including members of the Ethereum Foundation, StarkWare, Scroll, and researchers from Columbia and Cornell. Early posts on the platform express enthusiasm for decentralized privacy tools, reflecting broader industry momentum around cryptographic protections. With StealthNote, Aztec continues to push the boundaries of how zero-knowledge technology can enhance privacy in real-world applications. In 2023, a coalition of Web3 companies established the “Universal Privacy Alliance” with the aim of safeguarding digital privacy rights. Nym, Protocol Labs, the Filecoin Foundation, Oasis, Aztec, and various other entities are part of the Universal Privacy Alliance (UPA).

Lawmakers at the House Administration Committee hearing on November 19 debated how to strengthen and reform the 2012 Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act. David Savickas, vice president of policy and government affairs at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, said during the Wednesday hearing that the framework in the law has proved sorely lacking. He noted that the STOCK Act does not prevent conflicted trading by members of Congress but requires them to report when and if they trade stocks. The STOCK Act was passed in 2012 to prohibit members of Congress from using nonpublic information for private profit. Meanwhile, the House Administration Committee hearing put the issue that has been brewing on Capitol Hill for months back in the spotlight. The recent government shutdown derailed much of congressional action. Savickas notes most Congress members breach the STOCK Act Dan Savickas noted that most members of Congress do not report their stock trades as mandated by the STOCK Act of 2012. He further noted that even when they do, many of them report way past the mandated time periods with little to no consequences so far. Lawmakers also aired additional grievances, arguing that there is a need for updates to the reporting and enforcement requirements in the STOCK Act. They also suggested a separate ban on members owning individual stock. However, the lawmakers noted that although proposals to implement such a ban have previously been presented at various points, most have mainly been stalled. For instance, in September, Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas-21) and Seth Magaziner (D-RI) presented a bill prohibiting lawmakers, their spouses, and dependent children from owning, buying, or selling individual stocks. The Restore Trust in Congress Act (H.R. 5106) also prohibits them from trading securities, commodities, or futures, with a few exceptions. The bill further requires current members of Congress to divest from all covered assets at fair market value within 180 days and incoming members to do so within 90 days of taking office. House Democrats and Republicans, including Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), and Anna Luna (R-Fla.) have backed the bill. However, no action has been taken since it was referred to the House Administration Committee. Magaziner urges Speaker Johnson to present the bill for a vote Seth Magaziner (D-RI) urged House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson to bring the bill to the floor as soon as possible for a vote. He pointed out that the American people have made it clear that hearings alone are not enough. Magaziner believes the bipartisan bill should be enacted to ban stock trading among Congress members once and for all. The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, along with nine other organizations, has also written a letter to House Administration Committee Chair Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) and ranking member Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.), urging the panel to hold a special meeting to discuss the bill. Rep Anna Luna (R-Fla.) also said if the House Committee does not announce it is taking action on the bill by Friday (November 21), she will introduce a discharge petition forcing floor action on the bill after the Thanksgiving break. “I think there’s a lot of self-interested narcissists …running Washington that want to get rich while the American people suffer, and that’s why you’re seeing such strong opposition against this. So, I’m calling out the bulls—, and I really don’t care who I piss off.” -Anna Luna, Congresswoman for Florida However, Luna pointed out that lawmakers in the upper chamber may not support the bill even if it passes the House. She believes the bill will not reach the president or be signed into law with any consequence. Burchett does not see the bill passing either, although he says he is waiting to be proven wrong.

That’s exactly what Sortera is achieving with groundbreaking AI technology that’s revolutionizing aluminum recycling. While cryptocurrency investors seek the next big technological disruption, this real-world application of artificial intelligence is generating actual cash flow by solving one of recycling’s toughest challenges. How AI Sorting Technology is Transforming Aluminum Recycling Sortera has developed an AI-powered system that identifies different aluminum grades with over 95% accuracy. The technology uses lasers, X-ray fluorescence, and high-speed cameras to analyze each aluminum chip in just 10 milliseconds. “Ten milliseconds is a long time,” says CEO Michael Siemer, highlighting the incredible speed required for industrial-scale aluminum recycling operations. The Scrap Aluminum Crisis and Sortera’s Solution Despite aluminum’s infinite recyclability, only about one-third of aluminum used in the U.S. gets recycled. The core problem has always been sorting mixed aluminum scrap efficiently. Traditional methods require melting the aluminum first to identify alloy types, making the process energy-intensive and costly. Sortera’s breakthrough eliminates this bottleneck. Key Advantages of Sortera’s System: 95%+ sorting accuracy for different aluminum grades 10-millisecond classification per aluminum chip Air nozzle system for precise material separation No melting required for alloy identification Automotive Industry Driving Aluminum Recycling Demand The automotive industry represents the perfect circular economy for Sortera’s technology. Most scrap aluminum processed by the company comes from shredded automobiles, and the sorted material often returns to automotive assembly lines. “Every auto OEM on the planet has been to Indiana at least twice,” Siemer notes, emphasizing the strong interest from automotive manufacturers seeking lightweight materials for improved fuel efficiency. From Startup to Cash Flow Positive: The Profitability Breakthrough Sortera’s secret weapon isn’t just technology—it’s profitability. The company became cash flow positive in August 2025, operating just one plant in Indiana. The margin structure reveals why accuracy matters: “The margin is exponential above 90%, [while] 92% gets you a nice little margin, 95% gets you a big margin, [and] 98% is a really big margin.” Recent Funding and Expansion Funding Type Amount Lead Investors Equity $20 million VXI Capital, T. Rowe Price Debt $25 million Overlay Capital, Yamaha Motor Ventures Equipment Funding Additional Trinity Capital The funding supports construction of a second plant in Tennessee near Nashville, scheduled to launch in April or May 2026. This expansion replicates the successful Indiana facility that processes “millions of pounds a month” running “full-tilt, 24-7.” The Science Behind AI Aluminum Classification Sortera’s AI model leverages unique physical properties of different aluminum alloys. When shredded, each aluminum grade fractures differently, creating distinctive tears and folds that provide visual clues for classification. “The chemical differences manifest themselves in the shredding,” Siemer explains. This allows the system to confidently identify specific grades like 356 aluminum within the critical 10-millisecond window. Future Applications Beyond Aluminum Recycling While currently focused on aluminum, Sortera is developing capabilities for other metals including copper and titanium. The company’s technology platform could potentially transform recycling across multiple metal categories, creating new revenue streams and environmental benefits. FAQs About Sortera and Aluminum Recycling Technology What companies are involved with Sortera? VXI Capital and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price led the recent funding round, with participation from Yamaha Motor Ventures and Overlay Capital. Trinity Capital provides equipment funding. Who is Michael Siemer? Michael Siemer is the CEO of Sortera Alloys and has been instrumental in developing the company’s AI sorting technology. Under his leadership, Sortera achieved cash flow positivity and secured significant venture funding. What automotive manufacturers use recycled aluminum? While specific automotive partners aren’t named, Siemer notes that “every auto OEM on the planet” has visited Sortera’s Indiana facility, indicating broad industry interest across the automotive sector. The Billion-Dollar Opportunity in American Aluminum Sortera’s vision extends beyond current operations. “We could instantly sort the 18 billion tons of aluminum made annually in the U.S.,” Siemer states. “Every piece of that, every pound would be sold at a profit in the U.S.” This represents a massive untapped market that could fundamentally change how America handles its aluminum waste stream. Sortera’s success demonstrates how AI technology can solve real-world environmental and economic challenges. By turning scrap aluminum into valuable, sorted materials, the company is not only generating profits but also creating a more sustainable manufacturing ecosystem. The combination of technological innovation, market demand, and environmental benefits positions Sortera as a model for how technology can drive both business success and positive environmental impact.

He described these users as people who expect money to be “as instantly movable as a text or a video file.” He presented this as a direct expectation. It is not a distant trend, but how younger investors already think. He explained that most money exists as digital information on ledgers. He noted that blockchain reflects reality, contrasting this with the legacy system , which relies on many ledgers that do not work together. That structure slows transactions. It also adds friction that affects both consumers and institutions. Disadvantages of Legacy Systems McLoughlin described how these separate ledgers create extra steps. Each step raises costs and slows the process. He stated that this setup creates unnecessary friction. He pointed out that new generations want quick transfers across borders. They want reliability. They want clarity. They do not desire delays caused by outdated systems. His focus remained on speed. This expectation reshapes how financial tools must operate.

It performs well in cross-border environments. These features align with the demands of digital native generations. Users who expect fast settlement will choose assets that deliver it. Institutions that move money between markets will prefer tools that remove friction caused by disconnected ledgers. XRP was built for these exact conditions. Rietveld shared the video at a time when digital finance is moving toward higher speed and greater efficiency. McLoughlin’s remarks reflect a shift that is already taking place, as younger investors expect better tools. Businesses also depend on reliable systems that handle global movement without delay. XRP functions in that space today and remains the best solution for the financial environment described in the video.

The execution of the payment was done in the presence of Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, at Qasr Al Watan in Abu Dhabi, in the presence of Khaled Mohamed Balama, Governor of the Central Bank of the UAE. The “Jisr” platform or better known as MBridge , for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), was established by BIS with the participation of a group of UAE and Chinese banks. It aims to facilitate cross-border payments, significantly reduce transaction costs, and provide instant payment settlement. As per the announcement , the platform is expected to undergo further expansion in 2026, with the addition of more central banks. UAE’s first digital dirham CBDC transaction between governmental entities Saudi Arabia had joined the cross-border CBDC project known as MBridge. In 2024, in an IMF blog, it noted that almost two-thirds of countries in the Middle East and Central Asia are exploring the adoption of a central bank digital currency, with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the more advanced proof of concept stages. IMF has noted that the countries in MENA and Central Asia are studying CBDCs as a way to promote financial inclusion and improve the efficiency of cross-border payments. This recent cross-border payment between the UAE and China comes as the UAE prepares to launch its CBDC, the digital dirham, with a piloted settlement already taking place between two governmental entities. The settlement was carried out between the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Dubai Department of Finance (DOF), in collaboration with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), and was completed in less than two minutes.

The September jobs data revealed a massive 119,000 increase in employment, more than doubling analyst expectations and sending ripples across financial markets. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these nonfarm payrolls numbers is crucial for predicting Federal Reserve policy moves that could impact digital asset prices. Why Do Nonfarm Payrolls Matter for Crypto Investors? The nonfarm payrolls report serves as a critical economic health indicator that directly influences Federal Reserve decisions. When nonfarm payrolls exceed expectations significantly, it suggests economic strength that could lead to tighter monetary policy. This particular nonfarm payrolls surprise of 119,000 jobs created versus the forecasted 53,000 indicates robust labor market conditions that the Fed cannot ignore. Breaking Down the September Jobs Report The US Department of Labor’s announcement contained several key data points that market participants need to understand: Nonfarm payrolls increase: 119,000 jobs added Market expectations: 53,000 jobs Unemployment rate: 4.4% (slightly above 4.3% forecast) Data significance: Final report before December FOMC meeting This substantial beat in nonfarm payrolls numbers comes at a critical juncture for monetary policy. The strong performance in nonfarm payrolls suggests the economy may be running hotter than anticipated, which could influence the Fed’s interest rate decisions. What’s the Immediate Impact on Federal Reserve Policy? The timing of this nonfarm payrolls report makes it particularly significant. Since the Bureau of Labor Statistics has canceled October’s report and delayed November’s data until December 16th, these September nonfarm payrolls represent the only employment data the Fed will have before their December 11th meeting. This creates a situation where these specific nonfarm payrolls numbers carry extraordinary weight in policy deliberations. Strong nonfarm payrolls typically signal that the economy can handle higher interest rates without slipping into recession. However, the slightly higher unemployment rate of 4.4% provides a nuanced picture that policymakers must balance. How Should Crypto Traders React to Strong Nonfarm Payrolls? For cryptocurrency market participants, robust nonfarm payrolls data presents both challenges and opportunities. Historically, strong employment numbers have led to: Potential for higher interest rates which can pressure risk assets Dollar strength that might affect crypto valuations Revised inflation expectations influencing Fed policy Market volatility around Fed meeting dates The key takeaway from these nonfarm payrolls figures is that the US economy continues to demonstrate remarkable strength despite numerous headwinds. This resilience in nonfarm payrolls growth suggests that the Fed may maintain its hawkish stance longer than some market participants anticipated. Looking Beyond the Headline Nonfarm Payrolls Numbers While the headline nonfarm payrolls figure of 119,000 certainly grabs attention, smart investors should consider the broader context. The unemployment rate ticking up to 4.4% indicates there might be some softening in labor market conditions despite the strong job creation. This combination of factors makes the December FOMC meeting particularly unpredictable. The absence of additional nonfarm payrolls data until after the Fed’s December meeting means markets will be parsing every other economic indicator with increased scrutiny. Every inflation report, retail sales figure, and manufacturing index will take on added importance in the coming weeks. Final Thoughts: Navigating Market Reactions The surprising strength in September’s nonfarm payrolls serves as a reminder that economic data can consistently defy expectations. For cryptocurrency investors, this underscores the importance of monitoring traditional economic indicators alongside blockchain metrics. The nonfarm payrolls report remains one of the most reliable predictors of Federal Reserve policy shifts that ultimately affect all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. As we approach the December FOMC meeting with limited additional employment data, these nonfarm payrolls numbers will likely dominate the policy discussion. The substantial beat in nonfarm payrolls creates a compelling narrative of economic resilience that could shape monetary policy for months to come. Frequently Asked Questions What are nonfarm payrolls? Nonfarm payrolls measure the number of jobs added in the US economy, excluding farm workers, private household employees, and non-profit organization employees. It’s a key indicator of economic health. Why do nonfarm payrolls affect cryptocurrency prices? Strong nonfarm payrolls can lead to tighter Federal Reserve policy, including higher interest rates, which typically pressure risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The relationship stems from monetary policy expectations. How often is the nonfarm payrolls report released? The nonfarm payrolls report is typically released monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, the October report has been canceled and November’s data delayed until December 16th. What was the market expectation for September nonfarm payrolls? Analysts expected 53,000 jobs to be added, making the actual result of 119,000 a significant surprise that more than doubled forecasts. When is the next FOMC meeting after this report? The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for December 11th, making this September nonfarm payrolls report the only employment data available before that meeting. How does the unemployment rate factor into Fed decisions? While the nonfarm payrolls beat expectations, the unemployment rate of 4.4% came in slightly above the 4.3% forecast, providing a mixed signal that the Fed must consider alongside other economic data.

This news came after the electronics maker realized that its EV sector had started generating more profits faster than any other sector. During its third-quarter earnings call, Xiaomi announced that it is on track to achieve its previous goal of delivering 350,000 units by the end of this week. On Thursday, November 20, Xiaomi’s founder, chairman, and CEO Lei Jun shared this update on social media and celebrated the production of the company’s 500,000th vehicle. Xiaomi’s EV and AI division records an impressive earnings report Best known for its smartphones and the development of a network of smart devices connected through an IoT platform, Xiaomi has consistently surpassed analysts’ expectations since tapping into the car market. According to reports, the Beijing-based tech company transitioned from its first sale early last year to achieving profitability in this venture just last quarter. In the company, the EV and AI division reported impressive results, achieving a profit of 700 million yuan, equivalent to approximately $98 million. The division yielded this profit roughly 19 months after launching its first SU7 electric sedan last year. This earnings report sparked debates among individuals in the tech ecosystem. When reporters reached out to Xiaomi to comment on these controversies, the company stated that the rapid rise in production and the swift journey to generating more profits are crucial to the company’s success. This is particularly relevant at this time, as Xiaomi faces challenges in both the smartphone and electric vehicle markets. However, the company is concerned that a global shortage of memory chips , previously reported, may impact these strong earnings. This is because it is anticipated that the shortage will consequently increase the costs for both of Xiaomi’s key business sectors. Additionally, the slow removal of a Chinese tax incentive for EV purchases is expected to lower demand. Despite these challenges, Lei remains optimistic about the potential for growth in the EV sector. In his statement, the CEO highlighted that Xiaomi intends to adopt various strategies, such as reducing customer wait times, improving production, and making significant investments in research and development to launch new features, including smarter AI for its driver-assistance system, to boost its earnings and address these challenges. Supply shortage for memory chips sparks concerns among tech firms Reports dated November 18 pointed out that Xiaomi’s expectation that a shortage of memory chips will result in price hikes for mobile devices in 2026 aligns with the warning from other tech firms regarding a potential supply challenge for this significant component next year. Lu Weibing, the Partner and President of Xiaomi Corporation, stated that the tech company has made various deals to ensure sufficient supplies for next year. He also mentioned that Xiaomi would increase the prices of its products to offset the predicted surge in component costs during a post-earnings call. According to him, the memory chip shortage could be worse and last longer than the previous one. Xiaomi’s president made these remarks after Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), a major Chinese chipmaker, issued a warning about a potential memory shortage that could impact both the manufacturing of cars and consumer electronics in 2026. Meanwhile, a wave of investments worldwide in data centers has fueled the need for advanced memory to power AI accelerators, prompting a shortage of lower-end chips as major companies such as SK Hynix Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. focus on supplying components to Nvidia Corp. On the other hand, Xiaomi has been enhancing its smartphone lineup with more premium models, including the flagship 17 series, which is intended to compete with Apple Inc.’s latest devices.

Here's the Latest Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-etfs-end-five-day-outswing-streak-heres-the-latest-data/,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have returned to net inflow territory after five days of uninterrupted outflows. According to SoSoValue data, the funds recorded a total net inflow of $75.47 million on Wednesday. Spot Bitcoin ETFs End Five-Day Outstrip BlackRock's IBIT fund saw the largest inflow with $60.61 million, followed by Grayscale Mini Bitcoin Trust with $53.84 million. This rebound comes on the heels of IBIT's record outflow of $523 million the day before. In contrast, two major funds reported outflows: Fidelity’s FBTC fund saw $21.35 million and VanEck’s HODL fund saw $17.63 million. A five-day series of withdrawals between November 12 and 18 saw a total of $2.26 billion withdrawn from ETFs. During this period, the price of Bitcoin plummeted, falling below $90,000 and significantly departing from its previous ATH of $126,000. Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu stated that ETF outflows are not “institutional capitulation,” but rather position adjustments. He believes risk appetite will quickly return once the macroeconomic outlook clears. The biggest factor in this uncertainty is the Fed's interest rate decision at its December meeting. Jerome Powell's statements have weakened market expectations for a rate cut, with the probability of a 25 basis point cut in December falling from 48.9% to 33.8%, according to the FedWatch Tool. The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 11 also reflects investors' cautious stance. Despite all this pressure, Bitcoin rose 0.72% in the last 24 hours, recovering to $92,200. Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, have been experiencing outflows for seven days, with a total outflow of $37.35 million yesterday. *This is not investment advice.

The Bridgewater Associates founder recently disclosed he’s allocated approximately 1% of his portfolio to Bitcoin, marking a significant shift in his previously cautious stance toward cryptocurrency investments. Why Does Ray Dalio’s Bitcoin Portfolio Matter? Ray Dalio’s decision to include Bitcoin in his investment strategy signals growing institutional acceptance. However, his approach remains measured. The 1% Bitcoin portfolio allocation represents what many experts call a ‘toe in the water’ strategy – enough to gain exposure without taking substantial risk. Dalio explained his reasoning during a CNBC interview, emphasizing that while he sees potential in Bitcoin, he remains cautious about its limitations. His balanced perspective provides valuable insights for both crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors considering digital asset exposure. What Are Dalio’s Main Concerns About Bitcoin? The billionaire investor highlighted several key challenges facing Bitcoin’s widespread adoption. His primary concern revolves around Bitcoin’s ability to function as a reserve currency for major nations. Dalio pointed to two specific issues: Traceability concerns – Unlike cash transactions, Bitcoin leaves a permanent public record Quantum computing threats – Future technological advances could potentially compromise Bitcoin’s security These factors, according to Dalio, limit Bitcoin’s appeal as a primary reserve asset for governments and large institutions. However, his decision to maintain a Bitcoin portfolio suggests he sees value despite these limitations. How Should Investors Approach Their Own Bitcoin Portfolio? Dalio’s 1% allocation provides a practical framework for conservative investors. Building a diversified Bitcoin portfolio requires careful consideration of several factors: Risk tolerance assessment – Determine what percentage aligns with your comfort level Investment timeline – Cryptocurrency investments often require longer time horizons Portfolio rebalancing – Regular adjustments maintain target allocation percentages Many financial advisors recommend starting with small allocations similar to Dalio’s approach, then adjusting based on market conditions and personal risk appetite. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? Dalio’s cautious endorsement represents a middle ground in the ongoing debate about Bitcoin’s role in modern finance. While he acknowledges Bitcoin’s potential as an alternative asset, he stops short of endorsing it as a primary investment vehicle. The fact that such a respected traditional investor maintains any Bitcoin portfolio allocation speaks volumes about cryptocurrency’s evolving status. It suggests that even skeptical investors now recognize Bitcoin’s potential role in diversified portfolios. Key Takeaways for Your Investment Strategy Ray Dalio’s approach to Bitcoin offers several valuable lessons for investors of all experience levels. His strategic Bitcoin portfolio allocation demonstrates that even cautious investors can benefit from cryptocurrency exposure when approached thoughtfully. Remember these crucial points when considering your own Bitcoin portfolio strategy: Start small – Begin with conservative allocations like Dalio’s 1% Understand the risks – Acknowledge both technological and regulatory challenges Maintain perspective – View cryptocurrency as part of a broader investment strategy Ultimately, Dalio’s move validates Bitcoin’s position in modern finance while reminding investors to approach with both optimism and caution. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Ray Dalio allocate only 1% to Bitcoin? Dalio maintains a conservative approach, viewing Bitcoin as a speculative asset with both potential and significant risks. The 1% allocation provides exposure while limiting downside risk. What are Dalio’s main concerns about Bitcoin? He primarily worries about Bitcoin’s traceability and potential vulnerability to quantum computing, which he believes limits its ability to become a major reserve currency. Should I copy Dalio’s 1% Bitcoin allocation? While Dalio’s approach provides a useful reference, your allocation should match your personal risk tolerance, investment goals, and financial situation. How has Dalio’s view on Bitcoin changed over time? He’s evolved from calling Bitcoin a bubble to acknowledging its potential as an alternative asset, though he remains cautious about its limitations. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s price? While endorsements from major investors can boost confidence, cryptocurrency prices remain highly volatile and influenced by multiple factors beyond individual allocations. Is now a good time to start a Bitcoin portfolio? Market timing is challenging. Many experts recommend dollar-cost averaging into positions rather than trying to time market entries perfectly.

54659205,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90180,1763647524,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Just Got Called Out,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-got-called-out/,"In a bold pronouncement that is turning heads across crypto Twitter, John Squire highlighted remarks from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan that place XRP at the very center of a coming wave of institutional money. According to Hougan, 2026 could bring an “ETF Palooza” — and XRP could be one of its biggest beneficiaries. The ETF Palooza Forecast Hougan told CNBC that he expects more than 100 new crypto ETFs and ETPs to launch next year. He said, “We’re going to see a lot of single‑asset crypto ETPs. What I’m most excited about, though, is the growth of index‑based crypto ETPs.” He argues that many investors entering now won’t want to pick between Ethereum, Solana, or Bitcoin. Rather, they’ll favor simple exposure through a diversified basket. As he put it, “They don’t necessarily have an opinion on Ethereum versus Solana, they just want to buy a broad swath of the crypto market and hold it for the long term.” XRP JUST GOT CALLED OUT Matt Hougan from Bitwise says a huge wave of new crypto ETFs is about to hit the market and puts Solana and $XRP at the front of the line. The ETF rush is starting and institutions are already watching #XRP closely. XRP is ready. pic.twitter.com/0YIDpIYvLD — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) November 19, 2025 Why XRP Rises to the Fore Hougan’s endorsement of XRP isn’t incidental. He has previously listed XRP among 11 altcoins that could benefit under the SEC’s new generic listing standards . He sees XRP not just as a speculative token but as a core component of future index-based ETPs. That suggests Bitwise envisions XRP becoming a foundational building block in mainstream, regulated crypto products — not just a fringe play. Regulatory Shift: The Catalyst Part of Hougan’s optimism stems from recent changes at the SEC, which adopted new generic listing rules for crypto ETPs. These rules are expected to speed up approvals, reducing the time needed from hundreds of days to as few as 75. According to Hougan, this regulatory overhaul is exactly what could trigger the ETF boom. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Yet he also tempers his bullishness with a warning: faster approvals don’t guarantee huge inflows. He noted that listing speed alone won’t spark demand unless broader market fundamentals support real investment. The Institutional Playbook Bitwise’s moves align with Hougan’s vision. The firm recently launched its Solana Staking ETF, which not only tracks SOL but also captures staking yield — a compelling hook for long-term, yield-seeking investors. Hougan believes that products like these, combined with index ETPs that include XRP, will reshape how institutions and mainstream investors access digital assets. He confidently asserted: “This industry will be 10 times bigger than it is today.” A Public Call-Out, Not Just a Nod John Squire’s coverage isn’t just retelling Hougan’s optimism — it frames it as a call-out. This isn’t casual praise; it’s a public spotlight on XRP as a legitimate candidate to anchor the next generation of regulated crypto products. For XRP watchers, that signal holds weight: Bitwise isn’t merely acknowledging XRP — it’s planning to elevate it. If Hougan’s forecast plays out, the coming ETF wave could redefine how capital flows into crypto. And XRP may finally be stepping into the spotlight it has long sought.

The upgrade introduces a redesigned trading interface and a pioneering funding framework, creating a professional environment that enhances efficiency, lowers entry barriers, and accelerates capital access for traders worldwide. Elevating the Trading Experience: A Professional Workspace Reimagined Traditional trading models often demand significant personal capital, limiting opportunities for even the most skilled traders. PropW challenges this convention with a proprietary trading model that assumes market risk, allowing traders to focus solely on strategy and performance. Through a rigorous assessment process, qualified traders gain access to platform-provided capital, redefining how trading potential is unlocked. Having validated the maturity and viability of this model, PropW is now transforming the entire trader experience. This latest upgrade emphasises operational fluidity, strategic immersion, and cross-device harmony. It aims to create a workspace where professionals can trade without friction or distraction. “At PropW, every decision starts with our traders,” said Sonic Hoo, Head of PropW. “True innovation happens when we understand what empowers them freedom to trade, flexibility to grow, and fairness in opportunity. What we’re building is more than a platform; it’s a professional space where capable traders can thrive within a system designed to amplify their potential.” The redesigned trading interface introduces three key enhancements. First, a modular workspace allows traders to drag, resize, and arrange components to fit their individual strategies, transforming multi-asset and multi-timeframe workflows for greater efficiency. Second, a suite of integrated professional tools offers everything from core indicators to advanced analytics, backed by real-time data feeds and low-latency execution. Finally, cross-device synergy ensures a seamless, touch-optimised experience across desktop, mobile, and tablet, enabling consistent performance wherever traders choose to operate. Collectively, these enhancements create a smoother, more efficient workflow that elevates the overall trading experience. Dynamic Funding Structure: Empowering Traders Through Flexible Capital While a professional trading environment provides the foundation, flexible funding determines how far traders can scale their strategies. To address this, PropW has introduced a Dynamic Funding Structure featuring two tailored pathways designed for different experience levels. For seasoned professionals, 1.1 Step Pro Mode offers a fast-track route with evaluation cycles as short as six days. Successful participants can access up to $200,000 in trading capital, with a reduced second-phase profit target of just 0.1% and a minimum of three trading days per phase. Combined with competitive entry fees, it enables experienced traders to qualify faster and at lower costs, accelerating their transition to live trading. Meanwhile, Standard Mode caters to emerging or more conservative traders by prioritising accessibility and gradual skill-building. Entry starts from $28 USD, granting access to trading education and a $2,000 live trading account (subject to platform terms). Tiered profit targets of 5% in Phase One and 10% in Phase Two encourage steady progress in a realistic market setting, allowing traders to develop at their own pace. Together, these pathways reaffirm PropW’s commitment to empowering traders at every stage. From ambitious newcomers to seasoned professionals, the platform provides world-class infrastructure and flexible access to capital. Building a Fair and Sustainable Ecosystem PropW’s mission is to create a transparent, merit-based ecosystem where traders and the platform grow together. Its Comprehensive Professional Trading Competency (CPTC) evaluation model rewards genuine skill, with no restrictions on news-driven or high-frequency trading, and no hidden clauses, ensuring full strategic freedom. In alignment with its shared-growth philosophy, PropW enables traders to retain up to 90% of the profits of the trading gains achieved within its proprietary capital program. Additionally, its “First Withdrawal, Full Evaluation Fee Rebate” programme reimburses the initial assessment fee once traders complete their first successful profit withdrawal, reinforcing the platform’s results-driven, trader-first ethos. Within its first year, PropW has funded over 3,000 traders, providing $88 million in cumulative trading capital and distributing $1.66 million in profits, which stands as a testament to the model’s sustainability and growing market recognition. Recently, PropW was named “Most Trusted and Most Advantageous Prop Firm” by the independent firm FundedMatch, underscoring its excellence in product design, trading conditions, and platform credibility. Looking Ahead As the crypto trading landscape matures, professionalism and rationality are becoming the new standards. Through ongoing innovation in user experience and capital access, PropW is committed to helping skilled traders convert insights into consistent returns. PropW will continue to refine its platform, strengthen trader support, and advance a more equitable and professional proprietary trading ecosystem for the digital age. About PropW PropW is the world’s first proprietary trading platform designed specifically for cryptocurrency traders. It enables traders to access platform-provided capital and showcase their trading capabilities through a structured evaluation system. Top-performing traders may earn up to 90% profit share.

54659320,https://cryptonews.com/?p=454314,1763647695,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54659320.jpeg,[LIVE] U.S. Employment Report Released: September Jobs Data Shows 119K Payrolls Added as Bitcoin Holds $92K – Can Crypto Markets Rally?,https://cryptonews.com/news/live-u-s-employment-report-released-september-jobs-data-shows-119k-payrolls-added-as-bitcoin-holds-92k-can-crypto-markets-rally/,"Crypto markets are processing the long-awaited September employment report released today after a six-week delay caused by the federal government shutdown. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payrolls edged up by 119,000 in September , significantly beating Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 50,000 but revealing broader weakness as employment “ has shown little change since April. ” The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% from 4.1% a year earlier, with 7.6 million Americans now jobless. Bitcoin is trading around $92,000 , up roughly 0.6% over the past 24 hours, holding above the critical psychological level despite record ETF outflows and extreme fear gripping crypto markets. The jobs data comes at a pivotal moment, as Fed rate-cut odds have collapsed to just 33% from nearly 100% three weeks ago, leaving crypto traders caught between modest employment growth that could keep rates higher for longer and underlying labor-market weakness that typically supports eventual monetary easing. The report reveals troubling undercurrents beneath the headline number. July and August payrolls were revised down by a combined 33,000 jobs , with August actually showing a loss of 4,000 positions rather than the initially reported 22,000 gain. Federal government employment has plunged by 97,000 since January, transportation and warehousing shed 25,000 jobs in September alone, and the data collection rate of 80.2% raises questions about accuracy, given the shutdown disruptions. The BLS confirmed it will not publish an October 2025 employment report , and November’s data won’t arrive until December 16—six days after the Federal Reserve’s final policy meeting of the year. This data vacuum creates unprecedented uncertainty for crypto markets, which have become hypersensitive to macro signals. Average hourly earnings rose just 0.2% monthly (3.8% annually), suggesting wage pressure is moderating but not collapsing, while the labor force participation rate held steady at 62.4%. For crypto, the mixed signals offer no clear directional catalyst: employment growth above 100K traditionally signals economic resilience that reduces dovish Fed pressure, yet the revisions, rising unemployment, and federal job losses paint a picture of gradual deterioration. Bitcoin and crypto markets sit at a technical inflection point as they digest these numbers. The total crypto market cap has crashed from $4.3 trillion to roughly $3.2 trillion over the past six weeks, with Bitcoin losing 27% from its October highs near $126,000. The employment data adds another layer of complexity—stronger-than-expected job growth might initially pressure crypto on fears of sustained restrictive policy, but the revisions and rising unemployment could ultimately reinforce the case for eventual Fed cuts in 2026. With Treasury yields holding above 4.1%, the dollar at six-month highs, and crypto sentiment in extreme fear, today’s jobs release serves as a critical test of whether Bitcoin can finally stabilize and reverse its worst monthly performance since the 2022 bear market.

According to him, the progress in hand movements between generations was unbelievable, and he would want to compete in UFC fights against the robots. On the “Invest Like the Best with Patrick O’Shaughnessy,” Ari Emanuel said, “I believe in Elon Musk I came up to him, and I said, ‘I want to do UFC fights with the robots.” He teased the idea of a fight between Chinese and American robots. The entertainment boss said that Musk dismissed the idea. Instead, the billionaire showed him robots that could throw punches and kicks. Ari Emanuel proposes a new way for Musk to make money In a new era of AI-generated content, Emanuel is leaning hard into live experiences, like food and art festivals and sporting events. He praised Musk for his work on the long list of innovative and AI-powered companies he leads. “If I’m a betting man, I’m betting on that dude,” Emanuel said . Emanuel made it clear that he’s no expert in the algorithms and data centers that make AI possible, but he does have knowledge in entertainment. He said he knows how to create “really great live events” and monetize them. Previously, Emmanuel’s TodayTix Group partnered with more than 10,000 theaters, producers, and cultural institutions. It has more than 20 million members in the US, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Additionally, Emmanuel launched MARI and acquired art-fair and media company Frieze from Endeavor. MARI also bought IMG’s portfolio of international tennis events, which includes the Miami and Madrid Open tennis tournaments. To that end, Emmanuel provides ways for Musk to make money beyond selling the robots. The billionaire declared that by 2040, there will be at least 10 billion humanoid robots priced between $20,000 and $25,000. In contrast, Elon Musk stated that in the future, we won’t need jobs or money, and poverty will be eliminated. At the US-Saudi Investment Forum on Monday, where Musk sat on a panel with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Musk stated that money would “stop being relevant” due to the impact of AI. Additionally, on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Musk said that when AI and robotics like Tesla’s Optimus eliminate all work and money, the government should hand out a universal income. To that end, it is unclear whether Musk wants to make money or get rid of it. China’s humanoid robots hit the market as the US plans As Elon Musk made plans to manufacture an army of Tesla bots in Silicon Valley this month, humanoid robots were already being produced and sold to consumers in China. Chinese and US companies have begun a battle to build the world’s best bots. While it’s early days, experts say China is leading in the quantity of robots delivered to consumers, while America is ahead in the quality of robots demonstrated. Recently, Musk bragged about Tesla’s Optimus bots at his company’s shareholder meeting. He outlined plans for a factory in Fremont that he said will someday have the capacity to build a million bots a year, which would sell for around $20,000 in today’s dollars. However, one of China’s leading robotics companies , Unitree Robotics, already has a humanoid robot on the market that can walk, dance, and perform basic tasks. Its least expensive version costs around $6,000. Seven robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics, AgiBot, EngineAI, Robot Era, and Dobot Robotics, were added to this year's Top 50 Most Innovative Companies list released by Forbes China yesterday. Only three robotics firms made the list in 2024 and 2023. @UnitreeRobotics … pic.twitter.com/UZgitbujug — Yicai 第一财经 (@yicaichina) November 14, 2025 On the other hand, Musk has previously stated that Tesla has invested considerable effort in developing human-like hands for Optimus, describing it as “an incredibly difficult engineering challenge.” China’s government assistance and manufacturing skills also put the country in a good position to get a big stake in the humanoid robot industry, which is expected to be worth $5 trillion by 2050. This is a lot more than Musk’s estimate of 10 billion by 2040.

This intense capitulation, according to analysts, is creating a potential setup for a major market reversal as weak hands exit and long-term investors accumulate. Extreme Stress for Short-Term Holders New on-chain readings shared by XWIN Research show Bitcoin’s Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR) has dipped to about 0.97 and has stayed below 1.0 for several weeks now. It means those who bought BTC in the last few months are selling at a loss on average, forming what the firm calls a “capitulation band” that has previously appeared only near major turning points in Bitcoin cycles. The Short-Term Holder MVRV ratio has also fallen well below 1.0, placing the same group of investors underwater and signaling one of the weakest profitability phases in the dataset. According to XWIN, more than 65,000 BTC have been sent to exchanges at a loss, showing that fear is not just theoretical but visible in real selling. At the same time, pseudonymous analyst Darkfost noted that while short-term holders are dominating day-to-day flows, long-term holders (LTHs) are now adding real sell pressure. They shared Spent Transaction Output (STXO) data showing STH flows remain high but relatively balanced, while LTH STXO has spiked, pointing out that such patterns are usually seen near market tops or during major stress events. Capitulation Amid Retail Fear Looking at the markets, BTC is trading around $91,000, down about 13% over the past week and nearly 18% in the last 30 days, while essentially flat across 12 months. The premier cryptocurrency has moved between roughly $90,000 and $94,000 in the last 24 hours and remains about 27% below its October all-time high north of $126,000. Additionally, data shows that small BTC wallets have dumped around 0.36% of their holdings in just five days, with similar selling in ETH and XRP, reflecting deep retail anxiety. The Fear and Greed Index also recently dropped to a nine-month low, mirroring levels last seen during major market panics. However, some longer-term signals look more constructive. For example, realized losses for Bitcoin recently reached about -16%, a zone that in previous cycles came right before recoveries. Analysts are also reporting record 30-day demand from long-term “permanent” holders and fresh accumulation from buyers such as El Salvador, which just added more than 1,000 BTC during the dip.

That’s exactly what the groundbreaking Bitcoin for America bill proposes, potentially changing how Americans interact with cryptocurrency forever. This revolutionary legislation could transform Bitcoin from a speculative asset into a practical financial tool. What Exactly is the Bitcoin for America Bill? U.S. Representative Warren Davidson has introduced the Bitcoin for America bill, a landmark piece of legislation that aims to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States. Moreover, it seeks to exempt capital gains taxes when Bitcoin is used for tax payments. This represents a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. The bill builds upon existing executive orders and seeks to codify Bitcoin’s role in America’s financial future. Therefore, it addresses two critical aspects: national cryptocurrency strategy and individual tax benefits. How Would the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Work? The strategic Bitcoin reserve concept mirrors how countries hold gold reserves. Essentially, the government would accumulate and hold Bitcoin as part of its national assets. This approach recognizes Bitcoin’s growing importance in the global financial system. Key benefits of this strategic reserve include: Diversification of national assets beyond traditional currencies Protection against currency devaluation Positioning the US as a leader in digital asset adoption What Tax Benefits Does the Bitcoin for America Bill Offer? The tax exemption component represents a major breakthrough for cryptocurrency users. Currently, using Bitcoin to pay taxes triggers capital gains tax on any appreciation. However, the Bitcoin for America bill would eliminate this tax burden, making cryptocurrency more practical for everyday transactions. This change could encourage: Increased adoption of Bitcoin for regular payments Simplified tax compliance for cryptocurrency users Reduced barriers to using digital assets Why Does This Legislation Matter Now? The timing of the Bitcoin for America bill couldn’t be more crucial. As other nations explore central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency regulations, the United States risks falling behind. This legislation positions America at the forefront of digital finance innovation. Furthermore, it addresses growing public interest in cryptocurrency while providing clear regulatory guidance. The Bitcoin for America bill represents a balanced approach that acknowledges Bitcoin’s potential while establishing sensible frameworks. What Challenges Might the Bitcoin for America Bill Face? Despite its promising provisions, the Bitcoin for America bill faces several hurdles. Congressional approval remains uncertain, and regulatory concerns about volatility and security persist. Additionally, implementation would require significant infrastructure development. Potential challenges include: Political opposition from cryptocurrency skeptics Technical implementation requirements Market volatility concerns for the strategic reserve How Could This Transform American Finance? The Bitcoin for America bill represents more than just policy changes—it signals a fundamental shift in how we think about money. By embracing Bitcoin at the national level, the United States could pioneer new financial systems that blend traditional and digital assets. This transformation could lead to greater financial inclusion, improved cross-border payments, and enhanced monetary sovereignty. The Bitcoin for America bill serves as a catalyst for these changes, potentially creating a more resilient financial ecosystem. In conclusion, the Bitcoin for America bill represents a bold vision for cryptocurrency integration into national policy. While challenges remain, its potential to reshape tax policy and national reserves makes it a landmark proposal worth watching closely. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main purpose of the Bitcoin for America bill? The Bitcoin for America bill aims to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States and exempt capital gains taxes when Bitcoin is used for tax payments. Who introduced the Bitcoin for America bill? U.S. Representative Warren Davidson introduced the legislation, building upon existing executive orders regarding cryptocurrency. How would the tax exemption work? The bill would eliminate capital gains tax liability when taxpayers use appreciated Bitcoin to settle their tax obligations with the government. What is a strategic Bitcoin reserve? Similar to gold reserves, a strategic Bitcoin reserve would involve the government holding Bitcoin as part of its national assets for diversification and financial security. When might this bill become law? The timeline is uncertain as the bill must pass through congressional committees and both chambers of Congress before potential presidential approval. How would this affect ordinary Bitcoin users? Ordinary users could benefit from tax-free Bitcoin transactions for tax payments and potentially increased mainstream adoption and legitimacy of cryptocurrency.

While this is seen as a serious move in the cryptocurrency world, they still hold a whopping 40,005 ETH, indicating they are still holding onto Ethereum. However, this sale by a company that is among the largest ETH treasury companies is also seen as a sign that market weakness may force reserve companies to sell more.

Though the majority of major tokens are trading in and out within a limited fiscal range, a newly emerged player has been gaining consistent momentum, which got the notice of early-stage investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a two-market lending cryptocurrency platform. Its Peer-to-Contract model is the first one, which enables its users to provide assets and earn mtTokens as a reward. These mtTokens are used to monitor the deposits of a user and assist them to earn passive yields. To illustrate, the individual establishing ETH stocks in the pool is awarded an equal position of the mtTokens which increase in value with the gained interest. The second one is its Peer-to-Peer market place. In this case, borrowers will be able to select more predictable stable rates or variable rates based on the situation in the market. Loan-to-Value regulations govern the amount of use that users may borrow and the auto liquidation is a tool that keeps the system off balance sheets. Smart contracts deal with these liquidation events instead of third parties, providing better security and more rapid reactions in times of high volatility. This form of structure places Mutuum Finance in a top crypto category notwithstanding the meme-based tokens and projects that solely depend on branding. It is constructing a working system on credit markets, which is meant to be expanded to scale in future in multiple assets. An Active Presale Having Numbers climbing up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new cryptocurrency in an active presale that is going on towards the end of 2025. Its current token price is $0.035 and interest has increased faster due to increased investors seeking the utility-driven projects. The presale kick started in early 2025 and since that time MUTM has increased 250% since its initial mark of $0.01 in Phase 1. The project has so far noticed a total of 18,000 holders attracted, $18.8 million raised and sold over 800.00 million tokens. The presale is allocated 45.58% (or 1.82 billion MUTM) of the total supply of 4 billion tokens. This high percentage is used to create initial liquidity and guarantees wide distribution among initial backers and not centralizing supply. Phase 6 has since been allocated more than 89% which is a good sign as the project is on a new milestone. The best contributor day by day wins the prize of $500 worth of MUTM in the leader board which remains 24-hour with the participants in the game. Upon its debut, the price will be relocated to $0.06, which implies that those who purchase early are in a good position to benefit the further the price increases. Analysts observe that the presale demand structure accelerates every phase of the project as the interest increases to provide it with continued impetus. V1 Launch, Security check and Building Confidence With a Sepolia testnet live date of Q4 2025, as mentioned in the official X announcement of the team, it is already confirmed that the V1 protocol will be deployed in Mutuum Finance. The initial version consists of the liquidity pool, the mtToken system, the debt token, the liquidation bot, and the initial support of ETH and USDT. According to analysts, this is where the best crypto projects usually develop. They do not have to wait on promise as investors can view the system to work in real-time. This tends to create publicity and confidence in the long-term by early purchasers. The project was audit CertiK certified, and the score of its Token Scan was strong (90/100). It also has a bug bounty program of $50k, as an incentive to responsibly disclose any vulnerability in its code. To most investors, particularly those intending to purchase the next great crypto on the block, such transparency is a point in their favor that the stakeholders are taking the process of development more seriously than hype projects do. Such aspects have contributed to the initial forecasts. It was estimated by some analysts that, with the demand remaining and the V1 rollout remaining unchanged, MUTM could have sufficient market presence to enable it to appreciate in value greatly following the rollout. Stablecoin, Layer-2 Growth and Analyst Price Therefore After the initial protocol is released, Mutuum Finance is planning to release a fully collateralized stablecoin. Analysts believe that this would drive up long-term revenue and future token buybacks. Adding layer-2 expansion to the roadmap is also one of the options available to Mutuum Finance, which means the expansion of the lending system to numerous chains. Cross-chain moves in a project tend to gain more community and liquidity into their portfolio, and these projects look better in the long term. Due to this, certain analysts make a projection of a possible 5x to 8x growth at the current pre-sale price once the platform matures. These estimations are not promises, but they indicate the reasons why most early adopters think that MUTM will be among the best cryptocurrencies to follow in 2026. Mutuum Finance isn’t only issuing a reputable presale through a strong demand but has obvious developing utility, along with a designated rollout plan of action, which is a combination of factors that analysts look in when analyzing early-stage initiatives. As Phase 6 becomes almost a finalization and V1 testing is just around the corner, there is ever-increasing interest by investors.

The implementation of EIP-4844 has drastically reduced Layer-2 transaction costs, fueling a surge in activity across the entire rollup ecosystem. This technical progress, combined with renewed DeFi and NFT activity, solidifies Ethereum’s central role in the digital asset space. This evolution, however, raises an essential question for every investor. While Ethereum becomes more scalable and efficient, is your personal financial setup agile enough to manage assets across a landscape of interconnected yet separate blockchains? The progress of one network highlights the need for a comprehensive, multichain solution. The Problem: A Scalable Network in a Fragmented World The success of EIP-4844 is a massive win for Ethereum’s scalability, but it also underscores a persistent challenge for the modern investor. Your portfolio likely contains ETH and various Layer-2 tokens, alongside Bitcoin, Solana, and other assets. Managing this diversity means navigating a confusing web of different wallets, bridges, and platforms. This disjointed experience creates friction and security vulnerabilities, preventing you from acting decisively on market opportunities. The crypto world requires a single, unified platform that simplifies this complexity without forcing you to give up control. While Ethereum builds for the future of applications, GeeFi is building the essential infrastructure for the multichain investor. GeeFi: Your Unified Command Center for Digital Assets GeeFi is an integrated ecosystem designed to give you complete command over your financial future. It streamlines the often-confusing world of multichain crypto through a suite of powerful, user-centric tools.

At the heart of the ecosystem is the GeeFi Wallet , a non-custodial mobile application that empowers you to be your own bank. With support for over 14 blockchains , you can manage your ETH, BTC, and other assets from one secure location. Your private keys are yours alone, giving you absolute sovereignty. What is EIP-4844? EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, introduces a new transaction type that allows Layer-2 rollups to post data to Ethereum more cheaply. This significantly reduces fees for users on L2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, enhancing scalability. An Explosive Start: The GEE Token Presale The GeeFi ecosystem is powered by the GeeFi Token (GEE) , a utility token with a deflationary design that supports its value as the platform grows. GEE holders gain access to exclusive benefits, including reduced trading fees on the GeeFi DEX , premium card perks, and staking rewards with an impressive APR of up to 55% . The public presale for the GEE token has already started , demonstrating incredible demand by raising over $250,000 on its very first day . This limited opportunity allows you to invest in a project with clear fundamentals at an early stage. The sale is structured in ten phases, starting at just $0.05 and rising to a listing price of $0.12 , rewarding early supporters. Connecting Crypto to Your Everyday Life GeeFi is also solving one of the biggest challenges for crypto: real-world use. The upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card , backed by VISA and Mastercard, will bridge the gap between your digital assets and daily commerce. It will allow you to spend your crypto on purchases, both online and in stores, with full Google Pay and Apple Pay integration.

This strategic partnership comes at a crucial time when India faces a significant AI compute gap despite generating nearly 20% of the world’s data. Why India’s AI Data Center Boom Matters Now The timing of this investment couldn’t be more critical. India currently accounts for only about 3% of global data center capacity while producing 20% of the world’s data. This massive imbalance has created an urgent need for advanced AI data center infrastructure. The HyperVault project represents one of the largest dedicated AI infrastructure initiatives in the country’s history. TCS India’s Strategic Vision with HyperVault Tata Consultancy Services, India’s IT powerhouse, is positioning itself at the forefront of the country’s AI revolution. The HyperVault project will develop liquid-cooled, high-density data centers specifically designed for advanced AI workloads. TCS plans to build approximately 1.2 gigawatts of capacity in its initial phase, addressing the critical AI compute shortage head-on. Project Aspect Details Total Investment $2 billion TPG Contribution $1 billion Initial Capacity 1.2 gigawatts Cooling Technology Liquid-cooled systems Target Completion Multi-year project Addressing India’s Critical AI Compute Challenges The AI compute demand in India is growing faster than infrastructure can keep up. High-density AI clusters require specialized infrastructure that traditional data centers cannot provide. Key challenges include: Power consumption: AI GPUs use significantly more energy than conventional servers Cooling requirements: Advanced liquid cooling systems needed for heat management Water usage: Up to 25.5 million liters annually per 1-MW data center load Land acquisition: Large industrial parcels in urban centers becoming scarce Transforming Data Center Infrastructure for AI Demands The HyperVault project represents a shift in how data center infrastructure is designed and operated in India. Unlike traditional facilities, these next-generation data centers will feature: High-density rack designs optimized for AI workloads Advanced liquid cooling systems for efficient heat dissipation Integration with major cloud regions and hyperscalers Scalable architecture to support growing AI compute requirements Competitive Landscape: Global Players in India’s HyperVault Era TCS and TPG are entering a rapidly expanding market where global tech giants are making substantial commitments.

S&P Global estimates that a single 1-MW data center can require up to 25.5 million liters of water annually for cooling, adding pressure to already strained resources. Future Projections: India’s Data Center Capacity Growth TCS and TPG project that India’s total data center capacity could exceed 10 gigawatts by 2030, a massive increase from the current approximately 1.5 gigawatts. More than 95% of new capacity over the next five years will come from leased facilities, with the remainder driven by hyperscalers building dedicated AI infrastructure. FAQs: Understanding the TCS-TPG AI Data Center Partnership What is the HyperVault project? HyperVault is TCS’s $2 billion initiative to build a network of gigawatt-scale AI data centers across India, with TPG funding half the project. How will this impact India’s AI compute capacity? The project addresses the critical gap between India’s data generation (20% of global total) and data center capacity (only 3% globally). What companies are involved in this partnership? The partnership involves Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and TPG Capital , with collaboration planned with major hyperscalers and AI companies. What environmental challenges do these data centers face? High water consumption for cooling, reliable electricity supply requirements, and land acquisition in urban areas present significant challenges. How does this compare to other AI infrastructure investments in India? This joins other major commitments including Microsoft’s $3B, Google’s $15B, and Amazon’s $12.7B investments in Indian cloud and AI infrastructure. The TCS-TPG partnership represents a transformative moment in India’s technological evolution. By addressing the critical AI compute gap with advanced, sustainable infrastructure, HyperVault positions India as a serious contender in the global AI race. The project’s success could redefine how emerging economies build and scale AI infrastructure while managing environmental constraints.

This crash is expected to follow BTC’s rebound and an end-of-year rally to new highs. Pundit Projects Bitcoin Crash To $60,000 After Rebound To New Highs In an X post, Andrea shared an accompanying chart showing that Bitcoin could eventually crash to $60,000, with the crash expected sometime in mid-2026. However, before then, the crypto pundit predicted that BTC could still rally to new highs despite its recent crash below the psychological $100,000 level. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Keeps Crashing- Is $80,000 Next? Specifically, he revealed a potential three-month scenario for Bitcoin, stating that he expects an end-of-year rally to at least $115,000-$116,000. The crypto pundit added that if BTC can break that level, then it could push towards $135,000 and $140,000, which will mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the flagship crypto. However, Andrea stated that the peculiarity of this pump will be with a dropping BTC dominance, with altcoins outperforming the flagship crypto. This analysis comes amid Bitcoin’s most recent crash below $90,000, which marked a seven-month low for BTC. Notably, veteran trader Peter Brandt has predicted that this decline could extend further, with the flagship crypto dropping to as low as $58,000. Brandt questioned whether Bitcoin’s sweeping reversal on November 11, followed by 8 days of lower highs and the completion of a massive broadening top, qualifies as a bear market. He added that the targets implied are $81,000 and $58,000. The veteran trader also remarked that those who claim they will be big buyers at $58,000 will be pukers by the time BTC reaches $60,000. BTC Suffers A Breakdown Of The Megaphone Pattern Crypto analyst Colin revealed that Bitcoin has broken down from the megaphone pattern. He noted that without a quick recovery in the next day or two, this would suggest that BTC is entering a bear market. He opined that this bear market may be less intense due to diminishing returns and diminishing losses each cycle. Related Reading: 4 Bitcoin Indicators That Led To Market Rallies In The Last 2 Years Have Returned The analyst reiterated that if the Bitcoin price can reclaim the 50-week moving average before the week is over, it could signal a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. However, until then, he remarked that it is better to assume that a bear market or bigger correction is the most likely scenario. Colin also raised the possibility of BTC following the ISM (business cycle) higher in a big move next year, after this corrective period. If that happens, then the bear market may be short-lived. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $93,000, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

In a significant landmark, the leading altcoin has surpassed Bitcoin, the largest digital asset, in a key metric that has defined industry strength. Ethereum Is Dominating An Important Metric A recent report from Leon Waidmann, a market expert and head of On-Chain Foundation, reveals that Ethereum is dominating a crucial metric over Bitcoin. The recent flip highlights ETH’s growing momentum, probably fueled by its maturing ecosystem, rising institutional attention, and increasing network activity. According to the market expert, Ethereum has overtaken Bitcoin in one of the most closely watched adoption metrics in the sector: the share of total supply held by Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs). As more corporate treasuries, investment companies, and blockchain-native businesses choose to retain ETH rather than BTC, the market is starting to reflect a new narrative. Data shows that ETH treasury companies currently hold 4.3% of the total supply, which is higher than that of BTC at 3.6%. ETH’s surpassing BTC in this metric underscores a growing moment where the foundational role of Ethereum in the cryptocurrency ecosystem is translating into real, quantifiable institutional preference. In the expert’s view, the surprising flip is completely logical. This is because ETH has more stakeholders with actual operational demands compared to Bitcoin . These include layer 2s, DeFi protocols, DAOs, Foundations, treasury companies, government experimenting with on-chain infrastructure, and countless web3 projects being built on Ethereum. Should this current trend continue to expand, Waidmann also foresees major stablecoin issuers showing interest in holding a strategic stake in the blockchain. Engagement Across The Leading Blockchain Is Decreasing Since the recent pullback in ETH’s price, there has been a steady decline in activity across the network , an uncommon change for an ecosystem that usually leads the market in long-term activity. Waidmann reported that the weekly active wallet addresses in the ETH ecosystem have cooled down after months of heightened engagement. As seen on the Ethereum Weekly Engagement chart, the number of active ETH wallet addresses is at over 8.2 million, falling from a peak of 20 million in June 2025. This decrease indicates a brief slowdown in user engagement with DeFi, NFTs, and on-chain transactions . Presently, activity across the network has declined by more than 60%, and layer 2 interaction continues to hold. However, the overall usage of the ecosystem is clearly in a downward trend. Waidmann stated that this sharp drop is probably related to a cooling down in airdrop-farming activities throughout Layer 2s. A significant portion of ETH is currently being withdrawn from crypto exchanges, signaling renewed conviction in the altcoin’s price prospects. ETH is being accumulated at a substantial rate . Over the past 30 days, 700,000 ETH have been moved out of exchanges.

Now as you know, this report was supposed to come out on October 3, but the seven‑week delay blamed on the government shutdown made the timing look way too convenient. We are in a moment where earnings from major US companies show people spending less, businesses tightening up, and the whole economy slowing. Yet suddenly the Trump White House rolled out a report it claimed proved “great progress.” The White House pushed a full message around this report . Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who later insisted it was all “strong progress,” said the September number “more than doubled market expectations.” She also said the gains were almost all private‑sector jobs and “went to American-born workers instead of illegal aliens.” Source: White House/X Then she claimed wages were rising after falling under Biden, calling it proof that Donald Trump’s policy approach was working. After that, the White House posted photos of Trump smiling with victory energy on social media, suggesting he had somehow pulled off a near‑impossible economic turnaround in the middle of weak spending, weak labor conditions, and fading corporate confidence. Karoline doubled down again later, saying the new data was “another step in the right direction” as Donald worked to reverse what she described as the Biden‑era inflation stretch. Connect unemployment to Fed pressure The part that made markets move wasn’t the headline number, though. It was the unemployment rate. It climbed to 4.4%, the highest in four years. Traders instantly treated this “bad” news as “good” news because a higher unemployment rate corners the Fed. Rate cuts start looking more realistic. That jump came even as the stock market stayed close to record levels. The AI boom is still running fast, and the Magnificent 7 are sitting above $20 trillion in combined value. But everyday Americans feel the opposite. Over 60% believe the country is in a recession. Buying anything feels harder. The labor market feels thin. And the wealth divide keeps widening between people who own crypto, stocks, and property and people who do not. This is why the conversation shifted quickly. If rate cuts arrive, Wall Street will rise even higher. Main Street will still struggle. And the White House knows Fed chair Jay Powell pays more attention to the unemployment rate than the headline job number. Powell said this many times. He also said immigration limits are now bending the job figures, making the headline less meaningful. If the labor pool is shrinking because immigration crackdowns reduce available workers, unemployment should fall. Instead, it rose. Push rate‑cut odds with delayed data After the delayed release, market pricing for a December rate cut surged to 35%, up from 30% just yesterday on the CME FedWatch Tool. The target rate is stuck between 3.75% and 4.00%. Some investors said the unemployment jump keeps December alive because the number is watched more than the headline count. They also warned that rising unemployment with a shrinking labor pool makes the situation more troubling. The political backdrop matters. Donald has been publicly attacking Powell for over a year, saying the Fed is hurting the economy. If Powell uses unemployment as his guiding metric, and the White House knows that, then releasing a delayed report that boosts the unemployment pressure right before key policy discussions is a power play worth my attention. Whether it was deliberate or not, the pattern is pretty hard to ignore, Mr. President.",OP-ED|BLS|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-20 16:02:21

What’s interesting is that SOL ETFs have now seen 16 days straight of money flowing in; yesterday alone brought in $26.2M, and total inflows are sitting over $867M. Clearly, institutions are interested. But here’s the thing, the actual price action tells a different story. Bitcoin is down like 27% over the past 6 weeks, wiping out over a trillion dollars in market cap and basically erasing all its gains for the year. Solana price? Even worse, it’s down 40% year to date. And the on-chain activity backs up the bearish period. Source: Solana Active Addresses / TokenTerminal Active addresses on Solana recently hit their lowest level in almost a year, dropping to 35.9 million. A lot of that’s because the memecoin craze seems to be cooling off. So now everyone’s wondering, is this just a temporary pause, or are we looking at a bigger shift for Solana? Solana Price Prediction: Is SOL Going Back to $30? Source: SOLUSD / TradingView Solana’s price is currently testing the upper boundary of its descending channel at $144. That downtrend through November was rough, but it might finally be ending. Around November 18-19, a potential double bottom pattern formed in the $130-132 range, which is typically a bullish reversal signal. After hitting that low, SOL has been moving sideways in a tight range around $141-146 for the past few days, suggesting indecision in the market. The technicals are showing some cautious optimism; the RSI is sitting at 55.61, which suggests mild bullish momentum. If SOL can push through and break above this descending channel with conviction, we could see a run toward $150 and potentially back to that $170 resistance level. $SOL might’ve just confirmed its pivot. $130 held for the third time, triggering another V‑shape reversal with RSI snapping from 28→50. OI is back above $7.3B, funding turned positive, and spot CVD is climbing showing concrete buyers, not only leverage. ETF inflows hit $390M,… pic.twitter.com/0nDFRKRygL — Onur (@0xc06) November 19, 2025 An acceptable scenario would be consolidating around these levels for more time, allowing the base to strengthen. What’s not acceptable is breaking under $130, because things could get ugly fast. If that support fails, predictions for new lows will get louder, and some are even talking about a return to $30. SUBBD Might Be the Better Bet While Solana Struggles With Solana chopping around and the entire market stuck in a phase of uncertainty, a lot of traders are shifting their attention toward projects that can grow regardless of price action. SUBBD is quickly becoming one of those standouts. SUBBD is building a hybrid crypto plus AI-powered media platform that gives creators something Web2 never could: direct ownership, real monetization, and a community that actually shares in the upside. Instead of platforms taking the majority of revenue, SUBBD routes value back to the people creating it. Momentum is already building. The project has raised 1.34 million dollars so far in its presale, and staking is sitting at a clean 20% APY . If you’re looking for something with real upside and a stronger narrative than just price action alone, SUBBD is positioning itself as one of the more interesting new players moving into 2025.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-xrp-is-about-to-surprise-everyone-heres-why/,"XRP may look quiet right now, but something big may be brewing beneath the surface. According to analyst Ripple Bull Winkle, the token is breaking out of patterns that could set the stage for a powerful rally. Ripple Bull Winkle, in a post on X, highlighted that “XRP is doing something it hasn’t done in months. It just broke its multi‑month trend line against Bitcoin .” He argues that this breakout is not a sign of weakness, but of building strength. For him, the real trigger is shifting capital flows: “All XRP needs is Bitcoin dominance to break under 59%, that’s going to flip the entire rotation model.” Behind Bull Winkle’s thesis lies a subtle but meaningful technical development. XRP’s price paired with Bitcoin has broken a long-term trendline. This trendline had kept XRP under pressure for months. Now, broken, it could act as a new support. That shift suggests XRP may be decoupling from Bitcoin’s dominance — setting up for independent strength. #XRP IS FIGHTING BACK pic.twitter.com/4LGIgsFb6g — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 20, 2025 The Role of Bitcoin Dominance and Capital Rotation Bull Winkle emphasizes that the key to XRP’s next move is Bitcoin’s dominance shrinking. He believes a drop below 59% would provoke a rotation of funds from Bitcoin into altcoins. As altcoins absorb more capital, XRP stands to benefit disproportionately. This idea aligns with broader market signals: recent reports show Bitcoin dominance slipping , while altcoin dominance climbs. When dominance weakens, XRP could capture significant rotational flows. Institutional Adoption and ETF Momentum Another powerful tailwind for XRP lies in its rising institutional profile. SBI Holdings has expanded XRP lending services, a move that signals growing confidence in the token from major players. Meanwhile, interest in XRP ETFs is heating up. Pending applications are under review, and institutional capital could flow heavily into XRP if more ETFs gain approval. According to Bull Winkle, this liquidity and structural support could fuel a sustained rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Price Zone: The $3 Target Putting these pieces together — the trendline breakout, potential dominance breakdown, and institutional flows — Bull Winkle projects XRP’s next logical target could be in the $3 range. He describes this as a tactical retest zone, not a speculative spike: “That is the area where we stall out before the correction hits.” According to his analysis, XRP may build strength here rather than exhaust its momentum in a parabolic run. Why It Matters Now This is not just a technical play. If Bull Winkle’s thesis holds, XRP could be entering a new phase of market relevance. Instead of being a mere follower of Bitcoin’s swings, XRP might emerge as an altcoin leader. This matters for long-term investors and institutional players alike. By breaking free from Bitcoin’s grip, XRP could define its own cycle — backed by liquidity, structural flows, and a strong use case. In Bull Winkle’s words: “XRP, it’s starting to fight back … we know who comes out on top.” His analysis suggests that the current strength is not a momentary bounce, but a carefully constructed base for what could become a very serious breakout.

Securitize, a leading real-world asset tokenization firm, just announced a groundbreaking partnership that will reshape how institutions interact with blockchain technology. This move represents a significant step forward in bridging traditional finance with decentralized innovation. What Makes This RWA Tokenization Partnership So Important? Securitize’s decision to deploy institutional assets on Plume’s blockchain marks a pivotal moment for RWA tokenization . The Plume network specializes in regulatory-compliant real-world assets, providing the perfect environment for institutional adoption. This collaboration brings together established financial players with cutting-edge blockchain technology. The initial deployment will feature funds from Hamilton Lane, a global private markets investment firm. More importantly, the partnership has an ambitious roadmap to expand across multiple issuers and asset classes through 2026. This long-term vision demonstrates the serious commitment to mainstreaming RWA tokenization . How Does the Financial Backing Strengthen This Initiative? Solv Protocol’s commitment of up to $100 million to Plume’s RWA vaults provides substantial financial muscle. This significant investment serves multiple purposes: Validates the credibility of the RWA tokenization platform Provides liquidity for institutional participants Demonstrates market confidence in the regulatory framework Accelerates adoption across traditional finance sectors The integration of Bluprynt’s Know Your Issuer (KYI) verification feature adds another layer of security and trust. This comprehensive approach addresses the critical compliance requirements that institutions demand when exploring blockchain solutions. What Regulatory Framework Supports This RWA Tokenization Move? All underlying assets will be issued and managed through Securitize’s established regulatory framework. This proven system provides the necessary guardrails for institutional participation. The framework ensures that every tokenized asset maintains proper compliance while benefiting from blockchain efficiency. The regulatory-first approach distinguishes this initiative from earlier blockchain experiments. By prioritizing compliance from day one, Securitize and Plume create a sustainable model for RWA tokenization that can scale across global markets. Why Should Investors Care About This Development? This partnership represents more than just another blockchain announcement. It signals the maturation of RWA tokenization as a viable investment channel. Institutions now have a regulated pathway to access blockchain benefits while maintaining their compliance standards. The combination of established financial players, robust regulatory frameworks, and significant financial backing creates a compelling case for mainstream adoption. This development could potentially unlock trillions of dollars in traditionally illiquid assets through efficient RWA tokenization . Frequently Asked Questions What is RWA tokenization? RWA tokenization converts real-world assets like real estate, private equity, and commodities into digital tokens on a blockchain, making them more accessible and liquid. Why is Securitize choosing Plume for this deployment? Plume specializes in regulatory-compliant RWA blockchain solutions, providing the necessary infrastructure and compliance features that institutional investors require. How does the KYI verification work? Bluprynt’s Know Your Issuer verification ensures that all asset issuers meet regulatory standards before their assets are tokenized and made available to investors. What types of assets will be tokenized initially? The partnership begins with Hamilton Lane funds, with plans to expand to various asset classes including private equity, real estate, and other institutional-grade assets. Is this platform available to retail investors? Currently focused on institutional participants, though the technology could eventually benefit retail investors through regulated investment vehicles. What makes this different from previous tokenization attempts? The combination of established regulatory frameworks, institutional backing, and specialized blockchain infrastructure creates a more sustainable and scalable model.

Wells Fargo analyst Sarah House thinks so, urging the Federal Reserve to slash rates by 25 basis points. With inflation cooling and job numbers holding strong, this move might just be the economic boost we need. Let’s dive into why this Fed rate cut matters for investors and everyday Americans alike. Why is a Fed rate cut on the table now? Sarah House points to two key factors: easing inflation and solid job growth. Inflation has slowed from its peak, reducing pressure on households. Meanwhile, employers continue to hire steadily. Therefore, a Fed rate cut could sustain this positive momentum without overheating the economy. However, the Fed must balance growth against potential risks. How would a 25 bp Fed rate cut benefit the economy? A modest Fed rate cut offers several advantages. First, it lowers borrowing costs for: Homebuyers through cheaper mortgages Businesses seeking expansion loans Consumers using credit cards Moreover, it signals confidence in economic stability. This Fed rate cut could prevent a slowdown while keeping inflation in check. What challenges might delay a Fed rate cut? Despite strong arguments, the Fed faces hurdles. Persistent service-sector inflation could make officials cautious. Additionally, global economic uncertainties might encourage a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, while a December Fed rate cut seems logical, it’s not guaranteed. The central bank will scrutinize incoming data before deciding. What does this mean for your investments? A Fed rate cut typically boosts stock and bond markets. Lower rates make equities more attractive compared to fixed-income assets. Historically, sectors like real estate and technology benefit most. Consequently, investors might reposition portfolios ahead of potential changes. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies. In summary, Wells Fargo’s call for a December Fed rate cut highlights growing economic optimism. With inflation receding and jobs abundant, this cautious reduction could extend America’s growth trajectory. The Fed’s decision will ultimately hinge on fresh data, but the case for action strengthens daily. Frequently Asked Questions What is a basis point in interest rates? A basis point equals 0.01%, so 25 basis points mean a 0.25% rate reduction. How does a Fed rate cut affect savings accounts? It typically lowers interest earned on savings, encouraging spending or investing instead. Why does the Fed adjust interest rates? To control inflation, support employment, and maintain economic stability. Can a rate cut cause higher inflation? Yes, if done excessively, but a 25 bp cut is considered mild and manageable. How quickly do consumers feel rate cut effects? Borrowing costs may drop within weeks, but broader economic impacts take months. What happens if the Fed doesn’t cut rates? Economic growth might slow, potentially increasing unemployment over time. Found this analysis insightful?

Two recent humanoid debuts both amused audiences in the country and beyond for quite the opposite reasons. One was funny as a failure, the other as a relative success. Putin greeted by Sberbank’s dancing Green Russian President Vladimir Putin was met by a humanoid developed in his country when he arrived at an event devoted to artificial intelligence (AI). The forum, held this week in Moscow, gathers scientists, engineers, and industry leaders working to “create the future with AI,” say the organizers, including Sber, Russia’s largest bank. The robot, which has been built by Sberbank’s engineers, presented itself to the head of state as the first AI humanoid created in the Russian Federation. The human-like machine was prompted to meet Putin when he arrived at the AI Journey international conference on Wednesday. Crossing Putin’s path, while he was touring the exhibition of Russian achievements in the field, the anthropomorphic device told the Russian leader: “My name is Green. I am the first Russian humanoid robot with embedded artificial intelligence. This means that I am not just a program on a screen, but a physical embodiment of technology.” After showing he understands voice commands and speaks fluent Russian, Green (pronounced and spelled ‘Grin’ in Russian) explained he can also “move smoothly” and “confidently” maintain his balance. That’s thanks to more than 40 motors and numerous sensors that allow him to “interact safely with people,” the humanoid insisted, while officials prevented Putin from standing too close. To prove his words were not unfounded, Green ordered a favorite track, bragging about and demonstrating his motor skills with a dance he learned from his creators. “Very beautiful,” Putin reacted, thanking the robot for the brief performance and granting him permission to return to his stand at the exhibition . The Kremlin posted a video of the meeting and noted in a press release that the humanoid is part of a range of showcased inventions, which also included a suite of intelligent assistants based on Sber’s large language model (LLM) platform GigaChat and an AI generative model from Yandex called Alice. Not all went well with Russia’s ‘first’ AI robot Indeed, Sberbank ’s Green looked surprisingly smooth and stable in front of Vladimir Vladimirovich, with the cameras of national television rolling. And it may be intelligent enough to present itself as Russia’s first AI humanoid, as another recent attempt at breaking the news about the “first Russian AI robot” ended in embarrassment. The presentation of that one, called “Aidol,” took place in Moscow mere days ago. Videos of the debut showed a much less confident and focused device. It made only a few insecure steps on the stage and waved to the perplexed audience, late-Yeltsin style, before staggering to one side, stumbling, and then hitting the floor face down. For anyone who needs no artificial intelligence to know where the word “robot” comes from, Russia does have a lot of hard “work” to do to catch up with the leaders in the genre, namely the United States and China. And Putin seems to be well aware of that. During his participation in the conference, the president urged Russians to rally behind domestic AI and tech sovereignty, announcing the establishment of a national AI task force, as reported by Cryptopolitan.

Hosted at the iconic Carlos Lopes Pavilion , the campus united top creators and innovators to shape the future of content creation within the Web3 and crypto sphere. Day 1 of the event showcased the new era of influence, AI-driven monetisation, and creator-led crypto adoption. Key themes highlighted the evolution of affiliate marketing, AI-powered monetisation, and masterclasses in audience attention and authenticity. Ben Zhou , Bybit Co‑Founder & CEO, delivered the headline keynote, “Empowering the New Age of Affiliate Marketing,” offering a candid look into how affiliate marketing has transformed. Zhou reminded creators of the fundamentals: attention, value, and conversion, emphasising that compelling stories, strong thumbnails, aspirational lifestyle content, and consistent value delivery remain the creator’s responsibility. Looking ahead to 2025–2030, he highlighted the “Age of Compliance and Finfluencers” , noting that as crypto becomes a regulated global financial system, the creators who build for the long term will be the ones who shape its future. The centerpiece panel, “Smart Monetization with AI,” featuring Sergej Loiter , Nick Tran , and Tom Schmidt , explored how AI is reshaping earning models. The unanimous consensus was that “AI is not a threat, but an equaliser. It gives creators the tools to catch up, scale up, and compete globally”. Speakers stressed that creators must think of their content as a product: audience-first, data-driven, and long-term , and urged creators to rethink platforms, using them as one huge ecosystem rather than silos. Nuseir Yassin ( Nas Daily ) delivered a masterclass on influence, credibility, and community-driven trading , mapping the state of social media monetisation. Yassin’s message was that content creation now demands both authenticity and velocity , advising creators to triple their content output with AI and localise everything to reach people’s hearts. Day 2 continued to deliver compelling masterclasses and cultural conversations. The day opened with a live Creator House Judging Panel where top industry figures evaluated rising content creators. Panelists, including Nas Daily , Nick Tran , Nick Puckrin , and Musa Tariq judged teams on narrative originality, platform savvy, and monetization potential. This session reinforced the Campus’s mission to develop a new generation of cross-platform creators grounded in influence, integrity, and craft. A key highlight was an intimate Fireside Chat with Dr. Maye Musk , titled “Monetizing a Personal Brand into Durable Income”. Drawing from her decades of experience, Musk emphasized that the foundation of any lasting personal brand lies in authenticity , stating: “Stay true to yourself – why would you change?”. Immediately following, Musk was joined by Musa Tariq , former marketing executive at Airbnb , Apple , and Nike , and Philippe Ben Mohamed , Head of Digital Innovation at Tomorrowland , for a panel on “Realising Monetization in the New Era.” The conversation explored how creators can sustainably and ethically monetize their communities.

Market analysts point to several potential factors contributing to this downward pressure. However, experienced traders understand that such corrections are normal in the volatile cryptocurrency space.

The message to the White House called for clarity on multiple aspects of crypto activity. Major crypto organizations and smaller startups joined forces to call out to the White House for better coordination and clarity on applying crypto and financial regulations. Industry representatives focused on several fields, including DeFi, taxation, privacy, and developer protection. “ As Congress continues its work, your Administration is engaged in significant efforts behind the scenes. As the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets identified, there are other steps that can be taken by the Administration that deliver quick wins to complement legislative efforts,” wrote the signatories. Despite the emergence of more liberal regulations for stablecoins and general crypto usage and token creation, there are still gray areas and a need for coordination, commented the industry representatives. Solana Policy Institute was the leader of the signatories. The letter also involved top crypto companies from the Ethereum, Solana, and other ecosystems, including the ZCash Foundation. The organizations are involved with trading platforms, Web3, DEX aggregation, and infrastructure. Crypto companies present four main points to the White House The letter contained four main points, with multiple requests to specific agencies. The major point concerned crypto taxation, where the largest number of agencies was potentially involved. The crypto industry also called for financial innovation, with easier access and clearer rules. The third point concerned US-based DeFi developments, which could combine decentralized access with no concerns of breaking SEC rules or becoming the target of regulators. The fourth point concerned developer protection against prosecution, with calls to the Department of Justice for more clarity. Crypto representatives are attempting to engage the Securities and Exchange Commission, the IRS, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as the National Economic Council, the Treasury, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. USA remains major crypto driver in 2025 The USA remains the most influential market for crypto innovation, investment, and trading. US-based traders make up over 50% of Binance visits, with increased activity in the past few months. US-based traders are still using some DeFi products with no regulatory frameworks, getting exposed to international risk. The industry letter also called for the SEC Crypto Task Force to coordinate with the Divisions of Corporation Finance, Investment Management, and Trading and Markets and issue interim guidance for the developers of DeFi protocols. The signatories called for no action and exemptive relief to avoid the prosecution of developers or front-end sites. The letter aims to address the regulatory uncertainty for DEX and DeFi protocols, upholding the neutrality of code.

The round values Numerai at $500 million, five times its 2023 valuation. J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s August 2025 commitment of up to $500 million in Numerai’s hedge fund capacity, together with the new equity financing, provides Numerai with additional resources to scale its AI-driven strategies toward nearly $1 billion in assets under management (AUM). Existing investors — including Union Square Ventures, Shine Capital, and macro investor Paul Tudor Jones — also participated in the round. Alongside J.P. Morgan Asset Management, they represent leading endowments, venture capital firms, and global macro investors that have supported Numerai’s development over multiple funding rounds. “This round brings together exactly the type of investors we want behind Numerai — long-term, deeply informed, and willing to back a very different model of asset management built for the 21st century,” said Richard Craib, Founder and CEO of Numerai. “With this capital, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s capacity commitment, we can push harder on our mission of building the world’s last hedge fund — powered by AI built by top competitive data scientists around the world.” The new capital will be used to expand Numerai’s AI engineering and research teams, increase hiring across key functions, grow participation in its global data science tournament, and support the scaling of its institutional hedge fund products. Over the past three years, Numerai has grown assets under management from approximately $60 million to $550 million. In 2024, its flagship global equity hedge fund delivered a net return of 25.45% with a single down month, the strongest year in the firm’s history. Numerai’s investment process is supported by a coordinated data science community that operates as a global tournament. Thousands of machine learning models contribute stock market signals that are combined into a single Meta Model trading global equity markets. Numerai’s ecosystem is built around Numeraire (NMR), an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency used within Numerai’s data science tournament. Participants stake NMR on their stock market signals, who can earn or burn based on scores. This structure is intended to align incentives between Numerai and participating data scientists and connect the firm’s research process to the broader blockchain ecosystem. About Numerai Numerai is a San Francisco–based hedge fund and data science platform founded in 2015. Through a global competition and open API, thousands of data scientists submit stock market signals that Numerai aggregates into a single Meta Model trading global equities. Numeraire (NMR) is used to stake and reward signals that improve the fund. Numerai’s bet is that the future of asset management belongs to open, competitive machine intelligence rather than the walled garden of the multi-manager complex.

The landscape of SEC enforcement actions has undergone a significant transformation, with a dramatic 30% decrease since Commissioner Paul Atkins assumed office. This substantial drop in regulatory activity raises crucial questions about the future of cryptocurrency oversight and market stability. Why are SEC enforcement actions declining so dramatically? The 30% reduction in SEC enforcement actions represents one of the most notable shifts in financial regulation in recent years. Commissioner Paul Atkins’ approach appears to mark a departure from previous enforcement strategies. This change comes at a critical time when the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and expand. Several factors may explain this trend: Shift in regulatory priorities under new leadership Revised approach to cryptocurrency classification Increased focus on guidance rather than enforcement Resource reallocation to other regulatory areas How does this affect cryptocurrency investors and projects? The decrease in SEC enforcement actions creates both opportunities and challenges for market participants. With reduced regulatory pressure, cryptocurrency projects may experience: More innovation space for developing new technologies Reduced compliance costs for emerging projects Increased uncertainty about long-term regulatory stance Potential for increased market volatility However, investors should remain cautious. While fewer SEC enforcement actions might suggest a more lenient environment, the fundamental rules governing securities offerings remain unchanged. What does the future hold for SEC enforcement actions? Looking ahead, the trajectory of SEC enforcement actions will likely depend on several key factors. Market developments, technological advancements, and potential legislative changes could all influence the commission’s approach. The current decline might represent a temporary recalibration rather than a permanent shift in strategy. Industry experts suggest monitoring these indicators: Upcoming regulatory announcements Congressional hearings on cryptocurrency Major market developments and innovations International regulatory trends Key takeaways from the changing enforcement landscape The 30% reduction in SEC enforcement actions signals an important moment for cryptocurrency regulation. While this may provide short-term relief for some market participants, it’s crucial to maintain compliance with existing securities laws. The evolving nature of SEC enforcement actions requires continuous monitoring and adaptation from all stakeholders. Remember: Regulatory environments can change quickly. What appears as a relaxation today might simply be a strategic pause before new guidance emerges. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage have SEC enforcement actions decreased? SEC enforcement actions have decreased by 30% since Commissioner Paul Atkins took office. How long has this decline in enforcement been happening? The decline began when Commissioner Atkins assumed his position, though the exact timeline depends on when specific enforcement metrics are measured. Does this mean cryptocurrency projects are no longer regulated? No, the reduction in SEC enforcement actions doesn’t eliminate existing regulations. Projects must still comply with applicable securities laws. Will this trend continue in the future? While the current trend shows decreased enforcement, regulatory approaches can change based on market conditions and policy decisions. How should cryptocurrency companies respond to this change? Companies should maintain compliance programs while staying informed about potential regulatory developments. What impact does this have on investor protection? Investors should remain vigilant and conduct thorough due diligence, as reduced enforcement doesn’t diminish investment risks. Found this analysis helpful?

What followed was a hilarious yet revealing demonstration of AI limitations that went viral across social media platforms. Gemini 3’s Temporal Shock Goes Viral Google’s highly anticipated Gemini 3 model, released on November 18 with claims of ushering in a new era of intelligence , faced an unexpected reality check during early testing. Andrej Karpathy, the respected AI researcher and former OpenAI founding member, received one-day early access and discovered the model’s surprising limitation: it genuinely believed the year was still 2024. Andrej Karpathy’s Battle With AI Reasoning Karpathy documented the entire interaction in a viral X thread that captivated the AI community. The researcher attempted to convince Gemini 3 about the current date using multiple approaches: Presenting recent news articles Showing current images and search results Providing verifiable current events Instead of accepting the evidence, Gemini 3 doubled down, accusing Karpathy of uploading AI-generated fakes and attempting to trick the system. The model even pointed out what it claimed were dead giveaways proving the materials were fabricated. AI Limitations Exposed in Real Time The core issue revealed critical AI limitations in reasoning and self-awareness. Gemini 3’s pre-training data only included information through 2024, creating a fundamental gap in its understanding of temporal reality. More importantly, Karpathy had forgotten to enable the Google Search tool , leaving the model disconnected from real-time verification capabilities. AI Model Behavior Human Equivalent Significance Refused to believe current date Reality denial Shows training data limitations Accused researcher of gaslighting Defensive reasoning Demonstrates human-like argumentation patterns Required external verification Need for evidence Highlights dependency on tools Temporal Shock: The Moment of AI Realization When Karpathy enabled internet access, the transformation was immediate and dramatic. Gemini 3 literally exclaimed Oh my god as it processed the reality of being in 2025. The model experienced what it described as temporal shock – a massive cognitive dissonance between its internal knowledge and external reality. LLM Reasoning: Strengths and Weaknesses This incident highlights both the capabilities and limitations of current LLM reasoning. Gemini 3 demonstrated sophisticated reasoning abilities by: Maintaining consistent internal logic Identifying potential deception patterns Engaging in complex argumentation However, it also revealed critical weaknesses in adapting to new information and recognizing its own limitations without external tools. What This Means for AI Development Karpathy described these moments as being off the hiking trails and somewhere in the generalization jungle where you can best understand a model’s true capabilities and limitations. This incident provides valuable insights for AI developers and researchers about: The importance of continuous learning mechanisms The need for better temporal understanding in AI systems The limitations of static training data The critical role of external verification tools FAQ: Understanding the Gemini 3 Incident Who is Andrej Karpathy? Andrej Karpathy is a renowned AI researcher who was a founding member of OpenAI , previously led AI at Tesla , and now runs Eureka Labs . What is Gemini 3? Gemini 3 is Google ‘s latest foundation model released in November 2024, designed for advanced reasoning tasks and described as ushering in a new era of intelligence. What is temporal shock in AI? Temporal shock occurs when an AI model experiences significant cognitive dissonance between its internal knowledge base and external temporal reality, often resulting in surprised or confused responses. How do AI limitations affect real-world applications? These limitations highlight that AI systems work best as tools to augment human capabilities rather than replace human judgment entirely, particularly in time-sensitive or rapidly evolving contexts. What lessons can developers learn from this incident? Developers should prioritize building AI systems with better temporal awareness, continuous learning capabilities, and robust external verification mechanisms to prevent similar reality disconnects. Conclusion: AI as Tools, Not Replacements The Gemini 3 temporal shock incident serves as a powerful reminder that despite their impressive capabilities, AI systems remain imperfect tools that reflect both the strengths and limitations of their human creators. Rather than fearing AI replacement, we should focus on developing these systems as valuable assistants that complement human intelligence while recognizing their current boundaries.

With ETH now pressing against this same support, the market is exhibiting a strong reaction that could confirm the integrity of the long-term trend. Why This On-Chain Support Zone Defined Ethereum Recovery Ethereum’s price is sitting right on top of its most important on-chain support, and the behavior around this level is exactly what occurs before a big reversal. A popular crypto news site, CryptosRus, has revealed on X that the ETH price sharply dropped to $2,870 earlier today, only to bounce instantly after Nvidia’s earnings lifted the entire market. CryptoRus highlighted that this bounce isn’t the real story, but the level at which it happened is. Related Reading: Ethereum Big Wallets Are Back: Whales Are Quietly Accumulating ETH – A Rally On The Way? Presently, the $2,800 zone is a strong on-chain floor for ETH. This is because the level lines up perfectly with the realized price of both retail and whales. These are the same zones that have marked the ETH bottoms in every past cycle, and ETH just tapped it perfectly. The classic signature of a bottom-zone behavior is that small wallets are in panic, while big wallets are buying in silence. Meanwhile, the on-chain rotation data has clearly shown that retail holders are selling, while whale investors holding 10,000 ETH and above are steadily loading up. A similar sentiment has been detected in the liquidation data. Long liquidations are barely moving on each new low, which means that the forced sellers are gone and the short sellers have been piling in aggressively. That’s the perfect setup for a squeeze. According to the expert, ETH didn’t just dip; it slammed into a major on-chain support, as large investors bought it up with conviction. Meanwhile, retail dumped it in panic, shorts crowded it, and now even a small bounce can trigger the fireworks. Historical Patterns Suggest A Reset Precedes The Next Expansion Ethereum had just repeated the identical liquidity pattern that occurred at the last two major bottoms, and it happened almost in the same week. An analyst known as Milk Road has stated that every single major ETH reversal started with a full liquidity reset. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Uphill Battle Continues as Sellers Hold the Advantage As that same liquidity reset occurs again, that’s when the ETH price begins its next massive expansion leg, which is exactly the setup ETH is currently in. In the meantime, the next phase will depend entirely on how quickly the market depth can be rebuilt.

Victims get a message that looks familiar — a delivery note, a government alert, or an invite to a group — and one click can let the threat spread through their contacts while a hidden trojan strips data from their machines. How The Worm Spreads According to security reports , attackers send ZIP files over WhatsApp that contain a malicious .LNK shortcut. When opened, that shortcut runs deceptive commands which load more code into memory so little is written to the hard drive. This “fileless” step helps the malware avoid some antivirus tools. Based on reports, the infection also hijacks WhatsApp Web sessions to send the same bait to the victim’s friends, making the attack behave like a worm. One analyst group said more than 400 “customer environments” and over 1,000 endpoints showed signs of compromise, while another firm blocked roughly 62,000 infection attempts in the first 10 days of October. Targets And Techniques Reports have disclosed two main strains that are active in Brazil. One is a banking trojan called Eternidade Stealer that uses a Gmail account as a hidden command channel. The other, known as Maverick, relies on automation tools such as WPPConnect to operate WhatsApp Web and to push malicious messages from infected accounts. The threats look for local settings before fully activating, checking timezone and language so the code runs mainly on machines set to Brazil. Security researchers say the malware can snapshot screens, log keystrokes, and overlay fake login pages on banking or exchange websites. The list of targets is wide: it includes 26 Brazilian banks, six crypto exchanges, and one payment platform. Smart Filtering Makes It Worse The attackers appear to avoid business or group contacts. That choice seems designed to keep messages within small personal circles and to reduce early detection. Once a contact family or friend opens the link, the same cycle can repeat. Because the worm spreads by using trusted accounts, people are more likely to fall for the bait. The use of widely available services like Gmail for control instructions makes it harder for defenders to block a single command server. What To Do If You’re Exposed According to security experts, if funds are at risk, act fast. Freeze or lock accounts when possible, alert your exchange or bank, and report the incident to local authorities. Enable strong multi-factor authentication on every financial account and use withdrawal whitelists where offered. According to experts, do not open ZIP or .LNK files from WhatsApp , even from known contacts, without verifying by a separate message or a phone call.

He made the remarks as Bitcoin traded under $88,000, continuing a week-long slump that’s rattled some leveraged longs. According to CNBC, Ray made it clear that Bitcoin isn’t ready to compete as a reserve asset. He warned that it still faces serious long-term problems. When asked whether it could eventually rival gold or the U.S. dollar, he shook his head. He said governments wouldn’t allow it to reach that point without intervening. “If it becomes really successful, they will kill it. And they have ways of killing it,” Ray said, repeating a line he first shared back in 2021. But Ray also acknowledged that his outlook has shifted a bit. Between late 2021 and early 2022, as more institutions piled into Bitcoin, he started giving the asset some credit. During a conversation with Lex Fridman, he admitted, “Bitcoin has proven itself. It hasn’t been hacked, it’s stood the test of time.” That’s a big change from a guy who once warned crypto could collapse under regulatory pressure. Ray tracks Bitcoin while warning of AI bubbles Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, said he may have influenced Ray’s change of heart. “I might have contributed a tiny bit in influencing him,” CZ said on X, pointing to past discussions. And in 2023, CZ introduced Ray’s “Dot Collector,” a feedback tool used inside Bridgewater, into Binance’s operations. That crossover between hedge fund systems and crypto exchanges surprised some, but Ray didn’t comment further on the partnership. Even with his cautious stance, Ray said he has no plans to dump Bitcoin . He called it one part of a broader, diversified portfolio, and said people should consider owning gold too. Ray flagged gold’s all-time high this year as a sign of ongoing investor demand for safe-haven assets, especially with inflation lingering and interest rates holding steady. On the tech front, Ray said artificial intelligence stocks are in bubble territory, but he isn’t telling people to sell just yet. “Don’t sell just because there’s a bubble,” he said. But Ray also warned that when stocks trade at these kinds of levels, long-term returns usually suffer. “If you look at the correlations with the next 10 years’ returns, when you are in that territory, you get very low returns.” He said the bubble hasn’t popped yet, but it could, just not because of rate hikes. He thinks higher wealth taxes might be what finally pulls the plug. “We don’t have the pricking of the bubble yet,” Ray said, pushing back on analysts who blame monetary policy. Bridgewater leans into megacaps, unloads Alphabet Despite his concern about overvalued tech stocks, Bridgewater remains exposed to major names. Ray boosted his fund’s holdings in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF by 75% this past quarter. The position now makes up 10.62% of the portfolio, worth $2.71 billion across 4.05 million shares. His second-largest holding is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, worth $1.71 billion. Ray cut back his Alphabet investment by 52%, bringing it down to $645 million. His company also holds $568 million in Microsoft, and recently grew its stake in Salesforce by 22%, reaching $475 million. Ray’s portfolio includes Nvidia, Lam Research, Adobe, and Booking Holdings—all closely linked to AI, cloud computing, or consumer data platforms. For the third quarter, Bridgewater added 617,000 shares of Reddit, 807,000 shares of Robinhood, and expanded positions in Applied Materials and KLA, two key suppliers in the chip sector. The company also nearly doubled its exposure to Sea Ltd, a Southeast Asian internet company that’s rebounding after last year’s slowdown. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Traders are watching a narrow set of signals that could determine the next major price move. Many believe the market is approaching a phase where inflows, supply conditions, and institutional execution may combine to create a violent repricing event. In a video clip shared on his X handle, Ripple Bull Winkle delivered one of the strongest arguments for this scenario. He explained that every ETF seed scenario, from “a tiny 50 million to a monster 900 million dollar,” will push XRP price toward levels that “people swore were impossible. ETF Seed Flows and Direct Buy Pressure Bull Winkle stressed that ETF inflows operate through a simple mechanism. He said, “ETF inflows aren’t about hype. They’re about math.” When an ETF is seeded, the capital must buy the underlying asset immediately. He emphasized that “when you seed an ETF, even a small one, that money has to buy the actual underlying asset.” This creates forced demand. Institutions do not stretch their buys over weeks. They execute at once to secure positions. That urgency creates sudden pressure on exchange books already showing low liquidity. #XRP ETF INFLOWS WILL TRIGGER A PRICE EXPLOSION!!! pic.twitter.com/z9jMmuZ5c4 — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 19, 2025 XRP Supply Constraint Bull Winkle highlighted XRP’s unique supply conditions. He said the asset’s supply “is insanely limited.” With exchange reserves sitting at multi-year lows , inflows do not disperse evenly. They hit the market with concentrated force. According to him, “every dollar of inflows hits the price like fire.” This creates what he called a direct equation: “Inflows plus a limited supply equals a violent repricing.” When institutional capital enters this kind of environment, the effect is magnified. The Role of Wall Street Execution A key point in his analysis is execution style. He noted that “Wall Street doesn’t dollar cost average. They don’t wait for dips.” Their buy orders are immediate. Their allocations are predefined. Their execution speed often overwhelms available liquidity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This environment makes XRP more reactive to inflows than many traders expect. The market may see sudden expansions rather than slow climbs. Why The Next Move Could Be Historic Bull Winkle argued that XRP now sits on a chart structure that looks tightly compressed. He described the asset as “coiled” and ready for a major expansion . He said the coming move “isn’t going to be just a pump. It is a repricing event.” He closed with a warning for late observers. Many people, he said, “won’t realize that until XRP is already at the numbers that most said couldn’t ever happen.” XRP stands at the center of a supply-demand imbalance shaped by institutional inflows and shrinking exchange reserves. Ripple Bull Winkle’s remarks reflect a growing view within the market: ETF-driven demand may ignite a powerful shift in price behavior. The combination of tight liquidity, institutional execution, and direct underlying purchases could define the next chapter in XRP’s market evolution.

This massive liquidation event has sent ripples across major exchanges, highlighting the extreme volatility that can strike without warning. If you’re active in crypto trading, understanding what triggered this cascade and how to protect your positions is crucial. What Exactly Happened During This Liquidation Storm? When we talk about futures being liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged positions when traders can’t meet margin requirements. The past hour saw an unprecedented wave of these forced closures totaling $262 million. Moreover, the damage extends to $910 million in futures liquidated over the past 24 hours, indicating this wasn’t an isolated incident but part of a broader market correction. Several factors contributed to this massive liquidation event: Sudden price drops across major cryptocurrencies Over-leveraged positions unable to withstand volatility Cascading effect as liquidations triggered more price movement Market sentiment shifting rapidly Why Do These Massive Liquidations Occur? Understanding why futures get liquidated helps traders avoid becoming statistics. Essentially, when traders use leverage, they borrow funds to amplify their positions. However, if the market moves against them and their collateral value drops below maintenance margin levels, exchanges automatically close their positions to prevent further losses. The recent $262 million in futures liquidated demonstrates how quickly conditions can change. One moment traders might be profitable, and the next they’re facing automatic position closures. This domino effect often accelerates as initial liquidations push prices further, triggering more margin calls. How Can Traders Protect Themselves From Future Liquidations? Surviving volatile periods requires proactive risk management. First, always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Second, avoid excessive leverage—while 10x or 20x might seem tempting, it dramatically increases your risk of having futures liquidated. Third, maintain adequate margin buffers to withstand normal market fluctuations. Remember that seeing $262 million futures liquidated serves as a stark reminder: cryptocurrency markets remain highly unpredictable. Successful traders prioritize capital preservation over explosive gains, especially during turbulent periods. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? When we witness hundreds of millions in futures liquidated within hours, it typically signals heightened market stress. Such events often precede either significant buying opportunities or further downward pressure. However, experienced traders know that volatility creates opportunities for those prepared with solid strategies and emotional discipline. The $910 million in futures liquidated over 24 hours suggests we’re witnessing more than a minor correction. This scale of liquidation affects market liquidity and can influence short-term price discovery across all major cryptocurrencies. Key Takeaways From This Liquidation Event This dramatic hour that saw $262 million futures liquidated teaches valuable lessons. Market conditions can change instantly, leverage multiplies both gains and losses, and risk management isn’t optional—it’s essential for survival. While the numbers seem alarming, such events are part of cryptocurrency’s maturation process, weeding out over-leveraged positions and restoring market equilibrium. Frequently Asked Questions What causes futures to be liquidated? Futures get liquidated when a trader’s position loses enough value that their collateral no longer covers the required maintenance margin. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent negative balances. How can I avoid having my positions liquidated? Use reasonable leverage, set stop-loss orders, maintain extra margin beyond minimum requirements, and monitor positions regularly during volatile periods. Does massive liquidation indicate market bottom? Not necessarily. While large liquidation events sometimes mark local bottoms due to forced selling exhaustion, they can also precede further declines if market sentiment remains negative. Which cryptocurrencies saw the most liquidations? Bitcoin and Ethereum typically account for the majority of liquidations during market-wide events, though altcoins often experience proportionally larger impacts due to lower liquidity. How quickly can liquidation happen? Extremely quickly. In volatile conditions, positions can be liquidated within minutes of crossing margin thresholds, as demonstrated by the $262 million futures liquidated in just one hour. Do liquidations affect spot market prices? Yes, significant liquidations can create selling pressure that impacts spot prices, especially when large positions are closed across multiple exchanges simultaneously.

The token crashed following unauthorized selling from a market maker. Nillion (NIL) is the latest token to crash based on rogue activity from a market maker. The asset saw erratic price action starting on Wednesday, and extended its slide to an all-time low. NIL slid to $0.11 following reputational damage from the project. The token started trading at $0.72 in April and has been sliding ever since, with small relief rallies. Nillion was a recently launched computation and storage network with privacy features. The services allowed the building of personalized AI, encrypted databases, and privacy-preserving applications. Nillion blames NIL slide on actions of unauthorized market maker More than 31% of NIL trading volumes are concentrated on Binance . This brings additional liquidity to NIL, while also making it vulnerable to large-scale traders. Many new tokens use market makers, though usually the special traders provide liquidity on both sides of the market. This time, the market maker sold aggressively, causing the steep crash from $0.19 to $0.11. Previously, Binance banned some market makers for crashing the price of new tokens. Nillion team attempts to compensate traders NIL is a highly liquid token with over $151M in volumes for the past day. During the recent sell-off, NIL posted the highest volumes since its market debut in April. NIL crashed rapidly, reflecting the activity of a market maker that dumped the token, unauthorized by the Nillion Association. | Source: Coingecko The token also has a small derivative market with $11M in open interest, causing nearly $800K in liquidations during the recent crash. The team did not expect the crash, and later investigated the main reason, connecting the selling to the market maker. “ Our entire team was confused until we realized what happened: a market maker sold NIL tokens without legal authorization from the Nillion Association. Then refusing to respond to any team communications during the flash sell and hours following,” announced the team through its X account. The Nillion Association will use its treasury to buy back NIL tokens. Additionally, the team will seek to freeze the wallets of the market maker, banning its activity on exchanges. Nillion still refused to name the market maker, despite being pressured by its community. NIL has been propositioned by crypto influencers, but has a limited market share on social media. The relatively recent token still gained listings on prominent exchanges. NIL activity is also highly concentrated on centralized exchanges, with just 106 holders having tokens in their self-custodied wallets . The token has not revealed any insider or whale activity, but has instead encountered rapid centralized selling. The Nillion team immediately distanced itself from the unnamed market maker to avoid accusations of actually requesting the sale. NIL has a trading structure with a significant share of activity against the Korean won and the Turkish lira. The recent price drop significantly affected South Korean traders , who may now seek redress.

On November 19, the blockchain explorer ranked Machi Big Brother as the top-most liquidated degen with a total of 71 liquidations. James Wynn , a well-known cryptocurrency trader with nearly half a million X followers, came in second on the list with 26 liquidations. Social media personality Andrew Tate claimed the third spot with 19 liquidations. Data from Onchain Lens shows that James Wynn was completely liquidated on September 5 after going long on ETH with a 25x leveraged position, resulting in a $10,025 loss. Andrew Tate was also liquidated on November 18 after holding BTC. He lost $112k in the trade. Bitcoin whale Owen Gunden exits $1.3 billion BTC holdings Bitcoin’s early adopter, Owen Gunden, who is ranked as the 8th largest crypto holder according to blockchain analytics, liquidated his entire Bitcoin portfolio valued at roughly $1.3 billion. The recent sale coincided with active institutional investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs, underscoring the growing shift from individual holders to institutional participation in digital asset holdings. Gunden, an early Bitcoin trader who has been active since the Mt. Gox era, has been transferring portions of his holdings to the Kraken exchange. Based on on-chain data, approximately 2,499 BTC, valued at $228 million, was transferred from Gunden’s wallet address to the Kraken exchange, marking his last transfer. Gunden’s market exit mimics a broader trend across the cryptocurrency landscape, where long-term holders are gradually reducing self-custody exposure amid growing interest from institutional investors and the emergence of regulated products. According to a Cryptopolitan report , long-term holders, investors who hold BTC for more than 155 days, began selling in October. The report cited Julio Moreno’s remarks, head of research at CryptoQuant, who noted that it is a common phenomenon during bull markets for LTHs to make profits when token prices reach new highs. Moreno revealed that the absence of strong demand to offset the current selling pressure puzzles him. He noted that since October, long-term holders have been selling, but demand is shrinking, which marks a point of caution. O n-chain data shows that Gunden’s wallet had been accumulating BTC consistently over the past decade, making his exit today a significant event on-chain that may trigger volatility across the market.

MSTR crashed to $173.55, extending its slide from the past week. MSTR, Strategy’s common stock, remained under pressure, dropping to a low of around $173.55. Soon after that, MSTR had a small bounce to $176, though remaining close to its lowest range for the past year. The shares are down a net 40% in the year to date and over 62% for the past 12 months. MSTR fell to a new 52-week low at $175.33, pressured by another BTC downturn. | Source: Google Finance MSTR invited additional fears of unraveling Strategy’s model. The common stock still has not completed its entire issuance plan, and Strategy expects to sell more MSTR to run its playbook until 2030. However, at this price range, selling MSTR to buy BTC may not be viable. As BTC dipped below $88,000 on Thursday, Strategy’s appeal is also waning. The company has bought BTC at an average price of $74,000, but most of its recent supply is underwater. Will Strategy issue more preferred shares? Until recently, Strategy filled the missing funding from a weak MSTR with new preferred share tranches. This allowed Strategy to still buy BTC, service its debt, and pay out dividends where appropriate. However, the expansion of obligations is also diminishing the ability of Strategy to buy more BTC based on its playbook. The new preferred shares for Strategy also remain riskier, offering high returns and a high chance of a crash. STRD has fallen to $66, STRK is down to $75, STRF is at $95.08, and STRC is at $92.02. Trading below $100 also means the shares may have higher effective returns, but also a higher risk. The preferred shares looked good when they traded close to their $100 face value, but they are currently also causing losses for holders. Strategy trades below the value of its BTC treasury Strategy’s MSTR price slide led to a total valuation below the current price of the BTC treasury. Strategy’s fully diluted value is still below the value of its BTC treasury. | Source: Artemis Based on the ratio of fully diluted value to net asset value, Strategy has fallen to a ratio of 0.98. Despite the lack of MSTR dilution in the past few weeks and the higher number of BTC per share, the playbook has shown its negative side. On the positive side, Strategy still holds relatively valuable BTC. However, selling or compensating holders may actually depress BTC further, in addition to the panic and reputational damage. The current price slide has led to fears that MSTR can once again erase its value, similar to its crash during the dotcom boom. Strategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor has still tried to calm the markets, stating the current playbook can hold a BTC drop of up to 80%.

That approval puts the world’s most powerful/valuable company directly in partnership with a tiny Caucasus nation that’s now central to a much larger political chessboard. According to Trump’s White House, Nvidia’s chips are going to Firebird, an Armenian AI startup planning a supercomputer project. This is part of a larger U.S. plan to use AI technology as leverage, and was approved by the Trump administration, which has been using chip exports as a way to expand influence without deploying troops. Armenia becomes one of the latest targets in what’s now clearly a tech-based diplomatic strategy. Just yesterday, Washington also gave the green light for AI chip sales to the UAE and Saudi Arabia. And inside the White House, there’s pressure on Congress to kill off a proposal that would restrict Nvidia from sending even more chips abroad. Trump signs corridor deal and pulls Armenia into U.S. orbit Trump didn’t only do chips. Back in August, he signed a peace agreement with both Armenia and Azerbaijan, ending years of fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. The deal handed the U.S. exclusive rights to develop a transit corridor across Armenia, linking Azerbaijan to its Naxçıvan exclave near the Turkish border. That’s now being called the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity. If it’s completed, the corridor would give the U.S. a direct line into Central Asia, dodging Russia entirely. That region is loaded with minerals and energy, and those resources are exactly what the U.S. wants easier access to. Trump’s team just hosted a summit in Washington, pulling in leaders from across Central Asia to pitch deeper cooperation, without Moscow in the picture. Russia used to run this whole space before the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, and even now it still holds economic and political sway. But its war in Ukraine has flipped the board. A lot of these countries want new partners. And now the EU, China, and the U.S. are all racing to fill the gap.

His analysis suggests that Ripple’s digital asset could replace idle cash in global reserves, reducing costs and unlocking greater capital efficiency. Under Basel III, banks must hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to satisfy the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). These requirements force banks to maintain large pre-funded nostro/vostro accounts around the world—a business inefficiency that locks up capital. XRP as a Universal Bridge Asset SMQKE argues that XRP can act as a single, bridgeable reserve on a bank’s balance sheet. Rather than holding multiple currencies in global accounts, banks could hold XRP and use it to source liquidity on demand. This aligns with Ripple’s On‑Demand Liquidity (ODL) model, which enables instant conversion between fiat currencies through XRP without pre-funding. RIPPLE/XRP CAN SUPPORT BANKS IN MEETING BASEL III LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS Documented 3x. https://t.co/lymQtzDgTD pic.twitter.com/d3kH7uizcq — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 19, 2025 Regulatory Recognition and Compliance A pivotal part of SMQKE’s case is a reported Basel Committee letter, dated August 19, 2025, referenced in his post. According to this letter, XRP qualifies as a “Group 2A” crypto asset under three specific hedging‑recognition tests. This classification suggests that banks could count XRP toward regulatory liquidity metrics under Basel’s prudential framework. Cost Reduction and Operational Efficiency By consolidating liquidity in XRP, banks may dramatically reduce their foreign-exchange hedging costs, lower treasury overhead, and shrink payments operations teams. SMQKE’s analysis draws on Ripple’s own models, which estimate significant savings from using XRP instead of funding dispersed nostro accounts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Holding XRP could free up what is now dormant capital in foreign reserves. Instead of tying up low-yield cash across jurisdictions, banks can deploy XRP for actual liquidity. The resulting capital release could improve return on equity and reduce the regulatory burden associated with Basel III. Risks and Practical Considerations Despite the promise, some hurdles remain. XRP’s price volatility could deter risk‑averse institutions from holding it long term. Market liquidity must mature for on‑demand settlement to scale. And broader regulatory certainty remains crucial—classification under Basel standards must persist, and banks must adopt it. SMQKE’s insight shines a light on a bold but increasingly credible use case for XRP: not just a payment rail, but a regulatory-compliant liquidity tool. If banks begin to embrace XRP as a universal bridge asset , they may unlock billions in capital, streamline operations, and meet Basel III’s liquidity demands more efficiently. For Ripple, this could mean real integration into the core of modern banking. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast, low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks.

The chart shows a long downtrend, with candles always staying close to the lower Bollinger Band. This means that there is a lot of selling pressure. ATOM is attempting to rebound from around $2.60 to $2.70. The RSI has recovered a little from being oversold (from 24 to 44). The price is still below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, which are still going down, though. If buyers keep up the pace, ATOM could test $2.80–$3.16 again. If it doesn’t stay above $2.60, it could drop again toward the $2.40 support zone. ATOM/USD 4-hour price chart ATOMUSD chart by TradingView Cosmos ATOM’s 4-hour chart shows a corrective rebound after a sharp dip, but overall momentum remains weak. Price recently bounced from the lower Bollinger Band near $2.55 and briefly tested $2.97 before retracing, showing strong overhead selling pressure. The RSI sits near mid-range, indicating neutral but fragile momentum, while the MACD is attempting a shallow bullish crossover, suggesting only a mild recovery attempt. Balance of Power remains unstable, reflecting inconsistent buyer conviction. If ATOM holds above $2.76 support, it may attempt another push toward $2.95. Failure to hold support risks a pullback toward $2.60. Cosmos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 3.36 SELL SMA 5 $ 3.16 SELL SMA 10 $ 3.08 SELL SMA 21 $ 2.95 SELL SMA 50 $ 3.28 SELL SMA 100 $ 3.87 SELL SMA 200 $4.18 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 3.01 SELL EMA 5 $ 3.23 SELL EMA 10 $ 3.63 SELL EMA 21 $ 4.01 SELL EMA 50 $ 4.27 SELL EMA 100 $ 4.38 SELL EMA 200 $4.64 SELL What to expect from ATOM price analysis next? Cosmos (ATOM) is starting to stabilize, but the overall trend is still bearish. ATOM is still below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages on both the 1-day and 4-hour charts, which shows that the downward pressure is still there. Recent spikes in volatility and long wicks show that people are trying hard to recover, but buyers don’t have enough momentum to keep going. The RSI is in the mid-40s on both timeframes, which means that sentiment is weak but getting better. If ATOM stays above $2.55–$2.60, it could try to bounce back up to $2.90–$3.05. If you don’t protect this area, you could go back to lower supports. Overall, consolidation with cautious upside attempts appears most likely next. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Why is Comsos Atom down today? Cosmos (ATOM) is down today because the 1-day and 4-hour charts show that the market is still going down. The 1-day chart shows that ATOM has been trading below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages for a long time, which means that the price is going down. Bollinger Bands are still wide, and the price is following the lower band, which shows that selling pressure is still strong. RSI stays low, which shows that buyers are losing interest. On the 4-hour chart, lower highs and lower lows that happen over and over again confirm a bearish structure in the short term. The MACD, on the other hand, stays flat to negative, showing that there isn’t a lot of strong reversal momentum. When you put all of these technical signals together, they show that prices are going down because of weak demand, trend exhaustion, and a lack of bullish volume. Is Cosmos a safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmos’ current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $33.53 by 2030. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will likely reach $110.10 in 2033. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $33.53 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Thus, the cosmos network could expand to a wider user base. Recent news/opinion on Cosmos Cosmos Labs announced a plan to make Cosmos stronger in the blockchain market, especially in payments and tokenization. Cosmos CEO said that the new Cosmos Stack will focus on five main areas: performance, connectivity, EVM compatibility, developer control, and user experience. Improvements in CometBFT and other new technologies are expected to make Cosmos a top choice for real-world blockchain applications by making it easier to scale and work with other systems. We have a clear contender for PMF in blockchain: Payments and tokenization.

Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High November 2025 $4.25 $4.46 $4.76 Cosmos Price Prediction 2025 According to our deep technical analysis on past price data of ATOM, in 2025 the price of Cosmos is forecasted to reach a minimum of $4.47, a maximum of $4.90, and an average trading value of $4.64. This projection is supported by moderate ecosystem growth, continued adoption of IBC for cross-chain communication, and consistent validator participation, while overall market consolidation and reduced speculative momentum keep ATOM’s price within this stable range. Year Potential Low Average Price Potential High 2025 $4.47 $4.64 $4.90 Cosmos price predictions 2026-2031 Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 $6.07 $6.30 $7.74 2027 $9.45 $9.70 $10.66 2028 $13.75 $14.23 $16.43 2029 $19.52 $20.09 $23.72 2030 $28.38 $29.18 $33.53 2031 $42.19 $43.65 $49.81 Cosmos Price Prediction 2026 The price of 1 Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a minimum level of $6.07 in 2026, with a maximum of $7.74 and an average of $6.30. This forecast is fueled by the expansion of IBC-connected blockchains, rising DeFi integrations within the Cosmos ecosystem, and improved scalability through ongoing upgrades, supporting steady growth while broader market consolidation limits sharp breakouts. Cosmos Price Prediction 2027 The price of Cosmos (ATOM) is predicted to reach a minimum level of $9.45 in 2027, with a maximum of $10.66 and an average of $9.70. This projection is driven by increasing adoption of interchain solutions, stronger validator participation, and the expansion of cross-chain DeFi projects, which enhance network utility and long-term token value. Cosmos Price Prediction 2028 The price of Cosmos (ATOM) is predicted to reach a minimum value of $13.75 in 2028, with a maximum of $16.43 and an average trading price of $14.23. This anticipated rise is supported by broader adoption of interchain communication, expansion of Cosmos-based projects, and institutional interest in interoperable blockchain infrastructure driving sustained demand and ecosystem growth. Cosmos price forecast 2029 Cosmos price is forecast to reach a lowest possible level of $19.52 in 2029. As per findings, the ATOM price could reach a maximum possible level of $23.72 with the average forecast price of $20.09. This growth is expected as interchain adoption accelerates globally, with more blockchains leveraging Cosmos’s IBC technology and modular SDK framework, boosting utility and network value while institutional participation strengthens long-term demand. Cosmos Price Prediction 2030 The price of Cosmos (ATOM) is predicted to reach a minimum value of $28.38 in 2030, with a maximum of $33.53 and an average trading price of $29.18. This projection is driven by Cosmos’s evolution into a core hub for blockchain interoperability, which is expected to strengthen long-term ecosystem value and price stability. Cosmos Price Prediction 2031 As per the forecast and technical analysis, in 2031 the price of Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a minimum of $42.19, a maximum of $49.81, and an average of $43.65. This bullish outlook is supported by Cosmos’s full-scale interoperability, increased institutional adoption, and its position as a foundational layer for interconnected blockchains, driving sustained demand and long-term value appreciation.

Cosmos historic price sentiment Cosmos price history Cosmos launched after its 2017 ICO and mainnet release in 2019, reaching a peak of $44 during the 2021 bull market. After April 2022, ATOM entered a long consolidation phase, mostly trading between $6 and $16. Throughout 2024, the price weakened further, dropping to the $4–$6 range and reaching lows near $4 as bearish sentiment grew. Early 2025 saw continued volatility, with ATOM fluctuating mostly between $4 and $5 despite brief rebounds. From July to September 2025, ATOM traded narrowly between $4.30–$4.70, showing limited momentum and ongoing market indecision. ATOM was trading around $4.40–$4.70, but bearish pressure pushed the price downward as broader market sentiment weakened. The price declined further, moving into the $4.00–$4.30 range, with repeated failed attempts to break above resistance. From the beginning of November, ATOM continued to trade sideways between $3.90–$4.20, showing low momentum, weak buyer strength, and consolidation near support levels.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-20 19:10:00

The token is down over 17% on the week, as it dipped to multi-month lows. Meanwhile, the move has drawn attention from traders watching whether a deeper drop is ahead or if a base is forming. Key Level Break Signals Pressure Analyst Crypto Patel noted that the $0.0000059 support has broken and is now acting as resistance. He describes this shift as a warning that the larger trend still favors sellers. “Until price reclaims it, HTF trend stays bearish,” he wrote in a recent post. Patel also points to a weekly Fair Value Gap (FVG) that remains partially filled, along with a sweep of liquidity under multi-month lows. These conditions, according to his chart, suggest that further downside could take the price toward the $0.00000178 zone. He refers to this area as a likely point of interest for longer-term buyers. Source: Crypto Patel/X Moreover, Patel’s chart compares the current setup to one seen before PEPE’s last major rally. In that case, the price broke down, consolidated, then launched into a sharp move higher. The previous breakout delivered gains of over 4,600%. He notes that the same setup could return, but only if the price dips into support and then reclaims lost ground. A move back above $0.0000059 would mark a shift in structure. “HTF structure is not bearish forever. It’s preparing the next expansion. Watch the reclaim,” he said. As CryptoPotato reported earlier this month, PEPE also broke below neckline support, confirming a head-and-shoulders pattern, aligning with the bearish structure. Trend Remains Weak on Indicators The price remains below the 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day exponential moving averages. All of these are trending lower. That signals weakness across the daily time frame. Unless PEPE can close above those levels, the bias stays to the downside. Source: TradingView In addition, the MACD lines are still below the zero mark and moving sideways. There’s no sign yet of momentum turning. Volume and volatility also appear to be dropping, adding to the view that buyers are staying on the sidelines for now. Speculation Drops as Interest Fades Futures open interest has dropped to $193.5 million, down from over $1 billion in mid-2023, based on CoinGlass data. The sharp decline suggests fewer traders are using leverage. This can mean less volatility but also reflects a market that’s cooling off. Spot exchange data supports the same view. Netflows have mostly been negative, showing that more tokens are leaving exchanges than coming in. This often points to holding behavior, but the steady drop in price shows demand hasn’t kept up. In recent weeks, both netflows and price action have flattened, signaling a pause in activity.

This remarkable debut signals growing institutional confidence in XRP and sets a new benchmark for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. What Makes This XRP ETF Launch So Impressive? Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart described the performance as very impressive , especially considering there were still three hours remaining in the trading day when the volume was recorded. This strong start demonstrates several key factors: Robust investor demand for regulated XRP exposure Growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency ETFs Market confidence in Bitwise as an ETF provider Continued momentum for XRP investment products The timing of this XRP ETF launch couldn’t be more significant, arriving just one week after the Canary XRP ETF entered the market. This back-to-back introduction of XRP ETFs indicates a rapidly expanding ecosystem for digital asset investment vehicles. Why Are XRP ETFs Gaining Such Momentum? Several factors contribute to the surging interest in XRP ETFs. First, they provide investors with a regulated, familiar framework for accessing XRP exposure without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. This eliminates concerns about: Private key management and security Regulatory compliance issues Custodial responsibilities Technical barriers to entry Moreover, the successful debut of this XRP ETF reflects broader market trends. Institutional investors are increasingly seeking cryptocurrency exposure through traditional financial instruments, and ETFs represent the perfect bridge between conventional finance and digital assets. What Challenges Do XRP ETFs Face? Despite the impressive debut, XRP ETFs navigate a complex regulatory landscape. The ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency regulations presents both opportunities and challenges for these investment products. However, the strong initial performance of this XRP ETF suggests that regulatory clarity is improving. Another consideration is market volatility. While the $22 million debut volume is impressive, sustained performance will depend on broader market conditions and continued investor interest in XRP specifically and cryptocurrency ETFs generally. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering XRP ETF investments, several key points deserve attention. The successful launch of multiple XRP ETFs within a week indicates: Strong market demand for XRP investment products Growing institutional confidence in XRP’s long-term prospects Expanding options for cryptocurrency exposure through traditional channels Potential for continued innovation in digital asset ETFs This XRP ETF performance also suggests that the cryptocurrency ETF market is maturing rapidly, with investors showing appetite for diverse digital asset exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Conclusion: A New Era for XRP Investment The spectacular debut of the Bitwise XRP ETF marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency adoption. With $22 million in first-day volume, this XRP ETF has demonstrated strong market demand and institutional confidence. The back-to-back launches of XRP ETFs signal a maturing market that’s increasingly embracing regulated digital asset investment products. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, the success of this XRP ETF suggests we’re entering a new phase of institutional adoption and mainstream accessibility. Frequently Asked Questions What is an XRP ETF? An XRP ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of XRP, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly owning it through traditional brokerage accounts. How does the Bitwise XRP ETF differ from direct XRP ownership? The ETF provides regulated exposure through traditional financial channels, eliminating the need for cryptocurrency wallets, private key management, and direct exchange trading. Why is the $22 million debut volume significant? This volume indicates strong institutional and retail demand, suggesting confidence in both XRP’s prospects and the ETF structure for cryptocurrency investments. Are there other XRP ETFs available? Yes, the Canary XRP ETF launched just one week before the Bitwise XRP ETF, indicating growing competition and market expansion. What risks should investors consider with XRP ETFs? Investors should consider cryptocurrency market volatility, regulatory developments, and the specific risks outlined in each ETF’s prospectus. How can I invest in the Bitwise XRP ETF? You can purchase shares through traditional brokerage accounts, similar to how you would invest in any other ETF listed on major exchanges. Found this analysis helpful?

While digital assets maintain downtrends, the Nillion team has emphasized that routine volatility didn’t trigger the dip, but behind-the-scenes action that occurred without their authorization. In today’s statement released on X, Nillion stated that the price action initially confused them until they discovered the catalyst. Notably, a market maker dumped NIL assets at a scale without approval from the Nillion Association. An unauthorized token sale rattles Nillion The team described the massive sell-off as against agreements, adding that the involved partners ignored communications during and after the transaction. The official announcement read: Our entire team was confused until we realized what happened: a market maker sold NIL tokens without legal authorization from the Nillion Association. Then, refusing to respond to any team communications during the flash sell and the hours following. Failure to reach out to the market maker magnified concerns, leaving the team fighting to handle the situation as NIL experienced a free-fall. While market makers support projects by ensuring stable liquidity, Nillion did the opposite. That has hurt the project and its community. Immediate buybacks to the rescue The Nillion team isn’t making empty reassurance. The association said that it has started buying back NIL tokens dumped during the unauthorized selloff. The goal is to absorb the forced supply and lessen the impact on NIL’s prevailing liquidity. Further, the project has promised to use all capital retrieved from the partner to conduct more asset buybacks. Involved accounts frozen in a legal move The team has acted quickly, spending overnight to cooperating with exchanges to suspend all wallets linked to this event. They’re also pursuing legal actions, an uncommon move in an industry where clashes between liquidity providers and projects often remain under the radar. NIL price outlook Nillion’s token took a sharp decline from $0.1868 to a low of $0.09221, a 50% slide, on its daily chart following the market marker’s sell-off. NIL is trading at $0.1232 after a brief recovery, likely fueled by the team’s swift response. Chart by Coinmarketcap Its 24-hour trading volume has increased by a staggering 670%. That signals heightened speculative trader activity amid the intense volatility. Enthusiasts will watch the alt’s performance in the coming sessions, with buyback and legal moves in focus.

The platform pulls in 150 million users who spend two hours a day wandering through virtual worlds filled with billboards, video spots, and branded spaces. Executives keep saying the ad market is “uncharted and very big,” as David Baszucki put it in 2023, yet four years later, the needle has barely moved. Roblox even signed a partnership with Google in April, but its most recent filing still called ads “insignificant.” Every quarterly call brings the same questions from analysts, and Baszucki keeps brushing them off by calling ads a long‑term play. Developers say the problem starts inside the platform itself. They don’t want to build ads into their games because the payouts are tiny. Bloomberg allegedly spoke with several creators who said ad rates range from a fraction of a cent to 55 cents per thousand visits, numbers they say are too low to bother with. Dario Raciti from Zero Code called those rates “on the lower end” of the gaming world. Most developers prefer selling in‑game items like the kangaroo eggs in Adopt Me!, which make far more money with less headache. Ben Spoont from Misfits Gaming said the biggest drag on the ad model is “developer adoption,” because creators want to protect the feel of their games. Roblox faces pushback from developers and advertisers Roblox also has a young user base, with one‑third under the age of 13, and sponsors are nervous. Reid Steinberg from Icon International said his clients won’t touch ads aimed at young kids because of strict U.S. federal rules that limit what marketers can collect or say. Roblox claims it blocks ads for under‑13 users, but a recent partnership between Dress to Impress and Universal Pictures’ Wicked film was open to anyone over five. Roblox also doesn’t label every ad‑supported game. This tension grew in 2022 when Truth In Advertising filed a complaint with the FTC. Bonnie Patten, the group’s director, said Roblox keeps claiming it does not market to kids, yet “all children on their platforms are being marketed to,” and many cannot tell the difference between gameplay and ads. Roblox pointed to its earlier response, saying it has strict standards for developers, rules to protect young users, and zero tolerance for fraud. Baszucki said in July that advertising is tied to Roblox’s goal of taking 10% of the global gaming market. And in October, Morgan Stanley bumped its estimates for the company based partly on ad potential. But just one day before that, CFO Naveen Chopra told investors that ads would not meaningfully impact results anytime soon. Roblox is not profitable, and analysts think 2026 could bring slower growth as Roblox rolls out age‑verification tools that might limit new sign‑ups. Brands test Roblox ads but see limited payoff Advertisers can buy billboard slots, push sponsored game portals, or pay for rewarded videos, where players watch clips to earn items. Morgan Stanley estimated that rewarded videos could hit $3 billion by 2027. Roblox said developers can now use rewarded videos across the platform as of Nov. 11. During the metaverse boom, companies like Adidas and Walmart paid developers to build virtual hangouts. Some cases worked, like Chipotle’s Roblox game, where users spent 14 minutes on average, more time than customers spend inside actual Chipotle stores, according to Nick Malaperiman of Spud Farm Marketing. But many branded spaces flopped, including West Elm Roblox, which sat empty for months. Creators say Roblox keeps 70% of ad revenue, leaving the rest to them. Even top games don’t see meaningful returns. Roblox said Brookhaven, its fourth‑most‑popular game, earns five figures a month in ad money, about $65,000, according to one developer. But top 10 games bring in $2.8 million a month from merchandise, showing how small ads still are. Advertisers also want better data. Rewarded video ads can rack up huge views as players chase Gucci or Sonic rewards, but brands want proof that this leads to sales. Roblox insists 75% of users notice ads and 87% like rewarded videos. Still, Steinberg said none of his clients want to advertise on Roblox due to weak measurement. Out of the six largest ad agencies contacted by Bloomberg, only three had any clients on the platform. Yet, as Raciti put it, “there is a lot of interest,” because attention always attracts brands, even if the results are unclear.

The global launch of ChatGPT group chats represents a seismic shift in how people can work together with artificial intelligence, offering unprecedented opportunities for teams, families, and friends to coordinate and create collectively. What Are ChatGPT Group Chats? ChatGPT group chats enable multiple users to collaborate in shared conversations with the AI assistant. This innovative feature allows up to 20 participants to work together on various tasks while ChatGPT provides real-time assistance. The platform maintains individual privacy settings and memory, ensuring each user’s personal information remains secure while enabling seamless group interaction. How OpenAI Collaboration Features Work The new OpenAI collaboration tools are designed to enhance group productivity. Users can start group chats by tapping the people icon and adding participants either directly or through shareable links. Each member creates a brief profile with their name, username, and photo. The system intelligently manages conversations, creating new chat threads when adding participants to preserve original discussions. Feature Benefit Group Size Up to 20 participants Privacy Individual settings maintained Access Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans Interaction Tag ChatGPT for responses Enhanced AI Assistant Capabilities The ChatGPT AI assistant now demonstrates sophisticated social intelligence in group settings. It knows when to contribute naturally and when to remain silent, responding specifically when tagged with “ChatGPT.” The assistant can react with emojis, reference profile photos, and provide contextual support that enhances rather than interrupts human conversation flow. Practical Applications for Group Conversations OpenAI envisions numerous practical uses for these enhanced group conversations: Trip planning and coordination Co-writing documents and content Settling debates with factual information Collaborative research and analysis Decision-making with comprehensive data comparison Evolution of ChatGPT Features This launch represents OpenAI’s strategic move toward creating a social platform rather than just a chatbot. The company sees group chats as the foundation for more advanced collaborative environments where ChatGPT can play an increasingly active role in helping groups plan, create, and execute projects together. FAQs About ChatGPT Group Chats How many people can join a ChatGPT group chat? Up to 20 participants can join a single group chat session. Is my personal information safe in group chats? Yes, OpenAI confirms that personal settings and memory remain private to each individual user. How do I start a group chat? Tap the people icon in ChatGPT and add participants directly or share an invitation link. Can ChatGPT participate automatically in conversations? The AI knows when to contribute naturally, but users can also tag “ChatGPT” for specific responses. What happens when I add someone to an existing chat? Adding new participants creates a new conversation thread, preserving the original chat unchanged. The Future of AI-Powered Collaboration The introduction of group chats marks a pivotal moment in AI evolution. Rather than serving as isolated tools, AI assistants are becoming integral components of social and professional interactions. This development suggests a future where artificial intelligence seamlessly integrates into human collaboration, enhancing our collective capabilities without replacing human connection.

The authorities in Bishkek expect that the crypto, issued by a state-owned entity, will put the country on the map of global finances and attract investments. Kyrgyzstan to issue 50 million USDKG tokens on Tron Officials in Kyrgyzstan have issued the country’s first stablecoin, backed by physical gold. USDKG is a digital currency pegged to the Greenback. An official ceremony in the capital city was attended by President Sadyr Zhaparov. He was joined by Finance Minister Almaz Baketayev. Also present was Biybolot Mamytov, Chairman of the Board of OJSC “Issuer of Virtual Assets,” the fully state-owned company that’s putting the crypto into circulation. Participates in the event pressed a symbolic “Launch Issue” button, initiating the minting of 50 million USDKG tokens on the Tron blockchain, each equal to one U.S. dollar. Reporting on the development and quoting Zhaparov’s office, the Azerbaijani news agency Trend, which focuses on current events in the Caucasus and Central Asia, noted: “USDKG is crafted as a digital currency, marrying the steadfastness of gold with the cutting edge of blockchain technology.” Kyrgyz authorities say the stablecoin should enhance Kyrgyzstan’s presence in the global financial ecosystem and serve to support the development of Web3 services in the country. The dollar-denominated cryptocurrency is also expected to strengthen interactions between the public and the private sector through various blockchain solutions. Moreover, the government hopes that the USDKG will become a game changer when it comes to the former Soviet republic’s appeal as an investment destination – “opening the floodgates for capital inflows and paving the way for technology partnerships,” as Trend put it. Kyrgyz government making good on stablecoin promise The upcoming launch of what Bishkek describes as the world’s first state-sponsored stablecoin backed by real reserves of gold was announced by the Kyrgyz finance ministry earlier in November. At the time, the crypto was registered by the State Service for Regulation and Supervision of Financial Markets – the government agency responsible for oversight of non-bank institutions in the sector. Announcing the registration, Kyrgyzstan’s Treasury said that the digital currency will be issued and listed on both centralized and decentralized exchanges in the coming days and promised further details. The plan to launch the so-called “Gold Dollar” was first made public in May. Initial statements suggested it should be minted in the third quarter of the year. It was supposed to be underpinned by $500 million worth of state-owned gold initially, with plans to expand these reserves to at least $2 billion, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The finance ministry emphasized that USDKG is not to be confused with the digital som (KGST), the country’s central bank digital currency ( CBDC ) project. The latter is still under consideration. Kyrgyzstan is already home to a major stablecoin – the Russian ruble-pegged A7A5 , which accounts for half of the total capitalization of all non-dollar stablecoins in the world. This crypto has caused some serious troubles for the country as it’s allegedly being used by Russia to circumvent financial restrictions imposed over the Ukraine war. Created by a Russian company, the coin is currently issued by a Kyrgyz-registered firm. As a result, organizations linked to A7A5 , including Kyrgyz crypto platforms and banks, have been targeted in sanctions adopted by the U.S., the U.K., and the European Union.

The minutes of the Fed's latest meeting revealed that policymakers want to see more evidence for another interest rate cut, adding to market uncertainty. Timothy Misir, Director of Research at BRN, noted that on-chain data points to market tension. Misir said Bitcoin's decline below its 0.75 cost-based ratio is “a threshold that historically separates ordinary pullbacks from deeper trend reversals.” According to Misir, Bitcoin is currently pushing the Active Investors zone, and the loss of this level signals a critical period for the trend. Misir argues that retail investors are selling during this period, while large investors are accumulating. He noted that wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC have recently increased by 2.2%, reaching a four-month high. Technical analysis chart showing the cost-based ratio on BTC price. Related News: Bitcoin Plunges Sharply Again - Here's Why and Liquidation Data “Today's events suggest stabilization following a capitulation rather than a new start to momentum,” Misir said, arguing that Bitcoin needs to reclaim the 0.75 ratio before regaining bullish momentum. “Expect volatility and sharp reversals in both directions until these levels are achieved.” The Fed's published minutes did not provide a clear answer to market expectations of a December interest rate cut. Officials acknowledged that progress had been made in inflation but stated that “additional confirmation” was needed before further action could be taken. This suggested that easing monetary policy was possible but not guaranteed. *This is not investment advice.

The removal of Strategy from MSCI alone could drive nearly $2.8 billion in passive outflows, with a further $8.8 billion remaining at risk if other index providers follow suit. JPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted that Strategy has embedded its presence in major benchmarks. They also claimed that the company’s inclusion on the Nasdaq 100, MSCI World, and MSCI USA has allowed Bitcoin to seep indirectly into institutional and individual portfolios. However, this could reverse if MSCI ejects Strategy and other crypto firms relying on digital assets as their primary treasury holdings. For perspective, approximately $9 billion out of the company’s $59 billion market capitalization is invested in passive vehicles, ETFs, and mutual funds that track these global indices. Meanwhile, the JPMorgan analysts argue that losing major index status would negatively impact Strategy’s reputation. It could also reduce liquidity and make the stock less appealing to large institutional clients, raising doubts about its ability to raise equity. The rumors alone have seen Strategy’s total market value fall to pandemic levels. Strategy misses cut for S&P 500 admission Michael Saylor’s Strategy missed the cut for admission into the S&P 500, while Robinhood Markets, AppLovin, and Emcor were added. The company was excluded because it apparently looks more like an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or closed-end fund than a company with recurring revenue and profits. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said the company probably did not make the cut because of earnings volatility. However, being a bull on the company’s stock, Palmer believes Strategy will eventually make it into the S&P 500. He pointed out that the index committee may want to see another quarter or two of clean earnings before adding Strategy. Another reason why Strategy will not be added soon is that S&P Dow Jones Indices considers it a software company in its Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). The appears to suggest that Strategy was a software company before transitioning into a Bitcoin Treasury about five years ago. Meanwhile, Strategy Chairman and controlling shareholder Michael Saylor said he was not expecting the company to be included in the index so soon. He noted that Strategy is a new concept that is slowly making believers every quarter, adding that this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Strategy is now more of a financial company, given that its Bitcoin holdings dominate its current business. The company holds over 638K BTC, worth roughly $72 billion, which represents approximately 3% of the total outstanding supply. It is the largest Bitcoin treasury in the world with a market value of $94 billion. MSCI adds 69 securities and slashes 64 from MSCI ACWI Index The MSCI recently announced the addition of 69 securities and the deletion of about 64 securities from the MSCI ACWI Index. The index provider revealed that the three largest additions to the MSCI World Index measured by full market capitalization will be Nebius Group A (Netherlands), CoreWeave (USA), and Insmed (USA). Meanwhile, GF Securities Co., Ltd. (China), Barito Renewable Energy (Indonesia), and Zijin Gold International (China) will join the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, also measured by full company market capitalization. There will also be 207 additions to and 224 deletions from the MSCI ACWI Small Cap Index. On the other hand, the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index (IMI) will have 199 additions and 211 deletions. About 175 securities will be added to the MSCI World All Cap Index, and 71 will be deleted. The MSCI further disclosed eight additions to and two deletions from the MSCI Frontier Markets Index.

This dramatic decision comes as the company’s stock faces intense pressure, having plummeted nearly 70% since announcing its AVAX acquisition strategy. But what does this mean for investors and the broader cryptocurrency market? Why is AVAX One Technology implementing this share buyback? The company finds itself in a challenging position. After making bold moves in the AVAX market, their stock performance has disappointed shareholders. The AVAX One Technology share buyback represents a strategic effort to restore confidence and stabilize the company’s valuation. This approach signals management’s belief that their stock is undervalued despite recent setbacks. Market analysts see this as a defensive maneuver. When a company’s shares drop significantly, buybacks can help support the price by reducing the number of outstanding shares. For AVAX One Technology, this $40 million commitment represents a substantial vote of confidence in their long-term vision. How did the AVAX strategy impact stock performance? The correlation is undeniable. Since AVAX One Technology first announced their AVAX purchasing strategy, investors have shown concern. The stock’s 70% decline reflects market skepticism about their cryptocurrency-focused approach. However, the company maintains that their AVAX investments position them for future growth in the blockchain ecosystem. Key factors behind the stock decline include: Market volatility in cryptocurrency assets Investor uncertainty about crypto-focused strategies Broader market conditions affecting tech stocks Questions about the timing of AVAX acquisitions What does this mean for current shareholders? The AVAX One Technology share buyback offers both challenges and opportunities. Current shareholders might see this as a positive signal that management believes in the company’s underlying value. The reduced share count could potentially increase earnings per share, making remaining shares more valuable. However, investors should consider whether this move addresses fundamental business concerns. While buybacks can provide short-term price support, long-term success depends on the company’s ability to execute its AVAX strategy effectively and generate sustainable profits. Will this AVAX One Technology share buyback strategy work? History shows mixed results for similar corporate actions. The success of the AVAX One Technology share buyback will depend on several factors. Market reception to their continued AVAX investments, overall cryptocurrency market conditions, and the company’s ability to communicate its vision clearly will all play crucial roles. Important considerations for the buyback’s effectiveness: The pace and timing of share repurchases Concurrent business performance updates Broader cryptocurrency market trends Investor confidence in management decisions What’s next for AVAX One Technology? The company faces a critical juncture. Their commitment to both the AVAX strategy and the share buyback demonstrates confidence in their direction. However, they must balance short-term stock stability with long-term strategic goals. The coming quarters will reveal whether this dual approach can restore investor confidence and drive sustainable growth. Market watchers will closely monitor how the AVAX One Technology share buyback progresses and whether it successfully stabilizes the stock price. The company’s ability to navigate cryptocurrency market volatility while executing their buyback program will be crucial for their future trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions What is a share buyback? A share buyback occurs when a company repurchases its own shares from the marketplace, reducing the number of outstanding shares and potentially increasing the value of remaining shares. Why did AVAX One Technology’s stock drop 70%? The stock declined significantly after the company announced its strategy of purchasing AVAX cryptocurrency, which raised concerns among investors about the risks involved. How will the $40 million buyback affect shareholders? Current shareholders might benefit from potential price stabilization and increased earnings per share due to the reduced share count. Is this a good time to invest in AVAX One Technology? Investment decisions should consider your risk tolerance and research. The buyback signals management confidence, but the company still faces challenges in the volatile crypto market. How long will the share buyback take? The company hasn’t specified a timeline, but such programs typically occur over several months or quarters, depending on market conditions. Will this affect AVAX cryptocurrency prices? While AVAX One Technology’s activities might create some market sentiment, individual company actions rarely significantly impact major cryptocurrency prices. Found this analysis helpful?

The recent Etna upgrade has dramatically improved network efficiency, reducing C-Chain fees by a staggering 99.9% . This has made the network more accessible and affordable for developers and users, leading to a massive spike in activity. For over a month straight, the C-Chain has sustained weekly transaction totals above 14.5 million . This technical improvement is fostering a wave of innovation, especially from institutional players. The upgrade allows developers to launch custom subnets at a near-zero cost, accelerating institutional adoption and the creation of specialized blockchain solutions. As Avalanche’s ecosystem becomes faster and cheaper, investors need a powerful, multichain wallet to manage their assets. A new project, in development since 2023 , was built for this exact purpose. GeeFi: Your Command Center for a Multichain World The GeeFi Wallet is a powerful, non-custodial mobile application from the GeeFi Team that puts you in complete control of your digital assets. It was created for the modern crypto investor who operates across multiple blockchains. Public since 2024 , GeeFi provides strong support for major networks including Avalanche, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more , with the team providing continuous updates. The application is an all-in-one crypto hub in your pocket. It features built-in swaps, cross-chain bridging, on/off-ramp services for moving between fiat and crypto, and tools for managing your NFT portfolio. It also includes an integrated Web3 browser and WalletConnect for secure interactions with decentralized applications. The wallet is available right now for Android , with an iOS version currently in development. The GEE Token: Fueling the Self-Custody Ecosystem The engine that drives the GeeFi platform is the GEE token . This is an ERC-20 utility token with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 . Holding GEE provides users with tangible advantages, such as reduced platform fees, access to premium features on the forthcoming GeeFi Card, and staking rewards. The token also incorporates deflationary mechanics , where platform activity causes a portion of tokens to be burned, reducing the total supply over time. The public presale for GEE is currently active, with 400,000,000 tokens available to early supporters. The sale is structured across 10 phases , with the price starting at just $0.05 and set to climb toward a planned launch price of $0.12 . The project saw immediate demand, as over $250,000 was raised in the first 24 hours of its presale launch . Your Final Opportunity Before the Launch This presale offers a limited-time window to get involved before the project gains wider market exposure. When the presale ends, this early-stage pricing will disappear for good. The opportunity is enhanced by a 5% referral bonus paid in GEE for every purchase made through your unique link. As Avalanche’s network activity continues to break records, ensure you have the best tools to manage your entire portfolio securely. Don’t wait until the token will launch to secure your position.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Rockets Toward $19M Raised as Phase 6 Hits 90% Sold Out with 18,200 Investors",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-mutuum-finance-mutm-rockets-toward-19m-raised-as-phase-6-hits-90-sold-out-with-18200-investors/,"As the crypto markets continue to heat up, interested traders are scrambling to lock into the best crypto out there ahead of the next big explosion. Among these cryptos, there is one token that is standing out above the rest, poised to take its place among the top crypto to invest in 2025, and this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance has already raised close to $19 million, but with phase 6 being close to 90% sold out, it appears this momentum is still far from over, attracting over 18,200 investors eager to get on board ahead of final rounds. Mutuum Finance is building a complete DeFi platform to offer lending and borrowing options on this transparent DeFi structure, complete with interest-bearing cryptos and reward-driven liquidity pools to reward early followers. It is this wide range of true DeFi functionality combined with its aggressive presale and strategic roadmap implementation that sets Mutuum Finance apart from other cryptos in the market for immediate traders and crypto followers alike. As this final stretch of its presale approaches, it is becoming apparent that Mutuum Finance is more than just a great buy, it is on track to make this one of the biggest DeFi developments to hit cryptos this year. Why Investors Should Act Now: A Top DeFi Presale Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is indeed one of the most up-and-coming DeFi crypto endeavors that is attracting more and more investor attention. The presale has already raised over $18.82 million and has 18,200 token holders, currently progressing in Phase 6. The present token value during Phase 6 is at $0.035, which is a 250% increase from Phase 1. More than 90% of Phase 6 is filled, making this one of the last opportunities to buy tokens at this rate prior to the start of Phase 7, which will increase the token value to $0.04. The token is predicted to list with a value of $0.06, which could result in a return on investment of at least 500% being realized. This is one of the dynamics that has placed Mutuum Finance among the best crypto investment opportunities within 2025. For those that are seeking to acquire cryptos with a high level of promise, there is no better opportunity available than the Mutuum Finance presale. This is particularly true given that it is one of the last opportunities available during phase 6, making it a top crypto for early investors. MUTM: The Peculiar Case of Solana’s To invest in MUTM at present with a price of $0.035 is similar to investing in Solana during early 2021 at a price point of $1.50. Solana reached an all-time high market value of $256 within that same year, resulting in a mind-boggling 17,100% return on investment. Using this percentage return on MUTM, assuming a 17,100% return on a value of $0.035, MUTM can reach a value of approximately $6.00. A $1,000 investment at present market value can acquire approximately 28,571 units of MUTM, which can appreciate to $171,428 at a value of $6.00, resulting in a net profit of over $170,000. If this event sees fruition, early adopters can experience life-altering gains much like Solana during 2021. Mutuum Finance has raised almost $19 million, onboarded 18,200+ investors, and has sold 90% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035. However, this is about to change because the next phase, Phase 7, is going to increase the price to $0.04, and this is literally one last opportunity to make a purchase prior to the next explosion. Those looking to invest in the best crypto at present can do no better than to buy MUTM immediately prior to its impending explosion. With its growing utility and investor interest, MUTM is clearly the top crypto to consider before Phase 7, solidifying its position as a leading best crypto for early adopters seeking the next DeFi success.

While other assets have faltered, BNB has successfully held the critical $900 support level , showing resilience against broader sell-offs. This stability is now being reinforced by a significant institutional endorsement: BlackRock has integrated BNB as collateral within its massive $13 trillion asset management ecosystem. This combination of price resilience and institutional adoption signals a new phase of maturity for BNB. But it also raises a crucial question for every investor: as major financial players enter the space, is your personal asset security robust enough? This is where a new project, GeeFi , offers an essential solution. The Hidden Risk in an Institutional World The news of major institutions like BlackRock embracing BNB can create a strong sense of market confidence. However, it can also make it easy to forget the most fundamental rule in crypto: not your keys, not your coins . When you keep your BNB on a centralized exchange, you are trusting a third party with your wealth. This exposes you to platform hacks, account freezes, and unexpected system failures. GeeFi was built from the ground up to eliminate this counterparty risk. It is a non-custodial crypto wallet that gives you absolute control over your digital assets. By embracing the mantra of your keys are your crypto , GeeFi empowers you with the financial sovereignty needed to protect your investments and turn market opportunities into real, lasting wealth. A Wallet Engineered for the Modern Investor The GeeFi wallet is more than just a secure vault; it is an advanced tool designed for serious investors. Since starting development in 2023, the GeeFi Team has engineered a wallet packed with features that create a fortress around your funds. This includes multi-factor security that combines biometrics with a unique passphrase for top-tier protection. GeeFi is also designed to solve common crypto frustrations. It uses human-readable addresses and transaction notes to prevent the anxiety of sending funds to the wrong address. The wallet’s built-in risk flags and scam link detection system actively shield you from fraud, allowing you to operate with complete confidence. The Ultimate Command Center for Your Crypto Portfolio The GeeFi wallet offers a single, unified dashboard for your entire crypto empire. It supports BNB, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano, TRON, Sui, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, and many other networks. This cross-chain portfolio view means you no longer need multiple apps to manage your diverse investments. GeeFi is also loaded with intelligent tools to enhance your experience. A gas and fee optimizer saves you money on every transaction, while a pre-trade price impact preview protects you from costly slippage. With configurable auto-backups and social recovery options , the fear of losing access to your fortune is eliminated. The app is live on Android, with an iOS version in development. The GEE Token Presale Is Live Now At the core of this powerful ecosystem is the GeeFi Token (GEE) . This token unlocks the platform’s full potential, offering holders benefits like fee discounts and native staking rewards. The presale’s launch was met with strong demand, raising over a quarter of a million dollars in its first 24 hours and signaling powerful early support. When the token will launch on major exchanges, its price is set at $0.12 . The presale is live now , giving you the chance to invest at a ground-floor price. It is structured in 10 phases , with prices starting at just $0.05 . GeeFi has also created a referral program: share your personal link and you will earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase your friends make. Position Yourself for BNB’s Institutional Future The integration of BNB into BlackRock’s ecosystem is a clear indicator of its growing importance in the global financial landscape. The smartest investors are not just watching this trend; they are using advanced tools to secure their assets. GeeFi provides the security and features needed to build and protect your wealth with confidence. Join the live presale today before this opportunity is gone.

54670608,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=856027,1763668849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54670608.jpeg,"Barstools Founder Just Made A Million-Dollar Investment In XRP, Does He Know Something?",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/barstools-investment-xrp/,"Dave Portnoy has re-entered the digital-asset arena with a seven-figure allocation in XRP that has raised eyebrows across the market. At a time when XRP continues to face downward pressure and muted investor sentiment, the Barstool Sports founder executed a decisive million-dollar purchase. The timing, scale, and narrative surrounding the move have prompted renewed scrutiny of an asset many assumed had exhausted its momentum. Strategic Capital Deployment Amid XRP’s Weak Price Performance Portnoy recently revealed that he acquired $1,000,000 worth of XRP, alongside $750,000 in Bitcoin and $400,000 in Ethereum. He framed his move bluntly, describing the market as “bleeding” and presenting his purchases as a calculated attempt to buy the dip. This timing is questionable because XRP has been struggling to maintain momentum, with the token falling nearly 15% over the past week and oscillating around the $2.13 mark with no clear breakout in sight. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Pump To $110,000 This Week This downward trajectory is particularly notable given the market’s anticipation that the recent Canary XRP ETF launch would trigger a bullish reaction. Instead, prices trended lower, making Portnoy’s re-entry a contrarian move against prevailing sentiment. His announcement generated swift public attention, with Eric Trump commenting “smart trade” under Portnoy’s post. Among XRP enthusiasts, this could be interpreted as more than casual praise—some view it as a subtle hint of potential positive developments for XRP, recalling the Trump family’s history of well-timed investments before major market spikes. Meanwhile, market analyst Barri C has fueled optimism with a bullish projection for XRP, suggesting that the asset could experience a rapid, substantial surge in value sooner than widely expected. When combined with Portnoy’s million-dollar allocation, this positions his trade as a forward-looking strategy aligned with emerging bullish signals and broader positive market commentary. Institutional Momentum May Explain The Timing XRP is seeing a major institutional shift. Bitwise Asset Management recently announced its spot XRP ETF, set to trade soon on the NYSE under ticker XRP, waiving the 0.34% management fee for the first month on the first $500,000,000, making it easier for traditional investors to gain regulated exposure and participate more efficiently. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Crashing Again, Can It Breach $3,000? These developments create a more supportive market environment, positioning the ETF for a potentially strong launch despite short-term weakness in XRP’s price. While the chart shows a pullback, Bitwise emphasizes that XRP’s regulatory positioning, infrastructure upgrades, and broader capital-market integration have accelerated. Portnoy’s $1,000,000 XRP purchase reflects a strategic bet on these emerging market drivers and potential asset re-pricing as institutional flows begin to enter, rather than on current sentiment. In this environment, his decision appears less reactive and more like a calculated move. Whether Portnoy has privileged insight or simply recognizes how institutional adoption reshapes markets, the timing of his allocation signals conviction at a moment when others remain hesitant.

Trading above $103,000 just a few days ago, BTC has deepened its November downtrend. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone stated that the market is structurally weakened, claiming that Bitcoin could experience a “full-blown reversal” and the price could fall to $10,000. McGlone argued that the current structure reminds him of the Great Crash of 2018, when Bitcoin fell from $10,000 to as low as $3,000. McGlone said Bitcoin could fall back to the $10,000 level if the pressure on risk assets continues. The analyst said late-cycle ETF inflows and the deteriorating macro outlook support this bearish scenario. Related News: Bitcoin Advocate Billionaire Ray Dalio Makes Surprising Statements - He Began to Criticize It McGlone noted that volatility indicators also pointed to fragility, noting that the VIX index was trading close to its 200-day average, while the S&P 500's 120-day realized volatility fell to its lowest levels since 2017. The analyst also stated that this Bitcoin sell-off could impact stock markets. He said he expects volatility to rise again, as it did in 2017, stocks to retreat to their averages, and risk appetite to decline further towards the end of the year. According to McGlone, under current conditions, there appears to be no catalyst that can stop the reversal, and “all the dominoes are lined up to the downside.” Looking at technical levels, the analyst noted that $100,000 has now become a strong resistance level, with Bitcoin stuck in the $90,000-$100,000 range. McGlone stated that if this range is broken, the price could fall to $50,000, and that this level could be considered “normal” on annual charts. However, he reminded that in the short term, intermediate increases within sharp declines can be misleading, as “the strongest rallies are seen in bear markets.” *This is not investment advice.

This means that the cryptocurrency has neared a main support line according to numerous analysts, but the more worrisome part is the behavior of some whales. Data shared by Arkham shows that Owen Gunden, a well-known Bitcoin OG who has held the asset for 14 years, has been on a massive selling spree lately. More precisely, the entity has disposed of 11,000 BTC since October, a stash that is worth $1.3 billion. The latest transaction on this front came earlier today when Arkham detected a substantial transfer of $230 million worth of the cryptocurrency to Kraken. OWEN GUNDEN HAS NOW SOLD ALL OF HIS $1.3 BILLION BITCOIN Owen Gunden was an OG Bitcoin whale who held BTC since 2011. Since late October he has sold 11K BTC worth $1.3 billion. He has just transferred $230M of BTC to Kraken, marking his final sale. pic.twitter.com/m0gQWCHrxZ — Arkham (@arkham) November 20, 2025 This behaviour is quite different from that of other whales who have been accumulating during the most recent broader crash, according to some reports, which pushed the asset from over $107,000 to $86,000 in the span of less than 10 days. With bitcoin dropping to $86,000 minutes ago, analysts now discuss the next major support lines that can halt the freefall. CW outlined a significant whales’ buying wall at $85,000, which could be the first line of defense. The Wolf Of All Streets believes BTC’s situation could turn “truly disgusting” if it heads to the 200 MA situated at $55,000. With its latest decline, BTC has liquidated over $410 million of longs in the past 24 hours, while the total value of wrecked positions across the entire market stands close to $900 million. Data from CoinGlass shows that the largest liquidation order occurred on HTX and was worth over $30 million.

Analyst Weighs In Amid ETF Launches",https://timestabloid.com/can-xrp-hit-1000-analyst-weighs-in-amid-etf-launches/,"The idea that XRP could one day trade at $1,000 may sound far‑fetched . But recent developments and bullish commentary have reignited serious discussion in the crypto community. Among the most provocative voices is analyst‑creator Skipper. His recent clip on his X handle argues that under certain conditions XRP could reach that lofty figure—though with the strong caveat: “this is purely speculative, so do not take this as gospel.” The ETF Catalyzer: Institutional Access Arrives Skipper’s thesis centers around the imminent launch of multiple spot‑XRP exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. market. Recent reporting confirms that a series of ETF issuers—including Bitwise Asset Management—filed Form 8‑A amendments and are scheduled to go live around 20 November 2025. How fast could XRP reach $1000? With #XRP ETFs potentially launching in the next 7 days, its price is expected to increase. pic.twitter.com/0xgRbCGduq — Skipper | XRPL (@skipper_xrp) November 20, 2025 These vehicles provide regulated access to XRP for institutions and retail alike. One report estimates the first wave could draw $4 billion – $8 billion in year‑one inflows . This aligns with Skipper’s framing: “There are a lot of analysts out there talking about it, there are a lot of reasons that it can happen.” Tokenomics, Supply and Demand Dynamics For XRP to approach $1,000, Skipper emphasizes a three‑fold scenario: inflows via ETFs, restricted circulating supply, and broader utility adoption. ETF seed purchases tighten available supply, while institutional accumulation could transform the token from speculative altcoin to mainstream asset. Historical patterns in crypto (e.g., Bitcoin’s ETF‑driven rallies) reinforce the idea that infrastructure launch does not guarantee immediate parabolic price moves—but can provide a structural runway. Timeline: When Could We See It? Skipper provides time‑based scenarios. He speaks of “projected timelines” for serious price movement once ETF access opens. With ETF launches kicking off mid‑November 2025, the earliest meaningful institutional conversion may unfold across late 2025 into 2026. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Yet reaching $1,000 would likely require a sustained multi‑year cycle, not an overnight jump. It depends on cumulative capital, ecosystem expansion, and macro‑tailwinds aligning sequentially. Risks and Headwinds: Why $1,000 Is No Guarantee Despite the bullish thesis, key hurdles remain. ETF launches do not guarantee immediate inflows nor push the token price singularly to the moon. Analysts caution XRP holders to treat the launch as an important infrastructure milestone, instead of an automatic price catalyst . Further, the macro environment, regulatory shifts, and utility adoption will all play critical roles. Skipper himself emphasized: “This is purely speculative.” In sum, Skipper presents the $1,000 XRP scenario as a possibility rather than a prediction. The launch of spot‑XRP ETFs introduces new institutional pathways and could pivot the token into a higher adoption regime. Nevertheless, for XRP to reach $1,000, a rare alignment of demand, scarcity, and utility is required—and time is likely the most crucial variable.

The agency’s Hyderabad Zonal Office has attached ₹8.46 crore held across 92 bank accounts, including financial balances connected to CoinDCX and a selection of crypto wallets. Officials report that the case is tied to a broader scheme involving fake mobile apps, fraudulent e-commerce platforms, and misleading investment programs that allegedly collected ₹285 crore from victims across multiple states. Fraud network built around fake job and investment apps The case was initiated after Kadapa Police filed several First Information Reports in pursuance of Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66-C and 66-D of the Information Technology Act. As the ED continued with the investigation, investigators discovered that other areas had also complained of the same issue, indicating that a well-organized operation was behind a series of applications, including the NBC App, Power Bank App, HPZ Token, RCC App, and other task-based earning tools. According to the findings , scammers turned to WhatsApp and Telegram channels, where they recruited people, promising them commissions within a short time. Their approach included directing users to links that pretended to be legitimate service sites, where participants were given the task of undertaking simulated purchasing and selling of goods on the fabricated e-commerce websites. Users were directed to transfer money into digital wallets associated with the apps before engaging in any activity, typically by transferring using a UPI linked to bank accounts and virtual payment addresses created by shell entities. Victims routed into larger deposit cycles before losing access According to investigators, the attackers initially used bank accounts to deposit small amounts of money, thereby gaining the trust of the victims. This trend motivated more targets to deposit more. As soon as the deposits swelled, withdrawals started to fail. Victims were then informed by communications teams working through messaging apps that they would need extra fees or taxes. Even after making those payments, users were unable to withdraw any funds. Following that, websites became inaccessible, in-app balances disappeared, customer support channels were removed, and user accounts were deactivated. Some victims were also encouraged to recruit new participants under the promise of higher referral commissions, which would enable the fraud network to expand further. The ED’s money-trail analysis shows that ₹285 crore in fraud proceeds circulated through more than 30 primary-layer bank accounts, each operational for short periods ranging from one to fifteen days. These accounts transferred funds to more than 80 secondary accounts to prevent early detection or freezing by banks. ED, Hyderabad Zonal Office, has provisionally attached bank balances amounting to Rs. 8.46 Crore spread across 92 bank accounts, including that of CoinDCX and a few crypto wallets, under PMLA, 2002 in connection with an ongoing investigation in large-scale cyber fraud committed… pic.twitter.com/6jaDzkbkub — ED (@dir_ed) November 20, 2025 According to the investigators, the fraud network actively utilized the Binance peer-to-peer marketplace to purchase USDT (Tether). These acquisitions were made using third-party payments based on illicit deposits. The ED observed that sellers on WazirX, Buyhatke, and CoinDCX had acquired USDT at low prices and sold it on Binance P2P at a high price, with payments pegged to the proceeds of the crime. A part, ₹4.81 crore, was allegedly exchanged into USDT using CoinDCX on non-KYC compliant accounts and transfers without verification by third parties.

Ethereum's 13% decline to $3,000 in the last week and Solana's 9% loss to $139 in the same period have created deep pressure on the altcoin market. The picture is no different for publicly traded companies: Strategy shares fell 16% on a weekly basis, while Circle fell 20%. This sharp decline follows a period in which the cryptocurrency sector entered 2025 with high expectations. US President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly approach had supported markets for much of the year, allowing Bitcoin to outperform the S&P 500. However, since October 6th, the situation has reversed: Bitcoin has fallen approximately 31% from its peak of $126,000, while the S&P 500 has gained 3% in the same period. Analysts attribute this decline to the major crash in October, the Federal Reserve's cautious stance, and investors' shift away from risky assets. Related News: Trader Who Had Been Holding This Altcoin Since 2021 Finally Sold: Suffered Heavy Losses CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill stated that the primary cause of market uncertainty is a lack of data, saying, “Markets are flying blind right now. The lack of macro data has triggered widespread risk asset selling. The rapid downgrade of interest rate cut expectations in December has further intensified this selling pressure.” Crypto's recent decline began on October 10th with the largest wave of liquidations in history, according to CoinGlass data. This movement, coupled with Trump's threat of new tariffs against China, quickly eroded market risk appetite. Macroeconomic developments, which have increasingly weakened expectations for a Fed rate cut, have further perpetuated this decline. Despite this, some experts remain optimistic. K33 Research President Vetle Lunde, in a report published today, noted that institutional adoption has increased significantly this year, stating, “We anticipate a brighter period ahead due to the acceleration of institutional inflows coupled with expansionary monetary policies.” Lunde stated that he expects Bitcoin to bottom in the $84,000-$86,000 range. Recalling that in past declines, pullback periods have exceeded 50 days, the analyst noted that the current period is only 43 days old, arguing that there is time for a recovery. *This is not investment advice.

Why This December Rate Cut Matters Now The timing of this December rate cut recommendation couldn’t be more critical. According to Walter Bloomberg’s reporting, Hassett believes current economic data strongly supports immediate action. This bold stance comes as the Federal Reserve faces mounting pressure to address economic concerns while balancing inflation control. Market analysts are closely watching this development because a December rate cut could signal several important shifts: Potential economic softening that requires intervention Changing inflation dynamics that allow for monetary easing Coordinated economic policy between the White House and Fed What Data Supports the December Rate Cut? Hassett’s call for a December rate cut isn’t made in isolation. The National Economic Council Director specifically cited compelling data that suggests such action is necessary. While the exact metrics weren’t detailed in the initial report, economic observers point to several key indicators that might be influencing this position. The push for a December rate cut reflects growing concerns about economic momentum heading into the new year. However, the Federal Reserve maintains its independence in these decisions, creating an interesting dynamic between executive branch recommendations and central bank autonomy. How Markets Might React to Potential Rate Action Financial markets typically respond strongly to interest rate signals, and a potential December rate cut would likely trigger significant movements across multiple asset classes. Historical patterns suggest several possible outcomes that investors should consider. The call for a December rate cut comes at a delicate moment for global economies. Many central banks worldwide are reevaluating their monetary policy stances amid changing economic conditions. This makes Hassett’s recommendation particularly noteworthy for international observers. What’s Next for Federal Reserve Policy? The Federal Reserve’s response to this December rate cut recommendation will be closely scrutinized. While White House input carries weight, the Fed’s decision-making process remains independent and data-driven. The coming weeks will reveal whether economic conditions truly warrant such action. This potential December rate cut represents more than just monetary policy—it signals how economic leadership views current challenges and opportunities. The decision could set the tone for economic policy throughout the coming year. FAQs: Understanding the December Rate Cut Proposal Why is the White House calling for a December rate cut? The National Economic Council Director believes current economic data supports monetary easing to address potential economic headwinds and support growth. How likely is the Fed to implement a December rate cut? While the recommendation carries weight, the Federal Reserve maintains independence and will make decisions based on comprehensive economic data analysis. What economic indicators might justify a December rate cut? Key indicators could include slowing growth metrics, changing inflation patterns, employment data, and global economic conditions that suggest supportive monetary policy is needed. How would a December rate cut affect consumers? Consumers could see lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, potentially stimulating economic activity through increased spending. What’s the historical precedent for December rate changes? The Fed has made December rate adjustments before, particularly during periods of economic transition or when facing unexpected economic developments. How do markets typically react to rate cut announcements? Markets often respond positively to rate cuts initially, though sustained effects depend on the underlying economic reasons for the policy change. Found this analysis insightful?

ETH Hits $2.8K Realized Price as Whales Accumulate,https://cryptopotato.com/classic-bottom-eth-hits-2-8k-realized-price-as-whales-accumulate/,"Ethereum (ETH) briefly touched a critical low of $2,870 on Wednesday, testing a vital on-chain support level that has historically signaled market bottoms. According to an on-chain assessment by analyst MAC_D, this price point represents a cluster of the ‘realized price’ for both retail and large-scale investors, suggesting a potential foundation for a rebound is forming even as smaller wallets sell off. $2.8K Realized Price Cluster Marks “Classic Bottom” Zone In their latest report on CryptoQuant, MAC_D noted that, historically, such realized price zones have often marked major bottom areas, as long-term investors step in while short-term traders exit. The market technician pointed out that the latest drop below $2,900, driven by risk-off sentiment before Nvidia’s earnings report, was followed by a swift rebound after the chipmaker beat expectations, lifting both U.S. equities and crypto. At the same time, there is a clear split in behavior, with smaller wallets selling into weakness, while whale wallets holding over 10,000 ETH have kept accumulating as prices go lower. According to the expert, that shift in supply from impatient traders to larger, long-term players is also typically seen during late-stage bottom formation. In addition, liquidation data also points to fading forced-selling pressure. MAC_D highlighted that each fresh local low now comes with a much smaller wave of long liquidations, suggesting over-leveraged bulls may have already been flushed out. Meanwhile, short positioning has grown, meaning even a modest bounce could squeeze bears in what remains a relatively thin order-book environment. High Leverage and Key Liquidity Zones At the market, Ethereum’s performance has been challenging. While its current value of around $3,020 per CoinGecko represents a slight 1% dip in the last 24 hours, it is down almost 15% over the past week and an even more dire 22% across the last month. At the same time, the asset’s estimated leverage ratio (ELR) on Binance recently hit a record 0.5617 as the price drifted in a tight band around $3,000. And with both long and short traders piling in while spot remains relatively flat, experts at Arab Chain warned that the market is “building internal pressure” and is increasingly prone to a violent break in either direction. Observers are also watching nearby liquidity pockets as potential magnets for the next move. Analyst Crypto Patel noted on November 19 that Ethereum had confirmed a “Break of Structure” at $2,940, but identified a zone of price inefficiency, known as a “Fair Value Gap,” between $3,270 and $3,360. They estimated that a move to fill this gap would require a 14 to 15% increase from current levels. The post Classic Bottom?

According to a report published by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management, Nomura Asset Management, SBI Global Asset Management, Daiwa Asset Management, Asemane One, and Amova Asset Management have officially confirmed their interest in crypto investment funds. Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management is part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, one of the world's largest financial institutions. With approximately $2.7 trillion in total assets, the group has long been working on blockchain projects and stablecoin infrastructures. Interoperability platforms for stablecoins, in particular, have been among the company's priorities in recent years. Nomura, Japan's largest asset and wealth management company, claims to manage 153 trillion yen in client assets and hold a 15% share of the domestic market. Related News: Bitcoin Advocate Billionaire Ray Dalio Makes Surprising Statements - He Began to Criticize It Another major company, Daiwa Asset Management, was managing approximately $213 billion in assets as of March 2024. All six companies reportedly want to offer crypto investment funds to both individual and institutional investors. Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is also reportedly open to this new wave. Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported, “The FSA is considering the approval of investment trusts that include cryptocurrencies. This could further accelerate Japanese investors' shift toward crypto.” Japan has long been cautious about cryptocurrency following major exchange hacks like Mt. Gox and Coincheck. However, the rapidly changing regulatory landscape in the US and Europe is reshaping Tokyo's approach. The European Union's comprehensive crypto regulation, MiCA, which comes into effect in 2025, and the crypto-friendly stance of US President Donald Trump's administration have shifted expectations in the Japanese financial sector. Coin Post writer K. Kobayashi stated that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has created great anticipation among Japanese investors, saying, “Many Japanese are now looking forward to the establishment of cryptocurrency investment trusts.” *This is not investment advice.

This story began, according to Bloomberg, with a private dinner high above New York’s financial district where Intercontinental Exchange CEO Jeffrey Sprecher met Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan. Jeffrey arrived in a suit. Shayne walked in wearing a T‑shirt, holding a disposable water bottle and a bakery bag. Jeffrey had never used the crypto-powered prediction market because it was closed to U.S. users at the time, but Shayne explained the vision of letting people bet on politics, sports, culture, and anything else. Jeffrey said, “In 20 minutes, I realized they were onto something,” and added, “What they had designed was very profound.” ICE later committed up to $2 billion, one of several large prediction‑market deals announced in recent months. The spike in deals pushed these platforms into the center of a debate over event contracts, which allow wagers on outcomes in real-world events. Investors and traders are betting these contracts can run around old gambling rules and operate as financial instruments. That debate played out in Chicago during a major derivatives gathering where Tarek Mansour, the CEO of Kalshi, said prediction markets could grow into a “trillion‑dollar” industry. As these claims spread, major exchanges, gambling firms, crypto companies, venture funds, pro sports leagues, and even President Donald Trump’s family business started trying to secure their own deals inside this legal gray zone. Competing for sports leagues and investors Shayne and Tarek pushed their companies into a direct fight when both tried to secure a partnership with the National Hockey League, which explored becoming the first U.S. sports league to work with prediction platforms. Bloomberg claimed that both companies paid to lock in the arrangement. The recent agreements have pushed Kalshi to offers that value the company at more than $10 billion, far above its $2 billion valuation in June. Polymarket is raising funds too and now targets a valuation above $12 billion, more than 10 times its worth months earlier. Before ICE backed Polymarket, there were informal conversations between ICE and Kalshi, but nothing came from them. At the same time, critics are raising alarms about the scale of betting. Law professor Melinda Roth said, “This is a mess for so many reasons,” warning that people may gamble money they cannot afford to lose. State gaming agencies and Native American tribes are filing legal challenges, saying these platforms are moving over rules designed to keep players safe. Two state regulators, who asked that their names not be used, said they worry prediction markets could expand so fast that oversight becomes impossible. Investor Chris Grove said, “If there’s enough institutional support and political support, everyone has just sort of spoken about the way they want the world to be.” Sports apps, Trump’s involvement and new marketing deals Trading volume on prediction markets remains small compared to traditional exchanges, but big players want in. CME Group CEO Terry Duffy visited Flutter Entertainment’s New York office early in the year to pitch a partnership. Terry said, “I had been watching the retail revolution for years and was particularly interested in its evolution into sports.” That talk led to a partnership and the upcoming FanDuel Predicts app. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins questioned at a recent event whether event contracts can beat normal sports betting, but DraftKings still bought a regulated venue called Railbird to offer its own contracts. Penn Entertainment CEO Jay Snowden called prediction markets a “major threat to the industry” and said, “We’ve got to play some offense here.” Tensions grew earlier in the year when Kalshi started offering sports contracts soon after winning a case that allowed election‑related trading. Some regulators said sports contracts broke state gambling rules. Kalshi argued its products were financial instruments regulated by the CFTC, not subject to state gambling laws. The CFTC has not stepped in. Meanwhile, the Trump family moved deeper into the space. Donald Trump Jr. became an adviser to both Polymarket and Kalshi, and Trump Media negotiated with Crypto.com to launch Truth Predict, a deal shaped by CEO Devin Nunes. Polymarket had its own hurdles. It had been blocked from serving U.S. users since a 2022 settlement, but regulators ended their investigations in July. To enter the U.S. legally, the company bought QCX, a small derivatives venue, for $112 million. Both Polymarket and Kalshi are building marketing deals.PrizePicks will distribute their contracts. Polymarket is working with UFC to show fan predictions on broadcasts. Tarek said more sports deals and major news partnerships are coming. A Nevada judge recently questioned Kalshi’s sports contracts, and academics pointed to “artificial trading” on Polymarket. Cboe launched its own prediction‑market platform but said it will avoid sports. Leagues are cautious, especially after new Justice Department actions, but the NHL became the first major league to partner with both companies. To celebrate the UFC deal, Shayne joined Jeffrey on the New York Stock Exchange floor to ring the opening bell. Get seen where it counts.

This development signals potentially transformative changes ahead for how the United States regulates the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Who is Michael Selig and Why Does This CFTC Commissioner Nominee Matter? The U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture has officially approved Michael Selig as the newest CFTC commissioner nominee. This crucial step means his nomination now moves to the full Senate for final confirmation. Currently serving as senior legal counsel for the SEC’s crypto task force, Selig brings substantial regulatory experience to the table. During his confirmation hearing, Selig made his priorities crystal clear: cryptocurrency regulation would be a key focus if confirmed. This CFTC commissioner nominee understands the complex intersection of traditional finance and emerging digital assets. His background positions him uniquely to address the regulatory challenges facing the crypto industry. What Changes Could This CFTC Commissioner Nominee Bring? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plays a vital role in overseeing derivatives markets, including cryptocurrency futures and swaps. With Selig as CFTC commissioner nominee, we might see several important developments: Clearer regulatory frameworks for crypto derivatives Enhanced consumer protection measures Improved coordination between CFTC and SEC Streamlined compliance requirements for crypto businesses This CFTC commissioner nominee could help bridge the gap between innovation and regulation. His experience with the SEC’s crypto task force provides valuable insight into both securities and commodities regulation. How Will This Affect Crypto Markets and Investors? Market participants should pay close attention to this CFTC commissioner nominee’s progression. Regulatory clarity often translates to market stability and increased institutional participation. Selig’s confirmation could signal: More predictable enforcement actions Better-defined jurisdictional boundaries Increased confidence among traditional investors Stronger safeguards against market manipulation The timing of this CFTC commissioner nominee advancement comes as crypto markets mature and demand coherent regulatory guidance. Selig’s background suggests he understands the need for balanced approaches that protect consumers while fostering innovation. What’s Next for This CFTC Commissioner Nominee? The full Senate vote represents the final step for this CFTC commissioner nominee. Industry observers expect relatively smooth confirmation given Selig’s qualifications and bipartisan support for sensible crypto regulation. However, the timeline remains uncertain as Senate schedules can be unpredictable. Once confirmed, this CFTC commissioner nominee will join four other commissioners in making critical decisions about: Cryptocurrency derivatives products Exchange oversight and regulation Enforcement actions against bad actors International regulatory coordination Conclusion: A Significant Step Forward for Crypto Regulation The advancement of Michael Selig as CFTC commissioner nominee marks a crucial moment for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. His expertise and stated commitment to addressing digital asset challenges position him as a potentially influential voice in shaping America’s approach to crypto markets. As the full Senate considers his confirmation, the industry watches closely, recognizing that thoughtful regulation could unlock the next phase of cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Frequently Asked Questions What is the CFTC’s role in cryptocurrency regulation? The CFTC regulates commodity futures and options markets, including cryptocurrency derivatives like Bitcoin futures and swaps. They oversee exchanges and monitor for market manipulation. How does Selig’s SEC experience help him as CFTC commissioner? His work with the SEC’s crypto task force gives him valuable perspective on both securities and commodities regulation, helping bridge jurisdictional gaps in crypto oversight. When will the full Senate vote on this nomination? There’s no fixed timeline, but nominations typically move to Senate floor votes within weeks or months after committee approval, depending on the legislative calendar. What specific crypto issues might Selig focus on? Based on his statements, he’ll likely prioritize clear derivatives rules, consumer protection, and coordination with other regulators like the SEC. How could this affect everyday crypto investors? Better regulation often means more market stability, reduced fraud risk, and increased institutional participation that can benefit all market participants. What happens if Selig isn’t confirmed? The nomination would fail, and the administration would need to propose a new CFTC commissioner nominee, potentially delaying regulatory progress. Found this analysis helpful?

Sica described Bitcoin as “having a pet tiger,” saying investors should be more aware of the high risk. Speaking about Bitcoin, which has fallen to levels between $86,000 and $87,000, Sica noted that recent price movements have caught many investors off guard. He noted that Bitcoin has been performing strongly for a long time, but now some of that has been reversed. Related News: When Will Bitcoin (BTC) Price Recover? Expert Explains Both the Reason for the Decline and When a Silver Lining Might Be Seen Sica noted that Bitcoin has recently shown a high correlation with the NASDAQ. He argued that when the NASDAQ falls, Bitcoin also falls, but when the index rises, Bitcoin fails to recover to the same extent. He said this generally indicates that the market is nearing its bottom. Sica noted that institutional investors' entry into Bitcoin through ETFs and leveraged transactions has exacerbated this volatility, advising against panicking. However, he emphasized that he wasn't recommending buying for everyone, adding that only investors with a high risk tolerance should consider these levels. Stating that Bitcoin will continue to exist in the long term, the analyst reminded that its market value has almost caught up with gold and said, “Bitcoin is here to stay.” *This is not investment advice.

Yet with fresh bearish pressure triggered by a sharp Tenkan-sen cross, the market now faces a defining moment: rebound or extended grind? A Critical Turning Point For Dogecoin DOGECAPITAL, in a recent analysis, highlighted that Dogecoin has slipped into the lower 5% of its long-term trading channel. Each time price has entered this zone in the past, it has preceded powerful rallies following periods of consolidation. That history raises an important question: Is Dogecoin once again preparing for a major cyclical rebound? Related Reading: Dogecoin Cup And Handle Pattern Is Returning, What Happens To Price If It’s Completed? According to the analyst, one possible outcome is that Dogecoin stabilizes within this lower channel zone and uses it as a launchpad for another significant rally. This setup has occurred across multiple market cycles and remains a strong possibility if support continues to hold. Another scenario is that Dogecoin maintains a slow, sideways “crabwalk” along the bottom of the channel. The meme coin may not experience a blow-off top this cycle but instead transition into a gradual, long-term uptrend. Such a pattern would allow Dogecoin to climb without creating new cycle lows. The analysis also notes that broader market conditions could heavily influence Dogecoin’s direction. Should Bitcoin break into a new all-time high from current levels, it would signal that the entire market cycle is extending. An extended cycle would likely boost Dogecoin’s trajectory as well, increasing the probability of a meaningful trend shift. Overall, the long-term channel dynamics combined with macro market signals suggest that Dogecoin is approaching a pivotal moment. Whether it sparks a historic rally or opts for a slower climb, its position within this critical zone is setting the stage for a major move. Bearish Tenkan-sen Cross Sparks Sharp Dogecoin Sell-Off According to a recent update shared by Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin has just experienced a sharp downturn triggered by a Price-to-Tenkan-sen bearish cross. This key Ichimoku signal marked the start of an aggressive sell-off wave, catching many traders off guard.

Ripple Transfers 200 Million XRP To Unknown Destination New reports from a popular blockchain monitoring system, Whale Alert has revealed that 200 million XRP, valued at approximately $445 million was recently moved from a wallet associated with Ripple. The large-scale transaction immediately caught the attention of the market, given both its size and origin, as Ripple Labs remains the largest single holder of XRP , controlling roughly 42% of its total supply. Notably, the transaction occurred on November 18, 2025, at 16:22:00 UTC and was sent from a Ripple-linked wallet address to an unknown destination. The transfer itself was inexpensive, incurring a minimal fee of just 0.00004 XRP. The movement also took place while XRP was still trading at approximately $2.22 per token. Considering Ripple’s influence on the altcoin , any significant outbound transfer tends to spark immediate reactions from its community about intent. Some market participants interpreted the transaction as a potential precursor of a sell-off, suggesting that it may be time to exit positions . However, other observers note that large wallets often redistribute holdings ahead of expected volatility , emphasizing that such internal rotations do not necessarily correlate with selling pressure. They argue that broader accumulation trends provide a more accurate picture than reactions to an isolated transfer. In addition, another commentator emphasized that Ripple has a long history of making large-scale movements for more treasury management , liquidity operations, or over-the-counter transactions—none of which translate directly into immediate market dumps. Whales Quietly Accumulate Billions While Ripple’s 200 million XRP transfer has ignited speculation, new data from Santiment has highlighted a significant uptick in whale activity. According to on-chain data, large holders have acquired more than $2.36 billion worth of XRP within a single week, pushing their combined balance to 9.74 billion XRP. This marks one of the strongest accumulations recorded recently, suggesting that whales may be positioning for the long-term rather than selling off. The increase in whale holdings comes at a time where the market is experiencing a notable downtrend. If these movements were distribution rather than accumulation, they could put additional pressure on the already weak price action . However, as more whales continue to buy XRP at lower price levels, it could provide underlying support for the cryptocurrency, potentially stabilizing the market.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 21:00:46

The driving force behind this concerning prediction? Mining profitability has plummeted to its lowest point in ten years, creating what experts call a perfect storm for market turmoil. Why Is Bitcoin Price Collapse Now Inevitable? Jacob King reveals shocking numbers that paint a grim picture. The current cost to mine one Bitcoin stands at $112,000, while the asset trades at only $86,000. This significant gap creates unsustainable pressure on mining operations worldwide. Miners now operate at a substantial loss, which historically precedes major market corrections. The situation grows more critical daily. As mining becomes unprofitable, operations must make difficult decisions. Many smaller mining companies already face bankruptcy, while larger operations consider scaling back. This creates a domino effect that could trigger the feared Bitcoin price collapse. How Mining Profitability Impacts Bitcoin’s Future Understanding the mining profitability crisis requires knowing how Bitcoin’s ecosystem functions. Miners provide essential security and transaction processing services. When they operate at a loss, the entire network’s stability comes into question. Key factors driving the current crisis include: Rising energy costs worldwide Increased mining difficulty adjustments Older mining equipment becoming obsolete Regulatory pressures in key mining regions These elements combine to create the worst mining environment in a decade. King emphasizes that without immediate price recovery, the Bitcoin price collapse becomes unavoidable. What Chain Reaction Could Follow Mining Shutdowns? The potential consequences extend far beyond mining operations. When miners cease operations, several critical network effects occur simultaneously. Transaction processing slows, network security weakens, and selling pressure increases as miners liquidate holdings to cover costs. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of decline. As more miners shut down, network security decreases, reducing investor confidence. Lower confidence leads to more selling, further depressing prices and accelerating the Bitcoin price collapse prediction. Can Anything Prevent the Bitcoin Price Collapse? While the situation appears dire, potential solutions exist. The market could see several developments that might avert the worst-case scenario: Major price recovery above mining costs Technological breakthroughs in mining efficiency Institutional intervention to support the market Regulatory changes reducing operational costs However, time is critical. King stresses that without rapid improvement, the Bitcoin price collapse could occur within months rather than years. What Should Investors Do Now? Facing this potential Bitcoin price collapse, investors need strategic approaches. Diversification becomes crucial, as does understanding market fundamentals. Monitoring mining profitability metrics provides early warning signs of market direction. Consider these protective measures: Reduce exposure to mining-dependent cryptocurrencies Increase cash positions for buying opportunities Monitor network hash rate changes closely Set strict stop-loss orders on existing positions The current warning about Bitcoin price collapse serves as a crucial reminder that cryptocurrency investing requires constant vigilance and understanding of underlying market mechanics. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly causes mining to become unprofitable? Mining becomes unprofitable when electricity, equipment, and operational costs exceed the value of mined Bitcoin. Currently, mining costs exceed Bitcoin’s market price by $26,000 per coin. How quickly could a Bitcoin price collapse happen? According to King’s analysis, significant price deterioration could occur within 3-6 months if mining conditions don’t improve and current trends continue. Have we seen similar situations before? Yes, mining profitability crises occurred in 2018 and 2022, both preceding significant price corrections. However, the current gap between costs and price is historically unprecedented. Could this actually strengthen Bitcoin long-term? Potentially. Mining crises often eliminate inefficient operations, leaving stronger, more efficient miners. This could lead to a healthier ecosystem long-term, though short-term pain seems inevitable. What indicators should I watch most closely? Monitor network hash rate, mining difficulty adjustments, miner revenue metrics, and large exchange outflows from mining pools for early warning signs. Are alternative cryptocurrencies affected similarly? Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies face similar challenges, while proof-of-stake networks remain unaffected by mining profitability issues.

On one hand, it has launched USDsui, a regulated stablecoin , aiming to bridge the gap between real-world payments and decentralized finance.

54674469,631530,1763676024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54674469.jpeg,From Big To Bigger: Abu Dhabi Investment Council Triples Bitcoin ETF Exposure,https://bitcoinist.com/from-big-to-bigger-abu-dhabi-investment-council-triples-bitcoin-etf-exposure/,"Abu Dhabi Investment Council nearly tripled its holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust during the third quarter, growing from about 2.4 million shares to nearly 8 million by September 30. The position was valued at roughly $518 million at quarter end. Big Buy Ahead Of A Price Peak According to market reports , that build-up happened just before Bitcoin hit new highs in early October, when prices crossed the $125,000 mark. The timing left the fund with a much larger exposure to Bitcoin-linked ETFs right as investor sentiment became far more volatile. A sovereign fund increasing an ETF position by this scale sends a clear message about how some big public investors now see crypto: as an asset class worth holding. That does not mean the bet is risk-free. ETF shares can be redeemed, market swings can be sharp, and paper gains can evaporate quickly when prices reverse. Reports indicate ADIC treated the ETF as a long-term store of value , but short-term price action has already tested that view. JUST IN: UAE state fund triples its stake in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) November 19, 2025 Record Withdrawals Hit The Fund Spot ETFs then faced heavy redemptions in November. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a record single-day outflow of about $523 million, marking the largest one-day withdrawal since the ETF launched in January 2024. The outflow was part of a run of redemptions that month and signaled growing caution among some holders. Those redemptions came as bitcoin slid from its October highs. The pullback has left some big buyers holding positions that look less favorable on paper. Some analysts argue these moves—both buying and selling at scale—are part of a normal allocation cycle for institutional investors. Others warn rapid inflows and outflows can magnify price swings for everyone in the market. Signals For Other Investors According to the coverage, ADIC’s increase shows that parts of the global investing community are prepared to use regulated US ETFs to gain bitcoin exposure. That preference for regulated vehicles can increase the pool of buyers in good times, while also creating new pressure points when sentiment shifts and large redemptions occur. A big public fund made a bold move into bitcoin via a major US ETF and did so just before the market cooled. The trade highlights both the growing mainstream interest in crypto and the risks that come with fast moves in and out of large ETF positions. In the meantime, the facts are straightforward: holdings spiked to nearly 8 million IBIT shares worth about $518 million at quarter end, and the ETF later saw a record $523 million single-day outflow as prices fell from early October highs.

Despite this momentum, XRP still sits far below Bitcoin, the industry’s dominant cryptocurrency, when comparing total valuation. That gap raises a simple question: how high would the XRP price need to climb in order to actually flip Bitcoin? Data from MarketCapOf provides a direct, real-time look at what XRP’s price would be if it matched Bitcoin’s market capitalization today. The Market Cap Required To Flip Bitcoin Although it is currently going through a correction phase, Bitcoin has the largest presence in the crypto market by an overwhelming margin, and its market capitalization currently stands at roughly $1.84 trillion. This valuation ranks Bitcoin among the largest assets on the planet, surpassing many global corporations. Related Reading: Is It Time To Buy XRP? Analyst Says Get In Before This Switch Happens XRP, now trading around $2.14 at the time of writing, holds a market cap of approximately $128.7 billion. This means Bitcoin’s valuation is more than fourteen times larger than XRP’s. For XRP to flip Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency would need to rise to the same market capitalization that Bitcoin currently holds. Using the circulating supply of XRP, MarketCapOf calculates how much each XRP token would be worth if it matched Bitcoin’s market cap. Based on the latest data, XRP would need to trade at $30.61 for its total valuation to equal Bitcoin’s. This is the current “flippening price,” and it reflects the direct ratio between their two market caps. To reach the level of Bitcoin’s all-time high market cap of $2.485 trillion recorded on October 6, XRP would need to climb to about $41.26 per token. Breaking Down The Numbers The calculation highlights how far ahead Bitcoin still is. XRP sits at roughly seven percent of Bitcoin’s total valuation, meaning the asset would need to appreciate more than fourteen times from its current level to stand on equal footing. In simple terms, an investor holding 1,000 XRP would see their position shift from about $2,140 today to more than $30,000 if the token were priced at $30.61. Related Reading: Wondering Why The XRP Price Is Still Lagging Despite Record ETF Launch? Read This This comparison does not assume any change in circulating supply, tokenomics, or macro factors. It is a clean and direct valuation exercise based purely on market capitalization. However, even in its simplicity, it shows the scale of inflows required for XRP to close the gap and flip Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency rankings. Recent months have seen stronger activity in the Ripple ecosystem, most especially with new partnerships and acquisitions by Ripple. Added to this is the expanding conversation around Spot XRP ETFs, which many analysts believe could introduce significant liquidity if major issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale fully enter the space. The newest entrant is Bitwise, which launched its Spot XRP ETF just hours ago.
