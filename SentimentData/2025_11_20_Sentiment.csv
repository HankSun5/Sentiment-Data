The crypto market is showing clear signs of stress, and new data from CryptoQuant confirms that Bitcoin is now moving into one of the most severe short-term capitulation phases of this cycle. According to the latest on-chain metrics, short-term holders (STHs) are realizing losses at a scale typically seen only near major market turning points. Related Reading: XRP Supply In Profit Falls to 58.5% – Lowest Since 2024 Despite Higher Price The key indicator driving this analysis is STH-SOPR, which has plunged to deeply depressed readings around 0.97. This means STHs are selling coins at a clear loss, often driven by fear rather than strategy. Even more importantly, this metric has spent several consecutive weeks below the critical 1.0 threshold, forming what analysts refer to as a structural “capitulation band.” Historically, whenever STH-SOPR remained under 1.0 for extended periods, it signaled heavy emotional selling—typically from the most reactive and least informed market participants. These episodes have repeatedly aligned with late-stage corrections, market reversals, and shifts in long-term holder dominance. With Bitcoin now sitting at a crucial technical and psychological zone, the next phase could determine whether this becomes a deeper bear trend or a major reset before recovery. Short-Term Holders Under Extreme Stress as Capitulation Deepens According to XWIN Research on CryptoQuant, the current selloff is being amplified by the behavior of short-term holders, with the STH-MVRV ratio now sitting far below 1.0. This indicates that nearly all recent buyers are holding Bitcoin at a loss, placing short-term profitability in one of the weakest conditions in the entire dataset. Historically, these deep unrealized-loss phases are extremely rare and tend to compress selling pressure quickly, as weak hands eventually run out of coins to sell. This pattern is clearly visible in real market flows. A striking 65,200 BTC were recently sent to exchanges at a loss, showing that fear is not an abstract sentiment but is materializing in real, loss-driven capitulation. This kind of behavior aligns with classical capitulation structures: unrealized losses surge, panic selling intensifies, and eventually selling pressure becomes unsustainable. Once that happens, stronger hands begin absorbing supply quietly in the background. While this setup doesn’t guarantee an immediate rebound, the broader structure is shifting toward conditions that have historically preceded cyclical recoveries. STH losses remain at extreme levels, STH-SOPR is still below 1.0, and the pressure fueling exchange inflows is rooted in panic rather than fundamentals. Volatility is likely to persist, but the ongoing cleansing of weak hands is a process often seen near the end of major corrections — not at the start. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Dumps 2,800 BTC as Bitcoin Crashes Below $90K Testing Weekly Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market approaching a critical turning point as price trades just above $91,000 following a sharp multi-week decline. The recent breakdown from the $110,000–$105,000 range has confirmed a loss of bullish momentum, with sellers gaining control and pushing BTC toward its next major weekly support cluster near the 50-week moving average around $88,000–$90,000. This zone has historically acted as a key pivot level, often signaling whether a corrective phase deepens or stabilizes. Volume adds important context. The past several weekly candles show rising sell-side activity, reflecting panic-driven exits rather than orderly distribution. However, this surge in volume also indicates that the market may be approaching a capitulation threshold, where forced selling begins to exhaust itself — a setup often seen before stronger hands step in. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Historical Accumulation Level – Just 8% Away From LTH Cost Basis Structurally, Bitcoin is still trading above the 100-week and 200-week moving averages, both of which continue to trend upward. This suggests the aggressive downside move has not yet broken the broader macrotrend. But the loss of mid-term support levels and the sustained downward pressure highlight a market struggling to find confidence.

54630121,630711,1763593259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54630121.jpeg,Shiba Inu Receives Prestigious Honor Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum In Japan,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-prestigious-honor/,"Japan has officially elevated Shiba Inu (SHIB) into its highest-tier crypto compliance category, placing it alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. This milestone reflects a clear shift in how Japanese regulators view SHIB, recognizing it as more than a speculative token and validating its advancement into a government-approved digital asset. The designation is expected to reshape market perception, facilitate faster exchange listings, and enhance Shiba Inu’s readiness for participation at an institutional level within one of the world’s most tightly regulated financial markets . Shiba Inu’s Green-List Recognition Alongside Bitcoin And Ethereum The Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) , operating under the Financial Services Agency, has added SHIB to its Green List. This whitelist is reserved for assets demonstrating strong liquidity, broad exchange presence, and consistent operational performance. Being included on the Green List signals regulatory confidence and allows domestic exchanges to list Shiba Inu without undergoing lengthy, asset-specific vetting procedures. For ecosystem operators and liquidity providers, this reduces barriers to entry, improves the efficiency of capital allocation, and expands Shiba Inu’s reach across Japan’s compliant digital-asset infrastructure. The Green List also carries significant symbolic weight. Only a handful of digital assets—including Bitcoin and Ethereum—have historically received this designation, according to the JVCEA’s November 12, 2025, update. Being recognized alongside these benchmark cryptocurrencies positions SHIB as a more credible and professionally managed asset, helping it shed some of the skepticism associated with meme-based tokens . Japan is also reviewing its cryptocurrency taxation framework . Current policy discussions propose reducing the tax rate on approved, Green-Listed assets from the highest income brackets to roughly 20%. If implemented, this reform could materially enhance Shiba Inu’s appeal to both retail and institutional investors, creating a strong incentive for participation in a lower-tax, regulated environment. Analysts suggest that aligning regulatory recognition with favorable tax treatment could lead to a significant rise in compliant inflows once the reform is enacted, further supporting liquidity and adoption. Impact On Market Positioning And Future Capital Flows This recognition comes at a critical time for Shiba Inu, which has been upgrading its infrastructure and reorganizing its ecosystem to move beyond a meme-asset reputation . Japan’s formal approval confirms SHIB’s improved risk profile and signals to global markets that it has reached a more regulated, professionally governed stage of adoption. Licensed exchanges in Japan can now deploy new Shiba Inu markets, structured products, and liquidity channels with shorter compliance timelines. Increased accessibility encourages higher transactional activity, strengthens liquidity, and improves SHIB’s suitability for institutional participation. The Green-List status also positions SHIB for future inclusion in regulated investment vehicles , such as exchange-traded notes and custodial products, pending further approvals. By joining Bitcoin and Ethereum in Japan’s top compliance tier, Shiba Inu secures a significant step forward in global credibility, institutional acceptance, and its potential to attract future capital flows .",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 23:00:59

According to on-chain metrics, 42% of current XRP wallets accumulated their tokens near the $3 mark, leaving many with losses of 40% or more. Analysts warn that prolonged unrealized losses can trigger capitulation, adding pressure to an already fragile market outlook. While the XRP price is still nearly 4 times higher than it was in November last year, many investors appear to have entered during the post-SEC rally when sentiment was peaking. That surge, triggered by partial legal wins against the SEC, attracted a wave of buyers now sitting deep in the red. With sentiment still near historic lows, analysts warn that this group of underwater holders could start exiting if the broader market continues to slide. XRP Price Prediction: ETF Launches Could Trigger a Trend Reversal XRP is approaching a potential breakdown toward the $1.50 support zone after failing to hold above recent consolidation levels. The chart shows a descending structure forming, with any bounce likely facing resistance around $2.50 and again near the $3.60 high. If sentiment begins to turn and support holds, XRP may recover in phases — but for now, momentum remains weak. The upcoming launch of multiple XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States offers a long-term catalyst, potentially unlocking institutional demand once market conditions stabilize. In the meantime, storage and security remain key for any crypto portfolio.

However, for long-term retirement investors —particularly those using Bitcoin IRAs—price dips can offer strategic entry points rather than reasons for concern. Jonathan Rose, CEO of BlockTrust IRA, told Cryptonews that downturns often create the most compelling opportunities. He noted that the recent crypto pullback resulted in one of the busiest weeks ever for BlockTrust IRA, a U.S.-based platform that allows retail investors to hold crypto in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. “We are seeing a huge shift of investors putting crypto in BlockTrust IRAs, which indicates that Bitcoin is here to stay and that this is a great price entry opportunity,” he said. Data from Alto, a platform that allows users to add alternative assets to self-directed retirement accounts, echoes this trend. The company reported that its 29,000 self-directed IRA users executed over 240,000 crypto trades last year. Alto also stated that proprietary data from its platform reflects the growing confidence in crypto investments as part of a self-directed IRA. Crypto isn't just for traders. It's for planners. A Crypto IRA can help you secure your financial future. — BitcoinIRA (@Bitcoin_IRA) November 13, 2025 A Long-Awaited Entry Point for Retirement Investors Rose added that Bitcoin’s recent dip has opened the door for investors who previously felt like they had “missed the boat.” “For retirement investors who plan to hold Bitcoin for 10, 20, or even 30 years, dips simply represent lower entry points,” he said. This sentiment is shared across the industry. Ryan Flynn, head of Swan Advisor at Swan Bitcoin—a Bitcoin-only wealth management firm—told Cryptonews that Swan sees increased buying activity across all account types during drawdowns, including IRAs. “ Drawdowns in Bitcoin’s price are normal as Bitcoin continues its path of monetization and represents a buying opportunity for those who understand its fundamentals,” Flynn said. Jad Comair, CEO of Melanion Capital, added that Bitcoin’s pullbacks differ from traditional assets. He explained that traditional stock investments typically drop when fundamentals are deteriorating. However, Comair pointed out that Bitcoin investments work differently. “Bitcoin’s fundamentals don’t change when the price pulls back. The supply schedule remains fixed, the halving cadence continues, and global adoption keeps expanding,” he stated. Tax Benefits Strengthen the Case for Buying the Dip While lower prices alone create attractive buying conditions, Bitcoin IRAs offer additional advantages. The most obvious advantage of a Bitcoin dip is the chance to acquire more BTC for the same dollar amount. In a tax-advantaged retirement account , this effect compounds over decades. With a Traditional Bitcoin IRA, gains are tax-deferred; in a Roth Bitcoin IRA, gains can grow tax-free. Accumulating BTC at discounted prices inside these structures maximizes long-term appreciation without triggering taxable events along the way. “In Roth IRAs specifically, this allows for more of Bitcoin’s future price action to be captured as tax-free appreciation. Drawdowns allow retirement investors to max out capped annual contributions, increasing the account’s Bitcoin exposure,” Flynn explained. He added that when Bitcoin pulls back from $125k to $90k, the same $7k annual contribution purchases nearly 40% more Bitcoin. “These advantages accrue mostly to the investor who is preparing for retirement in the next 5-10 or more years,” Flynn stated. Yet, Flynn pointed out that disadvantages can particularly impact those investors who are already in retirement or are nearing that period. This is because these individuals have less time to recover to previous highs before distributions begin. “There is a behavioral risk that puts those investors who don’t understand what Bitcoin represents at a disadvantage where they may be more likely to panic sell near local bottoms,” Flynn said. Jonathan Bander, CPA at a New York-based public accounting firm ExperityCPA, further told Cryptonews that while a drop in BTC enables tax-loss harvesting to offset gains, disadvantages include no offset for personal income inside IRAs and ongoing volatility risk. Who Should Consider a Bitcoin IRA? While industry experts generally agree that Bitcoin dips can favor long-term retirement investors, suitability varies by investor. Crypto is highly volatile and may be more susceptible to manipulation than registered securities. Because of this, Comair believes younger investors may be best positioned to benefit. “They have the longest runway to let Bitcoin’s structural appreciation compound and can treat volatility the same way they would treat another major company’s historic drawdowns,” he said. Comair added that investors with stable cash flow and low liquidity pressure may also find a Bitcoin IRA appealing. “These individuals can keep contributing during corrections without being forced to sell.” Investors worried about long-term fiat debasement could also be a good fit, as Comair commented that Bitcoin’s fixed supply and institutional adoption make it a strategic hedge for retirement portfolios that are otherwise concentrated in assets tied to central bank policy. A Crypto IRA might offer tax-deferred growth and diversification. Just make sure it lines up with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline before jumping in. — Digital Wealth Partners (@DWP_advisors) November 14, 2025 However, investors who are more cautious or close to retirement and cannot tolerate large swings may want to rethink having a Bitcoin IRA. Fidelity research found that adding BTC to a portfolio would have enhanced returns during specific periods in the past, but also that even a small allocation of Bitcoin meaningfully increased portfolio volatility. Source: Fidelity Research The Future Growth of Bitcoin IRAs As the broader crypto market matures , demand for Bitcoin IRAs appears set to accelerate. Rose said BlockTrust is already seeing increased interest from international investors seeking exposure through U.S.-based Bitcoin IRAs. Comair believes this trend is only just beginning. He predicts that by 2026, Bitcoin will sit “much closer to the center of retirement strategies.” “Exchange-traded fund penetration will be broader, corporate ownership more common, and the post-halving supply regime will be tighter. For retirement investors, this period will be remembered as the phase when buying dips in a structurally appreciating asset became standard practice, not a contrarian move.” The post Why Bitcoin’s Latest Dip Has Supercharged Demand for Crypto Retirement Accounts appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Price|btc,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-19 23:18:41

Solana ETF Netflows. Source: SoSoValue . Collectively, Solana-based ETFs have already taken in over $2 billion, as issuers race to meet growing interest from allocators in assets beyond Bitcoin. Still, secondSwap CEO Kanny Lee cautions that these heavy flows could be misleading, crediting them to the novelty of the staking yields narrative when speaking with Decrypt . He argues the “real signal” will emerge early next year if the ETFs maintain sticky allocators once the initial hype wears off, a key test of true long-term holding intent. Considering that Bitcoin ETFs drove the BTC price to former all-time highs in early 2024, Solana could see a similar setup running into 2026 with growing sticky mainstream adoption. Solana Price Predictions: Can Solana Replicate Bitcoin’s 10x ETF Rally Solana could credibly mirror Bitcoin’s 2024 ETF-fuelled breakout, with its latest rebound affirming the lower support of a year-long symmetrical triangle. With momentum indicators verging on bullish, eyes are back on a breakout. The RSI has surged off the oversold threshold, while the MACD closes in on a golden cross, both signalling strengthening buy pressure beneath the surface. If momentum holds, Solana may finally challenge and overcome the key breakout zone around $205. Clearing this level opens the path toward reclaiming the $300 all-time high. With ETF inflows showing sticky, long-term accumulation, a sustained uptrend could unlock far more aggressive targets. As the bull market matures, a move toward $1,500, a 10x from current prices, becomes increasingly feasible. Still, the breakdown scenario remains in the cards if price action aligns with broader market sentiment over the ETF narrative. A rejection here could send Solana 30% lower to retest support near $95. A rejection here could send Solana 30% lower to retest support near $95.

The original cryptocurrency is down by 11% in a week and by 18% in a month, while Ethereum and Solana are down by 24% and 27% in the past month. These are discouraging percentages, yet such losses have stemmed from fears of an AI-related stock market bubble, which has caused institutions to pre-emptively pull money from crypto ETFs. However, fundamentals have not changed at all, while certain new tokens are showing the potential to rally in the coming weeks, including new ERC-20 cryptocurrency PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), which is our best new meme coin to buy today. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 19 November First announced in September, PEPENODE has since gone on to raise just over $2.15 million in its ongoing presale, which is gaining momentum with every passing week. This figure stands as a strong vote of confidence in PEPENODE from investors, who are likely excited by the project’s plan to launch crypto’s first mine-to-earn token. What this means is that PEPENODE will provide users with the opportunity to mine coins without having to invest in traditional mining equipment. Instead, they can use the PEPENODE coin itself to buy virtual mining nodes, with more nodes resulting in greater rewards. It’s as simple as that, with the platform paying out mining rewards in external coins, such as the original Pepe and Fartcoin (the project will announce more tokens at later dates). Because users will need to buy more PEPENODE in order to grow their virtual mining rigs, the token could attract substantial demand, pushing its price up rapidly. On top of this, holders will be able to stake the token, earning a passive income that currently equals an APY of 595%. This is hugely bullish, which is why PEPENODE is our best new meme coin to buy today, given its fundamentals and growing popularity. How to Join the PEPENODE Presale Before It Ends Of course, the token also makes use of tried-and-true Pepe memes, something which has also helped it grow its community at such an early stage of development. While the market may be down now, there’s every chance that a wave of altcoin ETF launches could spark a general recovery, which could coincide with PEPENODE’s launch. As such, it could rally strongly when it lists for the first time, with interested investors advised to act early, so that they can buy the token at a discount. They can do so by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. The coin is currently selling at a price of $0.0011546, although this will rise every few days until the sale ends. Once the sale ends, buyers will receive their coins, while PEPENODE will list on exchanges, potentially sending its price flying.

See What Just Happened,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-headed-to-1-50-see-what-just-happened/,"XRP continues to display signs of weakening momentum as sellers maintain pressure on the market. The asset has recorded a slight decline in the past 24 hours and is down by approximately 11% over the last week, reflecting the broader downturn across major cryptocurrencies. Despite this short-term weakness, XRP remains marginally profitable for investors who entered the market at the beginning of the year. The token has gained 2.58% on a year-to-date basis, positioning it alongside BNB and Tron as the only top-10 digital assets still showing positive returns in that period. Most other large-cap cryptocurrencies have surrendered earlier gains due to ongoing corrections. $XRP Lost the previous breakout level. Looks headed back to $1.50 area. pic.twitter.com/8VskyzrPXk — Nebraskangooner (@Nebraskangooner) November 17, 2025 Failed Breakout Raises Concern Market analyst Nebraskangooner has issued a cautious outlook for XRP, indicating that the token may be at risk of extending its downward movement. According to his assessment, XRP’s inability to confirm a breakout from a long-standing technical pattern is a key factor supporting a bearish scenario. He specifically referenced a descending triangle visible on the weekly chart, noting that XRP approached the upper boundary of the formation in late October but failed to secure upward continuation. The chart indicates that the triangle originated after XRP reached its yearly high of $3.66 in July. Subsequent trading activity kept the token within the confines of this formation until recent market conditions pushed it lower. Sellers eventually forced XRP below the triangle’s lower support zone near $2.20, marking a significant shift in structure. Based on this breakdown, Nebraskangooner projects that XRP could decline toward the $1.50 region. This level represents an estimated 30% slide from the current trading price of around $2.09 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Shift in Long-Term Holder Sentiment In addition to technical weakness, changes in investor sentiment may intensify downward pressure. Data from Glassnode suggests that long-term holders have gradually moved away from the optimism observed earlier in the year. Their sentiment has transitioned from strong confidence to a more cautious stance as XRP continues to struggle with sustained upward momentum. This analysis relies on the net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric for long-term holders, which evaluates whether these investors are predominantly sitting on gains or losses. The metric compares the market value of XRP to the realized value to determine the aggregate profitability of this group. Recent readings place long-term holders in the “anxiety” category. This state is characterized by modest unrealized gains but increasing uncertainty about future market direction. The shift toward anxiety implies that long-term participants are becoming more sensitive to price fluctuations. It also signals a greater likelihood of selling activity compared to earlier phases, when unrealized profits were larger and confidence was higher. This transition has appeared as XRP hovers near the $2 threshold, a level that carries psychological relevance for many traders. While the broader sentiment remains cautious, the coming weeks may provide clarity on whether XRP can stabilize above key support zones or whether the downward trend highlighted by analysts will persist. For now, technical indicators and sentiment signals continue to point toward the possibility of additional weakness unless buyers reclaim lost ground.

The initiative, backed by the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) and several influential crypto policy groups, argues that decentralized financial tools could save people up to $30 billion a year in fees, money that is currently lost to what researchers describe as the “poverty premium.” NEW BLOG: Why is the cost of U.S. financial services for lower-income families continuing to rise despite technological advances? DEF's @jenn_rosenthal revisits a phrase coined in the early 2000s — ""the poverty premium"" — and explores the possibility of DeFi as a solution. pic.twitter.com/tScifp647x — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) November 19, 2025 How Much Longer Can the Poor Afford an Expensive Financial System? The renewed push comes as global poverty levels remain stubbornly high. In 2025, an estimated 808 million people are living in extreme poverty on less than $3 a day, according to updated global estimates. Source: pip.worldbank.org Another 887 million are considered to be living in multidimensional poverty. Many of these households face overlapping pressures, including climate-related disasters, political instability, and rising economic fragility. The DeFi Education Fund says the financial system itself is part of the problem. In new research released this year, the group highlighted the long-standing cost gap between rich and poor households in the United States. Source: DEF Roughly 5.6 million U.S. households remain unbanked, and another 14.2% are underbanked, often forced to rely on costly financial alternatives. Cashing a paycheck can cost up to 5% of its value, and fees eat up an average of 7.1% of annual income for low-income families, compared with just 0.2% for wealthier households. These costs add up. DEF argues that removing intermediaries through decentralized financial rails could dramatically reduce basic expenses like remittances, money transfers, and bill payments. One estimate in the group’s proposal suggests DeFi infrastructure could cut global remittance costs by up to 80%, potentially saving the world’s unbanked populations $30 billion per year. Source: DEF The initiative lands at a moment when Americans appear increasingly open to alternatives. A DEF survey conducted with Ipsos found that 42% of Americans would likely try DeFi services if new legislation clarifying crypto privacy protections is passed. Many respondents expressed frustrations with banking delays, unexpected fees, and difficulty accessing their own funds. Across the sample, 56% of adults said they want full control of their money, and 54% said they want control over their financial data. As DeFi’s Real-World Role Grows, DEF Accelerates Washington Advocacy Alongside its economic arguments, the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) has expanded its policy efforts in Washington. In August, the organization launched the DeFi Education Foundation , a nonprofit designed to broaden its advocacy and deepen engagement with lawmakers. Around the same period, DEF and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a regulatory “safe harbor” for blockchain applications. The DeFi Education Fund and Andreeson Horowitz (a16z) are pushing the SEC to create a ""safe harbor"" for blockchain apps. #DeFi #a16z https://t.co/7OCIWRvUgk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 They argued that neutral software interfaces should not be classified as brokers, warning that current interpretations risk forcing developers into unintended regulatory roles and discouraging innovation. DEF also submitted a formal response to the Senate Banking Committee’s draft Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025. In that filing, DEF and several major crypto firms, including Paradigm, Jump Crypto, Multicoin Capital, the Solana Policy Institute, and the Uniswap Foundation, called for clear regulatory separation between software builders and financial intermediaries. @fund_defi has called on the US Senate Banking Committee to take a more measured approach to DeFi regulation. #Regulation #DeFi https://t.co/9pZzvG6gkV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 2, 2025 While debate over DeFi’s long-term value continues, advocates point to practical examples of how digital tools can expand access to financial services. Source: Poverty & Inequality Platform (PIP) In Nigeria and parts of East Africa, crypto-based networks allow users to transact with or without smartphones. In regions facing conflict or hyperinflation, including Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Argentina, digital currencies have been used to move money and preserve savings. Some humanitarian groups have adopted blockchain systems to distribute aid with greater transparency. Still, researchers note that DeFi faces limits. Collateral-heavy lending models, volatile token markets, smart-contract vulnerabilities, and financial literacy barriers have slowed broader adoption. Much of today’s activity remains concentrated in speculative trading rather than real-world economic use. Even in El Salvador, where Bitcoin became legal tender in 2021 , daily usage has remained below expectations. DEF maintains that policymakers should protect the aspects of DeFi that directly reduce costs for consumers. The group argues that open access, low-cost settlement, and user control remain essential to reaching people living at the financial margins.

His hearing was a major moment for the future of digital-asset regulation in the United States. Selig testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee, the agency that supervises the CFTC. Lawmakers grilled him on his previous advisory work with digital-asset firms, his views on DeFi, his regulatory philosophy, and how he plans to stabilize an agency that has been operating with only one commissioner in place for months. His nomination arrived after President Donald Trump withdrew his first selection , Brian Quintenz. The committee is slated to vote on Selig’s nomination in the near future, and the discussion is expected to start on Thursday. The result could determine who will determine the next generation of crypto oversight in the U.S. Selig began by warning lawmakers that the country is at a turning point. He said markets all over the world are shifting rapidly, and the U.S. risks falling behind if regulators rely too heavily on enforcement rather than clear regulations. He argued aggressive actions would push firms overseas and weaken American competitiveness. He described the digital-asset market as a sector that has grown from a small curiosity to a nearly $4 trillion global economy. Senators pose questions to Selig about crypto oversight Committee Chairman John Boozman pressed Selig about how he would enforce rules in the spot digital-commodity market — something Congress is mulling over further inserting under the CFTC’s mandate. The senator cited Selig’s nomination as connected to pending negotiations over a major market-structure bill that would determine how digital assets are classified and what agency oversees them. Selig was asked multiple questions about how decentralized finance works. He said that while “DeFi” is often just a vague term, regulators need to understand how on-chain applications work. He explained that identifying when intermediaries are present and whether applications pose risks similar to traditional financial services requires recognizing them. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the committee’s leading Democrat, voiced concern about the prolonged leadership vacuum within the CFTC. She observed that for months now, the agency has been with only Acting Chair Caroline Pham serving as its single commissioner, even though it typically has five. Klobuchar said this instability has sparked confusion for businesses that rely heavily on steady regulatory oversight. The confusion at the agency, she said, has produced “more chaos for people who depend on the CFTC.” If Selig is confirmed, Pham is expected to resign, leaving the CFTC’s four commissioner seats empty unless the White House fills them up quickly. That would be a way Selig can direct an agency that was left unexpectedly fragile in this context. Selig said it needed more diversity of thought on its commission. He said he would cooperate with whichever commissioners the president nominates and argued that a greater diversity of perspectives bolsters regulatory decisions. What Selig’s nomination means for crypto regulation Selig’s appointment would be a pivotal moment for the digital assets industry, which has never been in a better position. His regulatory approach represents a shift toward one that is more conducive to innovation—and one that attaches greater emphasis to creating formal rules, engaging with the industry rather than relying heavily on enforcement actions. If he assumes such leadership, it would shape how crypto trading platforms function, how decentralized finance is understood and regulated, how U.S. exchanges compete in the global marketplace, and how the CFTC shares functions with the SEC. His viewpoint sharply contrasts with years of friction between crypto companies and American regulators, in part because critics say a perception of uncertainty and unpredictable enforcement has hindered their operations. But Selig’s possible tenure would not be an effort to start without difficulty. The CFTC remains vastly understaffed, and a commission bereft of several members can encounter political resistance and legal trouble when considering such significant regulatory decisions.

The announcements, which came on the same day, show that major record labels and VCs are racing to capitalize on AI music technology after months of litigation, even as fundamental questions about copyright and fair use remain unresolved in the courts. Warner Music and Udio to launch a song creation platform Warner Music’s settlement with Udio makes it the second major label to resolve its dispute with the Massachusetts-based company in less than a month, following Universal Music Group’s October agreement. The companies plan to jointly launch a subscription service in 2026 that will use licensed music from Warner’s catalog to power AI-generated remixes, covers, and new songs featuring participating artists’ voices. “We’re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,” said Robert Kyncl , Warner Music Group’s chief executive officer. The settlement also includes provisions for artist protection, as they can choose to opt in to participate and will receive credit and compensation. Sony Music Group remains the last major label still litigating against Udio. Suno’s valuation rises Suno’s latest funding round was led by Menlo Ventures and also saw participation from other investors, including Nvidia’s NVentures, Lightspeed, Hallwood Media, and Matrix. The raise values the company at $2.45 billion. The platform, which allows users to create full songs using text prompts and has become widely popular among first-time creators and professional producers alike, is also facing copyright litigation with Warner, Universal, and Sony Music. Suno’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Mikey Shulman, said the latest capital will be used to build more sophisticated tools and expand its platform as demand for generative audio continues to accelerate. He added that millions of users have produced music through Suno over the past two years. However, unlike Udio, Suno hasn’t settled or resolved the copyright battles it has with the world’s largest record labels, which allege that the company used protected recordings to train its model and risks flooding music platforms with AI-generated tracks that could “drown out” professional artists. From courtrooms to collaboration In 2024, when the major record labels first took Udio and Suno to court, they alleged that they used protected recordings to train their AI models without permission. The labels accused the companies of copying hundreds of songs from popular musicians to create systems that would “directly compete with, cheapen, and ultimately drown out” human artists. However, both AI startups claimed that they didn’t violate any US copyright law and characterized the lawsuits as attempts to stifle competition. Industry observers had predicted that major labels would seek equity stakes and licensing arrangements rather than pursue lengthy court battles, and that forecast seems to have largely materialized. Part of Universal Music’s settlement with Udio also involves them collaborating to launch a platform for generative AI music trained on authorized and licensed music. Warner Music also announced a separate partnership with Stability AI on Wednesday, November 19, to develop professional-grade AI tools for artists and producers using ethically trained models.

This landmark case sends shockwaves through the crypto privacy sector and raises crucial questions about regulatory boundaries. What Exactly Happened with Samourai Wallet? The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York delivered the sentence after Hill pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Prosecutors presented compelling evidence that the Samourai Wallet service processed over $237 million in illicit funds. This case represents one of the most significant legal actions against cryptocurrency mixing services to date. Authorities argued that Samourai Wallet knowingly facilitated money laundering activities while operating outside regulatory frameworks. The service allowed users to obscure transaction trails, making it difficult for law enforcement to track illegal financial activities. Why Does This Samourai Wallet Case Matter? This sentencing establishes a critical precedent for how regulators approach cryptocurrency privacy tools. The Samourai Wallet case demonstrates that: Cryptocurrency services must comply with money transmission laws Privacy features cannot shield illegal activities Regulators are actively monitoring crypto mixing services The timing is particularly significant as it follows co-founder Keonne Rodriguez’s five-year sentence in August. Together, these cases show coordinated enforcement action against unregistered crypto services. How Does This Affect Crypto Privacy Tools? The Samourai Wallet verdict creates uncertainty for other privacy-focused cryptocurrency services. Many legitimate users value privacy features for personal security reasons. However, regulators clearly view mixing services as potential conduits for illegal activities. This case may prompt other privacy tool developers to reconsider their compliance strategies. Some key implications include: Increased regulatory scrutiny on all mixing services Potential licensing requirements for privacy tools Greater transparency demands from service providers What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Regulation? The Samourai Wallet sentencing signals stronger enforcement of existing financial regulations in the crypto space. Regulators are sending a clear message that anti-money laundering laws apply equally to traditional and digital financial services. This case likely represents just the beginning of increased regulatory attention on cryptocurrency privacy tools. Other mixing services may face similar legal challenges if they operate without proper licensing. Key Takeaways from the Samourai Wallet Case The four-year prison sentence for Samourai Wallet’s co-founder serves as a stark warning to the cryptocurrency industry. Compliance with financial regulations is no longer optional, even for privacy-focused services. This case establishes that: Cryptocurrency services must register as money transmitters Privacy cannot override anti-money laundering requirements Regulators are actively pursuing enforcement actions The Samourai Wallet case will undoubtedly influence how developers build and regulators view cryptocurrency privacy tools moving forward. Frequently Asked Questions What is Samourai Wallet? Samourai Wallet was a Bitcoin mixing service that allowed users to obscure their transaction history for enhanced privacy. Why was the co-founder sentenced to prison? William Lonergan Hill received a four-year prison sentence for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and facilitating money laundering. How much money was involved in the case? Prosecutors stated that Samourai Wallet was used to launder $237 million in illicit funds through its mixing services. What happened to the other co-founder? Keonne Rodriguez, the other Samourai Wallet co-founder, received a five-year prison sentence on August 7th in a related case. Are all cryptocurrency privacy tools illegal? No, but they must comply with money transmission regulations and anti-money laundering requirements to operate legally. What does this mean for other crypto mixing services? This case sets a precedent that may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential legal action against other unregistered mixing services. Found this analysis insightful?

After a series of regulatory filings and updates from major fund issuers, analysts now believe that the debut of the first Spot Dogecoin ETF is just days away. All signs now point to a launch window that could open as early as Monday, bringing the long-anticipated product to market far sooner than many expected . Grayscale Positions Its Dogecoin ETF For A Close Launch The clearest signal came after Grayscale updated its Dogecoin ETF filing, which started a 20-day countdown under the SEC’s new fast-track listing rules. These rules allow certain crypto ETFs to go live without the lengthy and restrictive approval process that previous products faced. Unless the SEC steps in with an objection, the end of this 20-day window will become the launch date of the proposed ETF. Based on the timing of Grayscale’s amendment, the first Spot Dogecoin ETF could debut as early as Monday, November 24. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, provided the clearest timeline so far. He stated: “Based on 20 20-day clock, I believe Grayscale will be out with the first Doge ETF in a week, 11/24.” His comment follows the expectation that the first Dogecoin ETF could go live before the end of November. Balchunas also shared the S-1 document image to show the structure of the filing that initiated the countdown. Solana ETF Approval Shows The New SEC Pathway Is Working The optimism surrounding Dogecoin’s ETF launch grows stronger when looking at what happened with Solana . VanEck successfully launched its Solana ETF this week with staking rewards and temporarily waived fees to attract early inflows. Fidelity also stepped into the arena with its own Solana ETF, FSOL, which recorded $2.07 million in inflows on its first trading day. That product went live under the same SEC listing framework now guiding Dogecoin’s filing. Its smooth debut confirmed that the new process is functioning as intended, with issuers able to bring crypto ETFs to market far more quickly than in earlier cycles. This sets a meaningful precedent because Dogecoin is next in line to benefit from that same pathway. Although Grayscale is expected to launch first, it may not remain the only DOGE ETF for long. Bitwise submitted an amendment to its own DOGE fund earlier in November, which activated a similar 20-day timeline. If the schedule holds, Bitwise’s Spot Dogecoin ETF could list the following week. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1586 , up by 2% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Bitwise|Bloomberg|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Eric Balchunas|FSOL|Grayscale|solana|Spot Dogecoin ETF|Spot Solana ETF|US SEC|vaneck,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 00:00:10

Portnoy, who has a large following of more than 3.7 million users on X, shared the update in a video posted on Monday night. In the same announcement, he revealed that his total spending on digital assets that evening exceeded $2 million, spread across multiple cryptocurrencies. His move quickly drew attention from public figures, including Eric Trump, who described the purchase as a smart decision. Portnoy’s Large XRP Allocation During Market Downturn In the video published on X, Portnoy outlined the sequence of trades he executed on November 17 when the market experienced notable volatility. He stated that at 6:38 PM, he added $500,000 of XRP to his portfolio, followed by a $400,000 allocation to Ethereum and a separate $750,000 order for Bitcoin one minute earlier. Records from his post also show that at 6:36 PM, he placed another order for $500,000 worth of XRP, bringing his total XRP expenditure to $1 million within a two-minute window. He indicated that the scale of the price drop across major cryptocurrencies created conditions that he viewed as favorable for large entries. Portnoy explained that he saw the sharp declines as an opportunity he did not want to overlook. His video highlighted that the purchases were made rapidly and were driven by a desire to take advantage of the broader sell-off occurring that evening. Smart trade @stoolpresidente https://t.co/uIVh0rSGh2 — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) November 19, 2025 Eric Trump Reacts to Portnoy’s Disclosure Following Portnoy’s announcement, Eric Trump responded publicly, expressing support for the decision and characterizing it as a good strategic move. Trump has made comments throughout the year regarding cryptocurrency trends and has regularly encouraged buying during market retracements. Earlier statements from him included predictions that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 by year-end and potentially rise to $1 million over a longer horizon. His endorsement of Portnoy’s investment is consistent with these previously stated views. Portnoy’s purchases came at a time when major cryptocurrencies were posting sustained weekly and monthly losses. XRP’s price has fallen to $2.07 after an 11.66% decline in the past week. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin is currently at $89,719, reflecting a 11.51% weekly decrease, and Ethereum has fallen to $2,940 after dropping 13.66% in the same period. Over the past month, the declines have been more pronounced, with Bitcoin losing 18.97%, Ethereum declining by 25.4%, and XRP dropping 15.66%. Portnoy’s Earlier Comments on XRP Portnoy has previously discussed his views on XRP in interviews. In May, he explained that his interest in the asset stems partly from what he described as strong fear-of-missing-out dynamics. He drew comparisons between XRP’s growth potential and his early experiences with Bitcoin, noting that he is especially attracted to the possibility of rapid gains. He also acknowledged that he does not base his decisions on XRP’s fundamental qualities, but rather on the asset’s perceived capacity for significant upward movement. His history with XRP includes a notable incident earlier in the year. In July, reports indicated that Portnoy sold roughly $3 million worth of XRP after misinterpreting a message from a friend as a warning of negative developments. He closed his position at $2.40, only for XRP to rise to $3.65 afterward. Portnoy later expressed regret over the decision, stating that the unexpected rally left him dissatisfied despite positive outcomes from his positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Portnoy’s latest acquisition underscores his continued interest in major cryptocurrencies despite recent market volatility. The positive reaction from Eric Trump adds a political figure’s endorsement to the discussion, further amplifying attention on the transaction.

Related Reading: Famous Trader Bets $27 Million That The XRP Price Will Crash This decline marks the fourth consecutive day of losses, erasing last week’s recovery and signaling a shift in sentiment as traders increasingly position for a deeper pullback. XMR's price records strong losses on the daily chart. Source: XMRUSD on Tradingview Monero (XMR)’s Selling Pressure Builds Further Fresh derivatives data reflect rising bearish conviction. According to CoinGlass, Monero’s futures Open Interest has fallen over the last 24 hours, while short positions now account for more than 55% of all trades. The drop in OI, now hovering around $78 million, suggests traders are withdrawing capital as fear of further downside builds. Technical indicators support this shift. The RSI has slipped below the midline, showing weakening momentum, while the MACD indicator has flashed a fresh sell signal. Together, these point toward deteriorating buying interest and a growing risk that XMR may not hold its current support levels. Support Threatened as Analysts Eye Breakdown Toward $350 Despite XMR maintaining an overall bullish structure on higher timeframes in recent months, the short-term outlook has flipped decisively bearish. The price is now testing key support zones, with the 50-day EMA at $348 emerging as the next major level to watch. A close below $358, which aligns with the neckline of a double-top pattern, would confirm a bearish breakdown, potentially accelerating losses toward the low-$300 region. Analysts warn that this scenario becomes more likely if market demand continues to weaken, particularly as retail traders rotate into alternative opportunities and risk sentiment remains fragile. Still, not all indicators point south. Analysts note that as long as XMR holds above $373, there remains potential for an intraday rebound toward the $400–$410 resistance range. But with the price already slipping below that threshold, bulls may face an uphill battle to reassert control. Privacy Narrative Remains Strong, but Momentum Falters Despite the near-term weakness, Monero continues to benefit from growing interest in privacy-preserving technologies. Recent upgrades, such as the Fluorine Fermi hard fork, have strengthened network security and improved resistance against surveillance-based threats. Long-term forecasts remain cautiously optimistic, with projections suggesting steady, though moderate, growth through 2030 and beyond.

This dramatic drop signals one of the most pessimistic market environments we’ve seen in recent months, creating both challenges and opportunities for crypto enthusiasts. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market sentiment. It calculates investor emotions using six key factors that provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. Understanding these components helps traders make more informed decisions during volatile periods. The index breaks down into these weighted components: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations Market Momentum/Volume (25%) – Tracks trading activity Social Media (15%) – Analyzes crypto mentions and sentiment Surveys (15%) – Gathers direct investor opinions Dominance (10%) – Monitors Bitcoin’s market share Trends (10%) – Follows Google search volume Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear Levels? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits such low numbers, it often signals potential turning points in the market. Extreme fear typically indicates that many investors are selling their positions, which can create buying opportunities for those with a longer-term perspective. However, it also suggests continued volatility ahead. Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries. The current reading of 11 places us firmly in the “extreme fear” category, which ranges from 0-25 on the scale. This psychological indicator helps traders understand when markets might be oversold or overbought. How Can Traders Navigate This Fearful Market? Navigating markets when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear requires careful strategy. First, consider dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk. Second, maintain a diversified portfolio across different cryptocurrency assets. Third, set clear stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage risk effectively. Remember that market sentiment often swings between extremes. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 11 represents one of these extreme points. While challenging, such environments have historically presented opportunities for patient investors. What’s Next for Crypto Markets? Looking forward, monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index will remain crucial for understanding market direction. As sentiment improves, we typically see the index climb back toward neutral territory around 50. However, sustained recovery requires positive catalysts and improved market fundamentals. The current extreme fear reading suggests markets remain fragile. Therefore, traders should watch for stabilization in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a potential sign of improving conditions. Meanwhile, maintaining risk management practices becomes essential. Key Takeaways from the Current Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 11 highlights several important market dynamics. First, investor psychology plays a massive role in cryptocurrency pricing. Second, extreme readings often signal potential reversal points. Third, understanding these sentiment indicators can help traders avoid emotional decision-making. As we monitor the evolving Crypto Fear & Greed Index, remember that markets move in cycles. The current extreme fear phase will eventually give way to more balanced sentiment, creating new opportunities for prepared investors. Frequently Asked Questions What is considered a normal reading for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A neutral reading typically falls between 40-60. Values below 25 indicate extreme fear, while readings above 75 suggest extreme greed in the market. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing regular insights into changing market sentiment and investor psychology. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market crashes? While it doesn’t predict specific crashes, sustained extreme greed readings often precede corrections, while extreme fear may indicate potential buying opportunities. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reliable for trading decisions? It works best as one tool among many. Combine it with technical analysis, fundamental research, and risk management for comprehensive trading strategies. Does the index cover all cryptocurrencies? While it focuses heavily on Bitcoin due to its market dominance, the index reflects overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. How long do extreme fear periods typically last? There’s no fixed duration. Extreme fear can persist for weeks or resolve quickly, depending on market catalysts and broader economic conditions. Found this analysis helpful?

Russia has taken a strategic and economic interest in AI, but the country’s entrance into the global AI industry will put it far behind established leaders in the industry like America and China. Putin believes AI is a matter of independence President Vladimir Putin recently announced the creation of a national task force at Russia’s flagship AI Journey conference. The purpose of the task force will be to coordinate generative AI development across the country. Putin explained that large language models (LLMs) have become vital tools for shaping public opinion, which means that dependence on foreign AI is a threat to Russia’s technological and value-based independence. He stressed the importance of Russia having its own full suite of generative AI technologies that will all be under the supervision of Russian experts. He also warned against harsh regulations, but said that for national security and intelligence, only Russian-trained models should be used so that their data remains within the country. The task force will promote the building of data centers across Russia. They will be supported by nearby energy sources like small-scale nuclear power stations. During his address, Putin also urged both state institutions and private companies to increase AI adoption. Putin projected that AI could contribute more than 11 trillion rubles (around $136 billion) to Russia’s GDP by 2030. Russia is far behind AI powerhouses like the U.S. and China in terms of technology development, but it already has some homegrown large-language models, including Gigachat, which was developed by Sberbank and Yandex GPT. At the same conference, Sberbank demonstrated upgraded versions of its model, as well as AI-driven products ranging from humanoid robots to health-scanning ATMs. One of the biggest obstacles for Russia’s AI ambition is the Western sanctions on microchips, as it limits Russia’s capacity to scale up its computing infrastructure. Putin’s selective cooperation The Russian President has said repeatedly that he regards foreign AI dominance as a threat to Russian culture and security. As far back as 2023, he warned that Western-trained AI systems could reflect Western values, ignoring or even “canceling” Russian traditions, history, and public policy. However, in late 2024, he announced an “AI Alliance Network” with BRICS members (Brazil, China, India, South Africa) and other nations to develop AI and build alternative regulation and market channels together. In early 2025, he ordered Sberbank and the government to deepen AI cooperation with China. According to recent research , Russia’s lower chamber of parliament, the State Duma, has been working on AI regulation since 2023, and there is reportedly a working group ordered to produce AI laws by 2026.

However, the Bitcoin derivatives market revealed an astonishing story of resilience that defied expectations. This remarkable stability in the face of price pressure offers crucial insights for cryptocurrency investors. What Makes the Bitcoin Derivatives Market So Resilient? The Bitcoin derivatives market has demonstrated exceptional steadiness despite recent price movements. According to Cointelegraph analysis, key metrics continue to show market confidence rather than panic. This stability suggests institutional maturity and growing sophistication among market participants. On November 19th, the monthly BTC futures premium maintained around 4% above spot prices. While slightly below the neutral 5% threshold, this figure indicates controlled optimism rather than excessive fear. The market shows measured responses instead of emotional reactions. How Do Perpetual Futures Signal Market Health? The perpetual futures funding rate for Bitcoin has consistently hovered around 4% annualized. This alignment with the two-week average reveals several important factors: Consistent trader behavior despite price fluctuations Balanced long and short positions Absence of extreme leverage situations Healthy market maker activity These conditions create a stable foundation for the Bitcoin derivatives market to operate efficiently. The funding rate stability prevents sudden liquidations that could trigger cascading effects. Why Does Options Data Matter for Bitcoin Investors? The BTC options delta skew maintained a stable 11% throughout the past week. This crucial metric provides deep insights into trader sentiment and risk assessment. A stable skew indicates that professional traders haven’t significantly altered their risk perceptions. This consistency in the Bitcoin derivatives market options space suggests that experienced participants view recent price movements as normal market behavior rather than fundamental shifts. The data reveals calculated positioning rather than emotional trading. What Does This Stability Mean for Future Bitcoin Price Action? The current Bitcoin derivatives market conditions create a favorable environment for sustainable growth. The absence of extreme fear or greed indicators suggests that any price movements will likely be more gradual and less volatile. This stability provides several advantages: Reduced risk of flash crashes More predictable trading conditions Improved institutional participation Healthier long-term development The Bitcoin derivatives market functioning as a stabilizing force represents significant progress in cryptocurrency market maturation. This development benefits all market participants through reduced volatility and improved liquidity. Key Takeaways from Current Bitcoin Derivatives Market Analysis The remarkable stability in the Bitcoin derivatives market during recent price tests demonstrates growing market sophistication. Traders appear to be learning from past volatility episodes and adjusting their strategies accordingly. This evolution in market behavior suggests we’re witnessing the maturation of cryptocurrency trading. Furthermore, the consistent metrics across futures, perpetuals, and options indicate coordinated market understanding. Participants across different Bitcoin derivatives market segments share similar risk assessments and trading approaches. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Bitcoin derivatives market? The Bitcoin derivatives market includes financial contracts like futures and options that derive their value from Bitcoin’s price. These instruments allow traders to hedge risk or speculate on price movements. Why is derivatives market stability important? Stability in the Bitcoin derivatives market reduces overall volatility, prevents cascading liquidations, and encourages institutional participation. It signals market maturity and sophisticated risk management. How does the futures premium indicate market sentiment? The futures premium shows whether traders are willing to pay more for future Bitcoin delivery. A stable premium around 4-5% suggests balanced optimism without excessive speculation. What does options delta skew measure? Options delta skew measures the difference in implied volatility between put and call options. A stable skew indicates consistent risk assessment among options traders. Can derivatives market stability predict future prices? While not a perfect predictor, derivatives market stability suggests reduced likelihood of extreme volatility. Stable conditions often precede more sustainable price movements. How do perpetual funding rates affect traders? Stable funding rates prevent sudden position liquidations and reduce trading costs. They indicate balanced market conditions between long and short positions. Found this analysis of Bitcoin derivatives market stability helpful?

The move represents one of Washington’s largest tech decisions in the Middle East, enabling both Gulf countries to possess hardware capable of training and running state-of-the-art AI models. U.S. officials say that these approvals entail strict security rules. The conditions are intended to prevent the chips from being sent to China or any other foreign adversary. The approvals also reflect a close partnership between Washington and the two oil-rich countries, which are both committed to becoming global leaders in AI. U.S. tightens control as sales approved The Commerce Department confirmed that G42 (UAE) and Humain (Saudi Arabia) will receive computer-equipped AI chips, comprising Nvidia’s GB300 processors . These are some of the most advanced chips Nvidia has ever produced. Approvals were granted only after both companies committed to “rigorous security and reporting requirements,” the U.S. added. Officials did not provide specifics but said their focus was heavily on preventing technology transfer to high-risk countries, particularly China. That followed months of talks between Washington and the Gulf governments. The talks were part of broader bilateral arrangements that focus on economic cooperation, cybersecurity safeguards, and new commitments to better governance with technology. G42 had already taken measures to appease American concerns. Last year, the Emirati firm committed to ceasing the use of Huawei equipment and unwinding its ties with Chinese companies. That decision paved the way for a $1.5 billion investment from Microsoft, which led to President Brad Smith joining G42’s board of directors. Saudi Arabia’s Humain has publicly stated that it will not buy Huawei gear, following U.S. expectations for secure AI development. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are both racing to build world-class AI industries. These are the new Nvidia approvals that will provide them with the raw computing power necessary to train next-generation AI models, operate large data centers, and entice global tech partners. G42 is growing at a rapid pace across various sectors — from outer space technology to national genomics projects. The company is constructing massive data centers and cloud infrastructure to fund AI labs and government projects all over the Emirates. Humain, in Saudi Arabia, is working towards its own national strategy. It plans to create giant “AI factories” to house hundreds of thousands of GPUs. The facilities are designed to provide power for projects in healthcare, higher education institutions, freight delivery services, transportation authorities, and government agencies. The Nvidia AI chips approvals come as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman strengthens ties with the Trump White House. The UAE, meanwhile, committed earlier this year to spend $1.4 trillion on the American side, further cementing its strategic alliance with Washington. U.S. balances innovation and national security Inside Washington, the decision has inspired debate. Many officials in the Trump administration view the sale as a response to China’s growing presence in the Middle East. U.S. companies, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle, can anchor the region’s AI buildout. It keeps Gulf nations inside America’s technological infrastructure. Nevertheless, some national security officials remain skeptical, as they worry that even with heavy monitoring, powerful AI chips can still be misused. They also worry that Beijing might someday gain access to data centers or research facilities located in the Gulf through commercial, scholarly, or hidden connections. Nonetheless, the American administration believes that strict operational conditions will ensure that the technology remains secure. Washington’s shift also indicates, in effect, that AI hardware is becoming increasingly part of Washington’s diplomatic toolkit. Gulf nations seek to develop AI capacity, while the United States aims to exert influence, maintain oversight, and foster economic cooperation. Nvidia, meanwhile, retains access to two of the world’s fastest-growing markets for high-performance computing. G42 and Humain approvals may be only the start. The two countries are expected to demand even more chips as they seek to emerge as global leaders in artificial intelligence, data infrastructure, and advanced technology manufacturing.

The latest data reveals a significant shift that every crypto investor needs to understand. The Altcoin Season Index has dropped five crucial points to just 26, signaling a potential change in market dynamics that could impact your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market indicator for cryptocurrency investors. This important metric defines an “altcoin season” as a period where 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 26 suggests we’re firmly in Bitcoin season territory. Why Should You Care About This Altcoin Season Index Drop? The five-point decline in the Altcoin Season Index matters because it reflects changing investor sentiment and capital flows. When the index moves lower, it indicates: Bitcoin is outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies Investor confidence may be shifting toward established assets Market risk appetite could be decreasing Capital rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin is occurring How Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Work? Understanding the mechanics behind the Altcoin Season Index helps you make better investment decisions. The index excludes stablecoins and wrapped coins from its calculation, focusing purely on performance comparisons. A score closer to 100 indicates strong altcoin season conditions, while lower scores like the current 26 point toward Bitcoin dominance. What Investment Strategies Make Sense Now? With the Altcoin Season Index sitting at 26, investors should consider several approaches. First, recognize that Bitcoin seasons often precede altcoin rallies. Historical patterns show that after extended Bitcoin dominance, capital typically flows back into altcoins. However, timing these transitions requires careful market observation and risk management. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify strategically rather than abandoning altcoins completely Monitor the Altcoin Season Index weekly for trend changes Focus on fundamentals rather than short-term price movements Set clear entry and exit points for your altcoin positions When Might We See the Next Altcoin Season? Predicting the exact timing of market shifts remains challenging, but the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable clues. The current reading suggests we’re not in altcoin season territory yet. However, market conditions can change rapidly based on several factors including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic trends. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Market Landscape The Altcoin Season Index drop to 26 presents both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. While Bitcoin appears to be dominating currently, this often sets the stage for future altcoin rallies. By understanding what the Altcoin Season Index measures and how to interpret its movements, you can make more informed decisions about your cryptocurrency portfolio allocation and timing. Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 26 mean? An Altcoin Season Index of 26 indicates that Bitcoin is significantly outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies. The index measures how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are beating Bitcoin’s performance over 90 days. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The Altcoin Season Index typically updates regularly as market data becomes available, providing ongoing insights into market dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. While a low Altcoin Season Index suggests Bitcoin dominance, it often precedes altcoin rallies. Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance rather than making reactionary decisions. What’s the difference between Bitcoin season and altcoin season? Bitcoin season occurs when Bitcoin outperforms most altcoins, while altcoin season happens when 75% of top cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict market crashes? The index measures relative performance between assets rather than predicting absolute price movements or market crashes. It’s best used as one of several market analysis tools. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for trading decisions? While valuable for understanding market trends, the index should complement rather than replace comprehensive research and risk management in trading decisions. Found this analysis helpful?

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted a Glassnode chart showing that Dogecoin’s net supply on centralized exchanges has just turned positive, noting on X: “Dogecoin supply on exchanges just turned positive! This shift has marked sharp rebounds before.” Dogecoin Rebound Loading? The chart in his post, “DOGE: Exchange Net Position Change – All Exchanges,” tracks monthly exchange inflows and outflows as a histogram, alongside DOGE’s price in US dollars. Green bars indicate net inflows (more DOGE moving to exchanges than leaving), while red bars show net outflows. From mid-2024 through late 2024, the series alternates between modest red and green periods before a sustained cluster of strong green bars emerges around the fourth quarter of 2024. During that phase, net inflows rise to several billion DOGE per month. At the same time, the price line accelerated from below $0.10 to a local peak to $0.48, illustrating how heavy exchange-side activity accompanied the rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakdown Or Bottom? On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone After that peak, the structure changes. Through early and mid-2025, the histogram becomes more mixed, with smaller positive and negative reads as price oscillates broadly between roughly $0.12 and $0.30. Heading into late 2025, however, the chart shows a pronounced sequence of red bars, with net outflows extending down toward roughly −5 to −6 billion DOGE while the price trends lower from the mid-$0.20s toward the low-$0.20s and below. The final data point, emphasized by a circular highlight on the right edge of the chart, marks a clear break in that pattern: a tall green bar crosses back above the zero line, indicating that net flows have turned positive again. At that moment, the price line sits slightly above the $0.15 mark on the vertical scale. Martinez interprets this as a “major rebound signal,” pointing to previous instances where a similar transition from persistent outflows to strong inflows coincided with sharp directional moves. DOGE On Thin Ice Below $0.16 A second chart he shared, an ATH-partitioned UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), sets out where the current DOGE supply last moved on-chain. A single, dominant bar appears around $0.07392452 and accounts for 28,260,298,271.803 DOGE, or 18.62% of the measured supply. Martinez summarizes this by stating that 27.4 billion DOGE have accumulated at roughly $0.08, calling it the “most significant support level.” Between that $0.07–$0.08 block and approximately $0.16, the URPD shows a shaded “GAP” with only small intermediate bars around levels such as $0.096, $0.125 and $0.155. Above the gap, a smaller but still notable cluster appears at about $0.162633395, containing 4,399,496,300.739 DOGE (2.9% of supply). “Below $0.16, support for Dogecoin $DOGE disappears quickly,” Martinez warns, adding that the “next real demand zone sits at $0.07.” Related Reading: One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst A third chart, a cost-basis distribution heatmap, tracks DOGE’s price against horizontal bands representing where holders’ cost bases are concentrated. It confirms two core cohorts: a lower band between $0.0812497 and $0.08279775 with 27,397,971,652.123432 DOGE, and an upper band from $0.20103297 to $0.20486326 containing 12,156,333,652.493444 DOGE. Together with the newly positive exchange flows, these data points define a market caught between a dense realized floor around $0.08 and a substantial holder cluster near $0.20, with the latest flow reversal now in focus for traders tracking DOGE’s next move. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.158.

54631970,630587,1763600432,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54631970.jpeg,First Bitcoin-Backed Municipal Bond Launches In New Hampshire,https://bitcoinist.com/first-bitcoin-backed-municipal-bond-new-hampshire/,"New Hampshire has authorized the first US municipal security explicitly backed by Bitcoin, approving a $100 million “conduit” bond that uses over-collateralized BTC rather than tax revenues or project cash flows as its primary backstop. The decision by the state’s Business Finance Authority (BFA) positions New Hampshire as an early test bed for integrating digital assets into the roughly $140 trillion global bond market. New Hampshire Continues To Lead US States Into Bitcoin Adoption Governor Kelly Ayotte framed the move as a way to attract capital while insulating residents from balance-sheet risk, saying she is “proud that New Hampshire is once again first in the nation to embrace new technologies with this historic Bitcoin-backed bond,” and calling it “an innovative way to bring more investment opportunities to our state and position us as a leader in digital finance without risking state funds or taxpayer dollars.” The bond follows a standard conduit structure: the BFA authorizes the issuance, but the credit risk rests with the private borrower, not the state’s general fund. What is novel is the collateral package. The borrower must post about 160 percent of the bond’s notional value in Bitcoin, held by digital asset custodian BitGo . If BTC’s price falls and the collateralization ratio approaches roughly 130 percent, automatic liquidation of part of the Bitcoin stack is triggered to protect bondholders and preserve principal. The BFA oversees the framework but does not guarantee repayment. SCOOP: New Hampshire Launches First Bitcoin-Backed Municipal Bond The Granite State just became the first to approve a muni bond backed by $BTC , a milestone that could pave the way for digital assets to enter the $140 trillion global debt market. https://t.co/18XTtMK9Tw — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 19, 2025 The structure was designed by Wave Digital Assets and municipal specialist Rosemawr Management, with BitGo as custodian and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe as legal counsel. Wave co-founder Les Borsai described the transaction as “the opening of a new debt market,” arguing that it shows how “public and private sectors can collaborate to responsibly unlock the value of digital assets.” Orrick partner Orion Mountainspring called it “the first municipal security backed by cryptocurrency” and a potential “game-changer for digital currency and municipal finance.” Fees and any Bitcoin appreciation associated with the transaction will flow into a dedicated Bitcoin Economic Development Fund, intended to support innovation and business growth in the state, rather than the general budget. The bond also dovetails with New Hampshire’s recently authorized Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which allows the state treasury to allocate up to 5 percent of funds into highly capitalized digital assets, in practice making Bitcoin the only viable candidate under today’s market conditions. Republican representative Keith Ammon, the driving force behind much of the state’s Bitcoin legislation, has presented the framework as a controlled way to test BTC as high-grade collateral for public finance without exposing taxpayers to direct losses. Because the bond is not a general-obligation security and relies on over-collateralization plus pre-defined liquidation thresholds, officials argue that Bitcoin’s volatility is ring-fenced within the structure. Whether the model scales beyond this initial authorization will depend on investor demand, pricing and ratings treatment once an actual borrower brings a deal to market. For now, New Hampshire has moved the concept of Bitcoin-backed public debt from theory into the machinery of US municipal finance, creating a live template other states and issuers can study or choose to emulate. At press time, BTC traded at $91,401.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 01:00:32

54633793,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=864645,1763602990,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54633793.jpeg,Semrush joins Adobe to power next-gen generative AI marketing,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/adobe-snaps-up-semrush-to-power-ai-marketing/,"Adobe has reached a deal to acquire Semrush in a cash transaction for approximately $1.9 billion, the companies announced on Wednesday. Adobe’s acquisition is a bold step in the broader effort to develop its generative AI marketing capabilities further and reveal how to make brands more visible across the digital landscape. Adobe says it will purchase Semrush at $12 a share, a premium of roughly 77.5% above Semrush’s recent trading price. Following the announcement, Semrush shares surged more than 74%, suggesting investor enthusiasm was evident. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending approval from regulatory authorities and shareholders. Adobe is acquiring the firm to integrate Semrush’s generative engine optimization and search engine optimization solutions into its Experience Cloud tools, which include Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Analytics. The aim is to help marketers understand not just how its brand looks on more conventional websites, but also how it appears in AI-powered interfaces, including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini . Adobe’s President of Digital Experience, Anil Chakravarthy, presented the acquisition as a response to a new battleground in a rapidly evolving landscape. Generative AI, when deployed to search for and discover brands, is a significant way for companies that don’t adapt to this new “engine” to be left behind, putting them at risk of irrelevance. Semrush’s Chief Executive, Bill Wagner, also stated that the merger will provide marketers with a 360-degree view of the brand’s engagements—whether on owned channels, the broader web, or AI-driven platforms. Semrush powers marketing with big data insights Semrush had been steadily growing ever since. In Semrush’s Q2 2025 earnings report , ARR grew to $435.3 million, representing approximately 15% year-over-year growth, fueled by large customers such as Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and TikTok. Semrush is well-positioned from a financial standpoint, with an ARR exceeding $400M and a non-GAAP operating margin of greater than 12%. The site serves approximately 117,000 clients – including tens of Fortune 500 companies— and still generates substantial revenue. For Adobe, the deal is, to some degree, about tools — it’s a way into systems that help marketing teams decide how and where to advertise online, from the relative tide pools of banner ads, tweets on Twitter, and posts on Facebook. Semrush’s data and platform enable Adobe to serve up something distinct: A look at what is possible with traditional SEO, as well as how GEO is just starting to change. Adobe plans to incorporate Semrush’s functions across its Experience Cloud and new developments – such as Adobe Brand Concierge, which is expected soon- to enable marketers to attend to their marketing needs in one place. This provides Adobe with greater capabilities to help brands work with massive language models and chat-based discovery — not just ranking search engine databases, but also being seen by AIs. This integration between Adobe’s creative offerings and Semrush’s marketing intelligence enables brands to create a seamless content creation process while gaining access to a wealth of visibility information. Integration hurdles could slow Adobe’s plans The deal is significant from a strategic perspective, but it is a tough one. Adobe is paying a steep premium, while Semrush has not yet experienced clear, standalone growth. Analysts say it prioritizes strategic value over short-term financial benefits, rather than immediate profits. To be successful, Adobe must seamlessly integrate Semrush’s platform into a single, unified system that minimizes disruptions to the existing business and customer experience. Buyers of these services are also likely to be sensitive to price increases, as Adobe will own the software. If an acquisition succeeds, it could be a game-changing digital marketing technology, as even competitors such as Ahrefs, Moz, or other SEO platforms would likely compete with Adobe’s AI-first, integrated alternative. This move could also lead to cross-selling opportunities throughout Adobe’s creative, analytics, and marketing platforms, as well as establish its footing as a marketing powerhouse powered by AI.

Large institutional movements often signal upcoming market shifts. Moreover, this particular Bitmain wallet ETH withdrawal could indicate several possibilities: Strategic portfolio rebalancing by Bitmain Preparation for upcoming Ethereum network upgrades Institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value Potential involvement in decentralized finance protocols How Does This Impact Ethereum’s Market Position? The timing of this Bitmain wallet ETH withdrawal coincides with several key market developments. Ethereum has been showing resilience despite broader market fluctuations. Therefore, this massive movement could reinforce positive sentiment around the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Market analysts are closely watching how this Bitmain wallet ETH withdrawal might affect: Short-term price volatility for ETH Institutional adoption trends Exchange liquidity conditions Overall market confidence in major cryptocurrencies What Can We Learn From This Transaction?

Large movements often precede market trends that affect portfolios of all sizes. Understanding these institutional moves helps you: Anticipate potential market shifts Make better timing decisions for your investments Recognize patterns in cryptocurrency adoption Stay informed about major player strategies Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitmain and why is this withdrawal significant? Bitmain is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturers. Their substantial ETH holdings and movements can influence market sentiment and indicate institutional positioning. How was this transaction identified as belonging to Bitmain? Onchain analytics platforms like Onchainlens use pattern recognition, transaction history, and wallet behavior analysis to identify likely ownership of cryptocurrency addresses. Could this large withdrawal affect Ethereum’s price? While single transactions rarely determine market prices, large movements from known entities can influence trader psychology and potentially create short-term volatility. What does withdrawing from BitGo indicate? BitGo is a major institutional cryptocurrency custodian. Moving funds from custody services often signals preparation for active deployment rather than long-term storage. Is this type of large transaction common? While cryptocurrency sees billions in daily transactions, movements of this size from identified institutional wallets remain relatively rare and noteworthy. Should individual investors be concerned about such large movements? Not necessarily concerned, but aware. Understanding institutional behavior helps individual investors make more informed decisions about their own strategies.

This temporary halt in deposits and withdrawals comes as the platform prepares for a significant network upgrade. If you’re holding 0G tokens, understanding this development is essential for managing your digital assets effectively. Why Did Upbit Announce the 0G Suspension? The primary reason behind the Upbit 0G suspension is an upcoming hard fork for the ZeroGravity network. Hard forks represent major protocol changes that require temporary transaction halts. Therefore, Upbit must ensure all systems align with the new network specifications. This precautionary measure protects user funds during the transition period. How Does the Upbit 0G Suspension Impact Traders? The temporary Upbit 0G suspension means traders cannot move their ZeroGravity tokens during the specified period. However, it’s important to note that spot trading typically remains operational. Here’s what you need to know: Deposit and withdrawal functions will be temporarily disabled Existing 0G balances remain secure in your Upbit wallet Trading activities may continue depending on market conditions The suspension period usually lasts until network stability is confirmed What Should You Do During the Upbit 0G Suspension? While the Upbit 0G suspension is in effect, traders should monitor official communications closely. Upbit typically provides regular updates about the resumption timeline. Moreover, this temporary pause offers an opportunity to research the hard fork’s potential impact on 0G’s value proposition. When Will Normal Services Resume After the Upbit 0G Suspension? Exchange officials haven’t specified an exact timeline for lifting the Upbit 0G suspension . Historically, such interruptions last until the network upgrade completes successfully. The exchange will announce resumption through official channels once they verify network stability and security. Why Are Hard Forks Necessary for Cryptocurrencies Like 0G? Hard forks represent crucial evolution points for blockchain networks. The Upbit 0G suspension highlights how exchanges manage these technical transitions. Network upgrades often introduce enhanced features, improved security, or scalability solutions. Consequently, temporary inconveniences lead to long-term benefits for the ecosystem. What Can We Learn From This Upbit 0G Suspension? This Upbit 0G suspension demonstrates the cryptocurrency industry’s maturation. Exchanges now implement proactive measures to ensure user protection during network changes. While temporary, such suspensions reflect the industry’s commitment to security and technological progress. The temporary Upbit 0G suspension serves as a reminder that blockchain technology continues evolving. Though inconvenient for short-term traders, these necessary pauses ensure long-term network health and security. As the cryptocurrency landscape matures, such procedural suspensions become standard practice during significant upgrades. Frequently Asked Questions How long will the Upbit 0G suspension last? The duration varies depending on network upgrade completion. Upbit will announce the exact resumption time through official channels. Can I still trade 0G during the suspension? Spot trading typically continues unless otherwise specified. However, deposit and withdrawal functions remain temporarily disabled. Will my 0G tokens be safe during the suspension? Yes, your tokens remain secure in your Upbit wallet. The suspension primarily affects transaction functions rather than storage security. Why do exchanges suspend services during hard forks? Exchanges pause services to ensure compatibility with new network protocols and prevent potential transaction errors or fund loss. How will I know when services resume? Upbit will make official announcements through their website, social media channels, and app notifications. Should I be worried about the hard fork? Hard forks are routine network upgrades. The temporary suspension demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to user protection during technical transitions. Found this guide helpful?

54633907,630438,1763604029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54633907.jpeg,"Bitmine Keeps Buying Ethereum Despite Market Drop: 21,054 ETH Arrive In New Wallet",https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-keeps-buying-ethereum-despite-market-drop/,"Ethereum has come under heavy selling pressure over the past few days as the broader crypto market entered a deep corrective phase. Yet, despite the volatility and widespread fear, ETH has managed to hold firmly above the key $3,000 level — a zone many analysts consider essential for maintaining the broader bullish structure. Now, as price stabilizes and buyers begin to re-emerge, several market observers are starting to call for a potential recovery, arguing that Ethereum may be nearing the end of its downturn. Adding fuel to this narrative is the continued accumulation from major players, most notably Tom Lee’s Bitmine. Tom Lee — a well-known Wall Street strategist, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, and long-time Bitcoin and Ethereum bull — has been one of the most influential voices in the digital asset market for nearly a decade. His firm Bitmine operates as a large institutional crypto investment entity focused on long-term accumulation, market-making, and strategic positioning during periods of fear. According to recent on-chain data, Bitmine has continued buying ETH even as prices fell, signaling strong conviction in the asset’s long-term outlook. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the broader market, where short-term holders have been capitulating. Bitmine Continues Accumulating ETH Despite Market Weakness According to fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain, accumulation activity around Ethereum is far from slowing down. A newly flagged wallet, 0xE2ed, believed to be associated with Tom Lee’s Bitmine, received 21,054 ETH (worth $66.57 million) from Kraken just a few hours ago. This move reinforces the view that large, sophisticated players are treating the recent correction as an opportunity rather than a threat. The timing of this transfer is notable. Ethereum has been under sustained selling pressure for weeks, with sentiment turning sharply bearish as the market grappled with fear, liquidations, and a broader rotation into stablecoins. Yet despite this environment, Bitmine-linked wallets continue to absorb supply aggressively. This pattern aligns with Bitmine’s broader strategy: accumulating high-quality crypto assets during periods of uncertainty to position for long-term upside. Large inflows to accumulation wallets during drawdowns have historically suggested strong conviction among institutional players, often preceding phases of recovery and renewed strength. Suppose this wallet is indeed tied to Bitmine. In that case, it signals that some of the market’s most well-capitalized participants remain confident in Ethereum’s long-term value, regardless of short-term volatility. ETH Price Analysis: Testing Long-Term Support Amid Heavy Volatility Ethereum’s weekly chart shows the asset navigating a critical zone as price hovers just above $3,000, a level that has historically acted as a major demand area. After weeks of sustained selling pressure, ETH has pulled back from the $4,500 region and is now retesting its long-term moving averages. The 200-week MA, in particular, is positioned closely beneath the current price, acting as a structural anchor that has supported Ethereum in previous cycle corrections, including the deep capitulation seen in mid-2022 and the recovery phase of 2023. The recent candle structure reflects heightened volatility, with long wicks suggesting strong reactions from buyers near the $3,000 threshold. Volume has increased slightly during this downturn, indicating active participation from both sellers locking in profits and buyers positioning for potential reversal. Yet ETH remains below its 50-week MA, showing that short-term momentum continues to lean bearish. Still, the broader pattern resembles earlier cycle pullbacks where Ethereum retraced sharply before forming higher lows and resuming its macro uptrend. If ETH can maintain this support band and reclaim the $3,300–$3,500 region, it may signal renewed strength. But a weekly close below $3,000 risks opening the door to deeper correction targets near $2,700.

As the global financial system moves toward higher costs, weaker currencies, and increasing inefficiencies, BTC is emerging as the most compelling alternative because it works more effectively. Economic Pressure Points That Will Accelerate Bitcoin Uptake In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital finance, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin’s future has often been intertwined with fervent ideological conviction. A media company, known as TFTC on X, has highlighted why BTC adoption won’t be driven by ideology, but rather by economics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Accepted By 4 Million Businesses, Thanks To Jack Dorsey Every merchant today is focused on handing over 2–3% of every transaction to payment processors and lives under the constant threat of chargebacks. Especially for small businesses, those costs and risks compound fast. However, BTC eliminates all of it with no processing fees, no chargebacks, just instant, final settlement straight into the merchant’s wallet. As Miles, a crypto enthusiast, consistently pointed out, the economic incentives are so overwhelmingly strong that adoption becomes inevitable. Merchants save thousands on fees, and they can pass those savings back to their customers through instant cashback rewards for using BTC. This dynamic creates a self-reinforcing flywheel effect, allowing Merchants to lower their operational costs and increase their profit margins. At the same time, consumers would get tangible rewards and better value for their money by simply using BTC. Both sides will benefit immensely, while the BTC network will grow stronger. When the underlying math is this incredibly favorable, adoption is no longer a philosophical stance, but it’s an economic certainty. The Path To Reclaiming Bullish Momentum While the economic incentives will be responsible for Bitcoin’s next rally, analyst Rekt Capital has revealed a historical demand area, marked in orange, which has played a pivotal role in dictating BTC’s next major trend. The first time price tapped this zone, it produced a sharp +20% rebound before breaking down. After this breakdown, the BTC price moved to lower levels to absorb the remaining buy-side liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Bullish Confluence: Death Cross And Key Support Signal Upside Once BTC reclaimed the orange region as support, it triggered a +37% rally to new all-time highs. On the second retest, this same support zone showed signs of strength. Currently, BTC is finding support at this same historical demand area. What would happen next will be critical in determining whether this demand area will continue to strengthen or if signs of weakening will finally emerge. Furthermore, BTC will need to break the multi-week downtrend, marked in black on the chart, to relieve fear of fading support. A rebound from this demand area that fails to break the multi-week downtrend would only result in a yield of +10% move, which suggests that the support zone may be weakening.

Officials say it’s an unprecedented scale mission, even comparing it to the Manhattan Project and the space race. The administration views AI not only as a technological tool but also as a strategic asset vital to national security, economic growth, and global influence. Genesis Mission will enlist national laboratories nationwide to ramp up research on next-generation AI technologies. Officials are also aiming to develop greater alignment among government agencies, tech organizations, and academic institutions through strong public-private partnerships, laying the groundwork for a robust, coordinated ecosystem around the development of artificial intelligence. Its goal, officials note, would be to expedite scientific innovation and put the U.S. at the forefront of the global AI race. The mission will span various fields, including data science and computing, engineering, materials science, and neuroscience, senior officials said. The administration also hopes to drive breakthroughs that will change not only the economy and national defense but also our destiny itself by ensuring that the best research efforts link with industry, federal resources, and its people. Administration moves to centralize AI regulation Alongside the Genesis Mission, the Trump administration is drafting an executive order that will solidify its authority over the regulation of AI within the federal government. It would permit the federal government to challenge state laws it deems unconstitutional and potentially restrict federal funds for states with so-called overly restrictive statutes. A patchwork of state rules, officials say, may hinder innovation, increase costs for companies, and create uncertainty for U.S. AI developers. The centralization of a federal scheme will create a single set of standards, aiming to streamline the regulatory environment and encourage companies to scale technologies rapidly. The order also sends a clear message to the private sector: the federal government will be the primary source of rules governing artificial intelligence nationwide, thereby reducing the potential for disparities across states. Simplified federal oversight is a tool to promote innovation in the digital age while ensuring that AI efforts align with national priorities. At the same time, it portends possible legal and political disputes over federal vs. state power that could loom in the next few months. Trump pushes U.S. to lead the global AI race Genesis Mission is part of a broader plan to keep the United States at the forefront of global AI development. Global competitors, most notably China, claim to have attempted to stoke aggressive growth in AI under more centralized regulatory regimes. The administration views the United States as poised to fall behind technologically and strategically unless it takes proactive steps. These objectives include improving existing research infrastructure while building new data centers and advanced high-tech supercomputing systems. The administration intends to accelerate the deployment of AI through a combination of federal research and private-sector innovations in areas such as scientific discovery, defense, healthcare, and industrial applications. Experts say the efforts are grand, but it has their traps. There will be legal issues with states regarding federal power, and expedited efforts could overlook important ethical considerations, such as data privacy and minimizing bias. However, the administration is presenting Genesis Mission as the most effective solution for protecting our tech future. Genesis Mission, which envisions the United States as being the world’s most innovative, capable, influential, and competitive nation in artificial intelligence, builds state-of-the-art research, regulation, and industrial cooperation at an unprecedented level.

Just hours ago, this pioneering Bitcoin investor transferred his entire remaining holdings of 2,499 BTC to the Kraken exchange, a transaction valued at an astonishing $228 million. This massive transfer from a long-term Bitcoin investor immediately sparked intense speculation across financial markets. Why Would a Bitcoin Investor Make Such a Massive Move? When a seasoned Bitcoin investor moves this amount of cryptocurrency to an exchange, the crypto community takes immediate notice. Large-scale deposits typically signal one thing: potential selling activity. However, experienced Bitcoin investors sometimes have multiple strategies beyond simple liquidation. This particular Bitcoin investor might be considering various options including: Portfolio rebalancing strategies Taking profits after substantial gains Preparing for other investment opportunities Estate planning or wealth management moves The timing of this Bitcoin investor’s decision comes during a period of relative market stability, making the move even more noteworthy for market analysts. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Markets? Market reactions to large transfers from early Bitcoin investors often create immediate ripple effects. When a prominent Bitcoin investor moves hundreds of millions in cryptocurrency, it typically triggers several market responses. Trading volumes often spike as other investors react to the news. Price volatility can increase significantly as market participants interpret the Bitcoin investor’s intentions. However, it’s crucial to remember that not every exchange deposit leads to immediate selling. Some Bitcoin investors use exchanges for other purposes like: Securing assets in exchange wallets Preparing for staking or lending activities Facilitating institutional transactions Diversifying across multiple platforms Understanding Early Bitcoin Investor Psychology Early Bitcoin investors like Owen Gunden possess unique market perspectives having witnessed Bitcoin’s journey from obscurity to mainstream adoption. Their moves often carry significant weight because these Bitcoin investors have demonstrated remarkable patience and conviction through multiple market cycles. When such a Bitcoin investor makes a substantial move, it’s worth examining potential motivations beyond surface-level interpretations. These seasoned Bitcoin investors typically consider factors that newer market participants might overlook. Their decisions often reflect deep understanding of market cycles, regulatory developments, and technological advancements affecting cryptocurrency valuations. Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts This development offers valuable lessons for anyone interested in cryptocurrency markets. The move by this early Bitcoin investor demonstrates several important principles about cryptocurrency investing. Market movements by established Bitcoin investors provide learning opportunities for understanding market dynamics. Large transactions remind us about the importance of having clear investment strategies regardless of market conditions. Moreover, this situation highlights why monitoring blockchain activity through services like Lookonchain has become essential for serious market participants tracking significant Bitcoin investor behavior. Frequently Asked Questions Why do large Bitcoin deposits to exchanges often indicate selling? Exchanges provide the liquidity needed for large sales. When Bitcoin investors move significant amounts to exchanges, they’re typically preparing to convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency or other assets. How early is Owen Gunden as a Bitcoin investor? While specific details about his initial acquisition aren’t public, holding 2,499 BTC suggests very early involvement, potentially dating back to Bitcoin’s earlier years when prices were substantially lower. Could this Bitcoin deposit have other purposes besides selling? Absolutely. While selling is the most common interpretation, Bitcoin investors sometimes use exchanges for staking, lending, or transferring between accounts. Some institutional transactions also require exchange intermediation. How might this affect Bitcoin’s price? Large potential sell pressure can create short-term volatility, but Bitcoin’s market depth has grown significantly. Single transactions, while large, rarely dictate long-term price trends in today’s mature market. Should retail investors follow early Bitcoin investors’ moves? While educational, retail investors should make decisions based on personal research and risk tolerance rather than blindly following any single Bitcoin investor’s actions. How can I track large cryptocurrency movements? Blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Chainalysis, and various on-chain analysis tools allow monitoring of significant cryptocurrency transactions in real-time.

In 2028, $SACHI is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $0.65, with an average price of $0.45. By 2031, $SACHI could trade between $0.60 and $1.35, with an average price of $0.95 SACHI is one of the new players in the Web3 gaming world. The coin combines high-quality Unreal Engine 5 graphics with blockchain-based economies to make a gaming universe that is always available and immersive. SACHI focuses on gameplay first and tokens second. Its “play first, wallet later” philosophy gives its token holders console-quality experiences right away—no wallet, no setup, no hassle—making it one of the easiest Web3 games to get into so far. SACHI is also building the foundation for a modern, seamless, and deeply social gaming world with help from major infrastructure partners like Microsoft Azure and Aethir, as well as real-time pixel-streaming technology. With the recent listing (November 19, 2025) of the $SACHI token on MEXC, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is $SACHI likely to go up? What will $SACHI be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the SACHI price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency SACHI Ticker $SACHI Current Price $0.07495 Market Cap – Trading Volume (24-Hour) $213.45K Circulating Supply 560,000,000 SACHI All-time High – All-time Low – 24-hour High $0.13311 24-hour Low $0.036 $SACHI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.07495 Price Prediction $0.09 Fear & Greed Index – Sentiment – Volatility – Green Days – 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI – $SACHI price analysis $SACHI/USDT price analysis 1-day chart The 1-day chart on Nov 20 shows that $SACHI is very volatile after its MEXC launch. There is a huge change from $0.03600 to $0.13311, and then the price stays stable around $0.074–$0.075. This pattern shows that the initial listing spike has cooled off and the market is now looking for a fair value zone. SACHI/USD chart by mexc.co The price is stable because the candle body is tight and the volume is low. If buyers stay above $0.07, SACHI might try to test the $0.10–$0.13 zone again. But if it drops below $0.06, it could go down even more to $0.045–$0.05. What happens next depends on how much volume comes back. If it doesn’t, $SACHI may trade sideways for a while. $SACHI/USDT price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart for $SACHI shows price movements that happen very early and are very volatile, but there isn’t much structure because it just got listed. The huge green candle that went from $0.036 to $0.13311 suggests that the first breakout was aggressive and was probably caused by listing hype and low liquidity. $ SACHI/USD chart by mexc.co Since then, the price has stayed around $0.074–$0.075, forming small red candles that show momentum is slowing down, but there hasn’t been a clear reversal yet. The market is still figuring out what fair value is because there aren’t any moving averages or trend structures. $SACHI might test $0.10 again if interest rises, and it might test $0.05 support again if interest falls. Expect prices to move up and down until there is more liquidity. $SACHI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 – – SMA 5 – – SMA 10 – – SMA 21 – – SMA 50 – – SMA 100 – – SMA 200 – – Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 – – EMA 5 – – EMA 10 – – EMA 21 – – EMA 50 – – EMA 100 – – EMA 200 – – What to expect from $SACHI price analysis next? SACHI’s price movements show that there will be some early-stage volatility as the token settles down after its debut on MEXC. The market is now looking for a fair value range after a strong start that sent the price up to $0.13311 and then settled around $0.074–$0.08. If more people buy and the listing keeps going up, SACHI could test the $0.10–$0.13 zone again. But because there isn’t much liquidity and there isn’t much historical data, pullbacks to $0.050–$0.060 are still possible. Short-term movement will depend a lot on what happens on the exchanges, how involved the community is, and any announcements about the ecosystem that are coming up. Expect a lot of ups and downs, but also some attempts to go up as more people become aware. Is $SACHI a good investment? SACHI aims to build a big gaming ecosystem on Unreal Engine 5 and get people to sign up by using its “play-first, wallet-later” model and listing on MEXC. It has a lot of potential, but it’s still in the early stages. The token might be worth keeping an eye on if you believe in the execution of its roadmap, the growth of the gaming Web3 space, and SACHI’s community momentum. But if you care more about lower risk or proven fundamentals, SACHI might be too risky right now. What will $SACHI be worth in 2025? By the end of 2025, SACHI is expected to reach a maximum price of $0.09 How much will $SACHI cost in 2030? According to analysts’ predictions, $SACHI Token is predicted to trade at an average price of $0.72, with a maximum price of $1.05 by 2030. Can $SACHI reach $20? SACHI is still very early in its development, so it’s very unlikely that it will reach $20. To reach that level, there would need to be a huge increase in value, a lot of people using it, listings on major exchanges, and a big drop in the amount of coins in circulation. $20 is still way too high for realistic short-term expectations unless SACHI becomes a top-tier gaming ecosystem. Where to buy $SACHI? Users can purchase $SACHI at MEXC Global, which is the main centralized exchange where $SACHI is officially listed and actively traded. You can also find it on some supported markets, like Holder.io, which shows the SACHI/USDT trading pairs. Before you buy, always check the official contract address and make sure you’re using a trusted exchange. Will $SACHI reach $10? It’s very unlikely that SACHI will reach $10 under the current conditions. To reach $10 from its recent range of about $0.07 to $0.08, it would need to grow by more than 100 times, which would require a lot of new users, a lot of new exchanges, and steady growth in the ecosystem. $10 is still very speculative and unlikely to happen in the near future because there are no proven long-term fundamentals or large-scale demand. Will $SACHI reach $100? Under any realistic market conditions, it is almost impossible for SACHI to reach $100. To reach $100 at its current price, it would need to rise by thousands of percent and push its market cap into the tens of billions, which is much higher than what most early-stage gaming tokens can do. For SACHI to get to that level, it would need a lot of people around the world to start using it, a lot of major exchanges to list it, a lot of new users to join, and a lot of coins to be taken out of circulation. None of these things are happening yet. Even though crypto can be unpredictable, $100 is not a reasonable or likely goal for SACHI based on its fundamentals, maturity, and tokenomics. Does $SACHI have a good long-term future? SACHI has a lot of potential if it can make its AAA Web3 gaming universe a reality, get a lot of players, and keep making good partnerships with companies like Microsoft Azure and Aethir. Its “play first, wallet later” model is different and might appeal to regular gamers. But it’s still very early, very speculative, and completely dependent on how well it’s done. There is a chance of long-term success, but it is not certain. Recent news/opinion on $SACHI Recent news about $ SACHI has gotten a lot of attention because the token is at a very important time for its ecosystem. The November 19 listing on MEXC Global lets gamers and traders from all over the world join in. It comes after the token generation event on November 18. The token’s “play-first, wallet-later” Web3 gaming model and community incentives based on airdrops helped it get more attention and gain traction early on. Its partnerships with Microsoft Azure, Aethir, and TokaCity show how big its goals are. But because the project is still in its early stages, is speculative, and has a short trading history, $ SACHI is still a high-risk investment. Community involvement and interest in real-world gaming will be important in figuring out if the hype turns into real value. $SACHI price prediction November 2025 The price of Hedera is expected to be at least $0.05 in November 2025.

SACHI price prediction 2027 By 2027, SACHI’s average market price is projected to reach $0.32, with a possible low of $0.20 and a high of $0.46, driven by gaming adoption and infrastructure upgrades.

SACHI price forecast 2029 By 2029, SACHI’s average price is forecast at $0.58, with a potential low of $0.36 and a high of $0.82, supported by maturing GameFi demand and deeper ecosystem integration. SACHI ($SACHI) price prediction 2030 By 2030, SACHI’s average market price may reach $0.72, with lows around $0.48 and highs of $1.05. However, this is due to sustained Web3 gaming growth at this time. SACHI price prediction 2031 By 2031, SACHI’s average price is expected to be $0.95, with a projected low of $0.60 and a peak potential of $1.35, assuming mass adoption, stable tokenomics, and expansion into mainstream gaming. $SACHI price predictions 2025 – 2030 $SACHI market price prediction: Analysts’ $SACHI price forecast Firm Name 2025 2026 Mexc $0.036 $0.0378 Cryptopolitan’s SACHI ($SACHI) price prediction Cryptopolitan forecasts $SACHI price to range between $0.07 and $0.80 by the end of 2025.

CRCL's business is still heavily reliant on USDC issuance and short-term interest rates, though, making it vulnerable to both falling interest rates and a potential crypto market downturn. While I believe there could still be further downside, I am now more neutral on Circle's stock after the recent decline. Circle's ( CRCL ) third-quarter results were strong, with efforts to diversify revenue beginning to pay off. This will only play out slowly, though, and in the meantime there is little to prevent a complete implosion of Circle's business in the event of a recession. I previously highlighted the enormous risks Circle was facing, and its share price is down over 40% since then. Short-term interest rates continue to fall, although this has been fairly modest so far. Bitcoin's price is also down materially in recent weeks, which could temper demand for stablecoins. Despite this, I am now more neutral on Circle's stock after the recent decline, as the longer term narrative remains fairly compelling. Having said that, there will little to support Circle's share price if macro conditions continue to deteriorate. Market Conditions The most important recent development for stablecoins is the introduction of a far more favorable regulatory environment. While the full impact likely won't be felt for some time, Circle is best positioned to capitalize on this situation due to its focus on compliance. Stablecoins in circulation increased 59% YoY in Q3, supported by surging markets. Circle’s market share also increased to 29% in the quarter. Stablecoin transaction volumes were reportedly up around 130% YoY, with USDC’s share growing to 40%. While this is positive, the recent market pullback is likely to temper demand for stablecoins in the short term. If this situation evolves into a bear market or recession, USDC's market capitalization could drop significantly, despite secular tailwinds. Figure 1: Bitcoin Price and USDC Market Capitalization (source: Created by author using data from) Circle Business Updates Circle's business continues to be dominated by the issuance of USDC, a US-dollar-denominated stablecoin. Circle also now offers the EURC stablecoin, but its market cap is still negligible. This is important as it means that Circle's revenue is predominantly dependent on short-term interest rates. Circle is building financial infrastructure that extends well beyond just USDC, though. This includes the Arc layer-1 blockchain, which is tailored for stablecoins. Circle recently launched the Arc public testnet with more than 100 participants. While this is an interesting strategic move, it is not guaranteed to be successful. Arc faces fierce competition, and it is a late entrant into the market. This must be weighed against the fact that Circle has a distribution advantage and could use incentives to drive adoption. For example, Circle is already considering introducing a native token on the Arc Network. Circle also offers CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol), an infrastructure solution that enables the movement of USDC across blockchains, improving liquidity and the user experience. CCTP volume reached 31.3 billion USD in Q3, up 640% YoY. Circle has suggested that this represented around 47% of the bridged volumes that it tracks. Circle also has the Circle Payments Network, a stablecoin payments solution targeted at financial institutions. It abstracts the complexity of the underlying blockchain system and enables fast, low-cost, and compliant global payments. CPN was only launched in May 2025 but is already seeing significant transaction volume growth. Support for 5 new chains was added in the quarter, and Circle continues to expand the CPN product portfolio. This includes CPN Console, a self-service solution for CPN members, and CPN Payouts, which enables automated stablecoin payouts on CPN. There are now 29 network members and a pipeline of 500 financial institutions waiting to join. CPN transaction volume is currently at around a 3.4 billion USD annual run rate. The other important part of Circle's business at the moment is USYC, a tokenized money market fund. Circle acquired this product to support the rising use of yield-bearing digital assets as collateral in margin trading. USYC is now the second largest TMMF globally, with roughly 1 billion USD AUM. Financial Analysis USDC in circulation reached almost 74 billion USD in the third quarter, an increase of 108% YoY. Onchain transactions using USDC also grew 580% YoY to 9.6 trillion USD. Revenue and reserve income was only up 66% to 740 million USD though, with lower interest rates offsetting a substantial portion of the volume increase (return on reserves of ~4.15%). Transaction revenue totaled 4.7 million USD in the quarter. Other revenue was 29 million USD in Q3, up from less than 1 million USD in the prior year's comparable quarter. Subscription and services revenue totaled 23.6 million USD, which primarily relates to blockchain network partnerships. Circle hasn't given specific near-term revenue guidance. USDC in circulation is expected to grow at a 40% CAGR over a multi-year period, though, which probably puts revenue growth at less than a 30% CAGR. Circle also now expects 90-100 million USD Other Revenue in 2025, which would mean that Other Revenue is fairly flat sequentially. Given the underlying trends in the business, this guidance appears overly conservative. Figure 2: Circle Revenue (source: Created by author using data from Circle) Total distribution and transaction and other costs increased 74% YoY in Q3 to 448 million USD. The increase was driven by distribution incentives and growth of USDC balances held on Coinbase's platform. As a result, Circle's RLDC margin declined to 39.5%. Circle's adjusted operating expenses only increased 35% YoY to 131 million USD though, with adjusted EBITDA reaching 166 million USD at a 22% margin. While Circle has a highly profitable business, this would soon change if interest rates were to drop significantly. Figure 3: Circle Margins (source: Created by author using data from Circle) Conclusion I remain skeptical of Circle's business due to its current dependence on interest rates and cryptocurrency speculation. The company is moving in the right direction, though, with its infrastructure solutions and tokenized money market fund continuing to grow rapidly. It will likely be years before these alternative revenue sources are large enough to justify Circle's current market capitalization. In the meantime, weakening economic conditions continue to present a serious threat to Circle's share price. Despite this, I am now more neutral on Circle's stock, as it could soon find support after the recent decline.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-20 02:32:22

Speaking at the Devconnect conference, Buterin expressed deep concerns that institutional money might compromise the very Ethereum values that made the network revolutionary. Why Are Ethereum Values So Important? Ethereum values represent the foundational principles that distinguish the network from traditional financial systems. These include decentralization, permissionless access, and censorship resistance. However, Buterin warns that these core Ethereum values face unprecedented challenges from institutional investors seeking to reshape the ecosystem for their own benefit. The Two Major Threats to Ethereum’s Future Buterin outlined two critical dangers that could emerge from excessive institutional influence: Community Exodus: The original builders and developers who created Ethereum’s infrastructure might abandon the project if it becomes merely a tool for large corporations Decentralization Collapse: Regular users and node operators could be priced out if technology development focuses exclusively on institutional needs How Can We Protect Ethereum Values? Buterin emphasized that preserving these essential Ethereum values requires conscious effort and strategic planning. The solution lies in developing protocols that remain: Global and accessible to everyone Permissionless without gatekeepers Censorship-resistant against external control What Makes a Strong Ethereum Community? A dedicated community committed to Ethereum values serves as the network’s first line of defense. This community must actively participate in governance, run nodes, and develop applications that serve diverse users rather than just institutional interests. The strength of these Ethereum values depends on everyday users maintaining control. The Path Forward for Ethereum Values Maintaining authentic Ethereum values requires balancing growth with principles. While institutional investment brings capital and legitimacy, it must not come at the cost of the network’s founding ideals. The community must remain vigilant in protecting the Ethereum values that make the platform unique in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions What are the core Ethereum values Buterin mentioned? The core Ethereum values include decentralization, permissionless access, censorship resistance, and community-driven development that serves diverse users rather than concentrated interests. How could institutional investors threaten Ethereum? Institutions might push for changes that prioritize their needs over regular users, potentially making node operation too expensive for individuals and centralizing control. What solutions did Buterin propose? Buterin emphasized developing global, permissionless protocols and strengthening community commitment to Ethereum’s original principles. Can Ethereum survive without institutional money? Yes, Ethereum initially grew through community support. While institutions bring benefits, the network’s survival depends on maintaining its core values above all. How can regular users help protect Ethereum values? Users can run nodes, participate in governance, support decentralized applications, and advocate for policies that maintain accessibility. Is this concern unique to Ethereum? While all decentralized networks face similar challenges, Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract platform makes it particularly vulnerable to institutional capture.

Analysts Weigh In After ETF Momentum Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/can-xrp-really-overtake-ethereum-analysts-weigh-in-after-etf-momentum-builds/,"The crypto market is buzzing after the launch of the first U.S. spot XRP ETFs, a development that has injected fresh institutional energy into the asset. Related Reading: Famous Trader Bets $27 Million That The XRP Price Will Crash With multiple high-performing firms entering the race, including Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale, a bold question is resurfacing across the industry: Can XRP realistically challenge Ethereum for the No. 2 spot in the global cryptocurrency rankings? XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP ETFs Ignite Institutional Momentum The launch of XRP ETFs in November 2025 marked a historic moment for the asset. Canary Capital’s XRPC debuted with over $58 million in first-day volume, the strongest ETF opening among hundreds launched this year. Franklin Templeton has now filed its Form 8-A to list the Franklin XRP ETF on NYSE Arca, signaling that another major player is just days away from going live. This influx of institutional interest mirrors the early phases of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF rollouts, characterized by short-term volatility followed by broader adoption. Though XRP’s price consolidated around the $2.12–$2.17 zone after the initial spike, analysts argue that ETF inflows operate with settlement lags through OTC desks. In other words, the actual impact on market price may not be realized until later. Can XRP Truly Compete With Ethereum’s Dominance? Despite XRP’s explosive year, marked by record utility, rising XRPL adoption, and Ripple’s $500 million strategic investment, the asset still faces a steep climb if it hopes to overtake Ethereum. Ethereum remains firmly in second place with a $373 billion market cap, supported by a massive ecosystem of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and tokenized assets. XRP, currently around $129 billion, operates on a network optimized for payments rather than programmable applications. Analysts note that while XRP’s institutional use cases are deepening, particularly in cross-border settlement, tokenization, and banking infrastructure, the lack of a native smart-contract layer limits its ability to mirror Ethereum’s developer-driven demand. For now, experts say that overtaking Ethereum is unlikely in the short to medium term. But with expanding utility, ETF-driven accumulation, and growing adoption in Japan, the U.S., and global banks, XRP’s market cap could still climb substantially. Price Outlook: Volatility Now, Bigger Moves Later From a technical standpoint, XRP is sitting at a critical support zone near $2.12, repeatedly testing the 0.382 Fibonacci level. Selling pressure remains present, with capital outflows and lower highs on the chart. Yet open interest has surged from $1 billion to over $6 billion since October, signaling strong trader engagement.

54635894,630766,1763607637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54635894.jpeg,$201M SOL Sell-Off Sparks More Fear: Can Solana Hold Above the $130 Support Zone?,https://bitcoinist.com/201m-sol-sell-off-sparks-more-fear-can-solana-hold/,"Solana (SOL) is under intense market pressure after a massive $201 million token transfer on November 17 sparked concerns about further losses. While institutional interest in Solana-based ETFs remains strong, technical indicators point to a fragile market structure that could send SOL toward the $125–$120 region if buyers fail to regain momentum. $201M Dump Raises Alarms as Solana Extends Downtrend Forward Industries, Solana’s largest corporate holder, moved 1.44 million SOL, worth roughly $201.34 million, to Coinbase Prime earlier this week, according to Onchain Lens . The transfer triggered speculation of an impending major sell-off, especially as Solana has already declined nearly 50% over the past two months. Although it remains unclear whether the tokens were sold or repositioned, the market reaction was swift. SOL briefly dipped to $128 before recovering to the $137 range. Trading volume, however, has declined by 38% to $5.65 billion, indicating elevated trader anxiety and aggressive repositioning. Technically, SOL remains in a confirmed downtrend after losing the critical $155 support level. Indicators such as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.18 and a bearish Supertrend signal show persistent selling pressure. If the price remains below the current consolidation zone, analysts warn of a potential 16% drop, placing $120 firmly in sight. Institutional Inflows Persist Despite Price Weakness The irony in Solana’s current situation is striking. Despite a weekly drop of 11%, institutional confidence is slowly picking up pace. Solana ETFs have rapidly expanded across major U.S. exchanges, with Fidelity, Canary, VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise all launching new SOL products in recent days. Fidelity’s $FSOL recorded $2.07 million in day-one inflows, while total net inflows across all U.S. Solana ETFs have soared to $420.4 million. Meanwhile, November 18 marked the 15th consecutive day of positive ETF inflows, totaling $26.2 million, led by Bitwise’s BSOL. This reflects a deeper narrative: institutional investors see Solana’s long-term fundamentals, speed, developer activity, and staking yields as compelling despite short-term volatility. Key Levels: Can SOL Hold Above $130? Analysts now highlight $125 and $120 as the most critical support zones. A failure to defend $130 could accelerate losses toward $120, with a deeper floor at $115. Conversely, a reclaim of $145, and ideally $160, would signal the first meaningful reversal in weeks. For now, Solana sits at a crossroads. Heavy selling pressure on one side, surging institutional conviction on the other. The next few days may determine whether SOL stabilizes or slides deeper into bearish territory.

His latest commentary presents the view that the broader crypto environment has entered a structural shift, one where assumptions are no longer reliable indicators of future performance. Rather than relying on historical patterns, he argues that new drivers now shape the direction of leading assets. ETF Influence and XRP’s Position At the center of his analysis is the belief that multiple exchange-traded funds dedicated to a single cryptocurrency fundamentally alter how that asset behaves. According to the researcher, once an asset reaches that stage, it is no longer confined to Bitcoin’s movements or the influence of cyclical trends that once defined the entire industry. He emphasizes that ETFs rely on liquidity, activity, and market demand. Not on adherence to legacy expectations about Bitcoin’s dominance or the traditional four-year cycle. Ripple Bull Winkle presents XRP as an example of this evolving structure. He suggests that even in the event of a Bitcoin downturn, XRP’s performance could remain unaffected. The reasoning behind this outlook lies in the presence of institutional participation and regulatory clarity , which he views as the primary factors driving modern market behavior. THE BREAKAWAY MOMENT HAS BEGUN Bitcoin can fall into a full bear market… and XRP will still be completely fine. Because once an asset gets multiple ETFs, it stops living under Bitcoin’s shadow. ETFs follow liquidity, not tradition. The four-year cycle everyone… — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 17, 2025 A Shift Away from Uniform Market Behavior The comparison he draws to the stock market underscores his point. In his view, the market is moving toward a landscape in which cryptocurrencies operate as distinct asset classes with unique catalysts, investor profiles, and liquidity conditions. He notes that major companies in traditional markets do not move in unison simply because they exist within the same sector. He expects digital assets to adopt the pattern. By this logic, XRP’s trajectory does not need to align with Bitcoin’s trends. He states that the introduction of ETFs has changed the market’s script, ushering in an era in which Bitcoin’s dominance gradually weakens while assets supported by utility and liquidity assume clearer, independent price structures. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions and Perspectives The discussion prompted responses from community members who shared similar interpretations of this evolving market framework. One commenter stated that comparing Bitcoin and XRP is inappropriate due to their differing purposes, adding that XRP’s long-term utility positions it differently within the market. Another user noted that ETF-driven assets should not be expected to follow Bitcoin’s historical bull and bear cycles, suggesting that future price action may resemble traditional market behavior rather than the halving-based patterns observed in previous years. Ripple Bull Winkle frames this moment as the beginning of a new phase for digital assets. His view positions XRP among the assets moving into a more defined and independent market identity, shaped by institutional mechanisms and real-world demand rather than legacy cycles.

Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,150 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $3,050 and entered a bearish zone. The decline gathered pace below $3,000 and the price dipped below $2,950. A low was formed at $2,870 and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,165 swing high to the $2,870 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $3,050 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,165 swing high to the $2,870 low. The next key resistance is near the $3,100 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,100 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,150 level. A clear move above the $3,150 resistance might send the price toward the $3,200 resistance. An upside break above the $3,200 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,320 resistance zone or even $3,350 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,100 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,000 level. The first major support sits near the $2,940 zone. A clear move below the $2,940 support might push the price toward the $2,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,820 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,750 and $2,740. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

The preferred shares all trading at a discount to par likely limit Strategy's ability to use those products for continued BTC purchases. Worse than that, Strategy likely has about $80 million in cash and roughly $150 million in dividend obligations due before the end of the year. The market seems to be daring the company to sell Bitcoin. I suspect it will simply keep diluting the common instead. Shares of Strategy ( MSTR ) have been in freefall since early October . MSTR falling in price is not something that I'm particularly surprised by given the declines in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I've been stressing caution through my MSTR coverage on Seeking Alpha for well over a year. Perhaps more important than the MSTR declines, Strategy's preferred stocks ( STRK )( STRF )( STRD )( STRC ) are now also collapsing. This directly challenges my prior thinking, and in this update, I'll detail why I think the market has lost confidence in Strategy's Bitcoin flywheel. The Preferred Stocks Are Unraveling Strategy Stocks (Seeking Alpha) As of writing, each of Strategy's preferred stocks is down significantly during intraday trading. These stocks are down between 3% and 8%. For income investments, these are absolutely massive moves. In recent months, I've made the case for why I felt one of Strategy's income-based products could conceivably do well when Bitcoin's price went down. In reality, the opposite has been true, and I'm now forced to reassess my thinking. While I have not been bullish on either the STRK or STRD shares in the past, I have been bullish on the STRF shares. To be clear, I do still hold STRF shares. But I also see some serious problems that I think warrant trimming that position. First, STRD and STRK are now trading below IPO price. Beyond that, STRF has fallen below $100 per share for the first time since June and is currently at its lowest price level since May. What this means is that every single dollar-based preferred stock that Strategy offers is currently trading below par. Since MSTR shares are also trading at a sizable discount to mNAV, it puts Strategy in a very precarious position with limited options as the company's December dividend payment due date quickly approaches. The Problem For those who have followed either my work or the stock itself, this shouldn't be a surprise. Strategy does not actually generate positive income from operating its software business. We have to strip out gains or losses on digital assets that were purchased years prior to get a real assessment of the company's software business operations. On a trailing twelve-month basis, Strategy's adjusted operating loss is over $42 million: Millions Q3-24 Q4-24 Q1-25 Q2-25 Q3-25 Revenue $116.1 $120.7 $111.1 $114.5 $128.7 Cost of Revenue $34.3 $34.2 $34.0 $35.8 $38.0 SG&A $68.9 $72.4 $68.1 $70.2 $68.1 R&D $33.3 $25.7 $24.4 $24.1 $22.6 Operating Income -$20.4 -$11.6 -$15.4 -$15.6 $0.0 Source: Seeking Alpha The only reason Strategy has been able to buy Bitcoin to the degree that it has is due to the company's ability to raise capital through various instruments, including convertible notes, preferred stocks, and good old-fashioned common stock dilution. Raising money to buy BTC was easy when MSTR traded at a significant premium to mNAV. BTC buys vs MSTR mNAV (Strategy & BitcoinTreasuries, Analyst's Chart) That is no longer the case, and we can see in the chart above how weekly acquisitions have fallen in line with MSTR mNAV compression. Anecdotally, it is quite obvious that MSTR shareholder appetite for more dilution of the common is virtually gone, judging by sentiment online. But it's important to keep in mind that 89% of the Bitcoin purchase capital raised since preferred stock ATMs launched in March has actually come from the common ATM. Strategy can just switch to issuing more preferred stock through ATMs then? Maybe not, actually. To illustrate why, let's look at one of Strategy's recent Bitcoin acquisition filings: November 10th Filing (Strategy) I've crudely circled the nominal value versus net proceeds for each of the four preferred ATM raises during the week of November 3rd. Strategy was really only able to utilize STRF and STRC because those were the two products that it could use to generate greater proceeds from the stock issuance than the nominal value of the obligation it was creating. That was not the case for STRK or STRD, which is why those raises were so much smaller by comparison. The point is, Strategy does not want to issue $6.4 million in preferred stocks to generate just $5.5 million in proceeds. It would much rather do the opposite. Now it can't. At the end of September, Strategy had $54.3 million in cash and equivalents. Since then, the company has raised about $318 million through its ATM programs and purchased almost $292 million in BTC with that capital. That leaves, at best, $80 million or so in cash to pay out nearly $150 million in dividend obligations before the end of the year. Preferred Class Shares Dividend/Shr Divis Due EOY STRK (Due Dec) 13,974,912 $2.00 $27,949,824 STRF (Due Dec) 12,676,383 $2.50 $31,690,958 STRD (Due Dec) 12,344,308 $3.06 $37,724,205 STRC (Due Nov+Dec) 29,587,063 $0.88 $51,777,360 Total Dividends Due by EOY $149,142,347 Source: Strategy, Analyst's Calculations, estimated dividend payments To be sure, Strategy could simply not pay the STRD dividends in December, though I suspect doing so would irreparably damage the company's ability to continue raising capital should it wish to continue doing so in the future. But even if it doesn't pay STRD shareholders in December, the company would still have a dividend shortfall through the other three products. Strategy's Next Move There are a variety of ways Executive Chairman Michael Saylor and company could play the precarious situation that Strategy now finds itself in. But I think these three are the most straight forward: Keep raising capital through preferred stocks Sell Bitcoin to pay dividends Continue diluting common stock holders I think option 1 is unlikely due to what I just laid out in the section above. Strategy cannot tap the preferred ATMs while all four of them are under par without severely damaging trust in his income products, in my opinion. However, if STRF recovers from current levels and retakes par, we could see Strategy begin to lean on that instrument a bit more despite its relatively small ATM. Option 2 is also unlikely because it goes counter to what Saylor has been saying for years. The time to sell BTC to pay the dividends was a month ago when Bitcoin was well over $110 per coin. Given the weakness in the market, Strategy selling BTC could trigger a deeper cascade lower in the asset. Which would result in bigger problems for the company. Option 3 seems like the easiest 'kick the can down the road' path. Thus, it seems to me to be the most likely. Closing Summary Again, I have to stress that Strategy had already been heavily relying on MSTR dilution to fund purchases to this point. Given the market dynamics currently on display in the preferred stocks, Strategy's ability to raise through its income products going forward is likely minimal. Frankly, I think the market is actually daring the company to sell Bitcoin to pay its preferred obligations in December. Furthermore, at a basic mNAV of 0.9, one could argue it behooves the company to sell Bitcoin to buy back its common stock to close its own mNAV discount. While I highly doubt buying back MSTR is something the company is considering doing, I have to imagine there is at least some internal discussion about buying back some of the preferred stocks while they're under par to minimize the company's perpetual dividend obligations. I could certainly be wrong for being bullish on STRF earlier this year. But I don't think I'm going to be wrong on continuing to avoid MSTR.",MSTR|STRF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-20 03:10:13

In an X post on Thursday, the WLFI team said some wallets were breached before the platform went live, either through phishing attacks or exposed seed phrases. It said that the incident did not stem from flaws in WLFI’s own platform or smart contracts, and blamed third-party security lapses that allowed attackers to take control of private wallets. The project said it responded by freezing affected wallets in September and verifying ownership. WLFI Rolls Out KYC Checks And New Wallet Process To Secure User Funds Users who reported compromise were asked to complete fresh know-your-customer (KYC) checks and submit new wallet addresses, so funds could be moved to safer accounts. 1/ Prior to WLFI’s launch, a relatively small subset of user wallets were compromised via phishing attacks or exposed seed phrases. Since then, we’ve tested new smart contract logic to safely reallocate user funds and verified users’ identity via KYC checks. Shortly, users who… — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) November 19, 2025 In parallel, engineers built and tested new smart contract logic to handle bulk reallocations. The team said reallocations will now begin for users who opened support tickets and passed the required verification steps, while wallets linked to users who have not yet engaged will remain frozen. Those users can still start the process through the help centre. WLFI framed the slow rollout as deliberate, saying it chose to prioritise the safety of funds over speed, even though the root cause lay outside its own systems. The message aimed to reassure holders who saw wallets locked for weeks while the team designed and tested the migration process. WLFI Trading Exploded On Binance With Nearly $1B Volume In First Hour The security issue arrives only weeks after WLFI’s high-profile debut. World Liberty Financial launched its WLFI token on Sept. 1, following teasers earlier in 2024. Trading began on decentralized venues with sharp swings, including a drop of more than 15% on launch day . Momentum then shifted to major exchanges. Trading volumes surged on Binance and elsewhere, with about $1b worth of tokens changing hands in the first hour, according to CoinMarketCap. Prices moved between $0.24 and $0.30, roughly in line with futures pricing ahead of the listing. At the top of that range, the Trump family’s stake, reported as 22.5b tokens out of a 100b supply, carried a paper value of more than $6b , making WLFI its single largest asset, the Wall Street Journal reported. The run-up gave the project instant visibility across both political and crypto circles. WLFI Stake Drops To $3.15B As Token Trades Well Below Launch Levels Market conditions have since cooled. As of Nov. 20, the family’s WLFI holdings are worth about $3.15b on paper, based on a token price of $0.13 and the same 22.5b token stake. These are locked governance tokens that confer voting rights and a share of revenue from presales, estimated at $400m to $500m realized so far, rather than full economic claims on the business. Phishing links, fake support channels and poor key storage remain the weakest points in consumer-facing crypto, even on projects with high visibility and substantial resources.

FIGR's Q3 revenue surged 55% year-over-year to $156.4 million, far exceeding Wall Street expectations, driven by ecosystem and technology fees. The company boasts >50% adjusted EBITDA margins, rapid loan origination growth, and a successful new crypto exchange product launched in August 2024. Reiterating a buy rating, I recommend using near-term dips as buying opportunities given FIGR's profitability and long-term market potential. Amid the sharp correction in the stock market from recent highs, crypto assets are also facing a correlated reckoning, with Bitcoin now sitting stubbornly under $100k. The sharp and highly visible crash in the world's largest crypto asset has also taken down a number of very attractive stocks in the blockchain space, like Circle ( CRCL ) and Figure ( FIGR ), which have little to do with crypto speculation and enjoy long-term secular tailwinds from the blockchain's capacity to dramatically improve our payments infrastructure. Figure, in particular, just reported its first earnings quarter since going public in September at $25 per share. Though Figure is up from post-IPO levels, the stock is down about 25% from highs above $49 reached in August, technically putting the stock in a bear market. In my view, it's a great time for investors who are unfamiliar with this name to take a look at this stock with fresh eyes. Data by YCharts I last wrote a buy article on Figure in September, shortly after the IPO, when Figure was trading in the mid $30s. Since then, I've gained on my position, but a number of positive fundamental factors have also moved in Figure's favor. Its recently opened exchange product is delivering substantial revenue growth, and may actually benefit from recent crypto market volatility. Meanwhile, its core loan origination product is also showcasing rapid growth, while diversifying Figure away from its original base of HELOC loans. And perhaps most importantly, Figure is minting incredible adjusted EBITDA profits, which make the stock's slide more irresistible. I'm reiterating my buy rating here. As a reminder for investors who are newer to Figure, here is what I consider to be the core bull case drivers for the stock in the long haul: Figure is a vast improvement over existing lending infrastructure. Per the company's own estimates, the company provides 93% savings versus the cost to originate a traditional loan, and an 80% reduction in due diligence costs for securitizing collateralized products. Transactional and recurring revenue. The company's core lending products earn an upfront 3% origination fee on all loans originated through the Figure platform, while the company also earns traditional mortgage servicing revenue for all the debt under its administration. Figure Exchange opportunity. The company launched its own crypto trading exchange in August 2024, which is driving substantial revenue growth for the company. Stablecoin issuer. The company also offers a regulated, yield-bearing stablecoin (YLDS), which can benefit from continued interest in holding digital assets that serve as a means of payment and don't fluctuate in value. Unlike rival Circle ( CRCL ), which sponsors the much larger USDC coin, net interest income is just a small slice of Figure's overall revenue, meaning that Figure won't be hugely impacted if the Fed keeps cutting short-term rates. Already immensely profitable. Though Figure is still in the early stages of addressing what it believes to be a $2 trillion market opportunity in lending and $4 trillion in crypto and digital assets, the company is already generating a >50% adjusted EBITDA margin. Stay long here and use any near-term dips as a buying opportunity. Q3 download In mid-November, Figure released Q3 results, which were the first earnings results since the company went public in September. Though the stock is down since the print, the big beat to consensus expectations is a strong indicator of positive sentiment for the stock going forward. The Q3 earnings summary is shown below: Figure Q3 results (Figure Q3 earnings deck) Figure's revenue grew 55% y/y to $156.4 million, absolutely crushing Wall Street's expectations of $119.5 million (+18% y/y) by a massive margin. Of course, Figure is a very complex business with multiple income streams, so we need to take it piece by piece. The top contributor to growth is the company's ""ecosystem and technology fees"", which grew about ~5x y/y to $35.7 million, or 23% of the company's total. This was driven by the launch of Figure Exchange, which only had a small and partial-quarter contribution in Q3 of last year. We do expect this revenue line to decelerate in Q4 and beyond as Figure starts to comp last year's launch against full-quarter contributions. Still, we think Figure Exchange's broadening selection of cryptocurrencies as well as increasing interest in Bitcoin, especially given recent volatility, are all positive indicators for Figure. As a side note here: though Figure doesn't provide monthly metrics, many other exchanges do, giving us possible insight into how crypto market trading activity is moving past the close of Q3. Robinhood (HOOD) recently released trading activity for the completed month of October, which indicates that nominal crypto trading volumes on the Robinhood app (excluding the recent purchase of Bitstamp) rose 49% y/y to $13.9 billion, and nominally higher than September: which is a strong indication that we should expect Figure to have healthy trading revenue in Q4. Robinhood October trading activity (Robinhood October metrics release) Meanwhile, in the company's core lending arm, loan origination fees grew 13% y/y to $21.4 million, and servicing fees grew 22% y/y to $7.9 million. The company notes in the chart below that its total consumer loan volume grew 70% y/y to $2.47 billion in originations in Q3, which was driven by additional patents in the network and a broadening scope beyond HELOC loans. Figure key metrics (Figure Q3 earnings deck) The company notes that partners are increasingly turning to Figure to help originate first-lien loans, and not just HELOCs. Per CEO Michael Tannenbaum's remarks on the Q3 earnings call: Total consumer loan marketplace volume reached almost $2.5 billion in the third quarter, representing a 70% increase year-over-year. This growth reflects continued expansion across our origination partner network and increased utilization of Figure Connect for liquidity. As more partners leverage the platform to fund and sell loans, we're seeing meaningful gains in both scale and efficiency. A standout example being first lien lending, where adoption has accelerated sharply among both new and existing partners. Firstly, volumes nearly tripled year-over-year, making it one of our fastest-growing products this quarter. Partners are leaning into Figure Connect as a liquidity solution, enabling faster funding, improved execution and lower cost versus traditional channels."" We note that interest income also supplemented Figure's results, with interest growing 40% y/y to $17.9 million (11% of company revenue) despite compression in interest rates, thanks to growing issuance of YLDS. We note here that Figure has a nice counterweight and hedge against interest rates: if rates go up, Figure will see better net interest spreads, but if rates come down as they are highly expected to do, Figure should benefit from greater loan origination activity that will help to offset softer net interest spreads. Figure is also showcasing immense profitability chops. Adjusted EBITDA, as shown in the chart below, jumped 75% y/y to $86.4 million, reflecting a 55.4% margin that improved 10 points y/y: Figure adjusted EBITDA bridge (Figure Q3 earnings deck) Valuation and key takeaways At current post-earnings share prices near $37, Figure trades at an $8.22 billion market cap. Netting off the $1.79 billion of cash, restricted cash, loans held for immediate sale and investments on Figure's balance sheet against $466 million of debt gives the company an enterprise value of $6.90 billion. For next year, FY26, Wall Street analysts peg Figure's revenue at $604.6 million, or 24% y/y growth. If we conservatively assume a 48% adjusted EBITDA margin against that revenue profile (flat to YTD 2025 actuals, and lower than the 55% margin that Figure notched in Q3, given that Q2-Q3 tend to be seasonal peaks for loan originations), adjusted EBITDA would be $290 million.

The Bitcoin Layer 2 project BOB has just unveiled its token distribution plan, and the numbers are turning heads across the cryptocurrency community. With nearly half of the total supply dedicated to ecosystem growth and community development, this approach represents a significant shift in how blockchain projects value their supporters. What Makes BOB Tokenomics So Special? The BOB tokenomics model stands out for its community-first approach. The project will release 10 billion tokens total, with a massive 44.76% allocated directly to the ecosystem and community. This substantial allocation demonstrates the team’s commitment to building a truly decentralized network where users have real ownership and influence. Why does this matter? Traditional crypto projects often reserve the lion’s share for insiders and early investors. However, BOB tokenomics flips this model by prioritizing long-term community growth over short-term profits. This strategic decision could potentially create stronger network effects and more sustainable development. Breaking Down the BOB Token Distribution Let’s examine the complete BOB tokenomics breakdown in detail: Ecosystem and Community : 44.76% (4.476 billion tokens) Early Backers : 20.09% (2.009 billion tokens) Core Contributors : 19% (1.9 billion tokens) Foundation : 10% (1 billion tokens) Initial Claims : 4.15% (415 million tokens) Community Sale : 2% (200 million tokens) This transparent BOB tokenomics structure ensures that no single group dominates the network. The careful balancing act between different stakeholders creates a healthy distribution that supports both initial development and long-term sustainability. How Will the Community Allocation Work? The massive 44.76% community allocation in BOB tokenomics serves multiple purposes. This portion will likely fund various initiatives including: Community governance programs Ecosystem development grants User rewards and incentives Network security enhancements Educational initiatives This approach to BOB tokenomics ensures that the community has both the resources and the influence to shape the project’s future direction. It represents a fundamental shift from traditional corporate structures to truly decentralized community governance. What Challenges Might This BOB Tokenomics Model Face? While the BOB tokenomics model appears promising, it’s not without potential challenges. Managing such a large community allocation requires sophisticated governance mechanisms and transparent decision-making processes. The project must ensure that these tokens are distributed fairly and used effectively to benefit the entire ecosystem. Moreover, the success of this BOB tokenomics approach depends heavily on community engagement and participation. Without active involvement from token holders, even the most generous allocation could fail to achieve its intended purpose of creating a vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystem. Why This BOB Tokenomics Approach Matters for Bitcoin Layer 2 The innovative BOB tokenomics model could set a new standard for Bitcoin Layer 2 projects. By prioritizing community ownership and ecosystem development, BOB demonstrates how Layer 2 solutions can build sustainable networks that complement Bitcoin’s security and decentralization principles. This forward-thinking BOB tokenomics strategy aligns perfectly with the core values of the Bitcoin ecosystem while introducing modern token distribution mechanisms that reward participation and contribution. It represents a bridge between Bitcoin’s proven security model and innovative token economic designs. Conclusion: A New Era in Token Distribution The revolutionary BOB tokenomics model marks a significant step forward in how cryptocurrency projects approach community building and token distribution. With 44.76% of tokens dedicated to ecosystem and community growth, BOB sets a powerful precedent for future Bitcoin Layer 2 projects. This community-centric approach not only rewards early supporters but also creates a foundation for long-term, sustainable growth that benefits all participants in the ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What is the total supply of BOB tokens? The total supply is 10 billion BOB tokens, with detailed allocations across six different categories including ecosystem, community, and core contributors. How does the 44.76% community allocation compare to other projects? This allocation is significantly higher than many traditional crypto projects, demonstrating BOB’s strong commitment to community-led growth and decentralized governance. When will the community sale occur? Specific dates for the community sale haven’t been announced yet, but the allocation represents 2% of the total supply for this purpose. What benefits do community token holders receive? Community token holders can participate in governance, earn rewards, and help shape the project’s future direction through various ecosystem initiatives. How does BOB’s tokenomics support the Bitcoin ecosystem? As a Bitcoin Layer 2 project, BOB’s tokenomics are designed to complement Bitcoin’s security while enabling new functionality and community participation. What mechanisms ensure fair distribution of community tokens? While specific mechanisms haven’t been detailed, the foundation allocation and structured distribution suggest careful planning for fair and transparent token distribution.

Massive crypto liquidations totaling $464 million swept through perpetual futures markets, with Ethereum taking the hardest hit. This dramatic event highlights the extreme volatility that continues to define digital asset trading. What Triggered These Massive Crypto Liquidations? When prices move rapidly against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close trades to prevent further losses. This process creates a cascade effect that amplifies market moves. The recent crypto liquidations demonstrate how quickly conditions can change in digital asset markets. Ethereum bore the brunt of this storm with $222 million in forced position closures. Surprisingly, 87% of these ETH liquidations were long positions, indicating most traders were betting on price increases before the downturn hit. How Did Major Cryptocurrencies Fare? The crypto liquidations distribution reveals important market patterns: Ethereum (ETH) : $222 million liquidated, 87.03% long positions Bitcoin (BTC) : $170 million liquidated, 74.97% long positions Zcash (ZEC) : $72.62 million liquidated, 94.99% short positions This data shows that most traders were positioned for upward moves in major assets like Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, Zcash presented a different story where the vast majority of liquidations affected short sellers. Why Do Crypto Liquidations Matter to Traders? Understanding crypto liquidations is crucial for risk management. These forced closures can create domino effects that push prices even lower. When long positions get liquidated, it often means selling pressure increases, potentially triggering more liquidations. The scale of recent crypto liquidations serves as a stark reminder about leverage risks. Traders using high leverage become vulnerable to sudden price swings that can wipe out their positions in minutes. What Can We Learn From This Volatility? Market events like these crypto liquidations provide valuable lessons. First, they emphasize the importance of proper position sizing and risk management. Second, they show how sentiment can shift rapidly in cryptocurrency markets. The concentration of crypto liquidations in long positions suggests many traders were caught off guard by the price movement. This pattern often occurs when market sentiment becomes overly optimistic without fundamental support. How to Protect Yourself From Future Liquidations Surviving periods of heavy crypto liquidations requires strategic planning: Use conservative leverage ratios Set stop-loss orders appropriately Diversify across different assets Monitor market conditions regularly Maintain adequate margin buffers These crypto liquidations demonstrate that even experienced traders can get caught in sudden market moves. Therefore, preparation remains your best defense against unexpected volatility. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Liquidation Landscape The recent $464 million in crypto liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of market risks. While Ethereum led this particular downturn, the phenomenon affects the entire digital asset ecosystem. Understanding these mechanisms helps traders make informed decisions and manage exposure effectively. As cryptocurrency markets mature, we may see reduced volatility over time. However, for now, crypto liquidations remain an integral part of the trading landscape that demands respect and careful navigation. Frequently Asked Questions What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close leveraged positions that have lost too much value, preventing further losses beyond a trader’s initial margin. Why did Ethereum have the highest liquidation volume? Ethereum likely had the highest liquidation volume due to its large market capitalization, high trading volume, and significant leverage usage by traders betting on price movements. How can I avoid getting liquidated? You can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, setting appropriate stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and closely monitoring your positions during volatile periods. Do liquidations always make prices drop further? While long position liquidations typically create selling pressure that pushes prices lower, short position liquidations can have the opposite effect by forcing buybacks. How often do large liquidation events occur? Significant liquidation events tend to happen during periods of high volatility, which can occur multiple times per year depending on market conditions and catalyst events. Are liquidations bad for the cryptocurrency market? While liquidations cause short-term pain for affected traders, they help maintain market stability by preventing uncontrolled losses and excessive leverage buildup in the system.

The Bitcoin options market is flashing warning signs that every trader should understand. According to Glassnode’s latest analysis, bearish sentiment is taking hold as implied volatility approaches levels not seen since the October 10 mass liquidation event. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Options Market Shift? The current Bitcoin options market reflects growing concern among traders. When Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90,000, implied volatility surged dramatically. This spike was particularly noticeable in short-term contracts, indicating heightened sensitivity to immediate risks. Glassnode identifies two key factors behind this volatility expansion: Increased demand for downside protection through put options Unwinding of short gamma positions that suffer during volatility spikes Why Are Put Options Trading at a Premium? The most telling signal from the Bitcoin options market comes from put option pricing. Currently, one-week put options trade at approximately 14% premium over calls. This means traders are willing to pay significantly more for protection against potential price declines. This premium indicates several market realities: Traders anticipate potential downside movement Hedging activity has increased substantially Market participants are preparing for volatility How Does Implied Volatility Impact Your Trading Strategy? Implied volatility serves as the market’s fear gauge. When IV rises in the Bitcoin options market, it signals uncertainty and potential price swings. The current levels mirror those seen during significant correction periods, suggesting traders should exercise caution. Consider these implications for your trading approach: Option premiums become more expensive during high IV periods Hedging strategies may require larger capital allocations Risk management becomes increasingly important What Can We Learn from Current Market Positioning? The Bitcoin options market provides valuable insights into trader sentiment and potential price direction. The current put premium suggests that experienced traders are positioning for possible declines. However, remember that options markets can sometimes act as contrarian indicators when extremes are reached. Key takeaways for informed decision-making: Monitor IV levels for timing entries and exits Consider the cost of protection in your risk calculations Watch for sentiment shifts that might signal reversal opportunities Navigating the Current Bitcoin Options Market Environment Understanding the dynamics of the Bitcoin options market helps traders make better decisions. The current bearish positioning doesn’t guarantee downward movement, but it does highlight market concerns. Successful traders use this information to adjust their strategies rather than following the crowd. Remember these principles when analyzing options data: Options markets often anticipate moves before spot markets Extreme positioning can sometimes precede reversals Always combine options data with other technical and fundamental analysis FAQs: Bitcoin Options Market Questions Answered What does put option premium indicate? When put options trade at a premium, it shows traders are willing to pay more for downside protection, indicating bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin options market. How does implied volatility affect option prices? Higher implied volatility increases option premiums because it suggests larger expected price moves, making both puts and calls more expensive. Why are short-term contracts more volatile? Short-term options in the Bitcoin options market react faster to price movements and news events, making them more sensitive to immediate market conditions. What is gamma positioning? Gamma measures how quickly an option’s delta changes as the underlying price moves. Short gamma positions lose money during volatility expansions. Can options data predict Bitcoin price direction? While the Bitcoin options market provides sentiment indicators, it shouldn’t be used alone for price predictions. Combine it with other analysis methods. How often should I monitor options market data? Regular monitoring of the Bitcoin options market helps identify sentiment shifts, but avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Ripple is exploring exactly that possibility with a groundbreaking proposal to introduce XRP staking to the XRP Ledger. This potential development could fundamentally change how users interact with one of cryptocurrency’s most established networks. What Exactly is XRP Staking and Why Does It Matter? XRP staking represents a potential evolution in how the XRP Ledger operates. Currently, XRP holders cannot earn rewards through traditional staking mechanisms like other cryptocurrencies. However, Ripple’s engineering team, led by J. Ayo Akinyele, is actively discussing how to implement this feature. The proposed XRP staking system would allow token holders to participate in network security while earning rewards. This approach aligns with growing demand for passive income opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. Moreover, it could significantly enhance XRP’s utility within the decentralized finance ecosystem. How Would XRP Staking Benefit the Network? Implementing XRP staking offers multiple advantages for both the network and its participants. First, it creates stronger incentives for long-term holding. Second, it enhances network security by rewarding users who help maintain consensus. Enhanced network security through increased participation Passive income opportunities for XRP holders Improved decentralization of the XRP Ledger Stronger DeFi integration capabilities Therefore, the introduction of XRP staking could address several key challenges facing the network while opening new possibilities for growth. What Challenges Might Ripple Face with XRP Staking Implementation? While the benefits are compelling, implementing XRP staking presents technical and regulatory considerations.

However, the engineering team appears confident they can navigate these challenges successfully. Their approach focuses on maintaining the network’s efficiency while adding staking capabilities. How Could XRP Staking Transform the Cryptocurrency Landscape? The potential introduction of XRP staking represents more than just a feature update—it signals Ripple’s commitment to evolving with market demands. As decentralized finance continues growing, staking capabilities become increasingly valuable. This move could position XRP more competitively against other major cryptocurrencies that already offer staking. Furthermore, it demonstrates Ripple’s proactive approach to enhancing token utility beyond payment functionality. What Does This Mean for Current XRP Holders? For existing XRP investors, the staking proposal offers exciting possibilities. It provides a pathway to generate returns beyond price appreciation. Additionally, it strengthens the fundamental value proposition of holding XRP long-term. New revenue streams without selling tokens Enhanced network participation opportunities Increased token utility and demand drivers Stronger community engagement through active involvement Consequently, the XRP staking feature could fundamentally reshape investment strategies for XRP enthusiasts. Frequently Asked Questions About XRP Staking When will XRP staking become available? No official timeline exists yet. Ripple is currently in discussion and research phases regarding XRP staking implementation. How would XRP staking work technically? While details remain unclear, it would likely involve validating transactions and maintaining network consensus in exchange for rewards. Will XRP staking affect transaction speed?

Dogecoin CBD Points To $0.08 As Strongest Support In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin support is looking from the perspective of the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). The CBD is an indicator created by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode that tells us about the amount of DOGE supply that was last purchased or transacted at the various price levels that the coin has visited in its history. Generally, investors are sensitive to retests of their cost basis and can be prone to showing some kind of reaction during one. The more holders that have their cost basis at the same level, the larger the market reaction upon a retest. Thus, the levels that the CBD identifies as being dense with supply could potentially be significant ones for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Panic: 65,200 BTC Sent To Exchanges At Loss Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Dogecoin CBD over the past couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, a major Dogecoin cost basis level is located around $0.20, hosting the break-even level of 12.1 billion DOGE. The latest bearish momentum, however, has meant that the memecoin has plunged under this mark, putting all these investors into a state of loss. Underwater holders may look forward to a retest of their cost basis so that they can exit with their entire investment back. This can make large supply zones above the asset’s price potential resistance barriers. Considering that the $0.20 level is so huge, it’s possible that DOGE may find notable impedance at it, should a retest take place in the near future. In the scenario that Dogecoin continues to decline, it might have to find support at a major cost basis center below. Such investors who were in profit prior to the retest may decide to buy more at their break-even level, thinking it to be a profitable entry point to accumulate more. From the chart, it’s visible that at the levels below, there aren’t any large cost basis zones until all the way down to $0.08, implying support may be thin for the asset. Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin Now In “Good Buy Zone,” Says Analytics Firm The $0.08 level, though, is extraordinary in the amount of supply that it hosts the acquisition point of: 27.4 billion DOGE. The analyst has noted that this makes the line DOGE’s “most significant support level.” It now remains to be seen how Dogecoin will develop in the near term and whether a retest of one of the big cost basis centers will take place. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.158, down 10% over the last week.

54638417,630667,1763611240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54638417.jpeg,XRP Long-Term Holders Shift From Euphoria to Anxiety as NUPL Signals Trouble,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-long-term-holder-shift-from-euphoria-to-anxiety/,"XRP is under heavy selling pressure as fear spreads across the crypto market, pushing sentiment into one of its most fragile stages of the cycle. What was once a euphoric rally earlier this year has steadily shifted into denial among long-term holders — and now anxiety is beginning to dominate. With XRP flirting dangerously with a drop below the $2 mark, investors are watching closely, aware that this level carries major psychological and structural weight. For now, XRP has managed to hold above $2, but the defense of this threshold is becoming increasingly difficult as liquidity thins and macro uncertainty intensifies. A break below this zone could trigger a deeper reset, while a successful rebound would reinforce it as a key long-term demand area. This shift in sentiment is also reflected in on-chain metrics : long-term holders, previously sitting comfortably in profit, are now watching their unrealized gains compress. Historically, transitions from euphoria to denial and into anxiety have often preceded major market inflection points, making the current moment especially significant. XRP NUPL Signals Growing Market Anxiety Analyst Ali Martinez shared new data showing that XRP’s Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) has now dropped below 0.5 — a level that historically marks a transition from confidence to growing anxiety among holders. NUPL measures the difference between the total unrealized profit and loss in the network, helping identify where investors stand emotionally within the market cycle. When NUPL is above 0.5, it typically reflects optimism or belief, often associated with rising prices and strong conviction. But when it falls below 0.5, sentiment weakens, indicating that investors are no longer comfortably in profit. XRP dipping below this threshold means a significant portion of the market is losing confidence as unrealized gains shrink. Investors who were previously sitting on sizable profits are now seeing those margins erode, pushing them into a more defensive psychological state. Historically, this signals that the market is shifting toward anxiety — a stage where many holders begin doubting whether upside momentum will return. This decline in NUPL aligns with XRP’s current price behavior near the $2 support level, emphasizing how fragile the market has become. While anxiety can fuel panic selling, it has also marked the beginning of long-term accumulation phases in past cycles. The next move for XRP may depend on whether fear intensifies — or whether strong hands step in to absorb supply. Testing Critical Support as Selling Pressure Deepens XRP continues to trade under heavy selling pressure, with the chart showing a clear series of lower highs and persistent failures to reclaim key moving averages. The price is now hovering near $2.14, testing a crucial support zone that has repeatedly acted as a psychological and structural level for buyers throughout the year. Each attempt to break above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages has been met with rejection, signaling that momentum remains firmly on the side of the sellers. Volume has gradually increased during recent downswings, suggesting that the sell-offs are driven more by capitulation than simple profit-taking. The sharp decline toward $1.20 in October still stands out as a sign of extreme volatility and liquidity stress, and although XRP quickly recovered from that anomaly, it highlighted how fragile the market structure had become. Since then, price has failed to establish a sustained uptrend, instead forming a tighter and more compressed consolidation beneath the major moving averages. If the $2 support level breaks decisively, XRP could revisit deeper liquidity pockets around $1.75–$1.90, where buyers previously stepped in during September. However, holding above $2 would keep the possibility of a recovery alive, especially if market sentiment stabilizes.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $77.09 million in net inflows on November 19th, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. This surprising reversal comes at a crucial time for digital asset investors seeking stability and growth opportunities. What Drove This Bitcoin ETFs Inflow Surge? The recent inflow data reveals fascinating patterns about institutional behavior. BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with an impressive $62.23 million inflow, demonstrating strong confidence from major players. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Mini BTC followed closely with $53.84 million, showing diversified interest across different Bitcoin ETFs products. However, the picture wasn’t uniformly positive. Fidelity’s FBTC experienced $21.35 million in outflows, while VanEck’s HODL saw $17.63 million leave. This mixed performance highlights how investors are carefully selecting their Bitcoin ETFs exposure rather than making blanket decisions. Why Should Investors Care About Bitcoin ETFs Movements? Tracking Bitcoin ETFs flows provides crucial insights into institutional sentiment. These investment vehicles have become barometers for professional money managers’ views on cryptocurrency. When Bitcoin ETFs see consistent inflows, it typically indicates: Growing institutional confidence in digital assets Increased mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency Potential price support for Bitcoin markets Enhanced market liquidity and stability How Do Bitcoin ETFs Impact Broader Crypto Markets? The relationship between Bitcoin ETFs and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem is increasingly important. Significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs often precede positive momentum across digital assets. This occurs because institutional money flowing into regulated Bitcoin ETFs products creates a foundation of stability that benefits the entire market. Moreover, the end of the five-day outflow streak suggests that professional investors might be seeing current price levels as attractive entry points. This could signal a broader market recovery ahead, making Bitcoin ETFs a key indicator to watch. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs Investors? Looking forward, several factors could influence Bitcoin ETFs performance. Regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and Bitcoin’s inherent volatility will continue to play significant roles. However, the recent inflow reversal demonstrates the resilience of institutional interest in cryptocurrency through regulated Bitcoin ETFs channels. For investors considering Bitcoin ETFs, this data provides valuable context. The mixed flows among different providers suggest that due diligence remains essential when selecting specific Bitcoin ETFs products for your portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track Bitcoin’s price, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly holding cryptocurrency. Why did Bitcoin ETFs see outflows for five days? Market volatility, profit-taking, and macroeconomic concerns typically drive short-term outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. How significant is $77 million for Bitcoin ETFs? While not massive in isolation, breaking a five-day outflow streak signals important sentiment shifts among institutional investors. Should I invest in Bitcoin ETFs now? Investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and portfolio strategy, though the recent inflow reversal suggests renewed institutional interest. Which Bitcoin ETFs performed best? BlackRock’s IBIT led with $62.23 million inflows, followed by Grayscale’s Mini BTC with $53.84 million. How often do Bitcoin ETFs flow data update?

Technical Signals Show Change in Momentum Analyst Ali Martinez reported a bullish divergence between ADA’s price and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The price has continued to post lower lows, but the RSI is rising. This divergence may reflect a loss of selling strength. A TD Sequential “9” buy signal has also appeared on the daily chart. These setups are often monitored for early trend shifts. Martinez commented, “ A rebound is coming! ” as long as the divergence remains intact. In addition, ADA is trading slightly below its 4-hour 9-period simple moving average (SMA), which stands at $0.47. The asset has moved sideways since mid-November, narrowing its range. This shows that momentum remains weak but stable. Source: TradingView The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and the histogram has reversed to positive. Though the signal is still forming, it implies that the latest sell-off might be losing its strength. On-Chain Flows Remain Negative Recent on-chain data shows continued outflows from spot exchanges. On November 19, net outflows totaled $1.80 million, according to CoinGlass. Traders appear to be withdrawing ADA from exchanges, possibly for long-term holding. Source: CoinGlass Despite these outflows, ADA’s price has continued to fall. This trend points to weak demand, with buyers not stepping in despite the lower available supply. Outflows alone have not supported a recovery in price. Sentiment and Whale Activity Remain Mixed Platform data from Market Prophit shows that public sentiment toward ADA is currently negative, while its internal model indicates a bullish outlook. This reflects a split view across participants.

This persistent trend raises important questions about investor sentiment toward Ethereum-based investment products and their future trajectory in the digital asset space. Why Are ETH ETFs Experiencing Continuous Outflows? The consistent withdrawal pattern from ETH ETFs suggests investors are reevaluating their positions in Ethereum-focused funds. Market analysts point to several potential factors driving this trend, including regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and shifting investment strategies. The seven-day outflow streak represents one of the longest continuous withdrawal periods for cryptocurrency ETFs this year. Data compiled by TraderT reveals the depth of this investor retreat. The outflows aren’t isolated to a single fund but represent a broader market sentiment affecting multiple ETH ETF providers simultaneously. This pattern indicates systemic concerns rather than issues specific to individual fund management. Which ETH ETFs Are Leading the Outflow Trend? The outflow distribution reveals significant concentration among major players: BlackRock’s ETHA led the exodus with $26.14 million in withdrawals Grayscale’s ETHE followed with $15.69 million exiting the fund Invesco’s QETH stood alone with $2.93 million in net inflows All other ETH ETFs reported no net changes in flows This distribution pattern highlights how even established financial giants like BlackRock aren’t immune to the current market sentiment affecting ETH ETFs. The concentration of outflows in these major funds suggests institutional investors might be driving this trend. What Does This Mean for ETH ETF Investors? For current and prospective ETH ETF investors, this seven-day outflow streak serves as a crucial market indicator. The persistent withdrawals could signal several market dynamics at play. However, it’s essential to consider this within the broader context of cryptocurrency market cycles and institutional adoption patterns. Investment professionals recommend monitoring these key aspects when evaluating ETH ETFs during outflow periods: Long-term adoption trends versus short-term market movements Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency funds Overall market liquidity and trading volumes Comparative performance against other digital asset classes Is There Hope for ETH ETFs Recovery? Despite the concerning outflow trend, some positive signals emerged from the November 19 data. Invesco’s QETH managed to attract $2.93 million in net inflows, demonstrating that not all investors are abandoning ETH ETFs. This divergence in performance among different funds suggests that specific fund characteristics and management strategies might influence investor decisions. The current situation with ETH ETFs reflects the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investments. While short-term outflows create headlines, the fundamental value proposition of Ethereum and its ecosystem continues to develop. Institutional interest in blockchain technology and decentralized applications remains strong, potentially supporting future recovery for ETH ETFs. Key Takeaways from the ETH ETFs Outflow Data The seventh consecutive day of outflows from ETH ETFs presents both challenges and opportunities for market participants. The $38.9 million withdrawal on November 19, combined with the preceding six days of outflows, creates a significant pattern that demands attention from investors and analysts alike. However, market veterans understand that cryptocurrency investments often move in cycles. The current outflow trend from ETH ETFs might represent a temporary adjustment rather than a long-term shift in investor sentiment. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the role of ETH ETFs in portfolio diversification and institutional access remains fundamentally important. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the ETH ETFs outflows? The outflows likely resulted from combined factors including market volatility, regulatory concerns, and portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors. How long has this outflow trend been happening? The November 19 outflow marked the seventh consecutive trading day of net withdrawals from ETH ETFs. Which ETH ETF performed best during this period? Invesco’s QETH was the only fund to record net inflows, attracting $2.93 million while others experienced outflows. Should I be concerned about investing in ETH ETFs? Like all investments, ETH ETFs carry risk. The current outflows represent short-term market sentiment rather than fundamental issues with Ethereum’s technology. How do ETH ETFs differ from direct Ethereum ownership? ETH ETFs provide regulated exposure to Ethereum price movements without requiring direct cryptocurrency ownership or storage. Will this outflow trend continue? Market trends are unpredictable, but historical patterns suggest cryptocurrency investments often experience cycles of inflows and outflows.

The Japanese yen’s alarming plunge to a 10-month low has sent shockwaves through currency markets, while other Asian currencies struggle to find stable footing. This developing situation presents both risks and opportunities for informed traders. How Did Asia FX React to the Fed Minutes? The latest Federal Reserve meeting minutes revealed deep divisions among policymakers, creating volatility across Asia FX markets. While most Asian currencies showed initial stability after recent declines, the underlying tension remains palpable. The split within the Fed indicates ongoing debate about the timing and pace of future interest rate adjustments, directly impacting currency valuations worldwide. Why the Yen Hit a 10-Month Low The Japanese yen’s dramatic decline represents one of the most significant movements in recent forex market history. Several factors contributed to this collapse: Diverging monetary policies between Japan and the United States Stronger-than-expected US economic data Bank of Japan’s continued accommodative stance Reduced safe-haven demand amid global market recovery Understanding Forex Market Dynamics Post-Fed Announcement The forex market typically experiences heightened volatility following major central bank announcements. The current situation demonstrates how currency trading strategies must adapt to changing monetary policy expectations. Traders are closely monitoring: Currency Pair Current Trend Key Support Level USD/JPY Bullish 148.50 EUR/JPY Neutral-Bullish 158.00 AUD/USD Bearish 0.6350 USD/CNY Range-bound 7.3000 Currency Trading Strategies in Volatile Markets Successful currency trading during periods of central bank uncertainty requires careful risk management and strategic positioning. The current Asia FX environment demands: Increased position sizing awareness Broader stop-loss placements Focus on fundamental analysis over technical signals Regular monitoring of central bank communications What’s Next for Asian Currencies? The path forward for Asia FX markets depends heavily on several key factors. The Federal Reserve’s eventual policy direction will play a crucial role, but regional economic developments and geopolitical considerations will also influence currency movements. Traders should prepare for continued volatility while watching for potential breakout opportunities. The dramatic movements in Asia FX markets, particularly the yen’s concerning decline, highlight the fragile balance in global currency markets. As central banks navigate complex economic landscapes, currency traders face both significant risks and potential rewards. The divided Fed message serves as a powerful reminder that in forex markets, uncertainty often creates the most compelling opportunities for those prepared to act strategically. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the yen to hit a 10-month low? The yen’s decline resulted from monetary policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan , combined with reduced safe-haven demand. How do Fed minutes affect currency markets? Federal Reserve minutes provide insights into policymakers’ thinking, influencing interest rate expectations and currency valuations globally. Which Asian currencies are most affected by Fed policy? Currencies with high correlation to US interest rates, particularly the Japanese yen, South Korean won, and Singapore dollar, show strongest reactions. What is the outlook for Asia FX markets? Markets expect continued volatility as traders assess the timing of potential Fed rate cuts and regional economic performance. How should traders approach current market conditions? Emphasize risk management, monitor central bank communications closely, and maintain flexibility in trading strategies.

While each asset has seen short-term relief after steep declines, analysts warn that failure to clear nearby hurdles could trigger another leg lower. Bitcoin attempts recovery but faces heavy resistance Bitcoin found support near $88,500 after an extended decline pushed the market leader below the $92,000 threshold earlier in the week. Bears remained active as BTC slipped beneath $93,000 and $92,500, ultimately reaching a low of $88,570. The cryptocurrency has since staged a modest recovery, climbing above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downswing from $93,747 to $88,570. BTC is still trading below $93,000 and remains capped by the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. An additional challenge is forming on the hourly chart: a bearish trend line with resistance near $93,500. Analysts note that even if Bitcoin attempts another recovery wave, selling pressure could reappear near the $92,500 area, which aligns with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline. A successful close above $93,750 would be needed to regain upward momentum, potentially allowing BTC to test $94,500 and even $95,000. Further gains could open the path toward $95,500 and $96,200. However, failure to break the $93,500 barrier may lead to renewed weakness. Immediate support lies at $91,150, followed by a more substantial zone around $90,500. A sustained move below $90,000 would increase downside risks, potentially dragging Bitcoin back toward $88,500. The major support for the asset sits at $86,500, a level that could accelerate losses if breached. Technical indicators reflect a market at a turning point. The hourly MACD is losing momentum in the bearish zone, while the RSI has climbed above 50, signaling an attempt by buyers to regain control. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $92,700. XRP rebound stalls as key technical barriers hold XRP mirrored Bitcoin’s price action, attempting a recovery after dropping sharply below $2.150 and $2.120. A low formed at $2.025, and while the token has since moved higher, it remains capped below the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. The latest rebound brought XRP toward the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline from $2.525 to $2.025, but a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.150 continues to limit upside attempts. A break above this level is viewed as essential for shifting near-term sentiment. The first significant resistance sits at $2.20. If cleared, XRP may rise toward $2.250 and then $2.2750—near the 50% retracement of the recent decline. Further gains could target $2.320, $2.350, and ultimately $2.420, though these levels remain distant given current conditions. On the downside, failure to overcome $2.150 risks another drop. Initial support is located at $2.050, followed by $2.020. A close below $2.020 would expose XRP to deeper losses toward $1.9650 and $1.920, with the potential to extend declines to $1.880. The token was trading at $2.13 at press time. Both Bitcoin and XRP are at critical junctures as traders watch whether recovery efforts can overcome entrenched resistance levels. While momentum indicators suggest attempts at stabilization, the broader trend remains fragile. A rejection at key barriers could reignite selling pressure, leaving the market vulnerable to further downside in the near term.

A Bitwise representative claimed that despite the selling pressure in recent weeks, Bitcoin is still very close to bottoming out and that current prices represent an “opportunity zone for long-term investors.” According to the analyst, the large outflows from Bitcoin ETFs were one of the key drivers of the risk-off movement that began in mid-October. However, there's also a shared view that a return to these funds will accelerate the recovery. Bitwise, noting the continued interest from institutional investors, believes Bitcoin will lead the recovery, just as it has typically led the way in declines. While the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs is seen as a major institutionalization step for the sector, analysts argue that it has a double-edged effect. Greater liquidity also enables faster declines. “New players, hedge funds, and large portfolio managers engaging in arbitrage are entering and exiting the market. This increases volatility, especially during periods of uncertainty,” he said. The longer-term picture is different. Bitwise argues that volatility is declining on a 10-year trend and that Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly institutional asset thanks to new investor profiles entering the market. The company states that asset managers and financial advisors, in particular, are regularly adding Bitcoin to their model portfolios, generating stable and long-term demand. It's reported that there's been a significant slowdown in corporate treasury purchases, which played a significant role in the first half of this year. “This weakening demand was one of the factors that accelerated the decline in October. However, low prices always present an opportunity for long-term institutions,” the report stated. Another focus of the markets is the Fed's interest rate decisions. Despite Bitcoin being described as a “store of value independent of the fiat currency system,” its recent high correlation with macroeconomic expectations has sparked debate. A Bitwise analyst stated that Bitcoin will inevitably be affected by Fed policies in the short term due to its increasing “cyclical dominance” since the pandemic. Related News: Bitcoin Price Continues to Fall - So What's Behind This Relentless Decline? Experts Weigh In The market has largely priced in the possibility of a December interest rate cut. The analyst noted that Bitcoin's recent bottoming at $90,000 and its subsequent recovery alongside other risk assets support this view. While Bitwise hasn't officially announced a target for 2025, it has shared a clear forecast for 2026: $200,000. This expectation is based on the prediction that institutional demand will increase exponentially. The company argues that a broad wave of institutional investors, from industry funds and university endowments to pension funds and corporate balance sheets, is “inevitable.” Harvard's Bitcoin purchase was cited as a symbolic example of this trend. *This is not investment advice.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the world’s leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at $93,017.81 on the Binance USDT market, marking one of the most significant Bitcoin price surge events in recent history. What’s Driving This Massive Bitcoin Price Surge? The cryptocurrency market is experiencing unprecedented momentum as Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory. This Bitcoin price surge represents more than just numbers on a chart—it signals growing institutional confidence and mainstream adoption. Several key factors are contributing to this remarkable performance: Institutional investment continues to pour into Bitcoin ETFs and direct holdings Global economic uncertainty is driving safe-haven asset demand Technological advancements in the Bitcoin network are enhancing utility Regulatory clarity in major markets is boosting investor confidence How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Movement? Breaking the $93,000 level represents a psychological barrier that many analysts considered crucial for sustained bullish momentum. This Bitcoin price surge demonstrates the cryptocurrency’s resilience and growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Moreover, the consistent upward movement suggests strong underlying fundamentals rather than speculative trading alone. The current trading volume on major exchanges like Binance indicates substantial institutional participation. This Bitcoin price surge is particularly noteworthy because it comes amid broader market stability, suggesting organic growth rather than reactionary movements. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For both seasoned traders and new investors, this Bitcoin price surge presents important considerations. The market’s strength at these levels indicates potential for continued growth, but also highlights the importance of strategic planning. Here are key takeaways for investors: Diversification remains crucial despite Bitcoin’s strong performance Risk management strategies should be reviewed and updated regularly Long-term perspective often outperforms short-term trading in volatile markets Stay informed about regulatory developments and market trends Will the Bitcoin Price Surge Continue? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the current market dynamics suggest continued positive momentum. The Bitcoin price surge we’re witnessing is supported by strong fundamentals including: Increasing adoption by traditional financial institutions Growing recognition as an inflation hedge Technological improvements enhancing network efficiency Expanding global acceptance as payment method However, investors should remain cautious and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and while this Bitcoin price surge is impressive, market corrections are natural and expected. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $93,000? The Bitcoin price surge is driven by multiple factors including increased institutional investment, growing mainstream adoption, positive regulatory developments, and global economic conditions favoring alternative assets. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at $93,000? While Bitcoin has reached new highs, many analysts believe there’s still potential for growth. However, investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon, and never invest more than they can afford to lose. How does this Bitcoin price surge compare to previous bull markets? This Bitcoin price surge differs from previous cycles due to greater institutional participation, improved regulatory clarity, and more sophisticated market infrastructure, potentially indicating more sustainable growth. What’s the next major resistance level for Bitcoin? Analysts are watching the $100,000 psychological barrier as the next major milestone, though market movements depend on various economic and regulatory factors. Should I be concerned about a price correction? Price corrections are normal in any financial market. Long-term investors typically focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value rather than short-term price fluctuations. How can I stay updated on Bitcoin price movements?

This update links new state-level exposure, a billion-dollar on-chain transfer and a fragile bounce into one picture of where the market stands. Four Governments Confirm New Channels for Holding Bitcoin Four governments have recently disclosed Bitcoin exposure through mining programs, direct purchases, ETFs and test portfolios. The United Arab Emirates, El Salvador, Luxembourg and the Czech Republic now all appear in public records as nation states with some form of BTC on their books. Four Nations Add Bitcoin Exposure. Source: The Bitcoin Historian In the UAE, blockchain analysts traced several thousand BTC to wallets tied to a government-backed mining operation. The coins come from mined rewards rather than exchange buys, yet the holdings still sit under state control and now show up in on-chain data. El Salvador continues to add Bitcoin directly to its national stash. Officials have announced new acquisitions worth around $100 million in recent weeks, extending a policy of buying BTC during market pullbacks and holding it as part of the country’s long-term strategy. Luxembourg is using a fund structure instead of spot coins. Its Intergenerational Sovereign Wealth Fund plans to place a small share of assets into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and related products, giving the state price exposure while custodians handle the underlying assets. The Czech Republic has taken a more experimental route. The Czech National Bank built a $1 million test portfolio that includes Bitcoin, a U.S. dollar stablecoin and a tokenized deposit. Officials say the basket sits outside formal foreign-exchange reserves and serves mainly as a research tool, yet it still marks disclosed central-bank exposure to BTC. While governments adjust their policies, large holders on-chain are also on the move. Whale Address Receives 10,145 BTC From BitMEX Cold Wallet Meanwhile, on-chain data show a whale address has received 10,145 BTC, valued near $1 billion at recent prices. A portfolio view for address 3JBM969wvpxEnfYLQ3LYayB3DVk52ZZpGq records a single inflow of 10.145K BTC from a BitMEX cold wallet roughly five hours ago, placing the full stack under that wallet’s control. Satoshi Era Whale 10,145 BTC Move. Source: 0xNobler As a result, traders are already debating whether the move signals long-term accumulation or simple internal rebalancing. The transfer has also revived speculation about whether a “Satoshi-era” holder is positioning for a market bottom, even though the transaction alone does not reveal the whale’s strategy. Analyst Says Bitcoin Bounce Shows Early Stabilization but Volatility Remains Elevated Bitcoin’s rebound h as offered the first signs of stabilization, even as volatility stays elevated, according to analyst Michaël van de Poppe. He noted that the recent drop left markets “overextended to the downside,” and the latest bounce reflects early attempts to find footing in a key support zone. Bitcoin Support Zone Analysis. Source: CryptoMichNL At the same time, he cautioned that reversals rarely happen quickly. Poppe expects Bitcoin to move sideways for a period as the market builds a new base following the sharp decline. The chart shows liquidity already cleared below recent lows, leaving room for consolidation before any sustained upward move can begin. He added that the current price region remains attractive for long-term positioning, emphasizing that accumulation in this zone could prove beneficial over the coming years.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 05:26:24

Pseudonymous crypto market analyst Axel Bitblaze has now found that the asset’s latest decline appears to be forming the pattern seen in the first quarter of 2025, when the asset topped in January and fell 17% while the S&P 500 continued to hit new highs. At the time, he noted that many believed Bitcoin was simply cooling off. However, four weeks later, the S&P 500 also peaked, and both markets plunged in tandem, which ended up triggering a six-week stretch in which BTC dropped 25% and the index slid 21%. One Last Bearish Trigger? Bitblaze argued that current conditions look strikingly similar. Bitcoin peaked on October 6 and has already fallen about 18% in recent weeks, while the S&P 500 has only now begun to turn lower. According to this breakdown, the sequence resembles the same cycle – Bitcoin begins to fall early without a clear bearish catalyst; equities continue to rise because they typically lag; investors eventually sense broader weakness and stocks break down; BTC’s sell-off briefly intensifies; Bitcoin regains strength sooner than equities; a final market spill follows; and then a reversal takes shape. Bitblaze said the market is likely in phase three or four of this pattern, with most of Bitcoin’s downside already realized. The analyst added that if markets are waiting for one last bearish trigger, it may already be forming, while pointing to rising Japanese bond yields, liquidity pressures at smaller US banks, and market sensitivity to rumors involving high-profile political figures. As such, the current downturn is mostly tied to the first two factors, which are potentially “slow burn” problems that often erupt without warning. “So yeah… feels like we’re close to the end of the damage, not the start. But one more shakeout wouldn’t surprise me at all.” Bearish Forces Still Dominate Despite a slight improvement in short-term signals, another analyst, Axel Adler Junior, believes the BTC market structure remains clearly bearish. The fast version of the Bull-Bear Structure Index has climbed from a critical reading of -41.89 on November 17 to -27.82, which indicates that bearish pressure has eased as prices stabilize near $91,000. However, he noted that the indicator is still well below the -25% threshold, and shows negative taker flow, derivatives pressure, and ETF outflows continue to dominate. Meanwhile, the slow, smoothed version of the index has weakened further after falling from -14.04 to -21.90, which means that deeper structural bearish trends are still gaining strength. Additionally, Coinbase Premium Gap has dropped to -$90, which happens to be one of its lowest levels this year. This signals weakened institutional participation. The premium typically rises when major players accumulate BTC, but the current negative reading shows retail-dominated trading on Binance is setting the tone.

At the same time, analysts expect the end of the US government shutdown to pave the way for a surge of new crypto ETF approvals in 2026. Even though current ETFs are dealing with major outflows and pressure on prices, some analysts believe a new regulatory cycle could lead to renewed institutional participation and innovation in the sector. ADIC Expands Bitcoin Position The Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC) escalated its exposure to Bitcoin by almost tripling its holdings in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) during the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg report . The move is being interpreted as a strong signal that institutional appetite for digital assets is still strong across the United Arab Emirates, even during a turbulent period for Bitcoin’s price. ADIC is an investment arm of Mubadala Investment Company, and reportedly increased its IBIT position from 2.4 million shares to nearly 8 million by the end of September. At the time, the position was valued at around $520 million based on IBIT’s closing price of $65 per share. The buying spree happened just before a dramatic surge in Bitcoin that pushed the asset to an all-time high of above $126,000 on Oct. 5. Since then, Bitcoin has retreated sharply, and recently even fell below $90,000 before stabilizing close to $92,089. This downturn dragged IBIT’s price down as well, with the ETF closing Wednesday at $50.71, This is roughly 23% lower than its value at the end of Q3. iShares Bitcoin Trus ETF price (Source: Google Finance ) Despite the pullback, many in the industry see ADIC’s aggressive accumulation as a clear sign of long-term conviction. The council told Bloomberg that it views Bitcoin as the digital equivalent of gold, which is a narrative that is increasingly embraced by institutional allocators looking for alternative stores of value. M2 treasury manager Zayed Aleem described the move as “fantastic to see,” and argued that it is a big step forward for the UAE to become a global digital-asset hub. Crypto commentator MartyParty also called ADIC’s position a strategic play on Bitcoin’s long-term store-of-value role. However, IBIT’s recent performance raised eyebrows. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the fund is currently undergoing an “ugly stretch,” and pointed to a wave of outflows that has intensified alongside Bitcoin’s price correction. On Tuesday, IBIT logged its largest single-day outflow since launch at $523.2 million, which contributed to $3.3 billion in outflows from Bitcoin ETFs over the past month. Despite this, year-to-date flows are still strong at +$25 billion, and since its January 2024 launch, IBIT has accumulated over $63 million in net inflows. For now, analysts are still split on Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. Some warn of sustained volatility, while others argue that the current range represents a prime accumulation opportunity. Analysts See ETF Boom Ahead Meanwhile, the end of the US government shutdown and the return to a normal legislative calendar could open the door to a wave of new crypto ETF approvals in 2026, according to several market analysts. Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan told CNBC that demand for crypto ETFs and exchange-traded products is “huge,” and he expects a major expansion of offerings once the SEC resumes a full regulatory pace. Hougan predicted a surge of more than 100 new products, ranging from single-asset funds to index-based crypto ETPs. He explained that index-focused products will likely become especially popular as investors look for simple, passive ways to gain exposure to the digital asset market. Matt Hougan’s interview with CNBC However, the current ETF environment is still a bit challenging. Despite strong investor interest, crypto ETFs have been facing major outflows that are adding even more pressure to already-weakened cryptocurrency prices. Canary Capital’s new XRP ETF, XRPC launched on Thursday with $58 million in first-day trading volume, but XRP still fell roughly 13% over the past week. Bitcoin ETFs are showing similar strain, with around $1.1 billion in outflows so far in November, putting them on track for their worst month since launch. Bitcoin’s drop below the average ETF cost basis of roughly $89,600 left many ETF investors holding unrealized losses. Analysts noticed that Bitcoin ETF holders largely stayed resilient through October’s market crash, with only about $1 billion in outflows following the sell-off. Eric Balchunas said long-term Bitcoin whales, rather than ETF retail investors, were responsible for most selling pressure in October and early November. Since then, the market downturn has deepened and ETF outflows have continued to accelerate. Despite this, some analysts are still optimistic that renewed regulatory activity in 2026 could unlock a fresh phase of ETF innovation and institutional participation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 05:30:00

This strategic move represents a significant leap forward for institutional participation in blockchain-based finance. But what makes this USDG0 stablecoin integration so revolutionary for the RWA sector? Why USDG0 Stablecoin Marks a Turning Point for RWAs The USDG0 stablecoin brings something crucial to the table that previous solutions lacked: regulatory clarity combined with advanced technical infrastructure. Built on LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, this USDG0 stablecoin offers seamless cross-chain functionality while maintaining the regulatory compliance that institutions demand. This combination addresses two major hurdles that have traditionally slowed institutional adoption. Plume’s decision to integrate the USDG0 stablecoin signals a maturation of the entire RWA ecosystem. The platform recognizes that for real-world assets to truly flourish on-chain, they need stable, regulated settlement layers. The USDG0 stablecoin provides exactly this foundation, enabling more sophisticated financial instruments and smoother transactions. How Does This USDG0 Stablecoin Integration Benefit Investors? The adoption of USDG0 stablecoin brings multiple advantages to the Plume ecosystem: Enhanced regulatory compliance through Paxos’ established framework Improved cross-chain interoperability via LayerZero technology Greater institutional confidence in RWA transactions Reduced settlement risks with regulated stablecoin infrastructure Expanded accessibility to real-world asset investments This USDG0 stablecoin integration means that institutions can now participate in RWA markets with the same level of regulatory comfort they experience in traditional finance. The move demonstrates how seriously Plume is taking institutional requirements while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized finance. What Challenges Does the USDG0 Stablecoin Overcome? Traditional RWA platforms have struggled with several key issues that the USDG0 stablecoin directly addresses. Regulatory uncertainty has been a major barrier, with many institutions hesitant to engage with unregulated stablecoins. The USDG0 stablecoin, being Paxos-issued, brings established regulatory oversight that changes this dynamic completely. Technical limitations have also hampered previous efforts. The Omnichain Fungible Token standard underlying the USDG0 stablecoin eliminates fragmentation across different blockchain networks. This means assets can move seamlessly between ecosystems while maintaining their value and properties – a crucial requirement for sophisticated financial operations. The Future Impact of USDG0 Stablecoin Adoption Looking ahead, the integration of USDG0 stablecoin could catalyze several important developments. We may see increased institutional capital flowing into RWA markets as compliance concerns diminish. The proven success of this USDG0 stablecoin implementation could also encourage other platforms to follow Plume’s lead, creating a domino effect across the industry. Moreover, the technical foundation provided by the USDG0 stablecoin opens doors to more complex financial products. Think tokenized real estate, compliant securities trading, and institutional-grade lending protocols – all operating with the stability and regulatory clarity that the USDG0 stablecoin provides. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Blockchain Participation The adoption of USDG0 stablecoin by Plume represents more than just another partnership announcement. It signals the beginning of a new phase where regulated, institutional-grade infrastructure becomes the standard rather than the exception. This move demonstrates that the blockchain industry is maturing rapidly, addressing real-world needs with sophisticated solutions like the USDG0 stablecoin that balance innovation with compliance. Frequently Asked Questions What is the USDG0 stablecoin? The USDG0 stablecoin is a regulated digital currency issued by Paxos and built on LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, designed for cross-chain functionality and institutional use. Why is Plume adopting USDG0? Plume is integrating USDG0 to expand regulated stablecoin infrastructure within its RWA ecosystem and facilitate greater institutional participation in real-world asset markets. How does USDG0 differ from other stablecoins? USDG0 combines Paxos’ regulatory compliance with LayerZero’s cross-chain technology, making it uniquely suited for institutional RWA applications that require both regulatory clarity and technical interoperability. What benefits does USDG0 bring to RWA markets? The stablecoin provides regulated settlement layers, reduced counterparty risk, improved cross-chain functionality, and greater institutional confidence in blockchain-based real-world asset transactions. When will USDG0 be fully integrated into Plume? While the announcement has been made, specific timeline details for full integration are typically released gradually as development milestones are achieved. Can retail investors access USDG0 through Plume? While primarily designed for institutional use, the integration aims to benefit the entire ecosystem, though specific access details may vary based on jurisdictional regulations.

Market sentiment remains mixed, but there is now more clear liquidity shifting toward projects displaying transparency in development, practical utility, and community engagement. Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana have each seen notable technical setups, while early stage PayFi project Remittix has emerged on the radar for its real-world payment architecture and fast-paced presale progress. As market volatility begins to pick up, longer-term investors are assessing which digital assets represent the most sound fundamentals and credible roadmaps. Below is a look at the best crypto to buy now as traders diversify beyond Bitcoin. 1. Remittix (RTX) Remittix stands out from the sea of projects as investors rotate to utility-driven assets, and it secures a top position on this list due to a focus on real-world financial infrastructure rather than speculative momentum. The project is building a full PayFi ecosystem that integrates crypto-to-fiat transfers, remittances, and daily payments into one seamless application targeted at the 19 trillion USD global payments market. The presale continues to accelerate, now with total funds raised at 28,165,960.66 USD and 686,111,564.44 tokens sold at a price of 0.1166 USD. This steady growth reflects the rise in demand from crypto investors who value transparency, potential adoption, and verified development practices. One of Remittix’s core strengths is its live beta wallet , which allows users to test early PayFi functions ahead of the full launch. Development updates are informed directly by community feedback, reinforcing a practical user centered approach. Security remains a major focus, with Remittix completing both a CertiK audit and full team KYC verification. The project has also confirmed multiple upcoming CEX listings, including BitMart, strengthening its long term accessibility. With its clear financial utility and structured development timeline, Remittix stands out as one of the best crypto presales to buy now. Key RTX Features • 28.16 million USD raised in the presale • 686 million tokens sold • CertiK audited and KYC verified team • Beta wallet live and actively updated • Crypto to fiat conversions, transfers, and payments in one app • Multiple CEX listings secured, including BitMart • Targeting the global payments market 2. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, while remaining one of the foundational assets to the crypto market, recent price movement shows signs of short-term weakness. ETH changeS hands for 2,941.11 USD, down 6.76 percent in the past 24 hours, with a market capitalization of 354.5 billion USD. Trading volume is 32.3 billion USD, down 36.91 percent as investors scale back for the time being. Ethereum needs to recover the 3,200 USD level to set up a meaningful recovery, says Innovator of Afrika. In that respect, a move above this threshold can re-open upside targets between 3,400-3,600 USD. As the biggest smart contract platform, Ethereum remains particularly integral to blockchain technology. It powers thousands of decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces-core components of Web3 development. The architecture also sees growing institutional adoption-with staking infrastructure and layer 2 scaling networks in place to better facilitate efficiency. Ethereum’s strong network effects and further developing ecosystem keep long-term investors tuned in. Short-term market sentiment may remain conservative, but Ethereum is one of the best altcoins anyone can buy now, especially for those wanting digital asset exposure with true sustainable utility. 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is presenting an important technical setup as it enters what analysts describe as the final corrective leg. Currently, the asset changes hands at 0.4523 USD, down 5.99 percent in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of 16.22 billion USD. Trading volume has jumped significantly to 847.92 million USD, up 34.82 percent, indicating a growing interest by traders. According to analysis by GainMuse, ADA is interacting with a crucial demand block close to the 0.45 USD level, which has consistently absorbed sell side pressure. If the support can hold, it might form a recovery towards the upper trendline, while a deeper dip might delay progress given that the token is still in a falling channel. Cardano remains a favorite project among longer-term crypto investors because of its academic development model, peer-reviewed research framework, and keen focus on secure, scalable blockchain technology. The network continues to grow in smart contract functionality, opening up fresh use cases in DeFi, identity solutions, and on-chain governance. While the short-term price structure for ADA is cautious, the longer-term fundamentals of this project continue to be attractive to those investors who like their blockchain platforms to grow more slowly and methodically rather than in volatile, hype-driven jumps. Cardano’s disciplined approach makes it a notable contender among today’s best crypto to buy now. 4. Solana (SOL) Solana is maintaining investor attention as it attempts to stabilize after retesting a key structural boundary. SOL is priced at 133.08 USD, down 5.57 percent in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of 73.78 billion USD and trading volume at 5.24 billion USD, down 40.89 percent. Recent analysis from GainMuse indicates that Solana produced a bullish daily candle after tagging the lower boundary of its descending channel, suggesting early signs of strength. Analysts note that a failure to hold above recent reaction lows could delay a potential climb toward the 160 USD region. Solana remains one of the most active and developer friendly smart contract ecosystems in the cryptocurrency market. Its high throughput, low transaction fees, and growing network of decentralized finance applications have made it a popular choice for blockchain developers and Web3 builders. Solana’s ability to deliver fast, scalable performance supports growing interest from both institutional and retail crypto investors. Although market fluctuations continue, Solana maintains strong long term potential and stands as one of the best altcoins to buy now as investors rotate out of Bitcoin and explore faster, application driven networks.

Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, commented, “We’re rolling out easy access to DEX trading in Brazil now in the Coinbase app. Our US users have been enjoying this product and are excited to bring it to new markets! Onchain trading is getting more and more accessible.” The DeFi Mullet service first launched in the US on October 8 to streamline the DeFi experience. Armstrong, at the time, had pledged to expand to other countries and networks. Crypto community members describe Coinbase’s decision as promising In its Wednesday press release, Coinbase explained that its DEX integration eliminates the typical DeFi complications and provides a seamless, straightforward path into onchain trading. The firm also wrote, “Using our DEX integration, users can trade on popular DEXs, like Aerodrome and Uniswap, without leaving the familiar ease of the Coinbase interface. When users submit a trade, DEX aggregators automatically scan the available liquidity across top DEXs to find the best prices.” Moreover, with a self-custody wallet, people can trade without being charged by the network, while still retaining complete control over their tokens, it added. However, it hasn’t yet shared a date for the Brazil launch. Aibra, an X user, commented on Coinbase’s decision, expressing approval of its path forward while suggesting more alignment with the Base app is needed. He noted the campaign could have included deposits from a Base app wallet without issue. Another commenter noted that Coinbase’s development into new markets was encouraging, adding that it shows global ambitions are taking shape. One by the domain name Alex Dulub, remarked , “Great to see this expanding! Every time onchain access reaches a new market, the expectations around reliability and safety rise with it. That is how real adoption compounds.” Brazil is still to implement a new regulatory framework for crypto assets by February 2026. The country’s central bank rolled out new anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing rules aimed at cracking down on illegal activity. Once enforced, all virtual asset service providers, including custodians and intermediaries, will be required to secure authorization from the central bank to operate their businesses. Crypto providers must also follow strict guidelines on transparency, governance, internal controls, and cybersecurity—similar to those expected of banks. Despite the regulatory developments, Brazil has become one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets in Latin America, with its adoption rate steadily increasing over the past few years. More than 10% of the country’s population already owns some form of digital asset, according to recent data, a figure above the global average. Interest is soaring as concerns about inflation, currency volatility, and a growing fintech ecosystem make accessing cryptocurrency easier than ever. The country is evaluating whether to tax international crypto transactions as it prepares to implement the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, which is now backed by over 70 nations. Coinbase’s stock has dropped by over 25% in October In Q3, Coinbase reported that Base saw growing use across trading, payments, lending, and social platforms, and also introduced Flashblocks for ultra-fast block confirmations of 200ms. The company is steadily building a Bitcoin treasury, increasing its holdings by 2,772 BTC in the third quarter to a total of 14,548 BTC, currently valued at $1.3 billion. Its net income surged to $432.6 million, more than five times higher than a year ago, as revenue rose 55% to $1.9 billion. Despite earlier gains, Coinbase stock has fallen 25.2% in the past month to $257.29, trading almost at its 2025 starting level, compared with MARA and Strategy, which are down 33.8% and 35.6%.

The massive Bitcoin withdrawal from BitGo involves 1,300 BTC valued at approximately $120 million, all moving within just six hours. This enormous transaction has cryptocurrency analysts and investors buzzing with questions about what this could mean for the market. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal Mean? The blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain first spotted this significant activity. The new address, starting with 3AXFhi, began moving these substantial funds in a coordinated pattern. This Bitcoin withdrawal represents one of the largest single movements from a major custodian like BitGo in recent months. The timing and scale of this transaction have naturally raised eyebrows across the crypto community. When we see a Bitcoin withdrawal of this magnitude, several questions immediately come to mind. Is this an institutional player repositioning assets? Could it be a whale preparing for a major market move? The concentrated nature of this Bitcoin withdrawal suggests careful planning rather than random activity. Why Are Large Bitcoin Withdrawals Significant? Major Bitcoin withdrawals often signal important market developments. Here’s what makes this particular transaction so noteworthy: Market Impact Potential : $120 million represents substantial buying or selling power Custodian Behavior : Movements from established platforms like BitGo carry different weight than exchange transfers Timing Patterns : The six-hour window suggests urgency or specific timing requirements Address History : The new address lacking transaction history adds mystery This Bitcoin withdrawal follows a pattern we’ve observed with institutional players who often move large sums in coordinated batches. However, the complete anonymity of the receiving address makes this case particularly intriguing. How Do Major Bitcoin Withdrawals Affect Market Sentiment? Large-scale Bitcoin withdrawals can influence market psychology in several ways. When substantial amounts leave custodial services, it often indicates one of two scenarios: either investors are moving to cold storage for long-term holding, or they’re preparing to deploy capital elsewhere. This specific Bitcoin withdrawal comes at a time when the market is particularly sensitive to large movements. The cryptocurrency community is closely watching how this Bitcoin withdrawal might affect: Short-term price volatility Exchange liquidity levels Institutional investment patterns Market confidence indicators Historical data shows that massive Bitcoin withdrawals often precede significant price movements, though the direction isn’t always predictable. What Should Investors Watch After This Bitcoin Withdrawal? Following this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal, market participants should monitor several key indicators. Track whether the withdrawn Bitcoin remains in the new address or gets distributed to multiple wallets. Observe if similar large Bitcoin withdrawals occur from other major custodians. Watch for any unusual trading patterns that might connect to this movement. The most crucial aspect is understanding that while individual transactions can be dramatic, they form part of larger market patterns. This Bitcoin withdrawal, while impressive, should be considered alongside other market fundamentals and technical indicators. Key Takeaways from This Major Bitcoin Movement This $120 million Bitcoin withdrawal serves as a powerful reminder of several cryptocurrency market realities. Large players continue to move significant amounts, demonstrating ongoing institutional interest. The efficiency of blockchain technology enables tracking of these substantial movements in real-time. Most importantly, single transactions rarely tell the complete story – context and follow-up activity provide the full picture. As we continue monitoring this Bitcoin withdrawal and its aftermath, remember that cryptocurrency markets thrive on both transparency and mystery. The ability to track transactions publicly while maintaining participant privacy creates the dynamic environment that makes this space so fascinating. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin withdrawal? A Bitcoin withdrawal refers to moving Bitcoin from one wallet or exchange to another. This particular Bitcoin withdrawal involved transferring funds from BitGo’s custodial services to a new external address. Why is this Bitcoin withdrawal significant? This Bitcoin withdrawal is notable due to its large size ($120 million), the short time frame (6 hours), and the mystery surrounding the receiving address, which had no previous transaction history. How can I track large Bitcoin transactions? You can monitor large Bitcoin withdrawals using blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or specialized analytics platforms like Lookonchain, which detected this particular transaction. Does a large Bitcoin withdrawal always affect prices? Not necessarily. While large Bitcoin withdrawals can indicate major player movements, price impact depends on whether the Bitcoin gets sold, held, or redistributed to other addresses. What is BitGo? BitGo is a leading digital asset trust company and security platform that provides custodial services for institutional investors holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Should I be concerned about large Bitcoin withdrawals? Large Bitcoin withdrawals are normal market activity. While interesting to observe, they typically represent portfolio management rather than market manipulation when occurring from regulated custodians.

The token traded in a tight range as some dip buyers returned, but crypto volumes stayed cautious with traders still wary of macro risk and the next batch of US data. The dollar edged higher ahead of a long-delayed jobs report, keeping risk appetite contained even as equities bounced.

Speaking to Fox Business, Saylor argued that Bitcoin’s price swings have actually narrowed over time as institutional adoption has increased. “We are getting a lot less volatility,” he said, adding that “Bitcoin is stronger than ever.” Michael @Saylor has pushed back against concerns that Wall Street’s growing presence in Bitcoin has amplified the asset’s volatility. #Strategy #Bitcoin https://t.co/ttN5ApxrDY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 19, 2025 AI Chip Optimism Fuels Asia Equity Surge With Japan And Korea Leading Gains Equity markets took their cue from Nvidia. Tech-heavy markets in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan led the charge after chief executive Jensen Huang talked up powerful demand for the firm’s AI chips from major cloud providers and brushed aside worries about an AI bubble. MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 1.2%, rebounding from a one month low, while futures linked to the S&P 500 climbed roughly 1.3%. Wall Street had already snapped a four day losing streak on Wednesday as investors began to question whether the latest anxiety over AI valuations had gone too far. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped around 3.2% and South Korea’s Kospi surged about 2.6 per cent, fuelled by sharp gains in chipmakers and tech suppliers tied to Nvidia’s boom. Names such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Advantest rallied between 4%-9% in local trade. SoftBank Group gained about 3.5% even after fully exiting its stake in Nvidia in October, reflecting the broader bid for tech risk. Weakness In Chinese Tech And EV Names Leaves Hong Kong Trailing Regional Gains Not every market joined the party. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped around 0.1% and a key mainland gauge erased an earlier rise of roughly 0.7% to trade flat, with losses in electric vehicle makers and mixed moves in Chinese tech firms. Xiaomi continued to fall after signalling higher global smartphone prices because of rising chip costs, while worries about slowing EV demand after the expiry of subsidies kept pressure on the sector. Attention now turns back to Washington. Investors are waiting for September’s delayed jobs report, due later in the global session, to gauge the health of the US labour market and the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Minutes from the Fed’s October meeting, released on Wednesday, showed policymakers cut interest rates while warning that moving too far could risk entrenched inflation and a loss of public trust in the central bank.

As Ethereum continues to evolve beyond just a cryptocurrency into a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem, investors worldwide are asking the critical question: Can ETH realistically reach $10,000? Our comprehensive Ethereum price prediction analysis examines the technical indicators, market fundamentals, and emerging trends that could propel ETH to new heights by 2030. What Factors Influence Ethereum Price Prediction? Understanding ETH price analysis requires examining multiple dimensions. The transition to proof-of-stake through Ethereum 2.0 has fundamentally changed the network’s economics. Reduced issuance and increased staking rewards create structural support for higher prices. Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are driving adoption while reducing transaction costs, making Ethereum more accessible to millions of new users. Technical Analysis for Ethereum Forecast Our cryptocurrency forecast methodology combines traditional technical analysis with blockchain-specific metrics. Key resistance levels at $4,000 and $6,800 represent significant psychological barriers. The 200-week moving average has consistently provided strong support during market downturns. On-chain data reveals that long-term holder accumulation accelerates during price corrections, indicating strong conviction among institutional investors. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Key Indicators Indicator Current Status Bullish Signal RSI Neutral Not overbought MACD Positive Upward momentum Volume Increasing Growing interest Staking Ratio 25% Reduced selling pressure Market Trends Driving ETH Value The evolving Ethereum market trends showcase several positive developments. Institutional adoption through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations continues to grow. The DeFi ecosystem, despite occasional setbacks, maintains Ethereum’s position as the dominant smart contract platform. NFT markets, while volatile, demonstrate Ethereum’s cultural relevance beyond pure financial applications. 2025-2030 Price Projections: Realistic Expectations Our Ethereum price prediction model considers three primary scenarios: Conservative: $6,500-$8,000 by 2025 Moderate: $8,000-$12,000 by 2027 Bullish: $15,000+ by 2030 The path to $10,000 requires sustained network growth, continued institutional adoption, and favorable regulatory developments. Each successful Ethereum upgrade improves scalability and reduces environmental concerns, addressing key criticisms that previously limited mainstream acceptance. Risks and Challenges in ETH Price Analysis While our ETH price analysis remains optimistic, several challenges could impact the trajectory. Regulatory uncertainty remains the single largest risk factor. Competition from alternative layer-1 blockchains continues to intensify. Technological risks associated with complex upgrades could create temporary setbacks. However, Ethereum’s first-mover advantage and robust developer community provide significant defensive characteristics. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on our comprehensive cryptocurrency forecast , strategic accumulation during market corrections appears prudent. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to Ethereum’s long-term potential. Monitoring key technical levels and fundamental developments helps investors make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions to short-term price movements. Conclusion: The Path to $10,000 Ethereum’s journey to $10,000 represents more than just price appreciation—it symbolizes the maturation of decentralized technology into mainstream finance. While the path may include volatility and temporary setbacks, the fundamental case for Ethereum’s long-term growth remains compelling. The combination of technological innovation, growing adoption, and evolving tokenomics creates a foundation for sustained value creation that could potentially exceed even the most optimistic Ethereum price prediction models.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-binance-announces-it-will-support-this-altcoins-network-upgrade-here-are-the-details-8/,"Binance has announced that it will temporarily halt certain transactions on November 20, 2025, to support a planned upgrade to the THORChain (RUNE) network. Binance to Support THORChain (RUNE) Network Upgrade: Transactions to Be Temporarily Suspended on November 20 As part of the preparation for technical work to maintain the highest level of user experience, the exchange will suspend deposits and withdrawals for all tokens on the THORChain network as of 20:00. The network upgrade is expected to occur around 9:00 PM, once block height 23,761,879 is reached. Binance emphasized that all technical steps necessary for the upgrade process will be handled automatically by the exchange, eliminating the need for users to perform any manual actions. According to the statement made by the exchange, trading of tokens on the THORChain network will not be affected during the upgrade and spot trading pairs will continue to operate normally. Binance will reactivate deposits and withdrawals once the upgrade is complete and the network is confirmed to be stable. No further announcements will be made for this phase. While THORChain's upcoming network update is stated to aim to increase network functionality and performance, the support provided by Binance in this process is critical to protecting users' asset security. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s Days Under $90K May Be Over,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/the-final-dip-bitcoins-days-under-90k-may-be-over/,"Bitcoin slid below the $92,000 mark on Wednesday, trading at $91,500 at press time after a one-day drop of 5% that left the token down 17% in the last 30 days. Related Reading: With 42% Of XRP Holders Underwater, Analysts Say The Altcoin Could Crash Even Further Market players were rattled after a stretch of heavy swings that began with a peak early in October. According to market trackers, price pressure has pushed sentiment into deep fear as investors reassess risk. Winklevoss Sees Opportunity According to posts on X by Cameron Winklevoss, prices under $90,000 may not last long. “This is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy bitcoin below $90k!” he said. Cameron and his brother Tyler have long compared Bitcoin to modern gold and have suggested it could one day reach $1 million, a view that frames the current pullback as a buy window rather than a lasting setback. Some industry leaders echoed that view, calling the fall a chance for long-term buyers to accumulate. This is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy bitcoin below $90k! — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) November 18, 2025 October Shock Still Echoes Bitcoin’s recent slide followed a new high of $126,200 on October 6, 2025, and heavy liquidations four days later that erased close to $20 billion in leveraged positions. Analysts tracking market cycles say this pullback fits a common pattern after the April 2024 halving, with major peaks often arriving 400–600 days afterward. Reports from The Kobeissi Letter suggest much of the current weakness looks like a routine unwinding of margin positions rather than a collapse in underlying demand. Whales Are Accumulating According to Glassnode, wallets holding 1,000 BTC rose from 1,354 on October 27 to 1,384 on November 17, an increase of 2.5%. At the same time, smaller holders moved away; addresses with less than one BTC dropped from 980,577 to 977,420 in the same period. Markus Thielen of 10X Research said large holders have been buying while absorbing selling pressure. Some of the buying activity has been quietly taking place, and it is being watched closely by analysts.

Here’s how the figure compares for Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP Retail Realized Price Puts Profit Margin Around 60% In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how retail profitability compares between the top assets in the sector: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Retail investors refer to the smallest of entities in the market, who don’t hold a significant balance on an individual level (typically less than $1,000). To calculate the profit-loss balance of this cohort, Glassnode has made use of the Realized Price indicator. The Realized Price measures the average cost basis or acquisition level of a given segment of the network. When the asset’s spot price trades above this level, it means the group is in a state of net unrealized gain. On the other hand, it being under the metric implies the dominance of loss among the cohort members. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price for the retail investors on the XRP network: As displayed in the above graph, XRP has witnessed bearish price action recently, but its price still has a notable gap over the Realized Price of the retail entities. More specifically, this group is in an average profit of 60% right now. Ethereum retail holders are also in the green, but their profitability isn’t quite as good, sitting at 40%. Both XRP and Ethereum, however, pale in comparison to Bitcoin. Even after the price crash , BTC retail addresses are still in an average profit of more than 100%. Now, what are retail investors doing with their profits? On-chain analytics firm Santiment has shed light on the matter in an X post . As the chart below for the holdings of this cohort shows, selling has occurred on all three networks recently. Bitcoin retail was accumulating until the latest price plunge, but this bearish wave has spooked them into selling 0.36% of their supply over the last five days, which is the highest rate of distribution in two months. Ethereum retail has been exiting for a while now, and the trend has only continued during the past month as the cohort’s holdings have gone down by 0.90%. XRP’s small hands have shown a more mixed behavior, first participating in a sharp selloff, and then following on with slight accumulation. Overall, the group’s supply is down 1.38% since the start of November. “Prices move the opposite direction of small wallets’ behavior,” noted Santiment. “So we’re keeping an eye on retail traders continuing to panic sell as a positive sign for crypto’s recovery.” XRP Price XRP has fallen alongside the rest of the market as its price has returned to $2.13.",XRP|bitcoin|btc|ETH|Ethereum|XRP Profit|XRP Retail|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 06:00:34

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-the-pendulum-has-swung-in-xrps-favour-heres-why/,"XRP spent years facing doubt from traders and analysts. Many expected that institutional interest would remain limited. That expectation is now fading. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto commentator on X, highlighted this change. He shared a recent discussion between Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and Scott Melker. His post pointed to a clear shift in tone as the industry begins to treat XRP as a serious focus. It’s crazy watching the narrative flip in real-time… They were skeptical of $XRP for YEARS now they're openly calling the XRP community “huge, committed, and excited The pendulum has swung. The tone shifted from “XRP? Nah” ➜ to “XRP is a priority focus. pic.twitter.com/4QCulzm1W3 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 16, 2025 A Clear Change From Industry Leaders In the video he shared, Melker dubbed XRP’s base a “huge community that is excited.” Hougan described XRP as “a reasonable project.” He said he is not surprised that recent XRP product launches show strong engagement because there are people who love XRP. The remarks showed how sentiment has moved. Hougan acknowledged that some crypto investors still view XRP with skepticism. However, he stressed that this does not affect the asset’s momentum. He pointed to a huge committed community that continues to drive demand. Xaif used the conversation to show how different the market now sounds compared to previous years. The language has shifted from hesitation to recognition. Institutional Entry Builds Ahead of a Key Launch This moment arrives as Bitwise prepares to launch its XRP ETF between November 19 and 20. The firm plans to enter the market with the lowest fee among competing XRP funds. The pricing is a deliberate move to capture early interest from investors seeking efficient exposure. It also shows Bitwise’s confidence in the asset’s demand profile. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Xaif’s post ties this development into the larger trend. XRP is no longer treated as a fringe product. Major firms are positioning themselves to compete for market share . The timing, combined with rising institutional attention, marks the real change in how XRP fits into the wider investment landscape. Community Support Shapes the Asset’s Momentum Community support remains central to this shift. Both Hougan and Melker acknowledged the active and loyal XRP user base. Their remarks align with what long-time holders have demonstrated through years of market cycles. As Xaif noted, “It’s crazy watching the narrative flip in real-time.’ The community stayed present even during difficult periods. Institutions now see stability as a strategic advantage. Xaif highlighted this point as part of his broader message. The negative sentiment that once surrounded XRP has weakened. The community’s consistency, combined with upcoming institutional products, has increased XRP’s market relevance.

South Korean exchange giant Coinone just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s creating waves across the crypto community. The platform revealed plans for a significant Band Protocol rebranding initiative that promises to reshape how investors perceive and interact with this innovative blockchain project. What Does the Band Protocol Rebranding Actually Mean? The Band Protocol rebranding represents more than just a cosmetic change. Coinone confirmed they’re streamlining the project’s name from ‘Band Protocol’ to simply ‘Band,’ while maintaining the familiar BAND ticker symbol. This strategic move aims to create a cleaner, more memorable brand identity in the crowded cryptocurrency marketplace. Think about it – simpler names often stick better in people’s minds. The updated logo will complement this new direction, though specific design details remain under wraps. This isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about positioning Band for broader adoption and recognition. Why Would Coinone Initiate This Rebranding Now? Market evolution drives strategic decisions, and the Band Protocol rebranding comes at a pivotal time. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, projects need clear, distinctive identities that resonate with both seasoned traders and newcomers. Consider these key benefits driving this change: Enhanced brand recognition – Simpler names are easier to remember and share Market positioning – Standing out in a competitive landscape User accessibility – Reducing complexity for new investors Future growth – Preparing for expanded adoption and use cases How Will This Band Protocol Rebranding Affect Investors? If you’re holding BAND tokens, you might wonder how this Band Protocol rebranding impacts your investments. The good news is that the fundamental technology and tokenomics remain unchanged. Your BAND tokens will continue functioning exactly as before, with the same utility and value proposition. However, successful rebranding often brings increased visibility and potentially broader adoption. As more people recognize and understand the project through its simplified identity, demand could naturally increase. This strategic move demonstrates the team’s commitment to growth and market relevance. What Challenges Might This Rebranding Face? While the Band Protocol rebranding offers numerous advantages, it’s not without potential hurdles. Transition periods can create confusion among existing community members and investors accustomed to the original branding. Clear communication and consistent messaging will be crucial during this phase. Additionally, the crypto community is known for its strong attachments to established brands. Winning over skeptics and ensuring smooth transition across all platforms and exchanges will require coordinated effort and transparent execution. Looking Ahead: The Future After Band Protocol Rebranding This bold Band Protocol rebranding initiative signals confidence and forward-thinking strategy. By simplifying their identity while maintaining core functionality, Band positions itself for the next phase of blockchain adoption. The move suggests the team is thinking long-term about market positioning and user experience. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues evolving, such strategic pivots become increasingly important. Projects that adapt and refine their messaging while delivering solid technology tend to thrive in competitive markets. Frequently Asked Questions Will the BAND token ticker change? No, the BAND ticker symbol will remain unchanged across all exchanges and trading platforms. When will the Band Protocol rebranding take effect? Coinone hasn’t announced specific dates, but typically such transitions happen over several weeks to ensure smooth implementation. Do I need to do anything with my BAND tokens? No action is required from token holders. Your existing BAND tokens will automatically reflect the new branding across supported platforms. Will this affect Band Protocol’s technology or partnerships? The rebranding is purely cosmetic and doesn’t impact the underlying technology, existing partnerships, or development roadmap. Why keep the BAND ticker if changing the name? Maintaining the BAND ticker ensures continuity for traders and prevents confusion in markets where the symbol is already established. Will other exchanges follow Coinone’s lead? While not confirmed, it’s common for major exchanges to coordinate on significant branding changes to maintain consistency across platforms.

The company will begin by developing its own data centers in Texas and New York City in partnership with Fluidstack. The first facilities are scheduled to open in 2026. The project is expected to create thousands of jobs and strengthen the U.S. position in the global technology race. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told CNBC that the investment will help build “more powerful AI systems” capable of driving major scientific breakthroughs. Rising AI Spending Sparks Bubble Concerns The scale of financial commitments in the industry has reached unprecedented levels. Oracle has reportedly concluded a $300 billion cloud-services contract with OpenAI, while Meta, recognized as an extremist organization in Russia plans to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. Yet these investments remain far ahead of actual earnings. According to the Financial Times, the combined valuations of ten leading AI startups, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI — have surged by nearly $1 trillion in just a year, despite most of them still operating at a loss. Investor Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2008 mortgage crisis, recently closed his hedge fund Scion Capital, saying its valuation models were “no longer in sync with the markets.” On X, Burry accused major tech firms of artificially boosting profits by using overly aggressive depreciation schedules on AI hardware, which typically lasts only two to three years. He estimates this could understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, inflating Oracle's and Meta’s profits by over 20%. Jared Bernstein, former chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers, also warned that an AI bubble is a “likely outcome,” citing extreme valuations and a widening gap between investment and credible revenue expectations. He noted that the share of economic activity flowing into AI investment is now nearly a third higher than what flowed into the internet sector during the dot-com bubble. Harris Kupperman, founder of Praetorian Capital, estimates that AI data centers built in 2025 will face $40 billion in annual depreciation while generating only $15–20 billion in revenue. Optimists See a Foundation, Not a Bubble Not everyone sees a looming collapse. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC that massive spending on AI infrastructure is essential for maintaining U.S. competitiveness. “Investing in AI means not only buying GPUs and chips, but also investing in cooling systems, IT infrastructure, electrical networks, and power supplies,” Fink said. Physical limits, such as power grid capacity, construction bottlenecks, and chip availability could naturally slow down industry expansion, preventing purely speculative overreach. Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst, added a broader perspective: “Of course there’s a bubble. Bubbles are healthy. They channel capital and talent into a new trend, create losses, but also give birth to long-lasting companies that change the world.” Anthropic’s $50 billion commitment reflects the company’s belief in AI as a transformative force. Whether this marks the beginning of a technological renaissance or the inflation of a new financial bubble remains to be seen.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 06:14:11

This surprising scenario is playing out across America’s wealth management landscape. According to a groundbreaking survey, 35% of young, high-net-worth investors have made this exact move – all because their previous firms failed to provide adequate cryptocurrency access. Why Is Cryptocurrency Access Becoming a Deal-Breaker? The recent survey conducted by stablecoin infrastructure startup Zerohash reveals a seismic shift in investor priorities. When researchers polled 500 wealthy U.S. investors, they discovered that cryptocurrency access now ranks among the top criteria for choosing financial advisors. Young investors particularly value exposure to digital assets, viewing them as essential components of a diversified portfolio. This trend highlights a growing divide between traditional financial institutions and modern investor expectations. Many established firms still hesitate to embrace digital assets, creating opportunities for more agile competitors. The message from investors is clear: adapt or risk losing valuable clients. What Do the Numbers Reveal About Future Crypto Adoption? The survey findings extend far beyond advisor switching. Consider these compelling statistics: 84% of respondents plan to increase cryptocurrency holdings within the next year Younger investors (under 45) show the strongest demand for digital asset exposure High-net-worth individuals seek professional guidance for cryptocurrency investments The average portfolio allocation to digital assets continues to grow steadily These numbers suggest we’re witnessing just the beginning of a major transformation in wealth management. Financial professionals who recognize this shift early will likely capture significant market share. How Can Financial Advisors Adapt to the Crypto Revolution? Forward-thinking financial advisors are responding to this demand in several ways. First, they’re educating themselves about blockchain technology and digital assets. Many are pursuing specialized certifications in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Others are partnering with crypto-native firms to offer their clients secure exposure to this emerging asset class. The most successful advisors recognize that cryptocurrency access isn’t just about buying Bitcoin. It involves understanding decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and emerging Web3 technologies. They’re positioning themselves as comprehensive digital asset guides rather than just traditional investment managers. What Challenges Do Investors Face When Seeking Crypto Exposure? Despite growing demand, investors encounter several obstacles when pursuing cryptocurrency access through traditional channels. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern for many financial institutions. Security worries and technological complexity also create barriers to entry. However, these challenges are gradually diminishing as infrastructure improves and regulatory frameworks evolve. The survey results indicate that investors are becoming increasingly comfortable with digital assets, viewing short-term volatility as part of the normal investment landscape. The Future of Wealth Management Includes Digital Assets The message from wealthy investors couldn’t be clearer: cryptocurrency access is no longer optional. Financial advisors who fail to provide this service risk losing substantial business to more adaptable competitors. The 35% switching rate represents just the tip of the iceberg, with 84% planning increased allocations signaling sustained growth ahead. This transformation represents more than just a passing trend. It marks a fundamental shift in how younger generations view wealth preservation and growth. Digital assets have moved from the fringe to the mainstream, and financial professionals must evolve accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions Why are wealthy investors so interested in cryptocurrency access? Wealthy investors see digital assets as diversification tools and growth opportunities. Many believe blockchain technology will transform multiple industries and want exposure to this innovation. What percentage of investors are switching advisors over crypto? 35% of young, high-net-worth U.S. investors have changed financial advisors because their previous firms didn’t offer cryptocurrency access. How many investors plan to increase crypto holdings? The survey found that 84% of respondents intend to increase their cryptocurrency investments over the next twelve months. Are traditional financial institutions adapting to this demand? Some are, but many remain cautious due to regulatory uncertainty and technological challenges. This creates opportunities for more agile competitors. What should investors look for in a crypto-friendly advisor? Seek professionals with proven cryptocurrency expertise, secure custody solutions, and comprehensive digital asset strategies beyond basic Bitcoin exposure. Is this trend limited to younger investors? While strongest among investors under 45, interest in digital assets is growing across all age groups as awareness and infrastructure improve.

Key Takeaways: Thirty-five percent of young wealthy US investors have already moved money away from advisers who don’t offer crypto exposure. Institutional adoption from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity has boosted confidence. 92% of surveyed investors want access to a broader range of digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. A study released Wednesday by crypto payments firm Zerohash surveyed 500 U.S. investors aged 18 to 40 with annual incomes between $100,000 and $1 million. The findings showed that 35% have already moved money away from advisers who do not offer crypto exposure, and more than half of those shifts involved between $250,000 and $1 million. Institutional Adoption Boosts Young Investors’ Confidence in Crypto The trend reflects how quickly crypto has moved from fringe to mainstream for younger investors. Zerohash noted that more than four-fifths of respondents said their confidence in digital assets increased as major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, embraced the sector over the past year. Investors at the upper end of the income spectrum appear to be the most impatient. Among respondents earning $500,000 or more, half said they had already switched advisers due to a lack of crypto offerings. The survey also pointed to robust demand ahead: 84% plan to increase their crypto holdings over the next 12 months, with nearly half saying they intend to “increase their allocations significantly.” Zerohash said the results show that crypto has become “essential to modern portfolio strategy,” and warned that wealth advisers who fail to adapt may lose clients to platforms offering broader digital asset access. “Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” the firm said. Crypto is officially shaking up Wall Street A recent survey by Zerohash shows that 35% of wealthy U.S. investors aged 18–40 ditched their financial institutions because their advisors didn’t offer crypto. Yep, no Bitcoin, no loyalty. Most of them moved $250K to $1M, and… pic.twitter.com/2UKbjAIwTP — Seven Crypto (@SevenWinse) November 20, 2025 Respondents were clear about their expectations: they want crypto integrated into their existing portfolios, with insured custody and compliant access. The demand goes beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ninety-two percent said access to a wider range of digital assets is important, a trend reflected in the growing menu of exchange-traded products tied to altcoins such as Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. Staking Products Gaining Momentum Asset managers are increasingly rolling out more complex offerings, including staking-based products that generate yield for users who lock up tokens. BlackRock appears to be preparing to enter that market as well, filing for a staked Ether ETF in Delaware this week. Meanwhile, 21Shares has launched its new 21Shares Solana ETF (TSOL) on the CBOE, giving U.S. investors direct exposure to the spot price of SOL without holding the token themselves. The fund debuted with $100 million in assets under management, joining a growing wave of Solana-focused products entering the US market. TSOL follows 21Shares’ earlier US launches, including its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (now above $8 billion AUM) and its spot Ethereum ETF. The firm already runs the world’s largest Solana ETP in Europe, with more than $1 billion in assets. With Fidelity, Bitwise, VanEck and Grayscale also pushing into spot Solana products, the segment has drawn over $420 million in inflows, underscoring rising demand for institutional-grade SOL exposure.

37365,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=129511,1763621981,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37365.jpeg,Flow coin price prediction 2025-2031: Is FLOW a good investment?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/flow-coin-price-prediction/,"Key takeaways: Flow coin price prediction for 2025 could reach a maximum value of $ 0.7975. By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.2656 Market Cap $430.49M Trading Volume $9.7M Circulating Supply 1.62B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.157 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2649 24-hour Low $0.2511 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.70% (Medium) 50-Day SMA $0.2901 14-Day RSI 43.95 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 11 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.3736 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow is stabilising around $0.265 with tightening volatility and early signs of a momentum turnaround. The short-term momentum supports bullish recovery, with the Alligator lines beginning to expand upward. Flow coin 1-day price analysis Flow’s 1-day chart for November 20 shows the coin holding at $0.265, hovering right on the mid-Bollinger band at $0.262, a sign that the market is trying to stabilise after a multi-day downtrend. The narrowing Bollinger bands indicate reduced volatility, and this compression typically precedes a stronger directional move. Should the coin close above $0.266–$0.270, the upper band at $0.291 becomes the next target, but failure to sustain this level risks a slip back to $0.250–0.240, where support recently formed. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram has flattened near zero, and the signal lines are converging, hinting at a potential bullish crossover if buyers push slightly harder. Meanwhile, RSI sits around 47, climbing slowly. This neutral zone is still favorable for upward extension if momentum increases. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, Flow has printed a clear bullish leg back to $0.266, with strong green candles reclaiming short-term moving averages. The Alligator lines are beginning to fan upward again, signalling the early phase of a potential trend reversal. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The last bullish impulse broke the recent sequence of lower highs, and if price holds above $0.262, buyers may attempt another push toward $0.270–0.274. The MACD sits above zero and is turning upward, confirming the intraday shift in momentum. Volume via PVT is no longer declining, which supports the validity of this upward impulse. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3133 SELL SMA 5 $0.2886 SELL SMA 10 $0.2790 SELL SMA 21 $0.2680 SELL SMA 50 $0.2901 SELL SMA 100 $0.3405 SELL SMA 200 $0.3736 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2735 SELL EMA 5 $0.2907 SELL EMA 10 $0.3232 SELL EMA 21 $0.3523 SELL EMA 50 $0.3693 SELL EMA 100 $0.3797 SELL EMA 200 $0.4204 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow appears to be transitioning from exhaustion to early recovery. If buyers defend $0.260 and momentum holds, a short-term rally toward $0.274–0.280 is likely. A failure to hold the mid-range could re-expose FLOW to support near $0.250. Overall, bias leans mildly bullish unless the coin breaks $0.258 in the meantime. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

54644485,631048,1763622009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54644485.jpeg,Hyperliquid At Risk In Democrats’ Crypto Crackdown? ZachXBT Warns Of Potential Risks,https://bitcoinist.com/hyperliquid-at-risk-in-democrats-crypto-crackdown/,"The recent crypto crackdown from the Democratic party, spearheaded by crypto-skeptic Senator Elizabeth Warren, may cast a shadow over the future of the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid (HYPE). This heightened scrutiny stems from concerns surrounding the crypto ventures associated with President Donald Trump’s family, specifically focusing on World Liberty Financial (WLFI). National Security Concerns Over WLFI’s Sales In a letter dated Tuesday, US Senators Warren and Jack Reed, who serve on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, expressed apprehensions that WLFI might pose national security risks. The letter, which was exclusively obtained by CNBC and addressed to Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, outlined the senators’ belief that World Liberty Financial lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent malicious actors from manipulating funds or exerting influence over its governance. The senators referenced a report by the nonprofit watchdog Accountable.US, which indicated that WLFI had sold its WLFI tokens to “various highly suspicious entities.” On-chain sleuth ZachXBT brought attention to the fact that WLFI raised an impressive $550 million during its token sale, but the senators accused it of having raised around $10,000 from illicit sources. ZachXBT noted that this figure represents merely 0.0018% of the total World Liberty Financial token sale, highlighting the disproportionate nature of the allegations. The investigator expressed concern over the potential misuse of “weak illicit funds” arguments by US regulators against the crypto industry. He suggested that if the actions against WLFI prove successful, Hyperliquid could become a target next. While ZachXBT did not provide specific reasons for why Hyperliquid might be affected, speculation surrounds WLFI’s native token trading on the Hyperliquid platform. Moreover, Hyperliquid recently incurred a loss of $4.9 million due to the external manipulation of the POPCAT token, where attackers artificially inflated the token’s price using $3 million in Circle’s USDC stablecoin, which could also catch the Senator’s attention if any action against the exchange materializes. Hyperliquid Unveils ‘Growth Mode Despite the challenges, Hyperliquid introduced a new feature under its HIP-3 upgrade framework, aimed at significantly reducing trading fees for newly launched markets. Dubbed “growth mode,” this upgrade reduces all-in taker fees by more than 90%, a move designed to accelerate liquidity formation and incentivize market makers engaging in nascent perpetual contracts. Since its launch, Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE , has experienced notable growth, skyrocketing by 1,000%. This surge has elevated Hyperliquid to rank as the 18th largest cryptocurrency in the world, boasting a market capitalization of $10 billion. However, when writing, HYPE trades at $37.31, recording losses of over 9% in the past fourteen days. After reaching a record high of $59.30 earlier this year, the token has retraced by almost 37%, in line with the broader crypto market’s correction.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $91,988.81 on the Binance USDT market, marking a concerning downturn for investors. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? The sudden Bitcoin price movement has left many traders wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several factors that could be influencing this downward trend. However, it’s important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are naturally volatile and price fluctuations are common. Key factors affecting the current Bitcoin price include: Market sentiment shifts among institutional investors Global economic uncertainty impacting risk assets Technical trading patterns and resistance levels Regulatory developments in major markets How Significant is This Bitcoin Price Movement? While any drop in Bitcoin price below key psychological levels grabs attention, context matters. The current Bitcoin price of $91,988.81 represents a notable decline, but historical patterns show that Bitcoin has weathered much larger fluctuations. Therefore, long-term investors often view these movements as normal market behavior. The current Bitcoin price situation presents both challenges and opportunities: For short-term traders: Increased volatility means higher risk but also potential quick gains For long-term holders: Price dips can represent buying opportunities For new investors: Lower entry points might be attractive for portfolio diversification What Should Investors Do About the Falling Bitcoin Price? When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, having a clear strategy becomes crucial. Rather than making emotional decisions, consider your investment goals and risk tolerance. Many experts suggest that reacting to short-term Bitcoin price changes often leads to poor investment outcomes. Actionable insights for navigating the current Bitcoin price environment: Review your portfolio allocation and risk exposure Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks Stay informed about market fundamentals rather than focusing solely on price Set clear entry and exit strategies based on your investment horizon Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Buying Opportunity? Some market participants see Bitcoin price declines as potential entry points. The current Bitcoin price below $92,000 might attract buyers who believe in the long-term value proposition. However, every investment decision should align with individual financial goals and risk capacity. Remember that the Bitcoin price has historically recovered from much larger declines. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, understanding market cycles can provide valuable perspective when evaluating the current Bitcoin price situation. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $92,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from combined factors including market sentiment, technical trading patterns, and broader economic conditions affecting risk assets. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this price drop? Investment decisions should align with your strategy and risk tolerance. Many long-term investors maintain positions through volatility, while traders might adjust based on short-term outlook. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible, but historical data shows Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations while maintaining long-term upward trends. Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some investors see price dips as buying opportunities, but timing markets is challenging. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks. What support levels should I watch for Bitcoin price? Technical analysts monitor previous resistance and support levels, but fundamental factors often drive long-term Bitcoin price movements more significantly. How often does Bitcoin price experience such volatility? Bitcoin price volatility is common, with similar percentage moves occurring regularly throughout its history as part of normal market behavior. Found this analysis helpful?

This performance follows the announcement of a key partnership with Durrah AlFodah Holding to promote the growth of blockchain technology in Saudi Arabia. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims $140 As Second Wave Of SOL ETFs Debut – Is A Rebound Coming? WhiteBIT Secures Strategic Collab In Saudi Arabia On Tuesday, top crypto exchange WhiteBIT unveiled it had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Durrah AlFodah Holding, represented by His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, aiming to drive the Kingdom’s development in blockchain technology, digital finance, and data infrastructure. According to the announcement, the partnership aligns with the strategic pillars of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 program, which seeks to foster economic diversification, technological innovation, and digital transformation across the Kingdom’s public and private sectors. Therefore, it will set the foundation for key projects within the Kingdom, including stock market tokenization, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) guidance, and the creation of national data computing and mining centers. Under the agreement, WhiteBIT will provide technological expertise and infrastructure design, while Durrah AlFodah will facilitate the crypto exchange’s market entry, regulatory engagement, and partnership development across Saudi Arabia. The move follows the exchange’s expansion to multiple jurisdictions, including Australia, Croatia, Italy, and Kazakhstan, as well as its recent dual entry into the Argentine and Brazilian markets, after key regulatory advancements in the two largest countries in South America. The collaboration reportedly envisions the creation of a joint venture company between WhiteBIT and Durrah AlFodah to manage and scale its national-scale initiatives. Volodymyr Nosov, Founder and President of W Group, the global fintech ecosystem that includes WhiteBIT, affirmed: It is an honor to work alongside the Holding of His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud to build the foundations of Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation. Together, we aim to establish secure and sovereign blockchain systems that will shape the Kingdom’s technological future. WBT Leads Mid-Week Altcoin Market Following the news, WhiteBIT’s WBT token jumped from the $51 level to a new all-time high (ATH) of $62.96 before stabilizing between the $60-$61 area. This performance builds on the remarkable WBT’s price action during the recent market volatility, which has seen many leading cryptocurrencies reach multi-month lows. Notably, the altcoin rallied to new highs in late June and consolidated within its $40-$47 range during the broader market rally between July and October. However, as the market entered a corrective phase in early November, WBT went against the current and broke out of its local range, hitting a new ATH at the time.

Moreover, the altcoin, which ranks 13th among all cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, is currently the only token with double-digit gains among the top 20 cryptocurrencies. As of this writing, WBT is trading at $60.62, a 9.8% increase for the altcoin in the weekly timeframe.

It is a tool banks can use today. With 15 years of Ripple technology, Aljarrah expects a major rally within 6 to 24 months. Fast Cross-Border Payments Aljarrah explained that RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity unravel slow international payments. Banks typically maintain funds in multiple accounts globally. This locks cash and slows transfers. XRP works differently. Banks convert local money into XRP and send it instantly. The receiving bank converts XRP into local money. Aljarrah pointed out that this lowers cost and risk. He noted that real money moves daily through active corridors in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. A liquidity crisis is approaching, and $XRP is uniquely positioned to provide instant cross-border settlement. With 15 years of @Ripple infrastructure in place, banks can leverage it immediately.

Aljarrah pointed out that Ripple has licenses in Singapore, the EU, and the UAE. He also highlighted the ruling from a U.S. judge that XRP is not a security . This lets banks use XRP safely. Aljarrah described old lawsuits as temporary noise. New rules, such as the EU’s MiCA and Abu Dhabi’s FSRA, match XRP. This legal clarity speeds up global adoption . Central Banks and Digital Money Central banks are also testing XRP and Ripple’s technology. Aljarrah stated that digital money needs fast, neutral ways to settle payments.

As more banks adopt these systems, demand for the asset will grow. Aljarrah believes XRP will become a key part of global real-time settlements. Liquidity and Immediate Market Impact XRP’s value comes from its use. Large transfers need high XRP liquidity. Banks and market makers must hold billions to maintain instant payments. Aljarrah estimated that $1 trillion in daily transfers could require $100 billion in XRP. Each new corridor or digital market adds demand. He stressed that price rises are due to need, not speculation. Aljarrah expects market effects within 6 to 24 months.

This comprehensive Solana price prediction analyzes every factor that could propel SOL to new heights between 2025 and 2030. Understanding Solana Price Prediction Fundamentals Solana has established itself as a leading blockchain platform known for its incredible speed and scalability. The SOL price reflects not just market sentiment but fundamental technological advantages. When examining any cryptocurrency prediction, it’s crucial to consider both technical analysis and real-world adoption metrics. The current SOL price movement suggests growing institutional confidence in Solana’s long-term viability. Key Factors Driving Solana 2025 Price Targets Several critical elements will influence whether Solana reaches $500 by 2025. Network upgrades, developer activity, and mainstream adoption all play significant roles in this cryptocurrency prediction. The expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications built on Solana creates inherent value for SOL tokens. Market analysts closely monitor transaction volume and staking participation as indicators of network health.

Chart patterns, moving averages, and trading volume all contribute to understanding potential SOL price trajectories. The current blockchain technology adoption curve suggests increasing utility demand for Solana’s high-throughput capabilities. Historical resistance and support levels help identify key price zones that could accelerate movement toward $500. Challenges in Cryptocurrency Prediction Accuracy While optimistic about Solana’s potential, responsible investing requires acknowledging prediction uncertainties. Regulatory developments, market volatility, and technological competition all impact SOL price stability. This cryptocurrency prediction considers multiple scenarios, including bear market conditions that could temporarily depress prices. Diversification remains essential when investing in any digital asset, regardless of promising forecasts. Network scalability and transaction speed advantages Growing decentralized finance ecosystem Institutional investment patterns Global regulatory landscape evolution Competitive blockchain technology developments Why Solana 2025 Projections Generate Excitement The roadmap for Solana development includes significant upgrades that could dramatically increase network efficiency and utility.

Current development activity suggests the Solana ecosystem will continue expanding through 2025 and beyond. Frequently Asked Questions What makes Solana different from other cryptocurrencies? Solana stands out for its exceptional transaction speed and low costs, leveraging unique consensus mechanisms that enable scalability unmatched by many competitors. How reliable are long-term cryptocurrency predictions? While educated projections provide valuable insights, all long-term predictions carry inherent uncertainty due to market volatility and unforeseen technological or regulatory developments.

What companies are building on Solana? Major projects include FTX (before its collapse), Serum , and numerous NFT marketplaces and DeFi protocols leveraging Solana’s high-speed infrastructure. How does Solana compare to Ethereum? While Ethereum pioneered smart contracts, Solana offers significantly higher transactions per second and lower fees, though with different decentralization trade-offs. As we’ve explored, the path to $500 for Solana involves multiple converging factors – technological advancement, market adoption, and broader cryptocurrency acceptance. While predictions provide valuable frameworks, the dynamic nature of digital assets means investors should maintain balanced perspectives and risk management strategies.

South Korea’s leading exchange Upbit has announced a crucial service interruption that affects your digital asset management. The platform will temporarily suspend all Upbit crypto deposits and withdrawals for approximately two hours this November. Here’s everything you need to know to prepare for this brief maintenance window. When Exactly Will Upbit Crypto Deposits and Withdrawals Stop? The scheduled maintenance begins precisely at 4:00 a.m. UTC on November 25. During this period, you cannot process any Upbit crypto deposits or withdrawal requests. The exchange estimates the service interruption will last about two hours, meaning normal operations should resume around 6:00 a.m. UTC. Therefore, plan your trading activities accordingly to avoid any inconvenience. Why Is Upbit Temporarily Halting Services? The suspension stems from essential server maintenance for VerifyVASP, a critical compliance system. VerifyVASP ensures secure transaction monitoring and regulatory compliance across virtual asset service providers. This maintenance demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to: Enhanced security protocols Regulatory compliance standards System reliability improvements User protection measures What Should Upbit Users Do During the Maintenance? While Upbit crypto deposits and withdrawals will be unavailable, most other exchange functions remain operational. You can still access your account, monitor market prices, and place limit orders. However, we recommend completing any urgent transactions before the maintenance window begins. Remember that other crypto exchanges continue operating normally, so you might consider alternative platforms for time-sensitive trades. How Does This Affect Your Crypto Trading Strategy? Brief maintenance periods typically cause minimal market impact, but prudent traders always prepare for contingencies. The temporary halt on Upbit crypto deposits might affect traders who: Rely on quick deposit confirmations for arbitrage opportunities Need immediate withdrawal capabilities for other investments Plan to transfer assets between exchanges during this window Fortunately, the two-hour duration falls during relatively low trading volume hours for Asian markets, potentially minimizing disruption. What Makes This Upbit Maintenance Different? Unlike routine system updates, this maintenance specifically targets VerifyVASP infrastructure. This system plays a vital role in preventing money laundering and ensuring transaction transparency. The upgrade likely incorporates new regulatory requirements or security enhancements that benefit all users in the long term. Regular maintenance like this actually strengthens the platform’s reliability and compliance standing. Key Takeaways for Upbit Users The temporary suspension of Upbit crypto deposits and withdrawals represents standard operational procedure for maintaining a secure trading environment. While briefly inconvenient, such maintenance ultimately protects your assets and ensures regulatory compliance. The exchange has provided ample notice, allowing users to adjust their trading schedules accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions Will I be able to trade during the Upbit maintenance? Yes, trading functions will remain available. Only deposit and withdrawal services will be temporarily suspended. What happens if I initiate a transfer right before maintenance begins? Complete any transactions well before the 4:00 a.m. UTC start time. Pending transactions might be delayed until services resume. Will this affect cryptocurrency prices on Upbit? Typically, brief maintenance windows don’t significantly impact prices, but reduced liquidity might cause slight volatility. How often does Upbit perform such maintenance? Regular maintenance occurs periodically, usually announced several days in advance to minimize user disruption. Can I still access my funds during this period? Yes, your funds remain secure in your account. Only the transfer functionality will be temporarily unavailable. What if the maintenance takes longer than two hours? Upbit has established a strong track record of completing maintenance within announced timeframes, but monitor official channels for updates. Share This Important Update Help fellow crypto traders stay informed! Share this article on your social media channels to ensure everyone in the Upbit community prepares for the temporary service interruption.

Over the last 30 days, ARB lost 24.89% in value. The recovery was accompanied by rising trading volumes (11.68%) as trader interest renewed.

ARB is caught in a broader risk-off rotation. The recent correction is a result of exhaustion from selling pressure. The $0.22 support level remains critical to ARB’s trajectory. Why is ARB down? ARB’s 14-day RSI hit 35.66 – nearing oversold territory (sub-30) – signaling exhaustion in recent selling pressure.

Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines. Is Arbitrum good to buy? Arbitrum is trading at its lowest range this year, with the charts showing it is just above the oversold region. At current prices, ARB is undervalued and is likely to recover if market sentiment changes.

Currently, Ripple is considering adding a staking feature to the XRP Ledger. Ripple is discussing introducing a staking feature for XRP Ledger (XRPL) to increase XRP's use in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, according to Decrypt. RippleX Senior Director of Engineering J. Ayo Akinyele said in a recent blog post that introducing staking to the XRP Ledger could improve network security by incentivizing long-term participation and rewarding users who help maintain consensus. “Considering how XRP’s usage can expand with new features, the need for staking naturally arises. Staking can incentivize long-term participation and provide rewards to participants who help maintain consensus, which can strengthen network security.” The introduction of staking has been noted to have the potential to increase utility through increased network security and participant rewards. However, it was also stated that it is difficult to adopt in the short term due to technical difficulties and risks. Akinyele stated that the XRP Ledger was initially designed to provide efficient global value transfer and liquidity, particularly for cross-border payments, and that this concept will help XRP maintain its dominance once it is adopted by digital asset treasuries and exchange-traded funds. However, the introduction of staking would challenge fundamental principles of the ledger, such as the Proof of Relationship mechanism, which prioritizes trust and stability over financial incentives. XRP is trading at $2.13, according to CoinMarketCap data. *This is not investment advice.

The SHIB token is expanding its digital asset utilities and gaining attention with its technical movements. More and more digital fans are expecting partnerships to increase SHIB’s utility more, and partnerships are being formed. At the same time, the presale of Mutuum Finance is expected to be one of the quickest to be completed as the market and users are seeing the expected utility. These two digital assets are expected to be the top digital assets to pay attention to as the 2026 year commences. Shiba Inu Sustains Dedication to Recent Collaborations Due to recent integrations Shiba Inu is showing strong signs of recovery. Recent integrations with Unity Nodes allow SHIB to have true utility within the telecom infrastructure. This integration allows customers to purchase nodes and licenses using SHIB. This grants customers the ability to earn in SHIB which in turn creates a circular economy. Additionally, this is a positive fundamental development considering the asset in question. Recent 4 hour time frame data shows a bullish reversal head and shoulders bottom consolidation. If the price breaks the resistance head and shoulders neckline, expect SHIB to target $0.00001025. For the fundamentalist investor considering what crypto to buy today with the best short term potential however, SHIB falls behind utility based tokens like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale is Almost Sold Out As SHIB works on trying to recover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing what demand truly is, as their ongoing presale is nothing short of amazing. We are now in Phase 6 of the presale, and the phase is almost sold out. Here, investors can purchase MUTM tokens for $0.035 which is a great deal before Phase 7 when the presale price increases by almost 20%. With the project having raised over $18.8 million, it is clear that investors are confident in this project. With presale success like this, Mutuum Finance will most certainly be one of the next big cryptocurrencies, and people in this current phase can expect more than a 400% return based on the price predicted for when the project officially launches. Given the current demand, the opportunity will be gone in the blink of an eye. Multi-Purpose Lending Architecture Provides Incredible Flexibility One of the many reasons people are so excited with the advancements in the Mutuum Finance ecosystem is the popularity of the dual lending model. The dual lending model caters to a number of different users with varying levels in their risk acceptance profile, making Mutuum Finance a versatile defi crypto platform. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows customers of the platform to deposit stable major assets like ETH, and USDT to a pooled liquidity from which depositors earn yield automation in a secured shared pool environment. At the same time, the platform has a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending that allows borrowers to negotiate loans directly with lenders on less liquid or exotic assets, allowing more control over the loan with institutional and advanced users. The dual model architecture allows mainstream and niche assets to find an efficient market, and provides countless opportunities to lenders, borrowers, and lends a solid ground to the architecture for new sustainable growth. The Buy and Distribute Mechanism and Sustainable Value Given the finance lending market, Mutuum Finance incorporates a unique ecological tokenomic feature, the buy-and-distribute mechanism, which establishes an alliance between the token value and the intensity of the platform usage. A fraction of the total revenue from protocol fees is circumvented to buy back MUTM tokens from the market. The acquired tokens are distributed to stakers of mtTokens, the liquidity providing interest-bearing receipts. Consequently, a sustainable feedback loop is created, whereby increased user engagement and fee collection amplify the buying pressure on the MUTM token and the constant stakers receive higher progressive rewards. This model unique to the protocol is a token holder value proposition. It is thereby one of the tokens to buy for those looking for crypto with embedded appreciation mechanisms. How to Position in The Most Valuable Assets By early 2026, the story is already in progress, as Mutuum Finance is using its community to build tangible utility, and has built a product and is demonstrating the power of a well-structured presale. With the Mutuum Finance presale window rapidly closing, there is a positive opportunity to take an investment in a project built for a positive investment outcome to a new level and a new height from where you currently stand. With its dual lending model, along with its innovative tokenomics, Mutuum Finance is definitely the best crypto to buy now for the upcoming quarter. It is the final opportunity to take part in Phase 6.

Over the past 12 hours, though, the bulls managed to reclaim some lost ground, and now the question is whether the asset can surpass $100,000 again this month or if this is only a “dead cat bounce.” To gain a clearer perspective, we asked four of the most popular AI chatbots for their two cents on the matter. Are the Bulls Coming Back? According to ChatGPT, a rebound above $100,000 would be “big” but not unusual for BTC’s volatility. The chatbot reminded that, historically, the primary cryptocurrency has snapped back with increases of 10-20% mere days after sharp corrections and liquidations. It noted that long-term holders remain unfazed by the crash, predicting that a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve, which suggests further rate cuts, could boost the asset. “Once BTC approaches $95-$97K again, FOMO can reignite aggressively and push the price towards the six-figure mark,” it added. Additionally, ChatGPT reminded that November is one of the strongest months for Bitcoin. While the asset has indeed registered solid increases during this period, the picture is somewhat different when November follows a halving year. The last two halvings occurred in 2020 and 2024. In November 2021, BTC slipped by approximately 7%, and since the beginning of the current month, its valuation is down by over 16%. Grok estimated that the chance of a rise above $100K before the start of December is around 40-50%. Similar to ChatGPT, it claimed that the approach of America’s central bank on interest rates will be of utmost importance to the recovery of the entire crypto market. “If you’re long-term bullish, dips like this are gifts – stack sats, hedge with options, and watch $90K as the ultimate support,” it stated. More Optimistic Opinions Perplexity said a rise beyond $100,000 as early as this month is likely and would coincide with the bullish expectations of some proponents of the digital asset. It warned that volatility might increase on the path towards that goal and predicted a further rise to $120,000 in December. Google’s Gemini claimed that a rise above that milestone is possible once BTC clears the $95,000 support zone. It also mentioned the recent decline in interest in spot BTC ETFs, suggesting that the return of institutional investors would be beneficial for a potential renewed rally.

These mining companies are shifting their focus towards AI and data center operations to capitalize on GPU demand, rather than relying entirely on cryptocurrency mining. IREN shifted part of its operations from traditional Bitcoin mining towards providing a data center for AI workloads. The firm recently signed a $9.7 billion multi-year deal with Microsoft to deliver Nvidia-based GPU compute from its North American facilities. The deal established Microsoft as IREN’s largest customer. IREN acquires Nvidia equipment from Dell Technologies to support the deployment of high-performing GPU clusters. IREN and Cipher Mining stock jumps over 10% after hours IREN stock rallied to $50.45 after hours following the announcement of better-than-expected Nvidia’s Q3 earnings as the firm expands its cloud-AI infrastructure backed by an extensive secured power portfolio. The stock price represented a 10.08% jump before today’s drawdown, reaching $45.83, which represents a $6.18% drop. IREN stock has grown over ten times its starting price at the beginning of 2025, with a 366.7% year-to-date growth, reflecting a growing investor conviction that miners are repositioning themselves as AI compute providers. Cipher Mining, which signed a 10-year AI hosting deal with Fluidstack, a Google-based firm, to use its data centers for AI purposes, also experienced a stock rally after hours. So far, Cipher Mining is upgrading some of its facilities to support Nvidia’s H100 and Blackwell GPUs. The firm’s stock rallied to $16.51, representing a 12.93% gain after hours. The CIFR stock has so far experienced a drawdown to $14.62, representing a 0.27% gain on the daily chart. Just like IREN, Cipher stock has experienced more than ten times growth this year with a 215.09% gain year to date, underscoring the conviction among investors that miners are repositioning their computing capacity to provide AI workload services. Nvidia’s Q3 earnings validated the current trend, driven by its data center GPUs’ support for the ongoing demand for AI compute. Miners are positioning themselves to benefit by offering that capacity. According to Nvidia’s press release , the firm recorded $57 billion in Q3 revenue, up 22% from Q2 and 62% growth year over year. The data center business generated $ 51.2 billion, representing a 25% increase from Q2 and a 66% year-over-year increase. Earnings per share were $1.3, and the GAAP gross margin was 73.4%. Nvidia projects a $65 billion revenue in Q4 Based on Nvidia’s projections, Q4 is expected to generate approximately $65 billion in revenue, with a non-GAAP gross margin of roughly 75%. Jensen Huang, the company CEO, revealed that the demand for its Blackwell chips and cloud GPUs fueled the results as AI compute demand continues to increase. IREN, on the other hand, has so far recorded $501 million in revenue in fiscal year 2025, with its AI cloud business growing rapidly. The firm has also secured a 2,910 MW power capacity to host more GPUs and scale its AI workload operations in its data center in British Columbia and Texas. The halving process of the Bitcoin network triggered the shift towards AI workloads among Bitcoin miners. According to a Cryptopolitan report , after the 2024 Bitcoin halving, which reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC, miners experienced squeezed revenues, which added to rising network difficulty and slow transaction volumes, drying up profits. Despite Bitcoin reaching new highs of $126,000 per Bitcoin, unit economics could not work as previously. Power costs have dramatically increased, squeezing returns and prompting miners to diversify their energy usage towards AI workloads to continue generating profits. For miners like IREN and Cipher, the shift represents leveraging the existing power, space, and cooling infrastructure to capitalize on high-demand computing services.

In an X thread posted on Wednesday, the President Trump family-affiliated company revealed that attackers gained access to wallets through external lapses tied to third-party tools or malicious schemes that tricked users into exposing private keys during its launch on September 1. The affected wallets were reportedly frozen after users reported suspicious activity, and they were asked to complete identity checks again so the company could confirm ownership and return recovered funds to the correct recipients. WLFI said it also “built and tested new smart contract logic to handle bulk reallocations,” noting that most of the compromises were caused by phishing and exposed credentials. WLFI executes emergency burn for reallocation According to the company’s statement expounding on the source of the breach, the launch of Ethereum’s EIP-7702 Pectra upgrade saw attackers placing malicious contracts into already compromised accounts, later enabling token drains once WLFI went live. 1/ Prior to WLFI’s launch, a relatively small subset of user wallets were compromised via phishing attacks or exposed seed phrases. Since then, we’ve tested new smart contract logic to safely reallocate user funds and verified users’ identity via KYC checks. Shortly, users who… — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) November 19, 2025 World Liberty Financial froze 272 wallets affected by the breach and warned users that fake support accounts and scam recovery services were in circulation at the time. Although the number of impacted users was limited, the company insisted on stringent verification requirements to avoid sending tokens to the wrong parties. Yesterday, the Web 3 platform executed an emergency contract function that burned 166.667 million WLFI tokens, valued at about $22.14 million, from addresses involved in the hack. A market watcher going by the username Emmet Gallic shared a photo of the explanation given for the token burn function from the contract, which read: Image from token burn contract. Source: Emmett Gallic on X. WLFI confirmed from its X post that reallocations will begin shortly for wallets that have completed the required checks. Tokens belonging to users who have not yet contacted the company will be frozen until they go through the verification process, and they can start the procedure through its help center anytime until claims are resolved. “Thank you to everyone who showed patience and trust throughout this process. We’re proud to protect our community, and ready to keep building,” the platform’s social media team concluded. World Liberty Financial’s token trading opened on decentralized exchanges, dropping more than 15% shortly after going live and denting the profits of several holders like social media influencer Andrew Tate, Cryptopolitan reported . At the top of that band, the Trump family’s reported stake of 22.5 billion tokens carried a paper valuation exceeding $6 billion, per the Wall Street Journal’s feature. World Liberty Financial’s website lists Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Barron Trump as co-founders, while US President Donald Trump is noted as a “Co-Founder Emeritus.” US President Donald Trump’s ties to WLFI spark congressional probe A report by the watchdog Accountable.US said the company sold $10,000 worth of WLFI to traders who had interacted with a blockchain address now sanctioned for ties to the North Korean Lazarus hacking group. Acting on what they perceive as “actionable intel,” two US Senators have asked federal officials to examine World Liberty Financial’s activities. In a letter sent Tuesday, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jack Reed, both members of the Senate Banking Committee, claimed WLFI is a national security risk with links to bad actors from North Korea, Russia, and Iran. The lawmakers cited the Accountable.US report, which alleged that WLFI tokens were sold to individuals tied to a sanctioned Russian ruble-based sanctions evasion network, an Iranian crypto exchange, and Tornado Cash, a service the US has sanctioned for money laundering. World Liberty Financial rejected the allegations in a statement to CNBC, saying: “There is no conflict of interest between World Liberty Financial. We conducted rigorous AML/KYC checks on every pre-sale purchaser of the $WLFI governance token and turned down millions of dollars from potential purchasers who failed the tests.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|ETH|USD|WLFI,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-20 07:55:15

The PI token has exploded by over 12% in the past 24 hours, and it topped $0.25 for the second time since the start of this otherwise bearish month for the digital asset industry. Pi Network’s (PI) Price on CoinGecko On the question of why it has defied the overall trend and posted such a massive increase, the most obvious answer comes from a regulatory standpoint. Numerous accounts dedicated to covering news regarding the project updated that Pi Network has achieved full compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The revised whitepaper, published on November 19, explains this change, which opens the door for the PI token to be listed on regulated EU-based exchanges. According to Kim H Wong, the MiCA approval “ reduces regulatory uncertainty – a major adoption barrier – potentially increasing liquidity and institutional interest. Token utility (payments within Pi’s ecosystem) gains legitimacy, driving demand.” Tony Cruz was bullish on the asset’s immediate price uptick, suggesting that the next wave to $0.30 is imminent as PI is “making a big comeback.” Other possible reasons behind the token’s impressive resurgance could be related to the overall updates and network development recently announced by the team. As reported over the weekend, the Core Team outlined updates in regards to the Pi App Studio, which allowed users with all types of experience to enhance their app creation process. They can now download their apps from the Pi Studio, make changes on their local devices, and then re-upload them for deployment or further improvements.

This turmoil is exemplified by the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which experienced its largest single-day withdrawal since launch, further contributing to the decline in Bitcoin’s price. Profit-Taking And Caution The recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF highlight the severity of the current selloff within the Bitcoin market, which has experienced a substantial correction below the crucial $100,000 mark following a record high reached in October. Related Reading: Kraken Achieves $20 Billion Valuation With $200 Million Investment From Citadel This downturn emphasizes the widespread pullback affecting various risk assets, while gold has notably remained resilient. Some analysts suggest that these developments indicate a trend of investors shifting their exposure from Bitcoin to gold. “The crypto market entered a hangover in August,” said Thomas Perfumo, Global Economist at Kraken, in a recent interview with Reuters, noting that much of the earlier demand for Bitcoin had been fueled by borrowed funds. He added, “Momentum seemingly peaked during the summer. But the truth is this hangover trend started months ago.” Analysts have also pointed to profit-taking behaviors among long-term holders and increasing caution among Bitcoin ETF funds and digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which had previously ramped up their acquisitions throughout the year. Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, stated that Bitcoin treasury companies had collectively purchased nearly $50 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past year. Recently, however, many of these firms have begun trading at a discount to their net asset value, which could dampen market expectations for new Bitcoin purchases in the near term. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Plummet This shift occurs amid rising concerns among heavyweight investors regarding inflated valuations across various asset classes. José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, noted that “an ongoing lack of speculative spirits is weighing on Bitcoin.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Dips Below $90,000—Yet Altcoins Remain Unscathed: Here’s Why Despite managing over $73 billion in assets, IBIT has seen a decline of 19% in the current quarter. Data from SoSoValue indicates that spot Bitcoin ETF funds collectively have recorded $2.59 billion in outflows this month alone. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which has experienced $1.78 billion in outflows in November alone. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) ranks second, with nearly $540 million in outflows. The turbulence isn’t limited to Bitcoin; the Ethereum exchange-traded fund sector also faced outflows, totaling approximately $74.2 million yesterday, with BlackRock selling off $165.1 million. On a more positive note, Solana spot ETFs reported net inflows of $30.09 million on Tuesday, primarily driven by Bitwise’s BSOL. This marks a major streak of 15 consecutive days of inflows for Solana.

Ethereum DAT Project By Leading Asian Whales Has Been Canned Last month, Bloomberg reported that some influential investors in Asia were gearing up to launch an Ethereum trust. The group involved the likes of Li Lin, founder of Huobi cryptocurrency exchange, Shen Bo, co-founder of Fenbushi Capital, and Xiao Feng, chairman and CEO of HashKey Group. At the time, the investors were in talks to acquire a NASDAQ-listed entity to facilitate the digital-asset treasury (DAT) structure, with the project already boasting a backing of $1 billion. According to a report from Wu Blockchain , however, that project has now been cancelled. “The US$1 billion Ethereum DAT proposed by leading Asian crypto investors has been shelved, and the committed capital has been returned,” wrote Wu Blockchain. Of the $1 billion backing, $200 million came from investment firm Avenir Capital alone, of which Huobi’s Li is a chairman. Another $500 million was provided by Asian institutional investors like HongShan Capital Group. Popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a DAT company is a public entity that makes a digital-asset reserve its main business. Earlier, firms mostly focused on using Bitcoin in this type of strategy, but 2025 has seen a push into altcoins like Ethereum and Solana. BitMine , which is currently the largest ETH DAT and second-largest overall after Strategy, adopted its ETH reserve strategy in June of this year. According to a Monday press release , the company holds 3,559,879 tokens, bought for a total of $11.1 billion. Unlike BitMine, the Asia-led DAT project appears to have been halted before it could launch. “Sources said the plan was halted mainly due to the market downturn following the sharp October 11 sell-off,” revealed Wu Blockchain. Ethereum has been in freefall alongside the wider cryptocurrency sector since this crash, with its price being down over 38% compared to its October high. As a result, BitMine’s holdings have gone underwater. At the current exchange rate, its holdings are valued at $10.3 billion, roughly 7% below cost basis. The ETH network as a whole has its average cost basis (“ Realized Price “) located at $2,316, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post . Given this, the average investor is still in a profit of about 24%. Earlier, when Ethereum was trading around its high, profitability reached an extreme level. So compared to that, there has been a bit of a cooldown. “Momentum is cooling off as the market takes a breather,” noted Maartunn. ETH Price Ethereum has suffered another 5% drop in the past day that has sent its price to $2,880.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum DAT|Ethereum treasury|ETHUSDT|HashKey|huobi,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 08:00:18

The “Pay like a local” feature, powered by Noah, enables users to pay directly to local shops through Mercado Pago and PIX using their stablecoin balances. Opera announced the update during the Ethereum Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and it is now available for the MiniPay wallet’s over 10 million users. The Noah-powered “Pay like a local” feature connects to the users’ MiniPay balances through Mercado Pago in Argentina and PIX in Brazil. In Argentina, Mercado Pago’s digital wallet has over 72 million active users and a 68% market share in the country’s payment ecosystem. In Brazil, the dominant financial “operating system” PIX is used by 76% of the population and processes 80% more transactions than credit and debit cards combined. By connecting to both, Opera says MiniPay is providing a bridge for digital dollar holders and travelers to pay like locals in economies where foreign cards often fail. Opera is using the new feature to enable instant utility for crypto users in these markets. Spark says this is about unlocking true spending power Murray Spark, the Head of Commerce at MiniPay, said his company is turning a stablecoin into a powerful and reliable tool for local spending. He added that this is about unlocking true spending power and delivering the smooth payment experience that travelers in the region want. Spark emphasized that the new feature will bridge MiniPay users’ stablecoin balances to the payment infrastructure that is central to Latin America’s commerce. Spark said that with the new feature, users will initiate transfers in MiniPay, see the quoted amount in USD, and MiniPay will handle the conversion and disbursement in local currencies (Brazilian Real or Argentine Peso) through the Noah integration. He further noted that MiniPay helps avoid card rejections, hidden fees, and unfavorable exchange rates. It also delivers a fast, transparent, and predictable way to spend stablecoin balances locally. “Once you’ve topped up your wallet, it’s important to be able to make real time payments with it.” – Murray Spark , Head of Commerce at MiniPay Spark also said MiniPay will now enable users to send and receive USDT with sub-cent fees, no gas management, and a phone number-linked experience. All these new real-time payment methods were rolled out during Devconnect, enabling a majority of crypto users attending the conference to make local payments. MiniPay plans expansion with El Dorado and Alfred integrations MiniPay also plans to integrate El Dorado, a P2P on- and off-ramp partner in the region. El Dorado helps users convert local fiat currency into USDT in minutes. It also facilitates instant money transfers and transparent pricing across six countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Opera also stated that Alfred will complement this footprint with compliant liquidity and cash-in/cash-out options across Latin America. Meanwhile, Paytrie, a Canadian MSB registered with FINTRAC, links Canada into the network to enable low-cost cross-border transfers between Canada, the U.S., and Latin America. Opera claims MiniPay is expanding its on- and off-ramp coverage in Latin America by onboarding the two additional ramp partners. The multi-ramp approach will provide users with consistent options to transfer value between local currencies and stablecoins across LATAM . Julia Syzndzielorz, Opera’s Director of Global Comms, also said support for PIX payments via QR code is set to be rolled out in the near future.

The semiconductor giant reported record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter ended Oct. 26, a 62% climb year-over-year and significantly above the $54.7 billion expected by analysts. Nvidia also announced quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, up 65% from last year, with full-year forecasts indicating demand for AI-related products remains robust. The upbeat report arrived amid a stretch of weakness for tech equities, as investors feared the sector’s rapid AI-driven gains could be unsustainable. Crypto and Tech Stocks Move Higher After Hours Shares of Nvidia climbed more than 5% to $196 in post-market trading after closing the session at $186.52. The positive earnings surprise triggered a broader rebound across crypto-linked companies, with Coinbase, Strategy and Circle Internet Group all seeing modest after-hours increases following declines earlier in the day. Crypto exchange Bullish also gained about 1% after the bell, reversing a portion of its 3.7% drop despite reporting its strongest quarter since going public. Major tech stocks including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta likewise moved higher in extended trading, reflecting improved sentiment across the broader sector. Bitcoin and Ether Recover from Intraday Lows The upbeat earnings report provided a lift to Bitcoin, which has suffered more than 10% losses over the past week during a broader market downturn. Bitcoin dipped to $88,540 late Wednesday, its first time below $89,000 since late April. The world’s largest cryptocurrency later climbed back toward $91,500 shortly after Nvidia released its earnings, easing some downward pressure. Ether experienced a similar trajectory, falling to $2,873 — its lowest level since mid-July — before recovering above $3,000. Analysts say the correlation between crypto assets and tech stocks appears to have strengthened as investors continue to treat both sectors as high-risk plays responsive to macro conditions. Nvidia’s robust results, they say, may offer short-term relief to markets that have been rattled by concerns over rate policy, slowing growth and potential froth in AI-driven valuations.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-20 08:06:17

The court ruling prohibits Maple from launching its competing product, syrupBTC, and from dealing in CORE tokens pending arbitration, while finding serious merit in Core’s claims of misuse of confidential information and exclusivity violations. The dispute stems from a partnership formed in early 2025 to create lstBTC, a product that enables Bitcoin holders to earn yield while maintaining their assets with institutional custodians like BitGo. Core Foundation alleges that by mid-2025, Maple began secretly developing syrupBTC, a rival offering that violated their 24-month exclusivity agreement, while continuing to accept Core’s capital, resources, and confidential information. https://t.co/p7qEjG6nq5 — Core DAO (@Coredao_Org) November 19, 2025 From Partnership Success to Alleged Betrayal Core Foundation and Maple Finance announced their lstBTC partnership at Consensus Hong Kong in February 2025, targeting Bitcoin investors seeking yield without sacrificing custody security. Core invested substantially in technical development, marketing, and subsidies, while Maple launched with under $500 million in assets. The Bitcoin Yield offering’s April 2025 launch catalyzed explosive growth for Maple, securing over $150 million in Bitcoin through an early over-the-counter version of lstBTC. That early traction demonstrated strong product-market fit for a Core-powered Bitcoin yield product, which Core claims became the catalyst for Maple’s alleged pivot to competing infrastructure. Core alleges that by mid-2025, Maple began misusing confidential information and work product while continuing to accept resources to develop syrupBTC, a rival offering that violated their 24-month exclusivity agreement. On September 26, 2025, Justice Jalil Asif KC ruled that there is a serious issue regarding Maple’s alleged breach of exclusivity and misuse of confidential information, with the judgment published on October 30, 2025. Court Rules Damages Insufficient The court determined that monetary damages would be inadequate due to the risk that Maple would dispose of CORE tokens and the irreversible head-start advantage a competing product launch would provide. The injunction prohibits Maple from using Core’s confidential information, launching syrupBTC or similar products, and dealing in CORE tokens without written consent. Rich Rines of Core DOA urged Bitcoin Yield lenders to “ strongly consider seeking independent legal advice ” before signing Maple agreements.

Questions Over Lender Asset Access Maple indicated it needs to declare impairment worth millions of dollars against Bitcoin Yield lenders, raising questions about asset accessibility and legal authority. Core maintains the Bitcoin should be held safely with reputable custodians in a bankruptcy-remote segregated portfolio, a structure Core specifically required during initial contracting to ensure assets remained ring-fenced and could never cover other Maple liabilities or exposures. The lstBTC product featured hedged protection, with CORE price volatility managed through put options procured from third parties, with Core Foundation serving as one provider. Core honored every put expiry for months, paying out millions of dollars, until it determined that it was directly subsidizing a competitive product following Maple’s alleged material breaches. As a result of this discovery, BitcoinYield removed Maple from its tracking database, citing potential fund losses and pending litigation, while Maple has also removed the Bitcoin Yield product from its website. However, Maple denies wrongdoing and pledges to pursue “ all available remedies aggressively, ” while Core maintains it will take legal action “ as far as necessary to protect the community. “ Maple Finance stands firmly in defense of lender rights and confirms there is no impact to our broader business operations as a result of the recent Core Foundation statement.

Its presence in central bank pilots, payment infrastructure, and regulated environments has expanded in visible ways. This progress prompted Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto commentator, to reshare a video about its future. In the video, he explained why he believes XRP’s position supports a long-term move toward $500. WAKE UP!!! This is why I believe in $XRP A digital asset infiltrating the global financial system like a virus silently, rapidly, and unstoppable. Even the maxis are getting nervous https://t.co/14AitchpAO pic.twitter.com/lKuvWA998a — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 17, 2025 Why Xaif Calls XRP a Strategic Asset Xaif opened with a direct claim. He said XRP is “quietly infiltrating the global financial system.” He called it a “10-year-old coin that the elites have written off,” yet argued that it now operates inside high-level financial infrastructure . He rejected the idea that XRP is only useful for cheap cross-border payments. He believes that this view ignores its expanding role across global settlement systems . He pointed to Ripple’s work with more than 70 central banks. He described XRP as a liquidity bridge that links fiat currencies, CBDCs, and tokenized assets. He also noted its integration into the ISO 20022 messaging standard. These developments suggest XRP’s participation in real settlement frameworks rather than speculative ecosystems. Regulatory Progress Xaif highlighted Ripple’s regulatory progress in the U.S. He referenced Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license and Federal Reserve master account access. He also drew attention to RLUSD’s presence and the upcoming automated market maker. He said these steps position Ripple to fit U.S. regulatory expectations. They also allow XRP to operate in regulated environments, further expanding its reach. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Tracking Integrations Inside Global Finance Xaif supported his view by pointing to active pilots. He mentioned Brazil’s CBDC test on the XRP Ledger and the Bank of England’s digital pound trial using Ripple’s technology. He added that the UAE and Saudi Arabia relied on Ripple tech in Project Aber. He also cited institutions such as Santander, SBI Japan, and Bank of America. These integrations place XRP inside established financial systems that manage regulated money movement. He contrasted this progress with issues he sees in competing networks. Xaif noted Ethereum struggles with layer 2 fragmentation and unclear regulation. This limits its use in banking, while XRP benefits from clear compliance and active institutional adoption . Why He Believes XRP Can Reach $500 Xaif linked XRP’s price potential to market structure. He noted that it must reach $40 to match Bitcoin and $5 to surpass Ethereum. He drew attention to its role in central bank pilots, regulated payment systems, and institutional programs. When combined with regulatory clarity and active integrations, these can help XRP reach $500. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

First is XRP, which is having an extremely hard time trying to break the resistance at $2.30. Currently, it is showing signs of bearish control while the intraday momentum weakens. If this price continues to consolidate, it could run the risk of further losses if support levels get too weak. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is having explosive growth and is garnering the attention of countless investors. The presale is selling out quickly and is now in Phase 6, which is 90% sold out. It is also showing the kind of demand that continues to put it ahead of the other major cryptocurrencies that have gone stagnant. This is a new cryptocurrency that continues to show potential and market presence while the other coins are struggling. XRP’s Bearish Battle XRP has renewed selling pressure and cannot sustain above recovery of vital selling pressure zones. Recently, the price leveling at $2.320 was swiftly retraced, dropping bearish sentiment at $2.250. The price is tragically now below each of the Simple Moving Average, of technical indicators, with traders signal retraced higher risk. The price has a bearish trend line on each of the hour’s charts with a recovery cap of $2.2550. With each minor price uptick, sellers have taken the price on each of their downtrends to satisfy the defensive market position. The price’s immediate future must maintain support at $2.150. If the price loses this level, the price downtrends fast towards $2.050. Mutuum Finance Presale Continues Amidst stagnation in XRP, investors can look to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto opportunity as well as its successful structured presale that has raised funds totaling $18,820,000 selling to 18,110 holders, growing at a fast clip. With its selling price at $0,035, MUTM is currently in Phase 6 and selling per token for 250% more than the original price in Phase 1. However, the current phase is 90% complete with price per token at $0.035 and primed to close fast. Phase 7 price will be $0.040 for a near 20% price increase. This is the last opportunity for investors to acquire tokens at a price lower than Phase 7. With such a positive presale transaction increase, investors are anticipating a price increase to $0.06 at launch. With such a fast closing presale, a positive crypto growth opportunity can be easily estimated, making many to view this as the best crypto buy opportunity. MUTM Leaderboard and V1 Protocol One of the key features recently introduced on the platform is a daily leaderboard within the 24-hour period that documents the top 50 holders, adding visibility and healthy competition during the presale period. Each day, the leader is rewarded with a bonus of $500 MUTM for everyday they complete a transaction during that 24-hour period. In addition, accessibility is improved at Mutuum Finance and surpasses a purchase threshold by implementing the ability to directly buy MUTM tokens with a card, simplifying the actions necessary to enroll new investors. Overall, the project’s foundation is robust since it has a set date for the V1 protocol’s introduction on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 . The operational milestone will include a live liquidity pool, mtTokens, both a debt-token and liquidator bot, which will facilitate lending and borrowing using either ETH or USDT as collateral. MUTM is now within the ranks of the top defi crypto projects, which reflects the operational milestone’s credibility and the project’s foundation’s tangible progress. A Definite Opportunity for Growth There is a stark contrast that can be observed. Currently, the price action for XRP is moving sideways, and its current price structure is bearish, giving traders very little to be excited about in the short term. In stark contrast to this, however, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining substantial momentum with its presale, which is expected to enter the next stage in record time. There is a substantial investment case to be made with the time left to purchase at the price of $0.035, the unique features and security of the project and the time left before this opportunity is expected to be gone. For investor planning the best possible course of action for investing for the highest potential for growth, the accelerating presale of this new cryptocurrency is gaining a huge amount of attention and is in need of immediate attention and action. Phase 6 will be the last opportunity to join cheaply before price hike, join now.

The level has acted as a cycle indicator in previous downturns, including the 2018 and 2021 bear markets. Analysts say the breakdown last week has raised questions about a possible shift in market momentum. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $91,974, suggesting a 0.82% increase in the last 24 hours. The market mood reflects that concern. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plunged to 10, mirroring panic conditions last seen in early and mid-2022. Over the past month, more than $700 billion has been wiped from the broader crypto market. The sharp reversal comes after Bitcoin’s second drop below $100,000 within a week, a move that triggered a wave of alarms across trading desks. On-chain signals strengthen those concerns. Bitcoin is now trading below the realized price for coins held for six to twelve months, which sits near $94,600. This group represents conviction buyers who typically accumulate in bullish phases. Trading below their cost basis suggests growing unrealized losses and the potential for forced selling if pressure intensifies. Futures markets also show rising stress. Perpetual futures open interest saw its largest weekly jump since April, adding more than $3.3 billion. Many traders placed dip-buying orders as Bitcoin slipped under $98,000. Those orders filled as the price dropped, adding leveraged long positions into a declining market and increasing liquidation risk if the downtrend continues. Technical Signals Split Analysts Veteran trader Peter Brandt has added weight to the bearish view. He pointed to a sweeping reversal pattern on November 11, followed by eight sessions of lower highs and the formation of a broadening top. His projected downside targets are $81,000 and $58,000. These levels align with prior structural support zones that marked key turning points in earlier cycles. Still, not all indicators confirm the start of a full bear market. Several analysts argue that Bitcoin is experiencing a mid-cycle breakdown, a period of instability within a longer bullish trend. They say the market needs additional confirmation before declaring a broader trend reversal. The next phase will depend on whether selling pressure accelerates and whether key support levels hold. Despite weak sentiment, one trend challenges the bearish narrative. Whale accumulation has increased during the decline. Addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC have grown in number, suggesting that large investors and institutions view current prices as attractive. This behavior has historically aligned with accumulation zones rather than capitulation phases. Macro Liquidity Counters Bearish Bias Macro conditions offer further support for the bullish case. Global liquidity remains high, with more than 80% of central banks currently easing policy. Broad monetary loosening has often benefited risk assets, and cryptocurrencies typically react strongly to expanding liquidity. Analysts point to the present environment as similar to pre-bull markets, where short-term corrections occurred even as liquidity conditions improved. Data from the Bank for International Settlements shows rising credit growth. US dollar credit expanded 6% year-over-year through the second quarter of 2025, while euro credit rose 13%. Expanding credit availability has historically supported asset valuations and increased market resilience during periods of volatility. Many macro strategists argue that as long as central banks continue to cut rates and increase liquidity, risk assets retain structural support. They note that cryptocurrencies, as frontier assets, tend to experience amplified gains during liquidity cycles. The current backdrop aligns with those past patterns.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 09:30:07

54649976,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=855951,1763631120,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54649976.jpeg,Why Bitcoin Hyper’s $28M Presale Has Next 1000x Crypto Potential,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/next-1000x-crypto-bitcoin-hyper-hits-28-million-upscales-bitcoin/,"What to Know: Bitcoin Hyper aims to turn Bitcoin into a fast, smart-contract-ready Layer 2 using SVM, canonical bridging, and ZK-secured rollups. The $HYPER presale has raised over $28.16M at roughly $0.013305 per token, with strong whale entries and active retail demand. Stakers can lock $HYPER for around 41% APY, with over a billion tokens already committed, aligning early holders with long-term network growth. Price models suggest multi-X potential if the roadmap lands, but competition, delivery risk, and market shocks make $HYPER a high-risk, high-reward bet. Bitcoin is at $92K now, but it doesn’t exactly feel like victory lap season. Price action is choppy, majors are flashing double-digit red, and on-chain data keeps reminding everyone that the original crypto is still slow, expensive, and allergic to smart contracts. Bitcoin processes around seven transactions per second, fees spike whenever activity returns, and most of DeFi, NFTs, and on-chain experimentation still lives on faster networks like Solana. That leaves a strange gap: the most valuable asset in crypto is mostly sidelined from the high-growth side of Web3. That gap is exactly what new Bitcoin Layer-2 projects are trying to close. Among them, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quietly pushed its presale past $28M at ~$0.013305/token, just as the market shifts back from panic to cautious dip-buying. Multiple market roundups now place it in the micro-cap, infrastructure-narrative bucket that speculators scan when they hunt the next 1000x crypto. Bitcoin Hyper’s pitch is simple but aggressive: turn Bitcoin into a high-throughput, smart-contract-ready Layer 2 while keeping Bitcoin-grade security. Under the hood, that means a Solana-style virtual machine, a canonical bridge for wrapped $BTC, and a rollup design secured with zero-knowledge proofs. Early investors have already staked over a billion $HYPER for yields around 41% APY, and whale buys in the hundreds of thousands of dollars ($500K just 6 days ago) suggest larger players are at least testing the waters. With the presale now past the $28M mark, the obvious question is whether Bitcoin Hyper is just another cycle narrative… or a serious contender for the next breakout Layer-2 play. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Bitcoin Into A DeFi-Capable Layer 2 At its core, Bitcoin Hyper is a rollup-style Layer-2 built specifically for Bitcoin. Users send $BTC to a monitored address on the main chain; an SVM-based smart contract verifies the deposit and mints an equivalent amount of $BTC on the Hyper network. Once bridged, that wrapped $BTC moves on a high-throughput chain with near-instant finality and sub-cent fees. Instead of forcing Bitcoin itself to run complex logic, Bitcoin Hyper batches transactions off-chain and periodically commits state back to Layer 1 using zero-knowledge proofs. That keeps the heavy security properties where they belong while shifting day-to-day activity to a faster execution layer. In practice, it lets Bitcoin behave like a settlement engine while Bitcoin Hyper handles payments, trading, and app activity. The Solana Virtual Machine is a key part of that design. By leaning on SVM tooling, Bitcoin Hyper lets developers deploy DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, games, and order-book DEXs with a familiar stack. Rust devs who already know Solana don’t need to relearn everything just to build on a Bitcoin-settled rollup. That cuts friction and gives the project a realistic path to a working ecosystem instead of a ghost chain. For anyone who wants exposure tied to Bitcoin and access to DeFi yields, NFT rails, and meme coin experiments, a $BTC-anchored Layer-2 like this is a clean narrative. If that thesis plays out and Bitcoin Hyper actually ships at scale, $HYPER stops being just a meme-wrapped token and starts looking like the core asset of a new Bitcoin DeFi stack. 📚 Read more about what Bitcoin Hyper is planning in our guide. Bitcoin Hyper Breaks $28M, Whales Continue Buying Stacks On the numbers side, $HYPER has already raised over $28M, placing $HYPER firmly in the early micro-cap bracket. The current stage price is $0.013305, up roughly 15% from the initial $0.0115, with fresh funding still flowing in despite broader market volatility. Presale buyers can also stake their tokens for 41% APY now, but this will drop as more people stake tokens. On the upside math, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction outlines a 2026 high around $0.08625, assuming the roadmap is delivered and liquidity lands on major exchanges. From today’s presale price of $0.013305, that implies roughly a 6.5x to the 2026 high if everything clicks. Longer term, $HYPER could push a 2030 high near $0.253, which would be a 20x-plus move versus early presale levels. 🤑 Here’s how to buy $HYPER before it hits $30M. This is exactly type of asymmetric setup presale hunters look for. A Bitcoin-settled rollup with audited contracts, a live staking program, and more than $28M already committed has a very different risk profile from pure meme plays with no tech. Some analysts are already tagging $HYPER as a potential high-beta proxy on Bitcoin’s evolution, and in a market obsessed with the next 1000x crypto narrative, that combination of real infrastructure and early-stage pricing is why it keeps popping up on watchlists.

The surge marked an all-time high in crypto-collateralized borrowing, but the market’s leverage is now better collateralized than during the 2021-2022 cycle. The analytics firm revealed that the surge was mainly driven by on-chain lending, which now accounts for about 66.9% of all crypto-collateralized debt. On-chain borrowing has surged from 48.6% at the previous peak four years ago, driven by collateralized debt positions (CDPs), stablecoins such as DAI, and lending applications. Borrowers abandon uncollateralized lending and shift to full-collateral models Data from Galaxy Research also showed that DeFi lending alone increased by 55% to an all-time high of $41 billion. According to the analytics firm, the surge was supported by points-driven user incentives and improved collateral types such as Pendle Principal Tokens. Centralized lending also grew by 37% to $24.4 billion. However, the centralized lending market remains a third smaller than its 2022 peak. The researchers noted that borrowers from the last cycle have largely abandoned uncollateralized lending and shifted toward full-collateral models. Galaxy Research believes lenders are moving towards collateralized models as they seek institutional capital or public listings. On-chan data revealed that Tether remains the dominant CeFi lender, holding nearly 60% of tracked loans. The USDT issuer also recorded its best quarter ever in terms of absolute loan book growth, expanding its book by almost $630 million. DeFi also saw a decisive shift in the third quarter, with lending apps now capturing more than 80% of the on-chain market. CDP-backed stablecoins shrank to 16% during the same period. “This is a notable shift away from synthetic, crypto-backed stablecoins towards the lending out of centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC.” – Zack Pokorny , Research Associate at Galaxy Research. Galaxy Research noted that new chain deployments, including Aave and Fluid on Plasma, helped fuel the activity. The firm found that Plasma attracted more than $3 billion in borrowings within five weeks of launch. On-chain data also showed that a leverage-induced wipeout occurred shortly after the end of Q3, resulting in the liquidation of more than $19 billion worth of perp positions. The October 10 wipeout was the largest single-day drop in crypto futures history. Hyperliquid recorded the most liquidations, totaling $10.08 billion over the 24 hours. Bybit and Binance also reported $4.58 billion and $2.31 billion, respectively. However, Galaxy’s report still claims the liquidation event showed no signs of broader credit deterioration. The firm argued that most positions were mechanically de-risked as exchanges’ auto-deleveraging systems kicked in. Corporate DAT strategies continue to rely on leverage The report also revealed that corporate digital-asset treasury (DAT) strategies continue to rely on leverage. Galaxy Research said it’s tracking more than $12 billion in outstanding debt tied to crypto-acquiring firms. On-chain data showed that total industry debt, including DAT issuance, hit a record $86.3 billion. Galaxy’s report revealed that the debt outstanding has remained stagnant through most of the year, with just $422 million added in the previous quarter. Galaxy also noted a 41.46% QoQ surge in futures Open Interest (OI), including perpetual futures, from $132.75 billion to $187.79 billion on September 30. Futures OI reached an all-time high of $220.37 billion on October 6. The drop in perps on October 10 also saw OI plummet 30% overnight from $207.62 billion the previous day to $146.06 billion by the end of the wipeout day. Galaxy Research stated that it tracked $24.37 billion of open CeFi borrows as of September 30. The firm also noted that CeFi borrowing has surged by $6.6 billion, or 37.11%, quarter-over-quarter, and $17.19 billion (+239.4%) since the bear market of $7.18 billion in Q4 2023.

The final prediction at this point came from Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson. Appearing on CNBC's Squawk Box program, Charles Hoskinson predicted $250,000 for Bitcoin (BTC). While this prediction comes amidst ongoing uncertainty for Bitcoin, Hoskinson said Bitcoin will regain its lost bullish ground and eventually reach unprecedented prices. Hoskinson believes that the cryptocurrency market will overcome the recent negativity and experience a strong recovery. At this point, he noted, Bitcoin will recoup most of the current 26.6% pullback in the next two quarters and reach $250,000 in about 12 months, namely towards the end of 2026. This prediction from Hoskinson indicates growth of approximately 170% from the current market price, pushing Bitcoin's value to $4.98 trillion. This is not the first time Hoskinson has predicted a $250,000 price for Bitcoin. Hoskinson, who has consistently stuck to Bitcoin's $250,000 price target, said last month that the timeline for Bitcoin to reach that price target was mid-2026. Now, he's just pushing the timeline forward a bit, stating that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2026. *This is not investment advice.

This innovative project represents a significant milestone in India’s journey toward digital currency adoption, blending traditional finance with cutting-edge blockchain technology. What Makes This Rupee-Linked Digital Asset So Revolutionary? The ARC project marks a pivotal moment for digital finance in India. Developed through a strategic partnership between blockchain giant Polygon and fintech startup Anq, this rupee-linked digital asset is designed to operate within the regulatory framework established by the Reserve Bank of India. The collaboration brings together Polygon’s extensive blockchain expertise with Anq’s innovative financial technology solutions. This rupee-linked digital asset represents more than just another cryptocurrency entry. It’s a carefully crafted digital representation of the Indian rupee, intended to provide stability while leveraging blockchain’s advantages. The limited initial operation scope demonstrates the cautious yet progressive approach regulators are taking toward digital assets. How Will ARC Transform India’s Financial Ecosystem? The introduction of this rupee-linked digital asset offers numerous potential benefits for India’s economy and its citizens. Here are the key advantages: Enhanced financial inclusion for millions of unbanked Indians Reduced transaction costs for cross-border payments Improved transparency in financial transactions Faster settlement times compared to traditional banking Regulatory compliance ensuring user protection Moreover, this rupee-linked digital asset could serve as a model for other emerging economies considering similar digital currency initiatives. The RBI’s involvement ensures that ARC will maintain the stability and trust associated with traditional currency while embracing digital innovation. What Challenges Does This Rupee-Linked Digital Asset Face? Despite the excitement surrounding ARC’s launch, several challenges remain. Technical infrastructure requirements, user adoption barriers, and maintaining price stability are significant considerations. The limited initial operation suggests a phased approach to address these concerns systematically. Security measures will be paramount for this rupee-linked digital asset. Polygon’s proven blockchain technology provides a solid foundation, but continuous monitoring and updates will be essential to protect against potential threats and ensure system integrity. When Can We Expect This Rupee-Linked Digital Asset to Launch? The planned early 2024 launch timeline allows sufficient time for thorough testing and regulatory approvals. The phased implementation strategy indicates a careful, measured approach to introducing this rupee-linked digital asset to the market. This timeline also provides opportunity for public education and infrastructure preparation. Stakeholders should monitor official announcements from the Reserve Bank of India, Polygon, and Anq for specific launch dates and participation details.

The most promising altcoins to buy now, based on investors' interest, are the Solana coin, TRX crypto and Digitap ($TAP) . Boasting significant upside potential—the recent launch of ETFs adds to its appeal—SOL is arguably the best crypto to buy now among the top altcoins. Additionally, TRON is set for a new peak, surpassing previous highs. Finally, $TAP, a low-cap coin at the intersection of DeFi and TradFi, is a must-have. By blurring the line between cash and crypto and having plenty of room to run, it has been hailed as the most profitable crypto presale of 2025. Digitap: Betting on the Next Big Thing – Why Are Whales Buying? Digitap's appeal spans its significant growth prospects and unique offering as an innovative payment solution. As an emerging cryptocurrency, its upside potential is staggering, prompting experts to hail it as the most promising crypto presale of Q4. Additionally, by enabling users to spend cash like crypto through a globally accepted Visa card, it is a game-changer. Its virtual and physical cards are co-branded by Visa for global acceptance online and in-store. Furthermore, these cards are fully integrated with Google Pay and Apple Pay, allowing users to tap to pay for a seamless payment experience. Equally important, as the world’s first omni-bank, users can hold more than one asset and spend from a unified balance. Amid imminent mainstream adoption, whales have been stacking up, pushing early funding past $1.8 million in record time. A 4,000% gain is projected this year after its market debut later this year, making it arguably the best crypto presale of 2025. USE THE CODE “DIGITAP15” FOR 15% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES Solana Coin to $1,000? Probably the Best Crypto to Buy Now The Solana coin, ranking among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, trades above $150 . Set for a breakout as sentiment tilts toward bullishness in Q4, analysts have hailed it as the best crypto to buy now. CryptoCurb, a top analyst with over 50,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), predicts the Solana coin will reach $1,000 , a bare minimum in their view. At its current price, it offers a low entry, making it a compelling investment option this year. Bulls pushing the altcoin price above its January all-time high of $294 may be the start of a significant uptrend. Additionally, substantial inflows into SOL ETFs will contribute to this surge in the Solana coin price. TRX Coin to Surpass Previous Highs? A Promising Wave Not to Miss TRX crypto is another altcoin on whales’ radars. In the top ten, it is a favorite among both institutional investors and small-scale traders. A 4% gain this week pushed the Layer-1 coin above $0.29, approaching a breakout above its 30-day high of $0.32. As one of the best penny cryptos of 2025, TRX crypto has substantial growth prospects. Its low cost makes it a favorite among retailers, considering they don’t have to break the bank before positioning for significant gains. This adds to its appeal as one of the most promising altcoins to buy in November. Stiven09, via a post on X, hints that the TRX crypto may surpass $0.36 and $0.45 in the near term . A breakout above this level will push the Layer-1 coin above its 2024 all-time high of $0.44 and may soar higher, placing it on the list of high-potential altcoins to buy ahead of the explosive Q4 rally. SOL, TRX & $TAP – Must-Have Cryptos in Q4 While the Solana coin and TRX crypto may enter price discovery, Digitap has more room to run as a low-cap coin. Besides the projected 4,000% rally after its market debut, the expected 371% gain at the launch price of $0.14 (the current price is $0.0297 in the second ICO round) makes it a must-have. Additionally, its blend of DeFi and TradFi, combined with its novelty as the world’s first omni-bank, positions it as the most promising crypto presale of 2025.

Unemployment held steady at 4.3%, the highest it’s been in four years. The job gains came in slightly better than August’s pathetic 22,000, but it’s still nowhere near what the economy used to crank out. This data came straight from the Labor Department’s delayed monthly jobs report, which was pushed back after the U.S. government froze for 43 days, the longest shutdown in history, and the delay came with consequences. October’s employment data is now gone. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, couldn’t run the household survey it uses to track the unemployment rate, so October’s figures were scrapped completely. The agency said it’ll combine October and November into one big dump now scheduled for December 16. Before that blackout even hit, the BLS had already estimated the U.S. created 911,000 fewer jobs between March 2024 and March 2025 than it had originally reported. Economists expect low hiring to stick around The slowdown wasn’t a surprise to Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University. “The labor market is clearly slowing, the assumption is that the trend is going to continue,” Sung said . “We’re going to be scratching the bottom for a while, but I don’t think we are going into recession.” The September job figure was pulled from a Reuters survey of economists who expected a slight pickup from August’s low number. But even that August number, economists argued, was likely pushed down by a seasonal data issue and could be revised upward later. Still, the general view is that the labor market doesn’t need to be adding much anymore. Between 30,000 to 50,000 jobs a month is now enough to match the working-age population’s pace, a sharp drop from the 150,000 monthly average needed in 2024. That drop-off is partly blamed on immigration policy. The flow of immigrants started slowing in Joe Biden’s last year in office and got worse under Trump’s current administration. That decline in immigration has shrunk the available labor pool, squeezing the job market from the supply side. Meanwhile, unemployment stayed mostly stuck between 4.1% and 4.2% throughout the year, only ticking up slightly in August. Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander U.S. Capital Markets, tied it all to labor supply. “This strongly suggests that the sagging pace of job growth is mostly, though not entirely, reflecting the shift in labor supply and that the labor market broadly has slackened slightly but not to a substantial degree,” Stephen said. AI, tariffs, and the Fed are shaping the jobs story AI is putting fresh pressure on the labor force, especially at the entry-level. Most of the jobs being cut are the ones meant for new graduates, locking many out of their first shot at full-time work. Economists are calling it jobless growth, where the economy might be expanding, but companies aren’t hiring. Trump’s trade policies are also being blamed. Business owners, particularly small ones, say the unstable trade environment is making it harder to hire. That chaos got a spotlight this month as the Supreme Court heard arguments over Trump’s use of tariffs , with justices questioning whether the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act gave him the right to impose them. Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College, said smaller companies are taking the brunt of it. “The environment is particularly detrimental to small and medium-sized enterprises; that’s where we’ve seen most of the employment losses,” Brian said. “This is a highly polarized economy.” September’s numbers could still matter for the Federal Reserve’s December 9–10 meeting, depending on how things look closer to then. The Fed won’t even have November’s job report in time, since it got delayed to December 16. That puts pressure on September’s data to tell the story. Minutes from the Fed’s October 28–29 meeting show policymakers are getting nervous about cutting interest rates again. Many warned that doing so could ruin their fight against inflation. Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale, said, “The Fed is itchy about cutting further. If you see a really weak report, that might move the Fed, but it would take a pretty weak report.” That weak report might already be here. And if not, we’re getting closer.

With fiscal policies hanging in the balance, GBP volatility has become a major concern for traders and investors alike. This comprehensive analysis explores how UK budget uncertainty continues to exert pound pressure across global financial markets. How UK Budget Uncertainty Creates Pound Pressure The current UK budget uncertainty stems from multiple unresolved fiscal decisions that directly impact sterling’s stability. Government spending plans, tax policies, and economic stimulus measures remain unclear, creating an environment of GBP volatility that traders must navigate carefully. This pound pressure reflects market concerns about the UK’s economic direction and fiscal responsibility. Understanding GBP Volatility in Current Markets GBP volatility has intensified as traders react to each new development in the budget negotiations. The sterling decline we’re witnessing isn’t just about numbers—it’s about confidence in the UK’s economic management. Several factors contribute to this situation: Unclear taxation policies affecting business investment Uncertain government spending priorities Mixed signals about deficit reduction targets Political divisions impacting fiscal decision-making Fiscal Policy Decisions Driving Sterling Decline The current fiscal policy landscape reveals why sterling decline has become so pronounced. Without clear direction on key economic matters, markets struggle to price the pound accurately. The table below shows recent GBP performance against major currencies: Currency Pair Recent Change Primary Driver GBP/USD -2.3% Budget uncertainty GBP/EUR -1.8% Fiscal policy concerns GBP/JPY -3.1% Risk aversion Navigating Pound Pressure as a Forex Trader For forex traders, understanding pound pressure dynamics is crucial for developing effective strategies. The current UK budget uncertainty requires careful risk management and position sizing. Consider these approaches: Monitor parliamentary debates and committee meetings Watch for official statements from the Treasury Track economic indicators that might influence budget decisions Use appropriate stop-loss orders to manage GBP volatility The Ripple Effects of Sterling Decline The ongoing sterling decline affects more than just currency markets. UK businesses face higher import costs, while exporters benefit from more competitive pricing. This creates a complex economic environment where fiscal policy decisions have far-reaching consequences beyond simple exchange rate movements. FAQs About UK Budget Uncertainty and Pound Pressure How does UK budget uncertainty affect cryptocurrency markets? UK budget uncertainty can influence cryptocurrency markets through several channels. When traditional currencies like GBP experience volatility, some investors seek alternative assets, potentially increasing crypto demand. However, the relationship is complex and depends on multiple factors. Which government entities are involved in UK budget decisions? The HM Treasury leads budget preparation, while Parliament must approve fiscal measures. The Bank of England monitors how budget decisions affect monetary policy and financial stability. What historical precedents exist for pound pressure during budget uncertainty? Previous episodes of budget uncertainty, such as during coalition governments or Brexit negotiations, have similarly caused GBP volatility. Markets typically react negatively to fiscal uncertainty until clear policies emerge. How long might the current pound pressure last? The duration of pound pressure depends on how quickly the government resolves budget uncertainties. Historical patterns suggest volatility could persist for several weeks or until clear fiscal direction is established. The alarming pressure on the pound underscores how crucial budget certainty is for currency stability. As UK budget uncertainty continues, traders must remain vigilant about GBP volatility and adapt their strategies accordingly. The sterling decline we’re witnessing serves as a powerful reminder that fiscal policy decisions have immediate and significant market consequences.

While BTC traded sideways, locked in a stalemate between bulls and bears around a key range, investors actively focused on structural opportunities within the Bitcoin ecosystem, Solana DEXs, and the L1/L2 scaling sectors. HTX data from November 10 to 17 show that high-quality assets across multiple sectors performed exceptionally, highlighted by BANK’s remarkable 97% surge in a single week. Bitcoin Ecosystem: BANK Leads With a 97% Weekly Gain The Bitcoin ecosystem was clearly in the spotlight this week. Momentum in the sector continued to build in the fourth quarter, driven both by the strengthening BTC Layer 2 narrative and active support for ecosystem assets from major centralized exchanges (CEXs). BANK’s exceptional performance also reflects the market’s strong conviction in the “next major breakout within the Bitcoin sector.” ● BANK (Lorenzo Protocol) : A modular Bitcoin L2 infrastructure built on Babylon. First launched on HTX in May, BANK surged 97% this week, fueled by community enthusiasm and an upgraded ecosystem narrative, securing its position as the top gainer of the week. L1/L2 Sector: SOON and STRK Rise as Funds Return The L1 public chain and Layer 2 sectors regained investor attention this week, leading to a general uptick in trading activity. Investor sentiment shifted toward “high-growth narratives and high-elasticity assets”. Compared to volatile meme coins or one-off spike tokens, the L1/L2 sectors showed a clear move toward a more sustainable growth trajectory. ● SOON : Up 80% for the week. Progress in ecosystem rollout and performance enhancements fueled renewed short-term interest, making SOON the top L1 performer of the week. ● STRK (StarkNet) : Gained 50% this week and stands out as the most representative growth asset in the L2 sector. DEX Sector: Solana Remains in Focus, PerpDEXs Reclaim Attention DeFi capital efficiency is on the rise, turning the derivatives market into a key hub for high-frequency on-chain traders and boosting valuations of related PerpDEX projects. At the same time, the Solana ecosystem remains one of the most closely watched narratives in Q4, with strong on-chain TVL, DEX trading volume, and active user numbers sustaining robust ecosystem liquidity. ● MET (Meteora) : Up 41% this week. Meteora is a dynamic liquidity pool protocol on Solana that supports Automated Market Makers and token trading through its Dynamic Liquidity Management Mechanism (DLMM). This week’s gain reflects continued native ecosystem value discovery. ● ASTER (Aster) : Rose 20% this week, a standout performer in decentralized perpetuals (PerpDEX). The PerpDEX sector is largely driven by trading volume and market volatility. Privacy Sector: ZEC and DASH Post Solid Gains Privacy-focused assets often act as a risk-off hedge during periods of market volatility. With signs of regional regulatory stabilization, the sector is attracting renewed interest. The strong performance of ZEC and DASH underscores investor confidence in secure, forward-looking assets. ● ZEC (Zcash) : Up 12% for the week. As one of the pioneering privacy tokens, ZEC is built on zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARKs) technology and continues to provide foundational support for on-chain privacy protection. ● DASH (Dash) : Gained 10% this week. Known for its “hybrid privacy + instant payment” model, DASH holds distinct advantages in payment network restructuring and on-chain settlements.

XRP’s long market history shows what maturity looks like, while newer projects like Digitap ($TAP) illustrate what early-stage acceleration can achieve for those seeking top altcoins to buy. Digitap is an omni-bank that allows users to make instant payments, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and more, allowing full financial ownership via its zero-KYC framework. With its crypto presale still priced under $0.03, $TAP offers potential for massive returns, in contrast to XRP’s limited upside. For those comparing legacy tokens to new entrants, this is a direct look at the best crypto to buy now, in the fintech arena. Digitap ($TAP): New Omni-Bank Model With 500x Potential Digitap is an omni-bank that connects crypto wallets and fiat payments in one platform. It targets the gap between traditional banking and Web3, providing users with a single account that manages savings, yield, payments, and more. The appeal of this new approach to finance has already prompted $1.8 million of whale investment, especially since $TAP retails at just $0.0297, 80% discounted from its confirmed $0.14 listing price. The protocol further reinvests 50% of platform profits into token burns and staking rewards, creating sustainable value for long-term holders. Analysts suggest that if adoption scales as planned, a 500x return could be possible — taking $TAP toward $15 in the lng term. That projection depends on user growth and platform utility, but even a fraction of that target would make Digitap one of the best cryptos to buy now. The 500x projection from analysts is no doubt linked to $TAP’s global appeal. With light-touch compliance and zero-KYC access, anybody can download the application from iOS or Android today to send money to family, make payments at local stores, send invoices, etc. This opens the doors to the 1.4B globally unbanked, alongside first-world residents who are frustrated with the cost and intrusiveness of traditional finance. XRP’s Price History And Current Position XRP continues to serve its purpose in global payments, but most analysts agree its risk-reward balance is now modest. A further 3x or 4x might occur with broader adoption, yet the explosive gains that defined its early years are gone. XRP has grown from a launch price near $0.005 in 2013 to its current $2.45 — an impressive 490x return across a decade. Despite that, growth has slowed sharply since its last peak in 2018. Regulatory battles, changing liquidity channels, and limited retail inflow have capped price momentum. Many investors have started scanning for altcoins to buy with earlier-stage pricing and scalable ecosystems that can deliver faster growth. Long-term holders still view XRP as a reliable bridge asset for remittances, but its future gains are likely to be incremental rather than transformative. Institutional demand may stabilize price volatility, yet serious ROI now lies in emerging tokens that mirror Ripple’s early-stage potential. So while XRP might yet hit $10, an increase of nearly 4x, this is not something that will happen in the months or years to come. After experiencing explosive price rises from 2024 to 2025, it needs time to consolidate before reaching new highs. And even these highs will not compare to the price potential of better altcoins to buy in the crypto presale industry. The Gap Between Legacy And Growth XRP’s current valuation reflects maturity. It is widely used, liquid, and relatively stable — yet its upside is limited compared to earlier periods. Digitap, meanwhile, is still pre-launch and priced for growth, with the flexibility to capture market share in multiple sectors. Among active crypto presale projects, few offer the same mix of adoption, tokenomics, and revenue. This widening divide between legacy coins and adaptive banking protocols underlines a major market rotation. Institutional portfolios are diversifying into presales that mimic fintech models, where real revenue feeds token demand. That’s a dynamic that XRP can't easily replicate within its existing framework, catering mainly to large banks. Investors must consider that XRP is not particularly retail-friendly, with a primary focus on corporations and institutions. It lacks retail appeal and is therefore less marketable to certain demographics that require a functional product that seamlessly integrates fiat and crypto into one easy-to-use platform. So we could see both retail and institutional investors pivot to Digitap. Institutions for the upside potential, and retail users for its real-world utility as a live omni-bank that accepts payments at any Visa-compatible point of sale terminal. The Best Altcoin To Buy: Valuation-Based Investing Returns Investors tracking crypto to buy now trends are increasingly applying valuation analysis rather than sentiment. In that sense, Digitap’s early pricing resembles XRP’s in 2014, but with compliance, developed token mechanics, market appeal, and delivered utility. In contrast, XRP offers stability, not acceleration. The shift in capital preference shows a growing appetite for early crypto presales like Digitap, where risk is balanced by the possibility of triple-digit returns. Its 124% APY, 80% token discount, massive addressable market, and Visa-compatibility are unique USPs that could together serve to increase adoption and price. The bottom line is that XRP has already seen a 490x. Only $TAP can realistically offer similar returns to investors, with a 500x positioning it around the $15 mark. XRP might have been the best altcoin to buy around 2013, but $TAP is the best altcoin to buy now. Digitap is Live NOW.

Bitcoin Hyper introduces a modular Bitcoin Layer-2 using SVM, delivering extremely low-latency smart contract execution and Solana-style performance anchored to Bitcoin security. The most recent whale buys of a combined $134K have pushed the $HYPER presale past $28.1M, currently with a token price of $0.013305 and a staking APY of 41%. $HYPER targets a release window of Q4 2025/Q1 2026 and eyes a 1,801% return rate by 2030. Bitcoin has a new subplot. While $BTC relentlessly grinds onwards toward previous highs and ETF flows dominate headlines, the real structural shift is happening in infrastructure. Capital is rotating from meme coin-driven trades into base layers, rollups, and execution environments that can handle the next wave of users. That shift matters because Bitcoin, despite its $1.8T+ market cap, still settles around just seven transactions per second . Fees routinely spike during congestion. Native smart contracts remain limited, so most DeFi volume lives on alternative Layer-1s or Ethereum rollups – not on Bitcoin itself. Solana, on the other hand, processes thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality. Ethereum rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are capturing billions in TVL by acting as execution layers. Over the last year, several teams have tried to bridge that gap, from general-purpose sidechains to Lightning-based experiments. That is the backdrop against which Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is gaining attention. The Layer-2 project will combine Bitcoin’s settlement guarantees with a Solana-style execution layer that integrates the Solana Virtual Machine , aiming to give $BTC holders a full DeFi stack without migrating to other chains. The presale has already raised $28.1M, with tokens currently priced at $0.013305 and staking at 41% APY. And it’s going strong, targeting a Q4 2025/Q1 2026 release window. Whales have been circling the sale too. In the past 24 hours alone, two whales contributed a combined $134K to the presale tally. Meanwhile, the largest recorded whale buy so far is a hefty $502.6K , which came in less than a week ago. Discover more about this Layer-2 project in our Bitcoin Hyper review. Whales Like the Sound of Bitcoin Hyper Bringing SVM Speed To Bitcoin’s Trusted Network At the core of Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) design is a modular architecture, with Bitcoin Layer-1 used purely as a settlement layer and a real-time SVM-based Layer-2 handling execution. Transactions batch on the Layer-2 while state roots anchor back to Bitcoin at intervals, giving you Bitcoin’s finality while keeping throughput unconstrained at the execution layer. On Hyper’s Layer-2, the Solana Virtual Machine runs smart contracts written in Rust, a proven environment that already powers high-frequency trading bots, NFT marketplaces, and gaming primitives. Think ultra-fast smart contract execution and high throughput. Then there’s the canonical bridge , which will mint your $BTC onto the Hyper layer with near-instant execution. That means you’ll be able to transact in wrapped $BTC with low fees and near-instant confirmations, while relying on Bitcoin’s Layer-1 for settlement security. These tools make Bitcoin Hyper stand out – and whales are taking notice. Compared with other attempts to scale Bitcoin, such as Lightning or sidechains like Rootstock, the differentiation lies in execution speed and developer experience. Lightning excels at peer-to-peer payments, but struggles with complex applications. Rootstock brings EVM compatibility, yet has not achieved the throughput required for Solana-style trading environments. Bitcoin Hyper will handle both high-frequency DeFi and composable dApps from day one, contributing to a faster, cheaper, more scalable, and overall more performant Bitcoin ecosystem. For infrastructure-focused investors, that is why the raised amount and whale activity matter less as hype and more as a signal. $HYPER Presale Momentum Fuels Bitcoin Layer-2 Price Speculation With the Bitcoin Hyper presale already above $28.1 million at a token price of $0.013305, the obvious question is how the market could value a Bitcoin-focused SVM Layer-2 once mainnet liquidity arrives. Comparisons to existing ecosystems give a starting framework rather than a guarantee. Solana’s fully diluted valuation has topped tens of billions during peak cycles, supported by high throughput and a vibrant dApp ecosystem. Ethereum rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism each reached multibillion valuations while still in early adoption. If this SVM-based Layer-2 captures even 3% of the aggregate value currently locked across Bitcoin-adjacent scaling solutions and competing DeFi chains, a plausible scenario emerges. Under that assumption, our $HYPER price prediction suggests a potential 2026 price point of $0.08625, a 548% ROI over the course of 12 months. By 2030, we’re looking at a potential target of $0.253 or higher, 1,801% up from the current presale price. These projections assume several things: sustained $BTC strength, successful mainnet deployment, developer traction for Rust-based dApps, and a functioning decentralized canonical bridge for wrapped $BTC flows. Community hype will also help. Check out our step-by-step guide to buying $HYPER. For you as a participant, the important takeaway is not the exact target but the structural setup. The token is tied to a clear utility, staking yields are integrated into the network’s security and governance model, and the use of the SVM narrows execution risk by leveraging a battle-tested virtual machine. If Hyper manages to achieve its post-launch goals fast and the token lives up to its hype, $HYPER could become one of the best crypto presales of 2025. For traders seeking asymmetric exposure to the Bitcoin Layer-2 narrative, the combination of modular design, SVM execution, and wrapped $BTC use cases positions $HYPER among the best altcoins as well. However, if you want to support the project and diversify your portfolio, the opportunity window is closing fast. The launch of Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2 is imminent. Head to the official presale page and buy your $HYPER today. Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice. Always do your own research and invest wisely.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin may stay locked between $60K and $80K if the Fed holds rates steady in December. Falling cut expectations have already drained liquidity from risk assets, pushing Bitcoin below $90K. A record $72.2B in stablecoin reserves signals strong sidelined liquidity. The December FOMC is shaping up to be one of the most unpredictable in years. After the US government shutdown forced the Bureau of Labor Statistics to cancel the October jobs report and delay both October and November data, policymakers will head into the meeting with limited visibility. Fed Rate-Cut Odds Collapse to 40–50% as Officials Split Rate-cut expectations, once comfortably above 70%, have now fallen into the 40%–50% range, with Fed minutes revealing a sharply divided committee. A pause would signal that the Fed is wary of easing while inflation hovers near 3% and key labor indicators remain missing. Historically, tight monetary conditions drain liquidity from risk assets, a pattern already seen earlier this month when falling cut expectations triggered sharp drawdowns across equities and crypto. Bitcoin reacted immediately. As cut odds slipped, the asset fell below $90,000, erasing weeks of gains. Bitcoin Range Outlook if the Fed Does Not Cut Rates in December “If the Fed does not cut in December, Bitcoin likely trades between 60,000 and 80,000 dollars into year-end.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/u4gNtzIrhM — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 20, 2025 Analysts say the same dynamic is likely if the Fed stays cautious in December, with leveraged positions becoming more vulnerable in a low-liquidity environment. However, beneath the surface, there’s fuel for a rebound. Stablecoin reserves on exchanges have climbed to an all-time high of $72.2 billion, according to the chart shared by XWIN. Every major rally in 2025 has started with a similar build-up, sidelined liquidity waiting for a macro green light. If no rate cut materializes, XWIN expects Bitcoin to consolidate between $60,000 and $80,000 through year-end. Downward pressure comes from muted risk appetite, while upside remains capped until traders get clarity from the Fed. The key question is whether stablecoin reserves stay parked or begin rotating into Bitcoin once the December policy risk passes. Experts Reject ‘Crypto Winter’ Fears, Point to Stronger Market Foundations Despite the recent pullback, several analysts have told Cryptonews that the current downturn looks more like a macro-driven correction than the start of a prolonged freeze, pointing to institutional adoption, regulatory progress, and sector resilience as signs the foundation remains strong. Bitwise’s Danny Nelson and HashKey’s Tim Sun both argued that the market is far from a full-blown winter. They noted that, unlike previous collapses, the current cycle has not seen a catastrophic event like FTX, and that infrastructure improvements, from tokenization to stablecoin expansion, continue to strengthen the ecosystem. Other analysts highlighted that the absence of a euphoric peak and the impact of global liquidity make this downturn different from historical bear markets. As reported, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has also urged investors to look past Bitcoin’s sharp pullback, arguing that the cryptocurrency’s long-term value has little to do with its recent slide and everything to do with the service it provides.

Hill was sentenced for his role in operating a Bitcoin mixing platform that authorities say processed more than $237 million in known criminal proceeds. Hill was sentenced on November 19, just weeks after Samourai CEO Keonne Rodriguez received the maximum five-year term for the same scheme . Source: DOJ Court Records Show Samourai Wallet Team Promoted Mixing Tools to Hackers, Darknet Users According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, both men knowingly operated Samourai Wallet as a money-transmitting business designed to conceal illicit transactions. The company’s two core products, the Whirlpool mixing tool and the Ricochet transaction-hopping service, processed over 80,000 Bitcoin, valued at more than $2 billion at the time of the transactions. Prosecutors said the funds were linked to drug trafficking rings, darknet markets, cyber intrusions, fraud schemes, sanctioned jurisdictions, murder-for-hire operations, and a child pornography website. In court filings, the DOJ said Samourai’s founders not only understood how their tools were being used but also actively encouraged criminal users to adopt them. Hill promoted the mixer on the darknet forum Dread, assuring one user seeking to “clean dirty BTC” that Whirlpool was a superior tool for making funds untraceable. Rodriguez was also cited for publicly urging hackers on Twitter in July 2020 to send stolen funds into Samourai’s system. In private WhatsApp messages, he described mixing as “money laundering for Bitcoin.” Judge Denise L. Cote sentenced Rodriguez on November 6 to five years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, along with a $250,000 fine. Hill received the same fine and supervised release conditions. Both men have already forfeited more than $6.3 million in fees earned from Samourai operations, and the DOJ said the forfeiture satisfied an order seeking over $237 million in traceable criminal proceeds. DOJ Tightens Grip on Crypto Platforms Linked to Illicit Finance The sentencing caps a turbulent legal process. Earlier this year, lawyers for the founders accused prosecutors of withholding FinCEN guidance stating that Samourai, as a non-custodial wallet, did not require a money transmitter license. Prosecutors nevertheless maintained that the platform exerted “functional control” over user assets and proceeded with the case. @SamouraiWallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill are set to reverse their plea to “guilty” in a high-profile crypto privacy case, according to New York court filings. #SamouraiWallet #CryptoMixers https://t.co/8aHVgJKESf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 Rodriguez and Hill ultimately pleaded guilty in July to conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business after facing an initial set of charges that included money laundering and sanctions violations. The Samourai case lands amid a wave of high-profile prosecutions targeting crypto founders and privacy tool developers. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao received a four-month prison sentence in 2023 after pleading guilty to anti-money-laundering violations . He has, however, been granted a presidential pardon . FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence , while BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed were charged for failing to implement AML controls . Russian operator Alexander Vinnik, Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht , and the husband-and-wife duo behind the Bitfinex hack, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan , have all faced major laundering charges. More recently, Virtual Assets LLC founder Firas Isa was indicted for allegedly running a crypto ATM network that laundered at least $10 million in fraud and drug proceeds . The DOJ’s focus comes as new data highlights the speed and scale of crypto laundering. A Global Ledger report found that $3 billion in digital assets were stolen in the first half of 2025 alone, with one-quarter of cases seeing funds fully laundered before any public alert. Investigators warn that stolen assets can now move through laundering pathways in minutes , narrowing the window for recovery to near zero. Hackers are stealing more crypto and moving it faster. One laundering process took only 2 minutes 57 seconds. Can the industry cope? #CryptoSecurity #Web3 #Blockchain #DeFi https://t.co/lGwutYsT6Q — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 12, 2025 For U.S. authorities, the sentencing of Samourai’s founders is another signal that the government intends to aggressively pursue developers whose platforms become conduits for criminal finance, regardless of whether the technology is open-source or non-custodial.

54650919,631211,1763632732,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54650919.jpeg,Dogecoin’s On-Chain Turnaround Is Putting the Best Meme Coins Back on the Menu,https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-to-watch-as-dogecoin-signals-market-shift/,"Quick Facts: Dogecoin’s improving net position change and MFI profile hint at renewed meme-coin demand and potential accumulation. Further pushing this demand is the highly anticipated launch of Grayscale’s ETF that tracks Dogecoin, expected to start trading next week. Apart from $DOGE, several new meme coins are also drawing attention as the market rotates to riskier assets. Among these are Maxi Doge, which turns high-leverage trading culture into on-chain staking, leaderboards, and a well-funded treasury structure, and PEPENODE, whose mine-to-earn design uses gamified virtual nodes to distribute tokens and drive user engagement. Dogecoin’s ($DOGE) on-chain profile is quietly shifting, while most traders stare at Bitcoin’s ($BTC) range. The coin’s Money Flow Index (MFI) is currently hovering below 40 , which is a level institutions and whales typically start accumulating. While this doesn’t signal a reversal yet, it could spark one when other traders catch on and FOMO builds up. Net spot flows remain negative , but the pace of outflows is slowing, and large holders appear to be absorbing liquidity rather than dumping into strength. On the other hand, institutional interest in $DOGE remains strong. In particular, traders have their eyes on Grayscale’s Dogecoin-tracking ETF, which could start trading next week . For traders watching the rotation, this is where things get interesting. When legacy memes stabilize and whales quietly add, the next phase often belongs to higher-beta plays further out on the risk curve, such as best meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) and PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , along with the ever-faithful $DOGE. Read on to learn more about each coin below: 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Leverage Culture Wrapped in a Meme Economy Maxi Doge takes that resurgent meme demand and targets a specific behavior pattern: high-conviction, high-leverage retail trading. Instead of promising utility it can’t deliver, Maxi Doge leans into the 1000x mentality that already dominates perp exchanges. The project brands itself as a 240-pound canine powerhouse, a caricature of the trader who never skips leg day and never skips a pump. That framing matters, because it informs how the ecosystem is structured. Get a full lowdown on the project in our ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ page. From a capital formation perspective, the project has already raised over $4.1M in its ongoing presale at a token price of $0.000269. That figure is important. It signals meaningful retail participation without yet pushing valuations into late-cycle territory. Learn how you can get your share of $MAXI tokens in our Maxi Doge buying guide . Helping the project stand out is its culture turned into an on-chain structure. Holder-only trading competitions reward top ROI performers rather than simply rewarding size. Leaderboards and meme-first gym-bro marketing push users toward active trading, ‘lift, trade, repeat’ behavior, and social bragging rights. In practical terms, Maxi Doge is building a vertically integrated meme and trading community rather than a static token. You can also stake your purchased tokens if you prefer. The staking rewards are set at 74% APY at the moment, which can still change as more tokens are locked in the staking pool. Go for max gains. Join the Maxi Doge presale. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine-to-Earn Approach to Meme Distribution PEPENODE attacks the same meme liquidity window from a different angle, focusing on gamified mining economics instead of leverage culture. Billed as the world’s first ‘mine-to-earn’ meme coin, PEPENODE wraps token distribution inside a virtual mining framework. When the platform launches, you’ll be able to spin up virtual nodes, climb through tiers, and earn rewards based on participation intensity rather than simple buy-and-hold behavior. The experience feels closer to a browser game with on-chain rewards than a standard ERC-20 launch. Powering the project is its native $PEPENODE token. Right now, you can buy these tokens via the PEPENODE presale page for $0.0011546 each. Using this token, you’ll be able to upgrade your rig and enjoy governance rights. Holding it will also give you the chance to receive additional bonuses in the form of famous meme coins like Pepe and Fartcoin. Want to join the PEPENODE presale? Read our guide on how to buy $PEPENODE for more details. To date, the presale has already raised over $2.1M. It’s a clear stamp of approval among investors about the project’s promise. Staking is available at a whopping 594% APY, and if you HODL, our PEPENODE price prediction puts its potential value between $0.0021 and $0.0072 by the end of 2026. However, this will largely depend on its presale performance, the game’s successful launch, and CEX and DEX listings. Don’t be left behind. Buy $PEPENODE tokens today. 3. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – Legacy Liquidity and Payment Utility Dogecoin still sets the reference point for meme-coin liquidity and depth. Launched in 2013 as a joke, it evolved into a peer-to-peer asset used for low-fee, quick payments, tipping, and microtransactions across social platforms and merchant gateways. Transaction fees have typically been a fraction of a cent with confirmations arriving in about a minute, which keeps it usable even outside speculative cycles. Since its launch, many meme coins have tried to emulate $DOGE’s success. Currently, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has been the closest to succeeding, but with newer players like $MAXI, time will tell how long Dogecoin can remain on the throne. $DOGE’s strength is its network effect. It enjoys broad exchange support, from tier-one spot venues to major derivatives platforms, which means deep order books and efficient price discovery during volatility spikes. The coin’s influence also expanded, thanks to the likes of Elon Musk, who occasionally posts mysterious Doge-related posts on his X page. This typically leads to $DOGE pumping time and again. Large holders and institutional products, including new investment vehicles reported by mainstream financial outlets, have started to treat it as the beta play on wider retail sentiment. When net position change moves back into positive territory and MFI signals accumulation, it often precedes multi-week periods where $DOGE outperforms majors on a risk-adjusted basis. In that environment, smaller memes that echo its cultural appeal can see disproportionate inflows as traders look for higher torque. If you track market structure first, Dogecoin remains the benchmark to watch. Buy $DOGE on Binance. As Dogecoin’s net position change turns positive and MFI hints at quiet accumulation, meme risk is back on traders’ dashboards. Dogecoin anchors liquidity, Maxi Doge channels high-leverage trading culture into on-chain competitions, and PEPENODE experiments with mine-to-earn mechanics. This combination of the OG along with new meme coins can be a potent mix in anyone’s portfolio once riskier investments make a comeback.

This entire cycle, BTC has respected the 50-week moving average, but now Bitcoin has lost this level, and sentiment is the worst it has been since February. The Fear and Greed Index reads 10 (Extreme Fear ), and retail investors are getting cold feet. But even in this environment, crushing animal spirits, flows are gravitating towards strong crypto presales. Digitap ($TAP) has smashed $2 million raised, and $TAP is up more than 150% from its first round price of $0.0125. Markets are rotating into utility and searching for relative strength. Digitap’s omni-banking app, Visa card, and user adoption are providing the winning ticket. The best altcoins to buy all have cash flows and value accrual built into tokenomics. While everyone is flipping bearish, here’s why Digitap could be among the best cryptos to buy now heading into 2026. Bitcoin Bear Market Begins: What Losing the 50-week Moving Average Means The 50-week moving average has functioned as the ultimate support for this entire cycle. Losing this key level changes the entire rhythm, and it appears that the four-year cycle believers were correct. Bitcoin needs to reverse quickly; otherwise, this weekly close will likely mark the beginning of another bear market. ETH inflows have drastically reversed with institutions selling aggressively, and doubts about the AI supertrend, along with the probability for a rate cut falling below 50% add to macro pressures. If equities roll over here, BTC could easily target $84,000, and as distribution begins in earnest, that’s why smart investors are rushing into utility-led crypto presales. Digitap Raises $2 Million in Record Time Digitap inflows haven’t appeared out of thin air. The team has already shipped a working app available on iOS and Android. They have issued virtual and physical Visa cards, including non-KYC virtual issuance, with same-day support for Apple Pay and Google Pay. But what is Digitap? This omni-banking app offers a single account with multiple rails, supporting both crypto and fiat. No more silos, just a fluid experience for managing all forms of value. It taps digital-first finance (how the majority of Gen Z and Millennials manage their money) and aims to disrupt several trillion-dollar industries simultaneously, such as remittances and cross-border payments, by using a dual approach. Under the hood, Digitap operates a multi-rail architecture: established banking corridors (SWIFT, SEPA, ACH, Faster Payments) sit alongside public blockchains. An AI-powered routing brain selects the corridor that clears best in terms of speed, fees, and FX. The end result for users is an interface that feels like a modern neobank but with all the crypto firepower underneath. Why Digitap Leads the Pack of Altcoins to Buy in a Risk-Off Environment This market clearly wants prudcits with distribution, cash flows, and outsized growth potential in market-agnostic sectors like payments. Digitap blending fiat and crypto and unlocking better settlement for an industry that processes trillions of dollars in volume annually is an enormous growth surface. This is the type of real-world utility that can flourish in a risk-off environment. Digitap is also supported by the secular tailwinds of stablecoin growth and booming demand for remittances and cross-border payments, which remain in secular bull markets. The $TAP token design is also next-gen. Instead of a useless governance token, $TAP accrues real value. The total supply is fixed at 2 billion, and Digitap dedicates 50% of platform profits to purchase and burn $TAP as well as reward stakers. This means automatic buy pressure and passive income for holders. That’s why the current price of $0.0313 looks undervalued, and $TAP ranks among the best cryptos to buy now for investors bullish on cash flows and value capture. Digitap’s Crypto Presale Offers Safe Haven While BTC Bear Market Begins The market can be bearish, and the top altcoins to buy can still perform excellently. This is a classic sign of a maturing market as asset selection becomes more important. BTC breaking the 50-week moving average will force traders and investors to reassess their positioning. Digitap raising $2 million in this environment shouldn’t be ignored, and this crypto presale is showing clear relative strength. While most altcoins look ready to print fresh lows, Digitap’s omni-banking services are ready to usher in a new era of digital finance. $TAP looks like one of the best cryptos to buy now, and early presale momentum vindicates this view. With a confirmed listing price of $0.14, investors will have to move fast to lock in the current price. Digitap is Live NOW.

According to a press statement released by GoMining on Thursday, the new program will help users start mining immediately with just a fraction of the miner’s cost, while spreading the remaining payments over three months. Much similar to the buy now, pay later concept used to buy goods in traditional markets, GoMining wants to help more miners who lack the resources to solve Bitcoin’s cryptographic equations by reducing upfront costs and simplifying payment schedules. GoMining to offer mining resources after a 25% down payment The Mine Now, Pay Later model requires users to pay a 25% down payment for a digital miner, with the balance distributed over monthly installments for up to 90 days. The program is structured to be interest-free, so the total payments will never exceed the standard miner purchase price. Users can also pay off the remaining balance early if they wish, either by clearing the full sum at once or by prepaying upcoming installments. Once the first payment is made, miners begin generating Bitcoin, which GoMining insists they can “withdraw immediately.” However, some advanced features like miner upgrades are only available after the full balance is cleared, and the miner will become fully transferable and tradable following a 90-day clearance period. The payment model is embedded on Ecommpay, a global full-stack payment service provider for growing, mid-sized, and large financial firms. Miners purchased via MNPL are eligible for additional perks, including access to GoMining’s VIP program ; However, the option is not available in regions with card restrictions or compliance limitations. “Digital miners purchased through GoMining are virtual representations of physical mining equipment. Each miner corresponds to a specific unit of computing power operated within GoMining’s infrastructure across data centers in the US, Africa, and Central Asia. Ownership grants users the right to receive real Bitcoin output,” the company wrote in its statement. Mark Zalan, CEO of GoMining, said the program would lift the weight of the heavy initial cost that new and small-scale miners have been facing. “For many people interested in mining, the biggest barrier has always been the initial cost. Mine Now, Pay Later’ directly addresses that. It allows users to participate in the mining economy immediately while spreading the cost gradually and transparently,” CEO Zalan surmised. Bitcoin mining profit margin below 50%, is it still worth it? Bitcoin mining is not as profitable as it was a decade ago due to its rising network difficulty, and the energy demands of running competitive hardware that come with it. According to data from Coinwarz, the current Bitcoin difficulty is 152.27 T, with an expected adjustment to 149.04 T in late November. The level of difficulty and operational costs has made solo mining largely unprofitable for individual operators, while institutional entities count about 41% returns from their investments in mining rigs and warehouses. Last week, market analytics firm Luxor reported that Bitcoin’s hashprice has dropped to a five-year low of $38.2 per PH/s. A Hashprice is the expected daily revenue a miner can earn for each terahash per second of computing power. Bitcoin’s network hashrate is also at near record levels, averaging over 1.1 ZH/s over the past seven days. The king coin’s market slump this week has dragged it down to around $91,000, 30% lesser than its October all-time high above $126,000. A price pullback could cause a demand effect that could drive more miners to power up their rigs, which would cause the network to increase the difficulty to restore the 10-minute interval at the next adjustment. GoMining CEO Zalan agrees it is “no longer profitable to operate on your own,” but it is still lucrative when done using shared resources as the company’s new program proposes. “Our goal is to make Bitcoin mining accessible for regular people. We’re Bitcoin maxis, true believers in BTC, and we want to expand towards bringing other economic benefits on top of Bitcoin,” he said during the European Blockchain Conference held in late October.

From Tokenized Trump Hotels to SUBBD Token: Real-World Assets Meet Trump Crypto November 20, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Trump’s Maldives hotel deal with Saudi Arabia’s Dar Global is all about turning a luxury resort with roughly 80 villas into tokenized slices of ownership, so investors can get in at the development phase instead of waiting for ribbon-cutting day. At the same time, Saudi Arabia has registered over 4,000 blockchain firms in 2025 , grown that base by 51% year-on-year, and pushed $48 billion in crypto transactions across 3 million active users, while also planning a tokenized stock market. That kind of scale shows tokenization isn’t a side quest anymore; it’s becoming the default way capital moves. If you want exposure to that shift without tying everything to one region or property, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) leans into the same on-chain ownership trend for the creator economy instead. It powers a Web3 subscription and content platform, with staking, AI-driven creator tools, and audits backing the smart contracts, while its presale has already raised $1.35+ at just $0.056975 per token, leaving plenty of asymmetry if adoption ramps. Read more about SUBBD Token in our guide. AI-Fueled Nvidia Rally, Bitcoin Hyper Presale, and the Trump Crypto Rotation Trade November 20, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Nvidia just printed blockbuster Q3 numbers and helped pull $BTC back above $91,000 after a dip below $89,000, proving AI risk appetite is still very much alive even as a Bank of America survey shows 45% of fund managers see an AI bubble as the top market threat. At the same time, the global crypto market has erased over $1T in value in six weeks, roughly a 25% drawdown, reminding you that high-beta narratives cut both ways. When correlations between crypto and big tech climb, liquidity tends to favor infrastructure that can actually handle the next wave of throughput, not just fresh memes. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets that lane directly as a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, shifting $BTC from ~7 TPS to a high-throughput, seconds-level execution environment while a canonical bridge lets you deploy bridged Bitcoin into DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. With security audits completed and $28.16M+ already raised at $0.013305, you’re effectively paying a presale price to front-run a potential liquidity rotation into Bitcoin scaling if the AI–crypto risk trade stays in play. Buy $HYPER before the next price increase.

54651034,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90129,1763632840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Mutuum Finance Dominates Whale Attention as Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Momentum in November 2025,https://timestabloid.com/mutuum-finance-dominates-whale-attention-as-shiba-inu-shib-loses/,"November 2025 has brought a noticeable shift in the crypto whale market, as long-time favorites like Shiba Inu (SHIB) begin showing signs of fading momentum. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to maintain traction amid cooling hype and a broader market slowdown, whales are increasingly turning their attention to promising new crypto projects that combine early-stage opportunity with real utility. One such project capturing the spotlight is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with over 90% already sold out, MUTM is emerging as one of the top cryptocurrencies attracting serious investor interest. Its innovative DeFi protocol, growing community of over 18,000 holders, and imminent V1 testnet launch on Sepolia are positioning MUTM as a potential breakout token, drawing capital away from older, stagnating memecoins and signaling a new era of strategic whale investment. Shiba Inu Eyes Short-Term Bounce Amid Market Uncertainty Shiba Inu (SHIB) is attempting a rebound after finding support near $0.00000900, forming a tightening triangle pattern following a prolonged downtrend. Technical indicators suggest a short-term bullish bias, with a confirmed breakout above $0.00001050 potentially propelling momentum toward the $0.00001200 target line. Traders are closely watching this setup, aware that failure to hold the $0.00000900 support could trigger a retest of $0.00000850 before another rebound attempt. While SHIB navigates this delicate phase, the shifting focus of market participants towards Mutuum Finance, a new crypto with real DeFi utility, highlights the increasing attention on innovative opportunities like those emerging in the current market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Last Opportunity to Buy at $0.035 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is experiencing tremendous presale activity, emerging as one of the top cryptocurrencies with high potential gains. So far, the presale has raised over $18.8 million and attracted more than 18,080 unique holders. The presale is currently in Phase 6, the last and crucial phase, with tokens priced at $0.035. Phase 6 is now over 90% sold out, making this the final opportunity for interested investors to purchase tokens at this exclusive pricing. Once Phase 6 concludes, Phase 7 will begin as an advanced stage, with token prices set to increase. This progression gives investors a clear chance to buy now at a lower, affordable rate before the next price adjustment. This presale positioning, combined with strong community interest and increasing token value, establishes Mutuum Finance as one of the top cryptocurrencies and a must-watch new crypto for 2025. Mutuum Finance Development: Sepolia Testnet Launch The development of Mutuum Finance’s platform is progressing smoothly and on schedule, achieving critical technical milestones. The first iteration of the lending and borrowing platform is advancing well, setting the stage for the highly anticipated Sepolia testnet , expected this quarter. The Sepolia testnet will play a crucial role in validating the platform’s overall functionality. It will demonstrate essential DeFi features, including lending, borrowing, and yield farming, and provide the development team with the opportunity to fine-tune and optimize these functionalities ahead of the mainnet launch. Mutuum Finance is committed to delivering a robust, functional, and utility-focused DeFi platform. By integrating all essential features, it aims to meet the needs of a broad user base and reinforce its status as a high-potential new crypto project attracting unprecedented attention in the DeFi ecosystem. Top DeFi Crypto to Buy Before Phase 6 Sells Out Mutuum Finance has raised over $18.8 million, attracted more than 18,080 investors, and sold over 90% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. With Phase 7 set to increase the price, this represents the final opportunity to secure tokens at early-stage pricing. The platform’s imminent V1 launch on the Sepolia testnet, combined with real Ethereum-based DeFi utility, lending and borrowing functionality, and a growing community, positions MUTM as one of the top cryptocurrencies for 2025. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now should act quickly to participate before Phase 6 sells out, capturing exposure to a potential breakout DeFi token attracting whale-level attention, and establishing MUTM as the new crypto with unmatched early-stage potential.

This bold forecast, made in April, came at a time when Bitcoin was trading at $77,000 after achieving a record high of $109,000 in January. Hoskinson’s Optimistic Bitcoin Price Forecast Hoskinson’s optimism was based on his belief that international negotiations, particularly between the US and China, would favor Bitcoin’s growth. The Cardano founder suggested that easing tariffs would lead to a positive market reaction and bolster adoption, particularly with the anticipated passage of the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law by President Trump a few months later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dips Below $90,000—Yet Altcoins Remain Unscathed: Here’s Why However, the current market realities have raised doubts about Hoskinson’s prediction. Since then, Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations, briefly regaining momentum to reach $126,000 mid-October, only to see the broader crypto market subsequently shed over $1 trillion in total market cap. This downturn has largely been attributed to persistent selling pressure by concerned investors, and substantial outflows from the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector, with nearly $2 billion sold over since October. As it stands, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $89,300, marking a nearly 30% decline from its recently achieved all-time highs. In light of this, Jacob King, CEO of Swandesk, publicly dismissed Hoskinson’s $250,000 price target, characterizing it as unrealistic. Is Bitcoin In A New Bear Market Cycle? In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), King stated that such lofty price predictions are “pulled out of thin air” and reflect a market still grappling with “delusions.” King elaborated on his viewpoint, suggesting that the industry is in the early stages of a new bear market cycle. He is not alone in this assessment. Market expert Lark Davis recently noted that, based on the classic four-year Bitcoin price cycle, the cryptocurrency has officially entered bear market territory. Davis commented that this scenario leaves two possibilities: either the established four-year cycle is no longer relevant, or the market has indeed shifted into a bearish phase. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, he leans toward the latter interpretation.

An analyst known as Mr. Wall Street has recently speculated that the Bitcoin price peaked at $126,000. The analyst believes that this may mark the zenith for this cycle, predicting that the Bitcoin price could next face significant downward pressure, potentially slipping to a range between $74,000 and $82,000. He further forecasts a possible decline to levels between $54,000 and $60,000 by the fourth quarter of 2026.

The shifts signal a readiness to take profits or restructure portfolios, as BTC is once again seeking direction. BTC flows to exchanges remained elevated in November, with a total of 580,000 BTC flowing to centralized markets. Compared to last year’s period, exchange flows are smaller. However, the recent shift to spot trading and exchange deposits arrives as BTC has made several dips below $90,000. Binance still leads in deposit volumes, with 163,800 BTC moving in. Coinbase absorbed 130,000 BTC. As the recent balance on exchanges shifted, BTC traded just below $92,000. The recent dips as low as $88,000 were once again linked to liquidating long positions, rather than signs of selling pressure or capitulation. Binance switched to BTC inflows in November On Binance, BTC started flowing back to the exchange since the end of October, after a boost for spot trading. The inflows coincided with BTC price weakness, as the leading coin lost its previous positions above $110,000. Smaller markets like Bybit and OKX did not see a spike in BTC deposits. Some of the reasons may include coin movements from US-based investors, who are the most active in Q4. Additionally, the Coinbase flows are linked to institutional platforms, absorbing some of the recent ETF selling. BTC reserves on Binance started climbing since late October, signaling a switch to spot trading, along with a rise in whale activity. | Source: CryptoQuant . Binance has also originated the most significant sales during BTC downturns, often deepening the slide and causing a wave of liquidations. The exchange absorbs BTC both during bullish periods for profit-taking, and for active trading. Binance also carries a record supply of stablecoins, offering significant exit liquidity. Some of the BTC deposited may also be held as collateral to open derivative positions. BTC is moving on-chain BTC started shifting on-chain since September, increasing the Coin Days Destroyed metric . The moving supply accelerated in the past two months, coinciding with a period of more volatile trading. Some of the reasons may include ETF turnover, exchange arbitrage, or posting collaterals. The on-chain movements also coincided with the rise of perpetual futures DEXs, which also require collaterals. The increased inflow of coins does not coincide with an increase in active addresses. The deposits originate from a relatively small number of wallets. The recent activity is usually connected to whales, especially new wallets making strategic moves. BTC orders also reflected the increasing influence of whales. Since the beginning of October, BTC order sizes have increased, signaling ongoing whale activity. The shift arrived after a period of neutral or retail-based buying in October. The market switched to whale orders in November, as the price weakness led to attempts to re-buy BTC at a lower range. | Source: CryptoQuant . The recent whale activity also gives hopes of re-accumulation and restructuring, before continuing with another BTC bull cycle. So far, even at an unfavorable cost basis, most BTC owners are not capitulating from their spot positions. The 2025 market also offers additional hedging opportunities, with peak open interest and volumes for options trading, and increased derivative trading activity.

According to the analysis, XRP’s latest climb was expected near the anticipated subwave 3 low. XRP Climbs Off Critical Fib Level The asset also met its RSI support trendline, which indicated conditions for a possible short-term bounce, and that a move back to $2.26 is still possible. Despite the volatility, the analyst stated that such chop is typical of overlapping Wave 4 structures, and the focus remains on the larger trend. XRP hovers above the macro 0.5 Fibonacci support at $2.03, which is being described as one of the most significant levels in the ongoing correction. CasiTrades stated that $2.03 could serve as the final low of the entire wave 2 correction, especially if Bitcoin simultaneously reaches its own support at $88,000, thereby creating a strong confluence for a potential macro bottom and the beginning of a larger Wave 3 that could push XRP to new all-time highs. However, the analysis also outlines an alternate scenario where the altcoin breaks below $2.03 and extends its decline to the macro 0.618 level at $1.65. In that case, the analyst expects a bounce near $1.84, followed by a move back to $2.00 to retest it as resistance before a final drop toward $1.65. Under this deeper correction path, Bitcoin would likely continue downward toward its macro 0.382 retracement at $80,000. Despite these possibilities, the analyst maintains that the broader structure remains intact and that a macro Wave 3 for XRP could realistically begin within the month. XRP ETF Lineup Expands On the institutional side of things, Bitwise Asset Management has confirmed that its new spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking XRP will launch on Thursday under the ticker “XRP.” The fund is scheduled to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. This follows Canary Capital’s XRPC ETF, which launched on November 13 and attracted almost $250 million in inflows on its opening day. Despite the strong start, XRPC’s momentum slowed this week as it managed to bring its total net inflow to just over $292 million, according to SoSoValue. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s EZRP also entered the market on November 18, further adding to the growing list of XRP-focused funds. Additional products from 21Shares and CoinShares are expected to debut later this week.

This crucial development comes at a pivotal moment for traders navigating the complex interplay between traditional monetary policy and digital asset performance. Why Did the Dollar Steady After Fed Minutes? The dollar’s stabilization represents a significant shift in market sentiment following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy revelations. Market participants had been anticipating more aggressive rate cuts, but the minutes revealed a more measured approach from central bankers. This cautious stance provided the foundation for the dollar to steady against major currency pairs, creating important implications for cross-asset correlations including cryptocurrency markets. Fed Minutes Analysis: What Traders Need to Know The recently released Fed minutes highlighted several key factors influencing the dollar’s performance: Committee members expressed concerns about premature rate cuts Inflation projections remain above the 2% target Labor market strength continues to support hawkish positioning Global economic uncertainties warrant careful policy calibration USD Strength and Its Market Impact The renewed USD strength following the Fed minutes has created both challenges and opportunities across financial markets. Traditional forex pairs have shown predictable reactions, while cryptocurrency assets have demonstrated more complex correlation patterns. The table below illustrates key currency movements: Currency Pair Pre-Minutes Post-Minutes Change EUR/USD 1.0850 1.0820 -0.28% GBP/USD 1.2700 1.2675 -0.20% USD/JPY 148.50 149.20 +0.47% USD/CAD 1.3450 1.3480 +0.22% Forex Market Reactions to Monetary Policy The forex market has responded with calculated precision to the Fed’s communications. Major currency pairs have adjusted their positioning based on the revised interest rate expectations. This recalibration affects not only spot trading but also forward contracts and options pricing, creating cascading effects across global liquidity pools. Federal Reserve Policy Outlook Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve appears committed to data-dependent decision making. The minutes suggest that future policy moves will hinge on incoming economic data rather than predetermined timelines. This approach provides flexibility but also introduces uncertainty, requiring market participants to maintain vigilant monitoring of key indicators. Actionable Trading Insights Traders can leverage several strategies in the current environment: Monitor dollar index (DXY) for broader USD direction Watch for divergence between Fed rhetoric and economic data Consider correlation patterns between traditional and digital assets Implement risk management protocols for volatility spikes FAQs What do the latest Fed minutes reveal about future rate decisions? The minutes indicate the Federal Reserve maintains a cautious approach toward rate cuts, emphasizing data dependency and inflation concerns over predetermined timing. How does USD strength affect cryptocurrency markets? Historically, strong USD periods have created headwinds for cryptocurrency valuations, though correlation patterns have shown increasing complexity in recent market cycles. Which Federal Reserve officials were most influential in the latest meeting? While all members contribute to policy decisions, markets closely watch commentary from Chair Jerome Powell and regional bank presidents for policy signals. What economic indicators should traders monitor following the Fed minutes? Key indicators include CPI data, employment reports, and manufacturing surveys that influence Federal Reserve decision-making. How long might the dollar’s steady period last? Currency stability typically persists until the next significant data release or Fed communication, making ongoing monitoring essential for position management. The dollar’s stabilization following the Fed minutes represents a critical inflection point for global markets. This development underscores the enduring influence of traditional monetary policy on asset valuations across both conventional and digital ecosystems. As markets digest these implications, the measured approach from the Federal Reserve provides both stability and strategic opportunities for informed participants.
