The crypto market is showing clear signs of stress, and new data from CryptoQuant confirms that Bitcoin is now moving into one of the most severe short-term capitulation phases of this cycle. According to the latest on-chain metrics, short-term holders (STHs) are realizing losses at a scale typically seen only near major market turning points. Related Reading: XRP Supply In Profit Falls to 58.5% – Lowest Since 2024 Despite Higher Price The key indicator driving this analysis is STH-SOPR, which has plunged to deeply depressed readings around 0.97. This means STHs are selling coins at a clear loss, often driven by fear rather than strategy. Even more importantly, this metric has spent several consecutive weeks below the critical 1.0 threshold, forming what analysts refer to as a structural “capitulation band.” Historically, whenever STH-SOPR remained under 1.0 for extended periods, it signaled heavy emotional selling—typically from the most reactive and least informed market participants. These episodes have repeatedly aligned with late-stage corrections, market reversals, and shifts in long-term holder dominance. With Bitcoin now sitting at a crucial technical and psychological zone, the next phase could determine whether this becomes a deeper bear trend or a major reset before recovery. Short-Term Holders Under Extreme Stress as Capitulation Deepens According to XWIN Research on CryptoQuant, the current selloff is being amplified by the behavior of short-term holders, with the STH-MVRV ratio now sitting far below 1.0. This indicates that nearly all recent buyers are holding Bitcoin at a loss, placing short-term profitability in one of the weakest conditions in the entire dataset. Historically, these deep unrealized-loss phases are extremely rare and tend to compress selling pressure quickly, as weak hands eventually run out of coins to sell. This pattern is clearly visible in real market flows. A striking 65,200 BTC were recently sent to exchanges at a loss, showing that fear is not an abstract sentiment but is materializing in real, loss-driven capitulation. This kind of behavior aligns with classical capitulation structures: unrealized losses surge, panic selling intensifies, and eventually selling pressure becomes unsustainable. Once that happens, stronger hands begin absorbing supply quietly in the background. While this setup doesn’t guarantee an immediate rebound, the broader structure is shifting toward conditions that have historically preceded cyclical recoveries. STH losses remain at extreme levels, STH-SOPR is still below 1.0, and the pressure fueling exchange inflows is rooted in panic rather than fundamentals. Volatility is likely to persist, but the ongoing cleansing of weak hands is a process often seen near the end of major corrections — not at the start. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Dumps 2,800 BTC as Bitcoin Crashes Below $90K Testing Weekly Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market approaching a critical turning point as price trades just above $91,000 following a sharp multi-week decline. The recent breakdown from the $110,000–$105,000 range has confirmed a loss of bullish momentum, with sellers gaining control and pushing BTC toward its next major weekly support cluster near the 50-week moving average around $88,000–$90,000. This zone has historically acted as a key pivot level, often signaling whether a corrective phase deepens or stabilizes. Volume adds important context. The past several weekly candles show rising sell-side activity, reflecting panic-driven exits rather than orderly distribution. However, this surge in volume also indicates that the market may be approaching a capitulation threshold, where forced selling begins to exhaust itself — a setup often seen before stronger hands step in. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Historical Accumulation Level – Just 8% Away From LTH Cost Basis Structurally, Bitcoin is still trading above the 100-week and 200-week moving averages, both of which continue to trend upward. This suggests the aggressive downside move has not yet broken the broader macrotrend. But the loss of mid-term support levels and the sustained downward pressure highlight a market struggling to find confidence.

54630121,630711,1763593259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54630121.jpeg,Shiba Inu Receives Prestigious Honor Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum In Japan,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-prestigious-honor/,"Japan has officially elevated Shiba Inu (SHIB) into its highest-tier crypto compliance category, placing it alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. This milestone reflects a clear shift in how Japanese regulators view SHIB, recognizing it as more than a speculative token and validating its advancement into a government-approved digital asset. The designation is expected to reshape market perception, facilitate faster exchange listings, and enhance Shiba Inu’s readiness for participation at an institutional level within one of the world’s most tightly regulated financial markets . Shiba Inu’s Green-List Recognition Alongside Bitcoin And Ethereum The Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) , operating under the Financial Services Agency, has added SHIB to its Green List. This whitelist is reserved for assets demonstrating strong liquidity, broad exchange presence, and consistent operational performance. Being included on the Green List signals regulatory confidence and allows domestic exchanges to list Shiba Inu without undergoing lengthy, asset-specific vetting procedures. For ecosystem operators and liquidity providers, this reduces barriers to entry, improves the efficiency of capital allocation, and expands Shiba Inu’s reach across Japan’s compliant digital-asset infrastructure. The Green List also carries significant symbolic weight. Only a handful of digital assets—including Bitcoin and Ethereum—have historically received this designation, according to the JVCEA’s November 12, 2025, update. Being recognized alongside these benchmark cryptocurrencies positions SHIB as a more credible and professionally managed asset, helping it shed some of the skepticism associated with meme-based tokens . Japan is also reviewing its cryptocurrency taxation framework . Current policy discussions propose reducing the tax rate on approved, Green-Listed assets from the highest income brackets to roughly 20%. If implemented, this reform could materially enhance Shiba Inu’s appeal to both retail and institutional investors, creating a strong incentive for participation in a lower-tax, regulated environment. Analysts suggest that aligning regulatory recognition with favorable tax treatment could lead to a significant rise in compliant inflows once the reform is enacted, further supporting liquidity and adoption. Impact On Market Positioning And Future Capital Flows This recognition comes at a critical time for Shiba Inu, which has been upgrading its infrastructure and reorganizing its ecosystem to move beyond a meme-asset reputation . Japan’s formal approval confirms SHIB’s improved risk profile and signals to global markets that it has reached a more regulated, professionally governed stage of adoption. Licensed exchanges in Japan can now deploy new Shiba Inu markets, structured products, and liquidity channels with shorter compliance timelines. Increased accessibility encourages higher transactional activity, strengthens liquidity, and improves SHIB’s suitability for institutional participation. The Green-List status also positions SHIB for future inclusion in regulated investment vehicles , such as exchange-traded notes and custodial products, pending further approvals. By joining Bitcoin and Ethereum in Japan’s top compliance tier, Shiba Inu secures a significant step forward in global credibility, institutional acceptance, and its potential to attract future capital flows .",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 23:00:59

According to on-chain metrics, 42% of current XRP wallets accumulated their tokens near the $3 mark, leaving many with losses of 40% or more. Analysts warn that prolonged unrealized losses can trigger capitulation, adding pressure to an already fragile market outlook. While the XRP price is still nearly 4 times higher than it was in November last year, many investors appear to have entered during the post-SEC rally when sentiment was peaking. That surge, triggered by partial legal wins against the SEC, attracted a wave of buyers now sitting deep in the red. With sentiment still near historic lows, analysts warn that this group of underwater holders could start exiting if the broader market continues to slide. XRP Price Prediction: ETF Launches Could Trigger a Trend Reversal XRP is approaching a potential breakdown toward the $1.50 support zone after failing to hold above recent consolidation levels. The chart shows a descending structure forming, with any bounce likely facing resistance around $2.50 and again near the $3.60 high. If sentiment begins to turn and support holds, XRP may recover in phases — but for now, momentum remains weak. The upcoming launch of multiple XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States offers a long-term catalyst, potentially unlocking institutional demand once market conditions stabilize. In the meantime, storage and security remain key for any crypto portfolio.

However, for long-term retirement investors —particularly those using Bitcoin IRAs—price dips can offer strategic entry points rather than reasons for concern. Jonathan Rose, CEO of BlockTrust IRA, told Cryptonews that downturns often create the most compelling opportunities. He noted that the recent crypto pullback resulted in one of the busiest weeks ever for BlockTrust IRA, a U.S.-based platform that allows retail investors to hold crypto in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. “We are seeing a huge shift of investors putting crypto in BlockTrust IRAs, which indicates that Bitcoin is here to stay and that this is a great price entry opportunity,” he said. Data from Alto, a platform that allows users to add alternative assets to self-directed retirement accounts, echoes this trend. The company reported that its 29,000 self-directed IRA users executed over 240,000 crypto trades last year. Alto also stated that proprietary data from its platform reflects the growing confidence in crypto investments as part of a self-directed IRA. Crypto isn't just for traders. It's for planners. A Crypto IRA can help you secure your financial future. — BitcoinIRA (@Bitcoin_IRA) November 13, 2025 A Long-Awaited Entry Point for Retirement Investors Rose added that Bitcoin’s recent dip has opened the door for investors who previously felt like they had “missed the boat.” “For retirement investors who plan to hold Bitcoin for 10, 20, or even 30 years, dips simply represent lower entry points,” he said. This sentiment is shared across the industry. Ryan Flynn, head of Swan Advisor at Swan Bitcoin—a Bitcoin-only wealth management firm—told Cryptonews that Swan sees increased buying activity across all account types during drawdowns, including IRAs. “ Drawdowns in Bitcoin’s price are normal as Bitcoin continues its path of monetization and represents a buying opportunity for those who understand its fundamentals,” Flynn said. Jad Comair, CEO of Melanion Capital, added that Bitcoin’s pullbacks differ from traditional assets. He explained that traditional stock investments typically drop when fundamentals are deteriorating. However, Comair pointed out that Bitcoin investments work differently. “Bitcoin’s fundamentals don’t change when the price pulls back. The supply schedule remains fixed, the halving cadence continues, and global adoption keeps expanding,” he stated. Tax Benefits Strengthen the Case for Buying the Dip While lower prices alone create attractive buying conditions, Bitcoin IRAs offer additional advantages. The most obvious advantage of a Bitcoin dip is the chance to acquire more BTC for the same dollar amount. In a tax-advantaged retirement account , this effect compounds over decades. With a Traditional Bitcoin IRA, gains are tax-deferred; in a Roth Bitcoin IRA, gains can grow tax-free. Accumulating BTC at discounted prices inside these structures maximizes long-term appreciation without triggering taxable events along the way. “In Roth IRAs specifically, this allows for more of Bitcoin’s future price action to be captured as tax-free appreciation. Drawdowns allow retirement investors to max out capped annual contributions, increasing the account’s Bitcoin exposure,” Flynn explained. He added that when Bitcoin pulls back from $125k to $90k, the same $7k annual contribution purchases nearly 40% more Bitcoin. “These advantages accrue mostly to the investor who is preparing for retirement in the next 5-10 or more years,” Flynn stated. Yet, Flynn pointed out that disadvantages can particularly impact those investors who are already in retirement or are nearing that period. This is because these individuals have less time to recover to previous highs before distributions begin. “There is a behavioral risk that puts those investors who don’t understand what Bitcoin represents at a disadvantage where they may be more likely to panic sell near local bottoms,” Flynn said. Jonathan Bander, CPA at a New York-based public accounting firm ExperityCPA, further told Cryptonews that while a drop in BTC enables tax-loss harvesting to offset gains, disadvantages include no offset for personal income inside IRAs and ongoing volatility risk. Who Should Consider a Bitcoin IRA? While industry experts generally agree that Bitcoin dips can favor long-term retirement investors, suitability varies by investor. Crypto is highly volatile and may be more susceptible to manipulation than registered securities. Because of this, Comair believes younger investors may be best positioned to benefit. “They have the longest runway to let Bitcoin’s structural appreciation compound and can treat volatility the same way they would treat another major company’s historic drawdowns,” he said. Comair added that investors with stable cash flow and low liquidity pressure may also find a Bitcoin IRA appealing. “These individuals can keep contributing during corrections without being forced to sell.” Investors worried about long-term fiat debasement could also be a good fit, as Comair commented that Bitcoin’s fixed supply and institutional adoption make it a strategic hedge for retirement portfolios that are otherwise concentrated in assets tied to central bank policy. A Crypto IRA might offer tax-deferred growth and diversification. Just make sure it lines up with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline before jumping in. — Digital Wealth Partners (@DWP_advisors) November 14, 2025 However, investors who are more cautious or close to retirement and cannot tolerate large swings may want to rethink having a Bitcoin IRA. Fidelity research found that adding BTC to a portfolio would have enhanced returns during specific periods in the past, but also that even a small allocation of Bitcoin meaningfully increased portfolio volatility. Source: Fidelity Research The Future Growth of Bitcoin IRAs As the broader crypto market matures , demand for Bitcoin IRAs appears set to accelerate. Rose said BlockTrust is already seeing increased interest from international investors seeking exposure through U.S.-based Bitcoin IRAs. Comair believes this trend is only just beginning. He predicts that by 2026, Bitcoin will sit “much closer to the center of retirement strategies.” “Exchange-traded fund penetration will be broader, corporate ownership more common, and the post-halving supply regime will be tighter. For retirement investors, this period will be remembered as the phase when buying dips in a structurally appreciating asset became standard practice, not a contrarian move.” The post Why Bitcoin’s Latest Dip Has Supercharged Demand for Crypto Retirement Accounts appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Price|btc,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-19 23:18:41

Solana ETF Netflows. Source: SoSoValue . Collectively, Solana-based ETFs have already taken in over $2 billion, as issuers race to meet growing interest from allocators in assets beyond Bitcoin. Still, secondSwap CEO Kanny Lee cautions that these heavy flows could be misleading, crediting them to the novelty of the staking yields narrative when speaking with Decrypt . He argues the “real signal” will emerge early next year if the ETFs maintain sticky allocators once the initial hype wears off, a key test of true long-term holding intent. Considering that Bitcoin ETFs drove the BTC price to former all-time highs in early 2024, Solana could see a similar setup running into 2026 with growing sticky mainstream adoption. Solana Price Predictions: Can Solana Replicate Bitcoin’s 10x ETF Rally Solana could credibly mirror Bitcoin’s 2024 ETF-fuelled breakout, with its latest rebound affirming the lower support of a year-long symmetrical triangle. With momentum indicators verging on bullish, eyes are back on a breakout. The RSI has surged off the oversold threshold, while the MACD closes in on a golden cross, both signalling strengthening buy pressure beneath the surface. If momentum holds, Solana may finally challenge and overcome the key breakout zone around $205. Clearing this level opens the path toward reclaiming the $300 all-time high. With ETF inflows showing sticky, long-term accumulation, a sustained uptrend could unlock far more aggressive targets. As the bull market matures, a move toward $1,500, a 10x from current prices, becomes increasingly feasible. Still, the breakdown scenario remains in the cards if price action aligns with broader market sentiment over the ETF narrative. A rejection here could send Solana 30% lower to retest support near $95. A rejection here could send Solana 30% lower to retest support near $95.

The original cryptocurrency is down by 11% in a week and by 18% in a month, while Ethereum and Solana are down by 24% and 27% in the past month. These are discouraging percentages, yet such losses have stemmed from fears of an AI-related stock market bubble, which has caused institutions to pre-emptively pull money from crypto ETFs. However, fundamentals have not changed at all, while certain new tokens are showing the potential to rally in the coming weeks, including new ERC-20 cryptocurrency PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), which is our best new meme coin to buy today. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 19 November First announced in September, PEPENODE has since gone on to raise just over $2.15 million in its ongoing presale, which is gaining momentum with every passing week. This figure stands as a strong vote of confidence in PEPENODE from investors, who are likely excited by the project’s plan to launch crypto’s first mine-to-earn token. What this means is that PEPENODE will provide users with the opportunity to mine coins without having to invest in traditional mining equipment. Instead, they can use the PEPENODE coin itself to buy virtual mining nodes, with more nodes resulting in greater rewards. It’s as simple as that, with the platform paying out mining rewards in external coins, such as the original Pepe and Fartcoin (the project will announce more tokens at later dates). Because users will need to buy more PEPENODE in order to grow their virtual mining rigs, the token could attract substantial demand, pushing its price up rapidly. On top of this, holders will be able to stake the token, earning a passive income that currently equals an APY of 595%. This is hugely bullish, which is why PEPENODE is our best new meme coin to buy today, given its fundamentals and growing popularity. How to Join the PEPENODE Presale Before It Ends Of course, the token also makes use of tried-and-true Pepe memes, something which has also helped it grow its community at such an early stage of development. While the market may be down now, there’s every chance that a wave of altcoin ETF launches could spark a general recovery, which could coincide with PEPENODE’s launch. As such, it could rally strongly when it lists for the first time, with interested investors advised to act early, so that they can buy the token at a discount. They can do so by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. The coin is currently selling at a price of $0.0011546, although this will rise every few days until the sale ends. Once the sale ends, buyers will receive their coins, while PEPENODE will list on exchanges, potentially sending its price flying.

See What Just Happened,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-headed-to-1-50-see-what-just-happened/,"XRP continues to display signs of weakening momentum as sellers maintain pressure on the market. The asset has recorded a slight decline in the past 24 hours and is down by approximately 11% over the last week, reflecting the broader downturn across major cryptocurrencies. Despite this short-term weakness, XRP remains marginally profitable for investors who entered the market at the beginning of the year. The token has gained 2.58% on a year-to-date basis, positioning it alongside BNB and Tron as the only top-10 digital assets still showing positive returns in that period. Most other large-cap cryptocurrencies have surrendered earlier gains due to ongoing corrections. $XRP Lost the previous breakout level. Looks headed back to $1.50 area. pic.twitter.com/8VskyzrPXk — Nebraskangooner (@Nebraskangooner) November 17, 2025 Failed Breakout Raises Concern Market analyst Nebraskangooner has issued a cautious outlook for XRP, indicating that the token may be at risk of extending its downward movement. According to his assessment, XRP’s inability to confirm a breakout from a long-standing technical pattern is a key factor supporting a bearish scenario. He specifically referenced a descending triangle visible on the weekly chart, noting that XRP approached the upper boundary of the formation in late October but failed to secure upward continuation. The chart indicates that the triangle originated after XRP reached its yearly high of $3.66 in July. Subsequent trading activity kept the token within the confines of this formation until recent market conditions pushed it lower. Sellers eventually forced XRP below the triangle’s lower support zone near $2.20, marking a significant shift in structure. Based on this breakdown, Nebraskangooner projects that XRP could decline toward the $1.50 region. This level represents an estimated 30% slide from the current trading price of around $2.09 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Shift in Long-Term Holder Sentiment In addition to technical weakness, changes in investor sentiment may intensify downward pressure. Data from Glassnode suggests that long-term holders have gradually moved away from the optimism observed earlier in the year. Their sentiment has transitioned from strong confidence to a more cautious stance as XRP continues to struggle with sustained upward momentum. This analysis relies on the net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric for long-term holders, which evaluates whether these investors are predominantly sitting on gains or losses. The metric compares the market value of XRP to the realized value to determine the aggregate profitability of this group. Recent readings place long-term holders in the “anxiety” category. This state is characterized by modest unrealized gains but increasing uncertainty about future market direction. The shift toward anxiety implies that long-term participants are becoming more sensitive to price fluctuations. It also signals a greater likelihood of selling activity compared to earlier phases, when unrealized profits were larger and confidence was higher. This transition has appeared as XRP hovers near the $2 threshold, a level that carries psychological relevance for many traders. While the broader sentiment remains cautious, the coming weeks may provide clarity on whether XRP can stabilize above key support zones or whether the downward trend highlighted by analysts will persist. For now, technical indicators and sentiment signals continue to point toward the possibility of additional weakness unless buyers reclaim lost ground.

The initiative, backed by the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) and several influential crypto policy groups, argues that decentralized financial tools could save people up to $30 billion a year in fees, money that is currently lost to what researchers describe as the “poverty premium.” NEW BLOG: Why is the cost of U.S. financial services for lower-income families continuing to rise despite technological advances? DEF's @jenn_rosenthal revisits a phrase coined in the early 2000s — ""the poverty premium"" — and explores the possibility of DeFi as a solution. pic.twitter.com/tScifp647x — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) November 19, 2025 How Much Longer Can the Poor Afford an Expensive Financial System? The renewed push comes as global poverty levels remain stubbornly high. In 2025, an estimated 808 million people are living in extreme poverty on less than $3 a day, according to updated global estimates. Source: pip.worldbank.org Another 887 million are considered to be living in multidimensional poverty. Many of these households face overlapping pressures, including climate-related disasters, political instability, and rising economic fragility. The DeFi Education Fund says the financial system itself is part of the problem. In new research released this year, the group highlighted the long-standing cost gap between rich and poor households in the United States. Source: DEF Roughly 5.6 million U.S. households remain unbanked, and another 14.2% are underbanked, often forced to rely on costly financial alternatives. Cashing a paycheck can cost up to 5% of its value, and fees eat up an average of 7.1% of annual income for low-income families, compared with just 0.2% for wealthier households. These costs add up. DEF argues that removing intermediaries through decentralized financial rails could dramatically reduce basic expenses like remittances, money transfers, and bill payments. One estimate in the group’s proposal suggests DeFi infrastructure could cut global remittance costs by up to 80%, potentially saving the world’s unbanked populations $30 billion per year. Source: DEF The initiative lands at a moment when Americans appear increasingly open to alternatives. A DEF survey conducted with Ipsos found that 42% of Americans would likely try DeFi services if new legislation clarifying crypto privacy protections is passed. Many respondents expressed frustrations with banking delays, unexpected fees, and difficulty accessing their own funds. Across the sample, 56% of adults said they want full control of their money, and 54% said they want control over their financial data. As DeFi’s Real-World Role Grows, DEF Accelerates Washington Advocacy Alongside its economic arguments, the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) has expanded its policy efforts in Washington. In August, the organization launched the DeFi Education Foundation , a nonprofit designed to broaden its advocacy and deepen engagement with lawmakers. Around the same period, DEF and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a regulatory “safe harbor” for blockchain applications. The DeFi Education Fund and Andreeson Horowitz (a16z) are pushing the SEC to create a ""safe harbor"" for blockchain apps. #DeFi #a16z https://t.co/7OCIWRvUgk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 They argued that neutral software interfaces should not be classified as brokers, warning that current interpretations risk forcing developers into unintended regulatory roles and discouraging innovation. DEF also submitted a formal response to the Senate Banking Committee’s draft Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025. In that filing, DEF and several major crypto firms, including Paradigm, Jump Crypto, Multicoin Capital, the Solana Policy Institute, and the Uniswap Foundation, called for clear regulatory separation between software builders and financial intermediaries. @fund_defi has called on the US Senate Banking Committee to take a more measured approach to DeFi regulation. #Regulation #DeFi https://t.co/9pZzvG6gkV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 2, 2025 While debate over DeFi’s long-term value continues, advocates point to practical examples of how digital tools can expand access to financial services. Source: Poverty & Inequality Platform (PIP) In Nigeria and parts of East Africa, crypto-based networks allow users to transact with or without smartphones. In regions facing conflict or hyperinflation, including Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Argentina, digital currencies have been used to move money and preserve savings. Some humanitarian groups have adopted blockchain systems to distribute aid with greater transparency. Still, researchers note that DeFi faces limits. Collateral-heavy lending models, volatile token markets, smart-contract vulnerabilities, and financial literacy barriers have slowed broader adoption. Much of today’s activity remains concentrated in speculative trading rather than real-world economic use. Even in El Salvador, where Bitcoin became legal tender in 2021 , daily usage has remained below expectations. DEF maintains that policymakers should protect the aspects of DeFi that directly reduce costs for consumers. The group argues that open access, low-cost settlement, and user control remain essential to reaching people living at the financial margins.

His hearing was a major moment for the future of digital-asset regulation in the United States. Selig testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee, the agency that supervises the CFTC. Lawmakers grilled him on his previous advisory work with digital-asset firms, his views on DeFi, his regulatory philosophy, and how he plans to stabilize an agency that has been operating with only one commissioner in place for months. His nomination arrived after President Donald Trump withdrew his first selection , Brian Quintenz. The committee is slated to vote on Selig’s nomination in the near future, and the discussion is expected to start on Thursday. The result could determine who will determine the next generation of crypto oversight in the U.S. Selig began by warning lawmakers that the country is at a turning point. He said markets all over the world are shifting rapidly, and the U.S. risks falling behind if regulators rely too heavily on enforcement rather than clear regulations. He argued aggressive actions would push firms overseas and weaken American competitiveness. He described the digital-asset market as a sector that has grown from a small curiosity to a nearly $4 trillion global economy. Senators pose questions to Selig about crypto oversight Committee Chairman John Boozman pressed Selig about how he would enforce rules in the spot digital-commodity market — something Congress is mulling over further inserting under the CFTC’s mandate. The senator cited Selig’s nomination as connected to pending negotiations over a major market-structure bill that would determine how digital assets are classified and what agency oversees them. Selig was asked multiple questions about how decentralized finance works. He said that while “DeFi” is often just a vague term, regulators need to understand how on-chain applications work. He explained that identifying when intermediaries are present and whether applications pose risks similar to traditional financial services requires recognizing them. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the committee’s leading Democrat, voiced concern about the prolonged leadership vacuum within the CFTC. She observed that for months now, the agency has been with only Acting Chair Caroline Pham serving as its single commissioner, even though it typically has five. Klobuchar said this instability has sparked confusion for businesses that rely heavily on steady regulatory oversight. The confusion at the agency, she said, has produced “more chaos for people who depend on the CFTC.” If Selig is confirmed, Pham is expected to resign, leaving the CFTC’s four commissioner seats empty unless the White House fills them up quickly. That would be a way Selig can direct an agency that was left unexpectedly fragile in this context. Selig said it needed more diversity of thought on its commission. He said he would cooperate with whichever commissioners the president nominates and argued that a greater diversity of perspectives bolsters regulatory decisions. What Selig’s nomination means for crypto regulation Selig’s appointment would be a pivotal moment for the digital assets industry, which has never been in a better position. His regulatory approach represents a shift toward one that is more conducive to innovation—and one that attaches greater emphasis to creating formal rules, engaging with the industry rather than relying heavily on enforcement actions. If he assumes such leadership, it would shape how crypto trading platforms function, how decentralized finance is understood and regulated, how U.S. exchanges compete in the global marketplace, and how the CFTC shares functions with the SEC. His viewpoint sharply contrasts with years of friction between crypto companies and American regulators, in part because critics say a perception of uncertainty and unpredictable enforcement has hindered their operations. But Selig’s possible tenure would not be an effort to start without difficulty. The CFTC remains vastly understaffed, and a commission bereft of several members can encounter political resistance and legal trouble when considering such significant regulatory decisions.

The announcements, which came on the same day, show that major record labels and VCs are racing to capitalize on AI music technology after months of litigation, even as fundamental questions about copyright and fair use remain unresolved in the courts. Warner Music and Udio to launch a song creation platform Warner Music’s settlement with Udio makes it the second major label to resolve its dispute with the Massachusetts-based company in less than a month, following Universal Music Group’s October agreement. The companies plan to jointly launch a subscription service in 2026 that will use licensed music from Warner’s catalog to power AI-generated remixes, covers, and new songs featuring participating artists’ voices. “We’re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,” said Robert Kyncl , Warner Music Group’s chief executive officer. The settlement also includes provisions for artist protection, as they can choose to opt in to participate and will receive credit and compensation. Sony Music Group remains the last major label still litigating against Udio. Suno’s valuation rises Suno’s latest funding round was led by Menlo Ventures and also saw participation from other investors, including Nvidia’s NVentures, Lightspeed, Hallwood Media, and Matrix. The raise values the company at $2.45 billion. The platform, which allows users to create full songs using text prompts and has become widely popular among first-time creators and professional producers alike, is also facing copyright litigation with Warner, Universal, and Sony Music. Suno’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Mikey Shulman, said the latest capital will be used to build more sophisticated tools and expand its platform as demand for generative audio continues to accelerate. He added that millions of users have produced music through Suno over the past two years. However, unlike Udio, Suno hasn’t settled or resolved the copyright battles it has with the world’s largest record labels, which allege that the company used protected recordings to train its model and risks flooding music platforms with AI-generated tracks that could “drown out” professional artists. From courtrooms to collaboration In 2024, when the major record labels first took Udio and Suno to court, they alleged that they used protected recordings to train their AI models without permission. The labels accused the companies of copying hundreds of songs from popular musicians to create systems that would “directly compete with, cheapen, and ultimately drown out” human artists. However, both AI startups claimed that they didn’t violate any US copyright law and characterized the lawsuits as attempts to stifle competition. Industry observers had predicted that major labels would seek equity stakes and licensing arrangements rather than pursue lengthy court battles, and that forecast seems to have largely materialized. Part of Universal Music’s settlement with Udio also involves them collaborating to launch a platform for generative AI music trained on authorized and licensed music. Warner Music also announced a separate partnership with Stability AI on Wednesday, November 19, to develop professional-grade AI tools for artists and producers using ethically trained models.

This landmark case sends shockwaves through the crypto privacy sector and raises crucial questions about regulatory boundaries. What Exactly Happened with Samourai Wallet? The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York delivered the sentence after Hill pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Prosecutors presented compelling evidence that the Samourai Wallet service processed over $237 million in illicit funds. This case represents one of the most significant legal actions against cryptocurrency mixing services to date. Authorities argued that Samourai Wallet knowingly facilitated money laundering activities while operating outside regulatory frameworks. The service allowed users to obscure transaction trails, making it difficult for law enforcement to track illegal financial activities. Why Does This Samourai Wallet Case Matter? This sentencing establishes a critical precedent for how regulators approach cryptocurrency privacy tools. The Samourai Wallet case demonstrates that: Cryptocurrency services must comply with money transmission laws Privacy features cannot shield illegal activities Regulators are actively monitoring crypto mixing services The timing is particularly significant as it follows co-founder Keonne Rodriguez’s five-year sentence in August. Together, these cases show coordinated enforcement action against unregistered crypto services. How Does This Affect Crypto Privacy Tools? The Samourai Wallet verdict creates uncertainty for other privacy-focused cryptocurrency services. Many legitimate users value privacy features for personal security reasons. However, regulators clearly view mixing services as potential conduits for illegal activities. This case may prompt other privacy tool developers to reconsider their compliance strategies. Some key implications include: Increased regulatory scrutiny on all mixing services Potential licensing requirements for privacy tools Greater transparency demands from service providers What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Regulation? The Samourai Wallet sentencing signals stronger enforcement of existing financial regulations in the crypto space. Regulators are sending a clear message that anti-money laundering laws apply equally to traditional and digital financial services. This case likely represents just the beginning of increased regulatory attention on cryptocurrency privacy tools. Other mixing services may face similar legal challenges if they operate without proper licensing. Key Takeaways from the Samourai Wallet Case The four-year prison sentence for Samourai Wallet’s co-founder serves as a stark warning to the cryptocurrency industry. Compliance with financial regulations is no longer optional, even for privacy-focused services. This case establishes that: Cryptocurrency services must register as money transmitters Privacy cannot override anti-money laundering requirements Regulators are actively pursuing enforcement actions The Samourai Wallet case will undoubtedly influence how developers build and regulators view cryptocurrency privacy tools moving forward. Frequently Asked Questions What is Samourai Wallet? Samourai Wallet was a Bitcoin mixing service that allowed users to obscure their transaction history for enhanced privacy. Why was the co-founder sentenced to prison? William Lonergan Hill received a four-year prison sentence for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and facilitating money laundering. How much money was involved in the case? Prosecutors stated that Samourai Wallet was used to launder $237 million in illicit funds through its mixing services. What happened to the other co-founder? Keonne Rodriguez, the other Samourai Wallet co-founder, received a five-year prison sentence on August 7th in a related case. Are all cryptocurrency privacy tools illegal? No, but they must comply with money transmission regulations and anti-money laundering requirements to operate legally. What does this mean for other crypto mixing services? This case sets a precedent that may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential legal action against other unregistered mixing services. Found this analysis insightful?

After a series of regulatory filings and updates from major fund issuers, analysts now believe that the debut of the first Spot Dogecoin ETF is just days away. All signs now point to a launch window that could open as early as Monday, bringing the long-anticipated product to market far sooner than many expected . Grayscale Positions Its Dogecoin ETF For A Close Launch The clearest signal came after Grayscale updated its Dogecoin ETF filing, which started a 20-day countdown under the SEC’s new fast-track listing rules. These rules allow certain crypto ETFs to go live without the lengthy and restrictive approval process that previous products faced. Unless the SEC steps in with an objection, the end of this 20-day window will become the launch date of the proposed ETF. Based on the timing of Grayscale’s amendment, the first Spot Dogecoin ETF could debut as early as Monday, November 24. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, provided the clearest timeline so far. He stated: “Based on 20 20-day clock, I believe Grayscale will be out with the first Doge ETF in a week, 11/24.” His comment follows the expectation that the first Dogecoin ETF could go live before the end of November. Balchunas also shared the S-1 document image to show the structure of the filing that initiated the countdown. Solana ETF Approval Shows The New SEC Pathway Is Working The optimism surrounding Dogecoin’s ETF launch grows stronger when looking at what happened with Solana . VanEck successfully launched its Solana ETF this week with staking rewards and temporarily waived fees to attract early inflows. Fidelity also stepped into the arena with its own Solana ETF, FSOL, which recorded $2.07 million in inflows on its first trading day. That product went live under the same SEC listing framework now guiding Dogecoin’s filing. Its smooth debut confirmed that the new process is functioning as intended, with issuers able to bring crypto ETFs to market far more quickly than in earlier cycles. This sets a meaningful precedent because Dogecoin is next in line to benefit from that same pathway. Although Grayscale is expected to launch first, it may not remain the only DOGE ETF for long. Bitwise submitted an amendment to its own DOGE fund earlier in November, which activated a similar 20-day timeline. If the schedule holds, Bitwise’s Spot Dogecoin ETF could list the following week. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1586 , up by 2% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Bitwise|Bloomberg|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Eric Balchunas|FSOL|Grayscale|solana|Spot Dogecoin ETF|Spot Solana ETF|US SEC|vaneck,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 00:00:10

Portnoy, who has a large following of more than 3.7 million users on X, shared the update in a video posted on Monday night. In the same announcement, he revealed that his total spending on digital assets that evening exceeded $2 million, spread across multiple cryptocurrencies. His move quickly drew attention from public figures, including Eric Trump, who described the purchase as a smart decision. Portnoy’s Large XRP Allocation During Market Downturn In the video published on X, Portnoy outlined the sequence of trades he executed on November 17 when the market experienced notable volatility. He stated that at 6:38 PM, he added $500,000 of XRP to his portfolio, followed by a $400,000 allocation to Ethereum and a separate $750,000 order for Bitcoin one minute earlier. Records from his post also show that at 6:36 PM, he placed another order for $500,000 worth of XRP, bringing his total XRP expenditure to $1 million within a two-minute window. He indicated that the scale of the price drop across major cryptocurrencies created conditions that he viewed as favorable for large entries. Portnoy explained that he saw the sharp declines as an opportunity he did not want to overlook. His video highlighted that the purchases were made rapidly and were driven by a desire to take advantage of the broader sell-off occurring that evening. Smart trade @stoolpresidente https://t.co/uIVh0rSGh2 — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) November 19, 2025 Eric Trump Reacts to Portnoy’s Disclosure Following Portnoy’s announcement, Eric Trump responded publicly, expressing support for the decision and characterizing it as a good strategic move. Trump has made comments throughout the year regarding cryptocurrency trends and has regularly encouraged buying during market retracements. Earlier statements from him included predictions that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 by year-end and potentially rise to $1 million over a longer horizon. His endorsement of Portnoy’s investment is consistent with these previously stated views. Portnoy’s purchases came at a time when major cryptocurrencies were posting sustained weekly and monthly losses. XRP’s price has fallen to $2.07 after an 11.66% decline in the past week. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin is currently at $89,719, reflecting a 11.51% weekly decrease, and Ethereum has fallen to $2,940 after dropping 13.66% in the same period. Over the past month, the declines have been more pronounced, with Bitcoin losing 18.97%, Ethereum declining by 25.4%, and XRP dropping 15.66%. Portnoy’s Earlier Comments on XRP Portnoy has previously discussed his views on XRP in interviews. In May, he explained that his interest in the asset stems partly from what he described as strong fear-of-missing-out dynamics. He drew comparisons between XRP’s growth potential and his early experiences with Bitcoin, noting that he is especially attracted to the possibility of rapid gains. He also acknowledged that he does not base his decisions on XRP’s fundamental qualities, but rather on the asset’s perceived capacity for significant upward movement. His history with XRP includes a notable incident earlier in the year. In July, reports indicated that Portnoy sold roughly $3 million worth of XRP after misinterpreting a message from a friend as a warning of negative developments. He closed his position at $2.40, only for XRP to rise to $3.65 afterward. Portnoy later expressed regret over the decision, stating that the unexpected rally left him dissatisfied despite positive outcomes from his positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Portnoy’s latest acquisition underscores his continued interest in major cryptocurrencies despite recent market volatility. The positive reaction from Eric Trump adds a political figure’s endorsement to the discussion, further amplifying attention on the transaction.

Related Reading: Famous Trader Bets $27 Million That The XRP Price Will Crash This decline marks the fourth consecutive day of losses, erasing last week’s recovery and signaling a shift in sentiment as traders increasingly position for a deeper pullback. XMR's price records strong losses on the daily chart. Source: XMRUSD on Tradingview Monero (XMR)’s Selling Pressure Builds Further Fresh derivatives data reflect rising bearish conviction. According to CoinGlass, Monero’s futures Open Interest has fallen over the last 24 hours, while short positions now account for more than 55% of all trades. The drop in OI, now hovering around $78 million, suggests traders are withdrawing capital as fear of further downside builds. Technical indicators support this shift. The RSI has slipped below the midline, showing weakening momentum, while the MACD indicator has flashed a fresh sell signal. Together, these point toward deteriorating buying interest and a growing risk that XMR may not hold its current support levels. Support Threatened as Analysts Eye Breakdown Toward $350 Despite XMR maintaining an overall bullish structure on higher timeframes in recent months, the short-term outlook has flipped decisively bearish. The price is now testing key support zones, with the 50-day EMA at $348 emerging as the next major level to watch. A close below $358, which aligns with the neckline of a double-top pattern, would confirm a bearish breakdown, potentially accelerating losses toward the low-$300 region. Analysts warn that this scenario becomes more likely if market demand continues to weaken, particularly as retail traders rotate into alternative opportunities and risk sentiment remains fragile. Still, not all indicators point south. Analysts note that as long as XMR holds above $373, there remains potential for an intraday rebound toward the $400–$410 resistance range. But with the price already slipping below that threshold, bulls may face an uphill battle to reassert control. Privacy Narrative Remains Strong, but Momentum Falters Despite the near-term weakness, Monero continues to benefit from growing interest in privacy-preserving technologies. Recent upgrades, such as the Fluorine Fermi hard fork, have strengthened network security and improved resistance against surveillance-based threats. Long-term forecasts remain cautiously optimistic, with projections suggesting steady, though moderate, growth through 2030 and beyond.

This dramatic drop signals one of the most pessimistic market environments we’ve seen in recent months, creating both challenges and opportunities for crypto enthusiasts. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market sentiment. It calculates investor emotions using six key factors that provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. Understanding these components helps traders make more informed decisions during volatile periods. The index breaks down into these weighted components: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations Market Momentum/Volume (25%) – Tracks trading activity Social Media (15%) – Analyzes crypto mentions and sentiment Surveys (15%) – Gathers direct investor opinions Dominance (10%) – Monitors Bitcoin’s market share Trends (10%) – Follows Google search volume Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear Levels? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits such low numbers, it often signals potential turning points in the market. Extreme fear typically indicates that many investors are selling their positions, which can create buying opportunities for those with a longer-term perspective. However, it also suggests continued volatility ahead. Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries. The current reading of 11 places us firmly in the “extreme fear” category, which ranges from 0-25 on the scale. This psychological indicator helps traders understand when markets might be oversold or overbought. How Can Traders Navigate This Fearful Market? Navigating markets when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear requires careful strategy. First, consider dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk. Second, maintain a diversified portfolio across different cryptocurrency assets. Third, set clear stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage risk effectively. Remember that market sentiment often swings between extremes. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 11 represents one of these extreme points. While challenging, such environments have historically presented opportunities for patient investors. What’s Next for Crypto Markets? Looking forward, monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index will remain crucial for understanding market direction. As sentiment improves, we typically see the index climb back toward neutral territory around 50. However, sustained recovery requires positive catalysts and improved market fundamentals. The current extreme fear reading suggests markets remain fragile. Therefore, traders should watch for stabilization in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a potential sign of improving conditions. Meanwhile, maintaining risk management practices becomes essential. Key Takeaways from the Current Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 11 highlights several important market dynamics. First, investor psychology plays a massive role in cryptocurrency pricing. Second, extreme readings often signal potential reversal points. Third, understanding these sentiment indicators can help traders avoid emotional decision-making. As we monitor the evolving Crypto Fear & Greed Index, remember that markets move in cycles. The current extreme fear phase will eventually give way to more balanced sentiment, creating new opportunities for prepared investors. Frequently Asked Questions What is considered a normal reading for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A neutral reading typically falls between 40-60. Values below 25 indicate extreme fear, while readings above 75 suggest extreme greed in the market. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing regular insights into changing market sentiment and investor psychology. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market crashes? While it doesn’t predict specific crashes, sustained extreme greed readings often precede corrections, while extreme fear may indicate potential buying opportunities. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reliable for trading decisions? It works best as one tool among many. Combine it with technical analysis, fundamental research, and risk management for comprehensive trading strategies. Does the index cover all cryptocurrencies? While it focuses heavily on Bitcoin due to its market dominance, the index reflects overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. How long do extreme fear periods typically last? There’s no fixed duration. Extreme fear can persist for weeks or resolve quickly, depending on market catalysts and broader economic conditions. Found this analysis helpful?

Russia has taken a strategic and economic interest in AI, but the country’s entrance into the global AI industry will put it far behind established leaders in the industry like America and China. Putin believes AI is a matter of independence President Vladimir Putin recently announced the creation of a national task force at Russia’s flagship AI Journey conference. The purpose of the task force will be to coordinate generative AI development across the country. Putin explained that large language models (LLMs) have become vital tools for shaping public opinion, which means that dependence on foreign AI is a threat to Russia’s technological and value-based independence. He stressed the importance of Russia having its own full suite of generative AI technologies that will all be under the supervision of Russian experts. He also warned against harsh regulations, but said that for national security and intelligence, only Russian-trained models should be used so that their data remains within the country. The task force will promote the building of data centers across Russia. They will be supported by nearby energy sources like small-scale nuclear power stations. During his address, Putin also urged both state institutions and private companies to increase AI adoption. Putin projected that AI could contribute more than 11 trillion rubles (around $136 billion) to Russia’s GDP by 2030. Russia is far behind AI powerhouses like the U.S. and China in terms of technology development, but it already has some homegrown large-language models, including Gigachat, which was developed by Sberbank and Yandex GPT. At the same conference, Sberbank demonstrated upgraded versions of its model, as well as AI-driven products ranging from humanoid robots to health-scanning ATMs. One of the biggest obstacles for Russia’s AI ambition is the Western sanctions on microchips, as it limits Russia’s capacity to scale up its computing infrastructure. Putin’s selective cooperation The Russian President has said repeatedly that he regards foreign AI dominance as a threat to Russian culture and security. As far back as 2023, he warned that Western-trained AI systems could reflect Western values, ignoring or even “canceling” Russian traditions, history, and public policy. However, in late 2024, he announced an “AI Alliance Network” with BRICS members (Brazil, China, India, South Africa) and other nations to develop AI and build alternative regulation and market channels together. In early 2025, he ordered Sberbank and the government to deepen AI cooperation with China. According to recent research , Russia’s lower chamber of parliament, the State Duma, has been working on AI regulation since 2023, and there is reportedly a working group ordered to produce AI laws by 2026.

However, the Bitcoin derivatives market revealed an astonishing story of resilience that defied expectations. This remarkable stability in the face of price pressure offers crucial insights for cryptocurrency investors. What Makes the Bitcoin Derivatives Market So Resilient? The Bitcoin derivatives market has demonstrated exceptional steadiness despite recent price movements. According to Cointelegraph analysis, key metrics continue to show market confidence rather than panic. This stability suggests institutional maturity and growing sophistication among market participants. On November 19th, the monthly BTC futures premium maintained around 4% above spot prices. While slightly below the neutral 5% threshold, this figure indicates controlled optimism rather than excessive fear. The market shows measured responses instead of emotional reactions. How Do Perpetual Futures Signal Market Health? The perpetual futures funding rate for Bitcoin has consistently hovered around 4% annualized. This alignment with the two-week average reveals several important factors: Consistent trader behavior despite price fluctuations Balanced long and short positions Absence of extreme leverage situations Healthy market maker activity These conditions create a stable foundation for the Bitcoin derivatives market to operate efficiently. The funding rate stability prevents sudden liquidations that could trigger cascading effects. Why Does Options Data Matter for Bitcoin Investors? The BTC options delta skew maintained a stable 11% throughout the past week. This crucial metric provides deep insights into trader sentiment and risk assessment. A stable skew indicates that professional traders haven’t significantly altered their risk perceptions. This consistency in the Bitcoin derivatives market options space suggests that experienced participants view recent price movements as normal market behavior rather than fundamental shifts. The data reveals calculated positioning rather than emotional trading. What Does This Stability Mean for Future Bitcoin Price Action? The current Bitcoin derivatives market conditions create a favorable environment for sustainable growth. The absence of extreme fear or greed indicators suggests that any price movements will likely be more gradual and less volatile. This stability provides several advantages: Reduced risk of flash crashes More predictable trading conditions Improved institutional participation Healthier long-term development The Bitcoin derivatives market functioning as a stabilizing force represents significant progress in cryptocurrency market maturation. This development benefits all market participants through reduced volatility and improved liquidity. Key Takeaways from Current Bitcoin Derivatives Market Analysis The remarkable stability in the Bitcoin derivatives market during recent price tests demonstrates growing market sophistication. Traders appear to be learning from past volatility episodes and adjusting their strategies accordingly. This evolution in market behavior suggests we’re witnessing the maturation of cryptocurrency trading. Furthermore, the consistent metrics across futures, perpetuals, and options indicate coordinated market understanding. Participants across different Bitcoin derivatives market segments share similar risk assessments and trading approaches. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Bitcoin derivatives market? The Bitcoin derivatives market includes financial contracts like futures and options that derive their value from Bitcoin’s price. These instruments allow traders to hedge risk or speculate on price movements. Why is derivatives market stability important? Stability in the Bitcoin derivatives market reduces overall volatility, prevents cascading liquidations, and encourages institutional participation. It signals market maturity and sophisticated risk management. How does the futures premium indicate market sentiment? The futures premium shows whether traders are willing to pay more for future Bitcoin delivery. A stable premium around 4-5% suggests balanced optimism without excessive speculation. What does options delta skew measure? Options delta skew measures the difference in implied volatility between put and call options. A stable skew indicates consistent risk assessment among options traders. Can derivatives market stability predict future prices? While not a perfect predictor, derivatives market stability suggests reduced likelihood of extreme volatility. Stable conditions often precede more sustainable price movements. How do perpetual funding rates affect traders? Stable funding rates prevent sudden position liquidations and reduce trading costs. They indicate balanced market conditions between long and short positions. Found this analysis of Bitcoin derivatives market stability helpful?

The move represents one of Washington’s largest tech decisions in the Middle East, enabling both Gulf countries to possess hardware capable of training and running state-of-the-art AI models. U.S. officials say that these approvals entail strict security rules. The conditions are intended to prevent the chips from being sent to China or any other foreign adversary. The approvals also reflect a close partnership between Washington and the two oil-rich countries, which are both committed to becoming global leaders in AI. U.S. tightens control as sales approved The Commerce Department confirmed that G42 (UAE) and Humain (Saudi Arabia) will receive computer-equipped AI chips, comprising Nvidia’s GB300 processors . These are some of the most advanced chips Nvidia has ever produced. Approvals were granted only after both companies committed to “rigorous security and reporting requirements,” the U.S. added. Officials did not provide specifics but said their focus was heavily on preventing technology transfer to high-risk countries, particularly China. That followed months of talks between Washington and the Gulf governments. The talks were part of broader bilateral arrangements that focus on economic cooperation, cybersecurity safeguards, and new commitments to better governance with technology. G42 had already taken measures to appease American concerns. Last year, the Emirati firm committed to ceasing the use of Huawei equipment and unwinding its ties with Chinese companies. That decision paved the way for a $1.5 billion investment from Microsoft, which led to President Brad Smith joining G42’s board of directors. Saudi Arabia’s Humain has publicly stated that it will not buy Huawei gear, following U.S. expectations for secure AI development. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are both racing to build world-class AI industries. These are the new Nvidia approvals that will provide them with the raw computing power necessary to train next-generation AI models, operate large data centers, and entice global tech partners. G42 is growing at a rapid pace across various sectors — from outer space technology to national genomics projects. The company is constructing massive data centers and cloud infrastructure to fund AI labs and government projects all over the Emirates. Humain, in Saudi Arabia, is working towards its own national strategy. It plans to create giant “AI factories” to house hundreds of thousands of GPUs. The facilities are designed to provide power for projects in healthcare, higher education institutions, freight delivery services, transportation authorities, and government agencies. The Nvidia AI chips approvals come as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman strengthens ties with the Trump White House. The UAE, meanwhile, committed earlier this year to spend $1.4 trillion on the American side, further cementing its strategic alliance with Washington. U.S. balances innovation and national security Inside Washington, the decision has inspired debate. Many officials in the Trump administration view the sale as a response to China’s growing presence in the Middle East. U.S. companies, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle, can anchor the region’s AI buildout. It keeps Gulf nations inside America’s technological infrastructure. Nevertheless, some national security officials remain skeptical, as they worry that even with heavy monitoring, powerful AI chips can still be misused. They also worry that Beijing might someday gain access to data centers or research facilities located in the Gulf through commercial, scholarly, or hidden connections. Nonetheless, the American administration believes that strict operational conditions will ensure that the technology remains secure. Washington’s shift also indicates, in effect, that AI hardware is becoming increasingly part of Washington’s diplomatic toolkit. Gulf nations seek to develop AI capacity, while the United States aims to exert influence, maintain oversight, and foster economic cooperation. Nvidia, meanwhile, retains access to two of the world’s fastest-growing markets for high-performance computing. G42 and Humain approvals may be only the start. The two countries are expected to demand even more chips as they seek to emerge as global leaders in artificial intelligence, data infrastructure, and advanced technology manufacturing.

The latest data reveals a significant shift that every crypto investor needs to understand. The Altcoin Season Index has dropped five crucial points to just 26, signaling a potential change in market dynamics that could impact your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market indicator for cryptocurrency investors. This important metric defines an “altcoin season” as a period where 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 26 suggests we’re firmly in Bitcoin season territory. Why Should You Care About This Altcoin Season Index Drop? The five-point decline in the Altcoin Season Index matters because it reflects changing investor sentiment and capital flows. When the index moves lower, it indicates: Bitcoin is outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies Investor confidence may be shifting toward established assets Market risk appetite could be decreasing Capital rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin is occurring How Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Work? Understanding the mechanics behind the Altcoin Season Index helps you make better investment decisions. The index excludes stablecoins and wrapped coins from its calculation, focusing purely on performance comparisons. A score closer to 100 indicates strong altcoin season conditions, while lower scores like the current 26 point toward Bitcoin dominance. What Investment Strategies Make Sense Now? With the Altcoin Season Index sitting at 26, investors should consider several approaches. First, recognize that Bitcoin seasons often precede altcoin rallies. Historical patterns show that after extended Bitcoin dominance, capital typically flows back into altcoins. However, timing these transitions requires careful market observation and risk management. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify strategically rather than abandoning altcoins completely Monitor the Altcoin Season Index weekly for trend changes Focus on fundamentals rather than short-term price movements Set clear entry and exit points for your altcoin positions When Might We See the Next Altcoin Season? Predicting the exact timing of market shifts remains challenging, but the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable clues. The current reading suggests we’re not in altcoin season territory yet. However, market conditions can change rapidly based on several factors including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic trends. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Market Landscape The Altcoin Season Index drop to 26 presents both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. While Bitcoin appears to be dominating currently, this often sets the stage for future altcoin rallies. By understanding what the Altcoin Season Index measures and how to interpret its movements, you can make more informed decisions about your cryptocurrency portfolio allocation and timing. Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 26 mean? An Altcoin Season Index of 26 indicates that Bitcoin is significantly outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies. The index measures how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are beating Bitcoin’s performance over 90 days. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The Altcoin Season Index typically updates regularly as market data becomes available, providing ongoing insights into market dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. While a low Altcoin Season Index suggests Bitcoin dominance, it often precedes altcoin rallies. Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance rather than making reactionary decisions. What’s the difference between Bitcoin season and altcoin season? Bitcoin season occurs when Bitcoin outperforms most altcoins, while altcoin season happens when 75% of top cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict market crashes? The index measures relative performance between assets rather than predicting absolute price movements or market crashes. It’s best used as one of several market analysis tools. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for trading decisions? While valuable for understanding market trends, the index should complement rather than replace comprehensive research and risk management in trading decisions. Found this analysis helpful?

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted a Glassnode chart showing that Dogecoin’s net supply on centralized exchanges has just turned positive, noting on X: “Dogecoin supply on exchanges just turned positive! This shift has marked sharp rebounds before.” Dogecoin Rebound Loading? The chart in his post, “DOGE: Exchange Net Position Change – All Exchanges,” tracks monthly exchange inflows and outflows as a histogram, alongside DOGE’s price in US dollars. Green bars indicate net inflows (more DOGE moving to exchanges than leaving), while red bars show net outflows. From mid-2024 through late 2024, the series alternates between modest red and green periods before a sustained cluster of strong green bars emerges around the fourth quarter of 2024. During that phase, net inflows rise to several billion DOGE per month. At the same time, the price line accelerated from below $0.10 to a local peak to $0.48, illustrating how heavy exchange-side activity accompanied the rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakdown Or Bottom? On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone After that peak, the structure changes. Through early and mid-2025, the histogram becomes more mixed, with smaller positive and negative reads as price oscillates broadly between roughly $0.12 and $0.30. Heading into late 2025, however, the chart shows a pronounced sequence of red bars, with net outflows extending down toward roughly −5 to −6 billion DOGE while the price trends lower from the mid-$0.20s toward the low-$0.20s and below. The final data point, emphasized by a circular highlight on the right edge of the chart, marks a clear break in that pattern: a tall green bar crosses back above the zero line, indicating that net flows have turned positive again. At that moment, the price line sits slightly above the $0.15 mark on the vertical scale. Martinez interprets this as a “major rebound signal,” pointing to previous instances where a similar transition from persistent outflows to strong inflows coincided with sharp directional moves. DOGE On Thin Ice Below $0.16 A second chart he shared, an ATH-partitioned UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), sets out where the current DOGE supply last moved on-chain. A single, dominant bar appears around $0.07392452 and accounts for 28,260,298,271.803 DOGE, or 18.62% of the measured supply. Martinez summarizes this by stating that 27.4 billion DOGE have accumulated at roughly $0.08, calling it the “most significant support level.” Between that $0.07–$0.08 block and approximately $0.16, the URPD shows a shaded “GAP” with only small intermediate bars around levels such as $0.096, $0.125 and $0.155. Above the gap, a smaller but still notable cluster appears at about $0.162633395, containing 4,399,496,300.739 DOGE (2.9% of supply). “Below $0.16, support for Dogecoin $DOGE disappears quickly,” Martinez warns, adding that the “next real demand zone sits at $0.07.” Related Reading: One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst A third chart, a cost-basis distribution heatmap, tracks DOGE’s price against horizontal bands representing where holders’ cost bases are concentrated. It confirms two core cohorts: a lower band between $0.0812497 and $0.08279775 with 27,397,971,652.123432 DOGE, and an upper band from $0.20103297 to $0.20486326 containing 12,156,333,652.493444 DOGE. Together with the newly positive exchange flows, these data points define a market caught between a dense realized floor around $0.08 and a substantial holder cluster near $0.20, with the latest flow reversal now in focus for traders tracking DOGE’s next move. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.158.

54631970,630587,1763600432,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54631970.jpeg,First Bitcoin-Backed Municipal Bond Launches In New Hampshire,https://bitcoinist.com/first-bitcoin-backed-municipal-bond-new-hampshire/,"New Hampshire has authorized the first US municipal security explicitly backed by Bitcoin, approving a $100 million “conduit” bond that uses over-collateralized BTC rather than tax revenues or project cash flows as its primary backstop. The decision by the state’s Business Finance Authority (BFA) positions New Hampshire as an early test bed for integrating digital assets into the roughly $140 trillion global bond market. New Hampshire Continues To Lead US States Into Bitcoin Adoption Governor Kelly Ayotte framed the move as a way to attract capital while insulating residents from balance-sheet risk, saying she is “proud that New Hampshire is once again first in the nation to embrace new technologies with this historic Bitcoin-backed bond,” and calling it “an innovative way to bring more investment opportunities to our state and position us as a leader in digital finance without risking state funds or taxpayer dollars.” The bond follows a standard conduit structure: the BFA authorizes the issuance, but the credit risk rests with the private borrower, not the state’s general fund. What is novel is the collateral package. The borrower must post about 160 percent of the bond’s notional value in Bitcoin, held by digital asset custodian BitGo . If BTC’s price falls and the collateralization ratio approaches roughly 130 percent, automatic liquidation of part of the Bitcoin stack is triggered to protect bondholders and preserve principal. The BFA oversees the framework but does not guarantee repayment. SCOOP: New Hampshire Launches First Bitcoin-Backed Municipal Bond The Granite State just became the first to approve a muni bond backed by $BTC , a milestone that could pave the way for digital assets to enter the $140 trillion global debt market. https://t.co/18XTtMK9Tw — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 19, 2025 The structure was designed by Wave Digital Assets and municipal specialist Rosemawr Management, with BitGo as custodian and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe as legal counsel. Wave co-founder Les Borsai described the transaction as “the opening of a new debt market,” arguing that it shows how “public and private sectors can collaborate to responsibly unlock the value of digital assets.” Orrick partner Orion Mountainspring called it “the first municipal security backed by cryptocurrency” and a potential “game-changer for digital currency and municipal finance.” Fees and any Bitcoin appreciation associated with the transaction will flow into a dedicated Bitcoin Economic Development Fund, intended to support innovation and business growth in the state, rather than the general budget. The bond also dovetails with New Hampshire’s recently authorized Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which allows the state treasury to allocate up to 5 percent of funds into highly capitalized digital assets, in practice making Bitcoin the only viable candidate under today’s market conditions. Republican representative Keith Ammon, the driving force behind much of the state’s Bitcoin legislation, has presented the framework as a controlled way to test BTC as high-grade collateral for public finance without exposing taxpayers to direct losses. Because the bond is not a general-obligation security and relies on over-collateralization plus pre-defined liquidation thresholds, officials argue that Bitcoin’s volatility is ring-fenced within the structure. Whether the model scales beyond this initial authorization will depend on investor demand, pricing and ratings treatment once an actual borrower brings a deal to market. For now, New Hampshire has moved the concept of Bitcoin-backed public debt from theory into the machinery of US municipal finance, creating a live template other states and issuers can study or choose to emulate.
