The crypto market is showing clear signs of stress, and new data from CryptoQuant confirms that Bitcoin is now moving into one of the most severe short-term capitulation phases of this cycle. According to the latest on-chain metrics, short-term holders (STHs) are realizing losses at a scale typically seen only near major market turning points. Related Reading: XRP Supply In Profit Falls to 58.5% – Lowest Since 2024 Despite Higher Price The key indicator driving this analysis is STH-SOPR, which has plunged to deeply depressed readings around 0.97. This means STHs are selling coins at a clear loss, often driven by fear rather than strategy. Even more importantly, this metric has spent several consecutive weeks below the critical 1.0 threshold, forming what analysts refer to as a structural “capitulation band.” Historically, whenever STH-SOPR remained under 1.0 for extended periods, it signaled heavy emotional selling—typically from the most reactive and least informed market participants. These episodes have repeatedly aligned with late-stage corrections, market reversals, and shifts in long-term holder dominance. With Bitcoin now sitting at a crucial technical and psychological zone, the next phase could determine whether this becomes a deeper bear trend or a major reset before recovery. Short-Term Holders Under Extreme Stress as Capitulation Deepens According to XWIN Research on CryptoQuant, the current selloff is being amplified by the behavior of short-term holders, with the STH-MVRV ratio now sitting far below 1.0. This indicates that nearly all recent buyers are holding Bitcoin at a loss, placing short-term profitability in one of the weakest conditions in the entire dataset. Historically, these deep unrealized-loss phases are extremely rare and tend to compress selling pressure quickly, as weak hands eventually run out of coins to sell. This pattern is clearly visible in real market flows. A striking 65,200 BTC were recently sent to exchanges at a loss, showing that fear is not an abstract sentiment but is materializing in real, loss-driven capitulation. This kind of behavior aligns with classical capitulation structures: unrealized losses surge, panic selling intensifies, and eventually selling pressure becomes unsustainable. Once that happens, stronger hands begin absorbing supply quietly in the background. While this setup doesn’t guarantee an immediate rebound, the broader structure is shifting toward conditions that have historically preceded cyclical recoveries. STH losses remain at extreme levels, STH-SOPR is still below 1.0, and the pressure fueling exchange inflows is rooted in panic rather than fundamentals. Volatility is likely to persist, but the ongoing cleansing of weak hands is a process often seen near the end of major corrections — not at the start. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Dumps 2,800 BTC as Bitcoin Crashes Below $90K Testing Weekly Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market approaching a critical turning point as price trades just above $91,000 following a sharp multi-week decline. The recent breakdown from the $110,000–$105,000 range has confirmed a loss of bullish momentum, with sellers gaining control and pushing BTC toward its next major weekly support cluster near the 50-week moving average around $88,000–$90,000. This zone has historically acted as a key pivot level, often signaling whether a corrective phase deepens or stabilizes. Volume adds important context. The past several weekly candles show rising sell-side activity, reflecting panic-driven exits rather than orderly distribution. However, this surge in volume also indicates that the market may be approaching a capitulation threshold, where forced selling begins to exhaust itself — a setup often seen before stronger hands step in. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Historical Accumulation Level – Just 8% Away From LTH Cost Basis Structurally, Bitcoin is still trading above the 100-week and 200-week moving averages, both of which continue to trend upward. This suggests the aggressive downside move has not yet broken the broader macrotrend. But the loss of mid-term support levels and the sustained downward pressure highlight a market struggling to find confidence.

54630121,630711,1763593259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54630121.jpeg,Shiba Inu Receives Prestigious Honor Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum In Japan,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-prestigious-honor/,"Japan has officially elevated Shiba Inu (SHIB) into its highest-tier crypto compliance category, placing it alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. This milestone reflects a clear shift in how Japanese regulators view SHIB, recognizing it as more than a speculative token and validating its advancement into a government-approved digital asset. The designation is expected to reshape market perception, facilitate faster exchange listings, and enhance Shiba Inu’s readiness for participation at an institutional level within one of the world’s most tightly regulated financial markets . Shiba Inu’s Green-List Recognition Alongside Bitcoin And Ethereum The Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) , operating under the Financial Services Agency, has added SHIB to its Green List. This whitelist is reserved for assets demonstrating strong liquidity, broad exchange presence, and consistent operational performance. Being included on the Green List signals regulatory confidence and allows domestic exchanges to list Shiba Inu without undergoing lengthy, asset-specific vetting procedures. For ecosystem operators and liquidity providers, this reduces barriers to entry, improves the efficiency of capital allocation, and expands Shiba Inu’s reach across Japan’s compliant digital-asset infrastructure. The Green List also carries significant symbolic weight. Only a handful of digital assets—including Bitcoin and Ethereum—have historically received this designation, according to the JVCEA’s November 12, 2025, update. Being recognized alongside these benchmark cryptocurrencies positions SHIB as a more credible and professionally managed asset, helping it shed some of the skepticism associated with meme-based tokens . Japan is also reviewing its cryptocurrency taxation framework . Current policy discussions propose reducing the tax rate on approved, Green-Listed assets from the highest income brackets to roughly 20%. If implemented, this reform could materially enhance Shiba Inu’s appeal to both retail and institutional investors, creating a strong incentive for participation in a lower-tax, regulated environment. Analysts suggest that aligning regulatory recognition with favorable tax treatment could lead to a significant rise in compliant inflows once the reform is enacted, further supporting liquidity and adoption. Impact On Market Positioning And Future Capital Flows This recognition comes at a critical time for Shiba Inu, which has been upgrading its infrastructure and reorganizing its ecosystem to move beyond a meme-asset reputation . Japan’s formal approval confirms SHIB’s improved risk profile and signals to global markets that it has reached a more regulated, professionally governed stage of adoption. Licensed exchanges in Japan can now deploy new Shiba Inu markets, structured products, and liquidity channels with shorter compliance timelines. Increased accessibility encourages higher transactional activity, strengthens liquidity, and improves SHIB’s suitability for institutional participation. The Green-List status also positions SHIB for future inclusion in regulated investment vehicles , such as exchange-traded notes and custodial products, pending further approvals. By joining Bitcoin and Ethereum in Japan’s top compliance tier, Shiba Inu secures a significant step forward in global credibility, institutional acceptance, and its potential to attract future capital flows .",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 23:00:59

According to on-chain metrics, 42% of current XRP wallets accumulated their tokens near the $3 mark, leaving many with losses of 40% or more. Analysts warn that prolonged unrealized losses can trigger capitulation, adding pressure to an already fragile market outlook. While the XRP price is still nearly 4 times higher than it was in November last year, many investors appear to have entered during the post-SEC rally when sentiment was peaking. That surge, triggered by partial legal wins against the SEC, attracted a wave of buyers now sitting deep in the red. With sentiment still near historic lows, analysts warn that this group of underwater holders could start exiting if the broader market continues to slide. XRP Price Prediction: ETF Launches Could Trigger a Trend Reversal XRP is approaching a potential breakdown toward the $1.50 support zone after failing to hold above recent consolidation levels. The chart shows a descending structure forming, with any bounce likely facing resistance around $2.50 and again near the $3.60 high. If sentiment begins to turn and support holds, XRP may recover in phases — but for now, momentum remains weak. The upcoming launch of multiple XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States offers a long-term catalyst, potentially unlocking institutional demand once market conditions stabilize. In the meantime, storage and security remain key for any crypto portfolio.

However, for long-term retirement investors —particularly those using Bitcoin IRAs—price dips can offer strategic entry points rather than reasons for concern. Jonathan Rose, CEO of BlockTrust IRA, told Cryptonews that downturns often create the most compelling opportunities. He noted that the recent crypto pullback resulted in one of the busiest weeks ever for BlockTrust IRA, a U.S.-based platform that allows retail investors to hold crypto in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. “We are seeing a huge shift of investors putting crypto in BlockTrust IRAs, which indicates that Bitcoin is here to stay and that this is a great price entry opportunity,” he said. Data from Alto, a platform that allows users to add alternative assets to self-directed retirement accounts, echoes this trend. The company reported that its 29,000 self-directed IRA users executed over 240,000 crypto trades last year. Alto also stated that proprietary data from its platform reflects the growing confidence in crypto investments as part of a self-directed IRA. Crypto isn't just for traders. It's for planners. A Crypto IRA can help you secure your financial future. — BitcoinIRA (@Bitcoin_IRA) November 13, 2025 A Long-Awaited Entry Point for Retirement Investors Rose added that Bitcoin’s recent dip has opened the door for investors who previously felt like they had “missed the boat.” “For retirement investors who plan to hold Bitcoin for 10, 20, or even 30 years, dips simply represent lower entry points,” he said. This sentiment is shared across the industry. Ryan Flynn, head of Swan Advisor at Swan Bitcoin—a Bitcoin-only wealth management firm—told Cryptonews that Swan sees increased buying activity across all account types during drawdowns, including IRAs. “ Drawdowns in Bitcoin’s price are normal as Bitcoin continues its path of monetization and represents a buying opportunity for those who understand its fundamentals,” Flynn said. Jad Comair, CEO of Melanion Capital, added that Bitcoin’s pullbacks differ from traditional assets. He explained that traditional stock investments typically drop when fundamentals are deteriorating. However, Comair pointed out that Bitcoin investments work differently. “Bitcoin’s fundamentals don’t change when the price pulls back. The supply schedule remains fixed, the halving cadence continues, and global adoption keeps expanding,” he stated. Tax Benefits Strengthen the Case for Buying the Dip While lower prices alone create attractive buying conditions, Bitcoin IRAs offer additional advantages. The most obvious advantage of a Bitcoin dip is the chance to acquire more BTC for the same dollar amount. In a tax-advantaged retirement account , this effect compounds over decades. With a Traditional Bitcoin IRA, gains are tax-deferred; in a Roth Bitcoin IRA, gains can grow tax-free. Accumulating BTC at discounted prices inside these structures maximizes long-term appreciation without triggering taxable events along the way. “In Roth IRAs specifically, this allows for more of Bitcoin’s future price action to be captured as tax-free appreciation. Drawdowns allow retirement investors to max out capped annual contributions, increasing the account’s Bitcoin exposure,” Flynn explained. He added that when Bitcoin pulls back from $125k to $90k, the same $7k annual contribution purchases nearly 40% more Bitcoin. “These advantages accrue mostly to the investor who is preparing for retirement in the next 5-10 or more years,” Flynn stated. Yet, Flynn pointed out that disadvantages can particularly impact those investors who are already in retirement or are nearing that period. This is because these individuals have less time to recover to previous highs before distributions begin. “There is a behavioral risk that puts those investors who don’t understand what Bitcoin represents at a disadvantage where they may be more likely to panic sell near local bottoms,” Flynn said. Jonathan Bander, CPA at a New York-based public accounting firm ExperityCPA, further told Cryptonews that while a drop in BTC enables tax-loss harvesting to offset gains, disadvantages include no offset for personal income inside IRAs and ongoing volatility risk. Who Should Consider a Bitcoin IRA? While industry experts generally agree that Bitcoin dips can favor long-term retirement investors, suitability varies by investor. Crypto is highly volatile and may be more susceptible to manipulation than registered securities. Because of this, Comair believes younger investors may be best positioned to benefit. “They have the longest runway to let Bitcoin’s structural appreciation compound and can treat volatility the same way they would treat another major company’s historic drawdowns,” he said. Comair added that investors with stable cash flow and low liquidity pressure may also find a Bitcoin IRA appealing. “These individuals can keep contributing during corrections without being forced to sell.” Investors worried about long-term fiat debasement could also be a good fit, as Comair commented that Bitcoin’s fixed supply and institutional adoption make it a strategic hedge for retirement portfolios that are otherwise concentrated in assets tied to central bank policy. A Crypto IRA might offer tax-deferred growth and diversification. Just make sure it lines up with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline before jumping in. — Digital Wealth Partners (@DWP_advisors) November 14, 2025 However, investors who are more cautious or close to retirement and cannot tolerate large swings may want to rethink having a Bitcoin IRA. Fidelity research found that adding BTC to a portfolio would have enhanced returns during specific periods in the past, but also that even a small allocation of Bitcoin meaningfully increased portfolio volatility. Source: Fidelity Research The Future Growth of Bitcoin IRAs As the broader crypto market matures , demand for Bitcoin IRAs appears set to accelerate. Rose said BlockTrust is already seeing increased interest from international investors seeking exposure through U.S.-based Bitcoin IRAs. Comair believes this trend is only just beginning. He predicts that by 2026, Bitcoin will sit “much closer to the center of retirement strategies.” “Exchange-traded fund penetration will be broader, corporate ownership more common, and the post-halving supply regime will be tighter. For retirement investors, this period will be remembered as the phase when buying dips in a structurally appreciating asset became standard practice, not a contrarian move.” The post Why Bitcoin’s Latest Dip Has Supercharged Demand for Crypto Retirement Accounts appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Price|btc,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-19 23:18:41

Solana ETF Netflows. Source: SoSoValue . Collectively, Solana-based ETFs have already taken in over $2 billion, as issuers race to meet growing interest from allocators in assets beyond Bitcoin. Still, secondSwap CEO Kanny Lee cautions that these heavy flows could be misleading, crediting them to the novelty of the staking yields narrative when speaking with Decrypt . He argues the “real signal” will emerge early next year if the ETFs maintain sticky allocators once the initial hype wears off, a key test of true long-term holding intent. Considering that Bitcoin ETFs drove the BTC price to former all-time highs in early 2024, Solana could see a similar setup running into 2026 with growing sticky mainstream adoption. Solana Price Predictions: Can Solana Replicate Bitcoin’s 10x ETF Rally Solana could credibly mirror Bitcoin’s 2024 ETF-fuelled breakout, with its latest rebound affirming the lower support of a year-long symmetrical triangle. With momentum indicators verging on bullish, eyes are back on a breakout. The RSI has surged off the oversold threshold, while the MACD closes in on a golden cross, both signalling strengthening buy pressure beneath the surface. If momentum holds, Solana may finally challenge and overcome the key breakout zone around $205. Clearing this level opens the path toward reclaiming the $300 all-time high. With ETF inflows showing sticky, long-term accumulation, a sustained uptrend could unlock far more aggressive targets. As the bull market matures, a move toward $1,500, a 10x from current prices, becomes increasingly feasible. Still, the breakdown scenario remains in the cards if price action aligns with broader market sentiment over the ETF narrative. A rejection here could send Solana 30% lower to retest support near $95. A rejection here could send Solana 30% lower to retest support near $95.

The original cryptocurrency is down by 11% in a week and by 18% in a month, while Ethereum and Solana are down by 24% and 27% in the past month. These are discouraging percentages, yet such losses have stemmed from fears of an AI-related stock market bubble, which has caused institutions to pre-emptively pull money from crypto ETFs. However, fundamentals have not changed at all, while certain new tokens are showing the potential to rally in the coming weeks, including new ERC-20 cryptocurrency PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), which is our best new meme coin to buy today. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 19 November First announced in September, PEPENODE has since gone on to raise just over $2.15 million in its ongoing presale, which is gaining momentum with every passing week. This figure stands as a strong vote of confidence in PEPENODE from investors, who are likely excited by the project’s plan to launch crypto’s first mine-to-earn token. What this means is that PEPENODE will provide users with the opportunity to mine coins without having to invest in traditional mining equipment. Instead, they can use the PEPENODE coin itself to buy virtual mining nodes, with more nodes resulting in greater rewards. It’s as simple as that, with the platform paying out mining rewards in external coins, such as the original Pepe and Fartcoin (the project will announce more tokens at later dates). Because users will need to buy more PEPENODE in order to grow their virtual mining rigs, the token could attract substantial demand, pushing its price up rapidly. On top of this, holders will be able to stake the token, earning a passive income that currently equals an APY of 595%. This is hugely bullish, which is why PEPENODE is our best new meme coin to buy today, given its fundamentals and growing popularity. How to Join the PEPENODE Presale Before It Ends Of course, the token also makes use of tried-and-true Pepe memes, something which has also helped it grow its community at such an early stage of development. While the market may be down now, there’s every chance that a wave of altcoin ETF launches could spark a general recovery, which could coincide with PEPENODE’s launch. As such, it could rally strongly when it lists for the first time, with interested investors advised to act early, so that they can buy the token at a discount. They can do so by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. The coin is currently selling at a price of $0.0011546, although this will rise every few days until the sale ends. Once the sale ends, buyers will receive their coins, while PEPENODE will list on exchanges, potentially sending its price flying.

See What Just Happened,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-headed-to-1-50-see-what-just-happened/,"XRP continues to display signs of weakening momentum as sellers maintain pressure on the market. The asset has recorded a slight decline in the past 24 hours and is down by approximately 11% over the last week, reflecting the broader downturn across major cryptocurrencies. Despite this short-term weakness, XRP remains marginally profitable for investors who entered the market at the beginning of the year. The token has gained 2.58% on a year-to-date basis, positioning it alongside BNB and Tron as the only top-10 digital assets still showing positive returns in that period. Most other large-cap cryptocurrencies have surrendered earlier gains due to ongoing corrections. $XRP Lost the previous breakout level. Looks headed back to $1.50 area. pic.twitter.com/8VskyzrPXk — Nebraskangooner (@Nebraskangooner) November 17, 2025 Failed Breakout Raises Concern Market analyst Nebraskangooner has issued a cautious outlook for XRP, indicating that the token may be at risk of extending its downward movement. According to his assessment, XRP’s inability to confirm a breakout from a long-standing technical pattern is a key factor supporting a bearish scenario. He specifically referenced a descending triangle visible on the weekly chart, noting that XRP approached the upper boundary of the formation in late October but failed to secure upward continuation. The chart indicates that the triangle originated after XRP reached its yearly high of $3.66 in July. Subsequent trading activity kept the token within the confines of this formation until recent market conditions pushed it lower. Sellers eventually forced XRP below the triangle’s lower support zone near $2.20, marking a significant shift in structure. Based on this breakdown, Nebraskangooner projects that XRP could decline toward the $1.50 region. This level represents an estimated 30% slide from the current trading price of around $2.09 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Shift in Long-Term Holder Sentiment In addition to technical weakness, changes in investor sentiment may intensify downward pressure. Data from Glassnode suggests that long-term holders have gradually moved away from the optimism observed earlier in the year. Their sentiment has transitioned from strong confidence to a more cautious stance as XRP continues to struggle with sustained upward momentum. This analysis relies on the net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric for long-term holders, which evaluates whether these investors are predominantly sitting on gains or losses. The metric compares the market value of XRP to the realized value to determine the aggregate profitability of this group. Recent readings place long-term holders in the “anxiety” category. This state is characterized by modest unrealized gains but increasing uncertainty about future market direction. The shift toward anxiety implies that long-term participants are becoming more sensitive to price fluctuations. It also signals a greater likelihood of selling activity compared to earlier phases, when unrealized profits were larger and confidence was higher. This transition has appeared as XRP hovers near the $2 threshold, a level that carries psychological relevance for many traders. While the broader sentiment remains cautious, the coming weeks may provide clarity on whether XRP can stabilize above key support zones or whether the downward trend highlighted by analysts will persist. For now, technical indicators and sentiment signals continue to point toward the possibility of additional weakness unless buyers reclaim lost ground.

The initiative, backed by the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) and several influential crypto policy groups, argues that decentralized financial tools could save people up to $30 billion a year in fees, money that is currently lost to what researchers describe as the “poverty premium.” NEW BLOG: Why is the cost of U.S. financial services for lower-income families continuing to rise despite technological advances? DEF's @jenn_rosenthal revisits a phrase coined in the early 2000s — ""the poverty premium"" — and explores the possibility of DeFi as a solution. pic.twitter.com/tScifp647x — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) November 19, 2025 How Much Longer Can the Poor Afford an Expensive Financial System? The renewed push comes as global poverty levels remain stubbornly high. In 2025, an estimated 808 million people are living in extreme poverty on less than $3 a day, according to updated global estimates. Source: pip.worldbank.org Another 887 million are considered to be living in multidimensional poverty. Many of these households face overlapping pressures, including climate-related disasters, political instability, and rising economic fragility. The DeFi Education Fund says the financial system itself is part of the problem. In new research released this year, the group highlighted the long-standing cost gap between rich and poor households in the United States. Source: DEF Roughly 5.6 million U.S. households remain unbanked, and another 14.2% are underbanked, often forced to rely on costly financial alternatives. Cashing a paycheck can cost up to 5% of its value, and fees eat up an average of 7.1% of annual income for low-income families, compared with just 0.2% for wealthier households. These costs add up. DEF argues that removing intermediaries through decentralized financial rails could dramatically reduce basic expenses like remittances, money transfers, and bill payments. One estimate in the group’s proposal suggests DeFi infrastructure could cut global remittance costs by up to 80%, potentially saving the world’s unbanked populations $30 billion per year. Source: DEF The initiative lands at a moment when Americans appear increasingly open to alternatives. A DEF survey conducted with Ipsos found that 42% of Americans would likely try DeFi services if new legislation clarifying crypto privacy protections is passed. Many respondents expressed frustrations with banking delays, unexpected fees, and difficulty accessing their own funds. Across the sample, 56% of adults said they want full control of their money, and 54% said they want control over their financial data. As DeFi’s Real-World Role Grows, DEF Accelerates Washington Advocacy Alongside its economic arguments, the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) has expanded its policy efforts in Washington. In August, the organization launched the DeFi Education Foundation , a nonprofit designed to broaden its advocacy and deepen engagement with lawmakers. Around the same period, DEF and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a regulatory “safe harbor” for blockchain applications. The DeFi Education Fund and Andreeson Horowitz (a16z) are pushing the SEC to create a ""safe harbor"" for blockchain apps. #DeFi #a16z https://t.co/7OCIWRvUgk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 They argued that neutral software interfaces should not be classified as brokers, warning that current interpretations risk forcing developers into unintended regulatory roles and discouraging innovation. DEF also submitted a formal response to the Senate Banking Committee’s draft Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025. In that filing, DEF and several major crypto firms, including Paradigm, Jump Crypto, Multicoin Capital, the Solana Policy Institute, and the Uniswap Foundation, called for clear regulatory separation between software builders and financial intermediaries. @fund_defi has called on the US Senate Banking Committee to take a more measured approach to DeFi regulation. #Regulation #DeFi https://t.co/9pZzvG6gkV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 2, 2025 While debate over DeFi’s long-term value continues, advocates point to practical examples of how digital tools can expand access to financial services. Source: Poverty & Inequality Platform (PIP) In Nigeria and parts of East Africa, crypto-based networks allow users to transact with or without smartphones. In regions facing conflict or hyperinflation, including Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Argentina, digital currencies have been used to move money and preserve savings. Some humanitarian groups have adopted blockchain systems to distribute aid with greater transparency. Still, researchers note that DeFi faces limits. Collateral-heavy lending models, volatile token markets, smart-contract vulnerabilities, and financial literacy barriers have slowed broader adoption. Much of today’s activity remains concentrated in speculative trading rather than real-world economic use. Even in El Salvador, where Bitcoin became legal tender in 2021 , daily usage has remained below expectations. DEF maintains that policymakers should protect the aspects of DeFi that directly reduce costs for consumers. The group argues that open access, low-cost settlement, and user control remain essential to reaching people living at the financial margins.

His hearing was a major moment for the future of digital-asset regulation in the United States. Selig testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee, the agency that supervises the CFTC. Lawmakers grilled him on his previous advisory work with digital-asset firms, his views on DeFi, his regulatory philosophy, and how he plans to stabilize an agency that has been operating with only one commissioner in place for months. His nomination arrived after President Donald Trump withdrew his first selection , Brian Quintenz. The committee is slated to vote on Selig’s nomination in the near future, and the discussion is expected to start on Thursday. The result could determine who will determine the next generation of crypto oversight in the U.S. Selig began by warning lawmakers that the country is at a turning point. He said markets all over the world are shifting rapidly, and the U.S. risks falling behind if regulators rely too heavily on enforcement rather than clear regulations. He argued aggressive actions would push firms overseas and weaken American competitiveness. He described the digital-asset market as a sector that has grown from a small curiosity to a nearly $4 trillion global economy. Senators pose questions to Selig about crypto oversight Committee Chairman John Boozman pressed Selig about how he would enforce rules in the spot digital-commodity market — something Congress is mulling over further inserting under the CFTC’s mandate. The senator cited Selig’s nomination as connected to pending negotiations over a major market-structure bill that would determine how digital assets are classified and what agency oversees them. Selig was asked multiple questions about how decentralized finance works. He said that while “DeFi” is often just a vague term, regulators need to understand how on-chain applications work. He explained that identifying when intermediaries are present and whether applications pose risks similar to traditional financial services requires recognizing them. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the committee’s leading Democrat, voiced concern about the prolonged leadership vacuum within the CFTC. She observed that for months now, the agency has been with only Acting Chair Caroline Pham serving as its single commissioner, even though it typically has five. Klobuchar said this instability has sparked confusion for businesses that rely heavily on steady regulatory oversight. The confusion at the agency, she said, has produced “more chaos for people who depend on the CFTC.” If Selig is confirmed, Pham is expected to resign, leaving the CFTC’s four commissioner seats empty unless the White House fills them up quickly. That would be a way Selig can direct an agency that was left unexpectedly fragile in this context. Selig said it needed more diversity of thought on its commission. He said he would cooperate with whichever commissioners the president nominates and argued that a greater diversity of perspectives bolsters regulatory decisions. What Selig’s nomination means for crypto regulation Selig’s appointment would be a pivotal moment for the digital assets industry, which has never been in a better position. His regulatory approach represents a shift toward one that is more conducive to innovation—and one that attaches greater emphasis to creating formal rules, engaging with the industry rather than relying heavily on enforcement actions. If he assumes such leadership, it would shape how crypto trading platforms function, how decentralized finance is understood and regulated, how U.S. exchanges compete in the global marketplace, and how the CFTC shares functions with the SEC. His viewpoint sharply contrasts with years of friction between crypto companies and American regulators, in part because critics say a perception of uncertainty and unpredictable enforcement has hindered their operations. But Selig’s possible tenure would not be an effort to start without difficulty. The CFTC remains vastly understaffed, and a commission bereft of several members can encounter political resistance and legal trouble when considering such significant regulatory decisions.

The announcements, which came on the same day, show that major record labels and VCs are racing to capitalize on AI music technology after months of litigation, even as fundamental questions about copyright and fair use remain unresolved in the courts. Warner Music and Udio to launch a song creation platform Warner Music’s settlement with Udio makes it the second major label to resolve its dispute with the Massachusetts-based company in less than a month, following Universal Music Group’s October agreement. The companies plan to jointly launch a subscription service in 2026 that will use licensed music from Warner’s catalog to power AI-generated remixes, covers, and new songs featuring participating artists’ voices. “We’re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,” said Robert Kyncl , Warner Music Group’s chief executive officer. The settlement also includes provisions for artist protection, as they can choose to opt in to participate and will receive credit and compensation. Sony Music Group remains the last major label still litigating against Udio. Suno’s valuation rises Suno’s latest funding round was led by Menlo Ventures and also saw participation from other investors, including Nvidia’s NVentures, Lightspeed, Hallwood Media, and Matrix. The raise values the company at $2.45 billion. The platform, which allows users to create full songs using text prompts and has become widely popular among first-time creators and professional producers alike, is also facing copyright litigation with Warner, Universal, and Sony Music. Suno’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Mikey Shulman, said the latest capital will be used to build more sophisticated tools and expand its platform as demand for generative audio continues to accelerate. He added that millions of users have produced music through Suno over the past two years. However, unlike Udio, Suno hasn’t settled or resolved the copyright battles it has with the world’s largest record labels, which allege that the company used protected recordings to train its model and risks flooding music platforms with AI-generated tracks that could “drown out” professional artists. From courtrooms to collaboration In 2024, when the major record labels first took Udio and Suno to court, they alleged that they used protected recordings to train their AI models without permission. The labels accused the companies of copying hundreds of songs from popular musicians to create systems that would “directly compete with, cheapen, and ultimately drown out” human artists. However, both AI startups claimed that they didn’t violate any US copyright law and characterized the lawsuits as attempts to stifle competition. Industry observers had predicted that major labels would seek equity stakes and licensing arrangements rather than pursue lengthy court battles, and that forecast seems to have largely materialized. Part of Universal Music’s settlement with Udio also involves them collaborating to launch a platform for generative AI music trained on authorized and licensed music. Warner Music also announced a separate partnership with Stability AI on Wednesday, November 19, to develop professional-grade AI tools for artists and producers using ethically trained models.

This landmark case sends shockwaves through the crypto privacy sector and raises crucial questions about regulatory boundaries. What Exactly Happened with Samourai Wallet? The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York delivered the sentence after Hill pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Prosecutors presented compelling evidence that the Samourai Wallet service processed over $237 million in illicit funds. This case represents one of the most significant legal actions against cryptocurrency mixing services to date. Authorities argued that Samourai Wallet knowingly facilitated money laundering activities while operating outside regulatory frameworks. The service allowed users to obscure transaction trails, making it difficult for law enforcement to track illegal financial activities. Why Does This Samourai Wallet Case Matter? This sentencing establishes a critical precedent for how regulators approach cryptocurrency privacy tools. The Samourai Wallet case demonstrates that: Cryptocurrency services must comply with money transmission laws Privacy features cannot shield illegal activities Regulators are actively monitoring crypto mixing services The timing is particularly significant as it follows co-founder Keonne Rodriguez’s five-year sentence in August. Together, these cases show coordinated enforcement action against unregistered crypto services. How Does This Affect Crypto Privacy Tools? The Samourai Wallet verdict creates uncertainty for other privacy-focused cryptocurrency services. Many legitimate users value privacy features for personal security reasons. However, regulators clearly view mixing services as potential conduits for illegal activities. This case may prompt other privacy tool developers to reconsider their compliance strategies. Some key implications include: Increased regulatory scrutiny on all mixing services Potential licensing requirements for privacy tools Greater transparency demands from service providers What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Regulation? The Samourai Wallet sentencing signals stronger enforcement of existing financial regulations in the crypto space. Regulators are sending a clear message that anti-money laundering laws apply equally to traditional and digital financial services. This case likely represents just the beginning of increased regulatory attention on cryptocurrency privacy tools. Other mixing services may face similar legal challenges if they operate without proper licensing. Key Takeaways from the Samourai Wallet Case The four-year prison sentence for Samourai Wallet’s co-founder serves as a stark warning to the cryptocurrency industry. Compliance with financial regulations is no longer optional, even for privacy-focused services. This case establishes that: Cryptocurrency services must register as money transmitters Privacy cannot override anti-money laundering requirements Regulators are actively pursuing enforcement actions The Samourai Wallet case will undoubtedly influence how developers build and regulators view cryptocurrency privacy tools moving forward. Frequently Asked Questions What is Samourai Wallet? Samourai Wallet was a Bitcoin mixing service that allowed users to obscure their transaction history for enhanced privacy. Why was the co-founder sentenced to prison? William Lonergan Hill received a four-year prison sentence for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and facilitating money laundering. How much money was involved in the case? Prosecutors stated that Samourai Wallet was used to launder $237 million in illicit funds through its mixing services. What happened to the other co-founder? Keonne Rodriguez, the other Samourai Wallet co-founder, received a five-year prison sentence on August 7th in a related case. Are all cryptocurrency privacy tools illegal? No, but they must comply with money transmission regulations and anti-money laundering requirements to operate legally. What does this mean for other crypto mixing services? This case sets a precedent that may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential legal action against other unregistered mixing services. Found this analysis insightful?

After a series of regulatory filings and updates from major fund issuers, analysts now believe that the debut of the first Spot Dogecoin ETF is just days away. All signs now point to a launch window that could open as early as Monday, bringing the long-anticipated product to market far sooner than many expected . Grayscale Positions Its Dogecoin ETF For A Close Launch The clearest signal came after Grayscale updated its Dogecoin ETF filing, which started a 20-day countdown under the SEC’s new fast-track listing rules. These rules allow certain crypto ETFs to go live without the lengthy and restrictive approval process that previous products faced. Unless the SEC steps in with an objection, the end of this 20-day window will become the launch date of the proposed ETF. Based on the timing of Grayscale’s amendment, the first Spot Dogecoin ETF could debut as early as Monday, November 24. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, provided the clearest timeline so far. He stated: “Based on 20 20-day clock, I believe Grayscale will be out with the first Doge ETF in a week, 11/24.” His comment follows the expectation that the first Dogecoin ETF could go live before the end of November. Balchunas also shared the S-1 document image to show the structure of the filing that initiated the countdown. Solana ETF Approval Shows The New SEC Pathway Is Working The optimism surrounding Dogecoin’s ETF launch grows stronger when looking at what happened with Solana . VanEck successfully launched its Solana ETF this week with staking rewards and temporarily waived fees to attract early inflows. Fidelity also stepped into the arena with its own Solana ETF, FSOL, which recorded $2.07 million in inflows on its first trading day. That product went live under the same SEC listing framework now guiding Dogecoin’s filing. Its smooth debut confirmed that the new process is functioning as intended, with issuers able to bring crypto ETFs to market far more quickly than in earlier cycles. This sets a meaningful precedent because Dogecoin is next in line to benefit from that same pathway. Although Grayscale is expected to launch first, it may not remain the only DOGE ETF for long. Bitwise submitted an amendment to its own DOGE fund earlier in November, which activated a similar 20-day timeline. If the schedule holds, Bitwise’s Spot Dogecoin ETF could list the following week. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1586 , up by 2% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Bitwise|Bloomberg|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Eric Balchunas|FSOL|Grayscale|solana|Spot Dogecoin ETF|Spot Solana ETF|US SEC|vaneck,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 00:00:10

Portnoy, who has a large following of more than 3.7 million users on X, shared the update in a video posted on Monday night. In the same announcement, he revealed that his total spending on digital assets that evening exceeded $2 million, spread across multiple cryptocurrencies. His move quickly drew attention from public figures, including Eric Trump, who described the purchase as a smart decision. Portnoy’s Large XRP Allocation During Market Downturn In the video published on X, Portnoy outlined the sequence of trades he executed on November 17 when the market experienced notable volatility. He stated that at 6:38 PM, he added $500,000 of XRP to his portfolio, followed by a $400,000 allocation to Ethereum and a separate $750,000 order for Bitcoin one minute earlier. Records from his post also show that at 6:36 PM, he placed another order for $500,000 worth of XRP, bringing his total XRP expenditure to $1 million within a two-minute window. He indicated that the scale of the price drop across major cryptocurrencies created conditions that he viewed as favorable for large entries. Portnoy explained that he saw the sharp declines as an opportunity he did not want to overlook. His video highlighted that the purchases were made rapidly and were driven by a desire to take advantage of the broader sell-off occurring that evening. Smart trade @stoolpresidente https://t.co/uIVh0rSGh2 — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) November 19, 2025 Eric Trump Reacts to Portnoy’s Disclosure Following Portnoy’s announcement, Eric Trump responded publicly, expressing support for the decision and characterizing it as a good strategic move. Trump has made comments throughout the year regarding cryptocurrency trends and has regularly encouraged buying during market retracements. Earlier statements from him included predictions that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 by year-end and potentially rise to $1 million over a longer horizon. His endorsement of Portnoy’s investment is consistent with these previously stated views. Portnoy’s purchases came at a time when major cryptocurrencies were posting sustained weekly and monthly losses. XRP’s price has fallen to $2.07 after an 11.66% decline in the past week. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin is currently at $89,719, reflecting a 11.51% weekly decrease, and Ethereum has fallen to $2,940 after dropping 13.66% in the same period. Over the past month, the declines have been more pronounced, with Bitcoin losing 18.97%, Ethereum declining by 25.4%, and XRP dropping 15.66%. Portnoy’s Earlier Comments on XRP Portnoy has previously discussed his views on XRP in interviews. In May, he explained that his interest in the asset stems partly from what he described as strong fear-of-missing-out dynamics. He drew comparisons between XRP’s growth potential and his early experiences with Bitcoin, noting that he is especially attracted to the possibility of rapid gains. He also acknowledged that he does not base his decisions on XRP’s fundamental qualities, but rather on the asset’s perceived capacity for significant upward movement. His history with XRP includes a notable incident earlier in the year. In July, reports indicated that Portnoy sold roughly $3 million worth of XRP after misinterpreting a message from a friend as a warning of negative developments. He closed his position at $2.40, only for XRP to rise to $3.65 afterward. Portnoy later expressed regret over the decision, stating that the unexpected rally left him dissatisfied despite positive outcomes from his positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Portnoy’s latest acquisition underscores his continued interest in major cryptocurrencies despite recent market volatility. The positive reaction from Eric Trump adds a political figure’s endorsement to the discussion, further amplifying attention on the transaction.

Related Reading: Famous Trader Bets $27 Million That The XRP Price Will Crash This decline marks the fourth consecutive day of losses, erasing last week’s recovery and signaling a shift in sentiment as traders increasingly position for a deeper pullback. XMR's price records strong losses on the daily chart. Source: XMRUSD on Tradingview Monero (XMR)’s Selling Pressure Builds Further Fresh derivatives data reflect rising bearish conviction. According to CoinGlass, Monero’s futures Open Interest has fallen over the last 24 hours, while short positions now account for more than 55% of all trades. The drop in OI, now hovering around $78 million, suggests traders are withdrawing capital as fear of further downside builds. Technical indicators support this shift. The RSI has slipped below the midline, showing weakening momentum, while the MACD indicator has flashed a fresh sell signal. Together, these point toward deteriorating buying interest and a growing risk that XMR may not hold its current support levels. Support Threatened as Analysts Eye Breakdown Toward $350 Despite XMR maintaining an overall bullish structure on higher timeframes in recent months, the short-term outlook has flipped decisively bearish. The price is now testing key support zones, with the 50-day EMA at $348 emerging as the next major level to watch. A close below $358, which aligns with the neckline of a double-top pattern, would confirm a bearish breakdown, potentially accelerating losses toward the low-$300 region. Analysts warn that this scenario becomes more likely if market demand continues to weaken, particularly as retail traders rotate into alternative opportunities and risk sentiment remains fragile. Still, not all indicators point south. Analysts note that as long as XMR holds above $373, there remains potential for an intraday rebound toward the $400–$410 resistance range. But with the price already slipping below that threshold, bulls may face an uphill battle to reassert control. Privacy Narrative Remains Strong, but Momentum Falters Despite the near-term weakness, Monero continues to benefit from growing interest in privacy-preserving technologies. Recent upgrades, such as the Fluorine Fermi hard fork, have strengthened network security and improved resistance against surveillance-based threats. Long-term forecasts remain cautiously optimistic, with projections suggesting steady, though moderate, growth through 2030 and beyond.

This dramatic drop signals one of the most pessimistic market environments we’ve seen in recent months, creating both challenges and opportunities for crypto enthusiasts. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market sentiment. It calculates investor emotions using six key factors that provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. Understanding these components helps traders make more informed decisions during volatile periods. The index breaks down into these weighted components: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations Market Momentum/Volume (25%) – Tracks trading activity Social Media (15%) – Analyzes crypto mentions and sentiment Surveys (15%) – Gathers direct investor opinions Dominance (10%) – Monitors Bitcoin’s market share Trends (10%) – Follows Google search volume Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear Levels? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits such low numbers, it often signals potential turning points in the market. Extreme fear typically indicates that many investors are selling their positions, which can create buying opportunities for those with a longer-term perspective. However, it also suggests continued volatility ahead. Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries. The current reading of 11 places us firmly in the “extreme fear” category, which ranges from 0-25 on the scale. This psychological indicator helps traders understand when markets might be oversold or overbought. How Can Traders Navigate This Fearful Market? Navigating markets when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear requires careful strategy. First, consider dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk. Second, maintain a diversified portfolio across different cryptocurrency assets. Third, set clear stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage risk effectively. Remember that market sentiment often swings between extremes. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 11 represents one of these extreme points. While challenging, such environments have historically presented opportunities for patient investors. What’s Next for Crypto Markets? Looking forward, monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index will remain crucial for understanding market direction. As sentiment improves, we typically see the index climb back toward neutral territory around 50. However, sustained recovery requires positive catalysts and improved market fundamentals. The current extreme fear reading suggests markets remain fragile. Therefore, traders should watch for stabilization in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a potential sign of improving conditions. Meanwhile, maintaining risk management practices becomes essential. Key Takeaways from the Current Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 11 highlights several important market dynamics. First, investor psychology plays a massive role in cryptocurrency pricing. Second, extreme readings often signal potential reversal points. Third, understanding these sentiment indicators can help traders avoid emotional decision-making. As we monitor the evolving Crypto Fear & Greed Index, remember that markets move in cycles. The current extreme fear phase will eventually give way to more balanced sentiment, creating new opportunities for prepared investors. Frequently Asked Questions What is considered a normal reading for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A neutral reading typically falls between 40-60. Values below 25 indicate extreme fear, while readings above 75 suggest extreme greed in the market. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing regular insights into changing market sentiment and investor psychology. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market crashes? While it doesn’t predict specific crashes, sustained extreme greed readings often precede corrections, while extreme fear may indicate potential buying opportunities. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reliable for trading decisions? It works best as one tool among many. Combine it with technical analysis, fundamental research, and risk management for comprehensive trading strategies. Does the index cover all cryptocurrencies? While it focuses heavily on Bitcoin due to its market dominance, the index reflects overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. How long do extreme fear periods typically last? There’s no fixed duration. Extreme fear can persist for weeks or resolve quickly, depending on market catalysts and broader economic conditions. Found this analysis helpful?

Russia has taken a strategic and economic interest in AI, but the country’s entrance into the global AI industry will put it far behind established leaders in the industry like America and China. Putin believes AI is a matter of independence President Vladimir Putin recently announced the creation of a national task force at Russia’s flagship AI Journey conference. The purpose of the task force will be to coordinate generative AI development across the country. Putin explained that large language models (LLMs) have become vital tools for shaping public opinion, which means that dependence on foreign AI is a threat to Russia’s technological and value-based independence. He stressed the importance of Russia having its own full suite of generative AI technologies that will all be under the supervision of Russian experts. He also warned against harsh regulations, but said that for national security and intelligence, only Russian-trained models should be used so that their data remains within the country. The task force will promote the building of data centers across Russia. They will be supported by nearby energy sources like small-scale nuclear power stations. During his address, Putin also urged both state institutions and private companies to increase AI adoption. Putin projected that AI could contribute more than 11 trillion rubles (around $136 billion) to Russia’s GDP by 2030. Russia is far behind AI powerhouses like the U.S. and China in terms of technology development, but it already has some homegrown large-language models, including Gigachat, which was developed by Sberbank and Yandex GPT. At the same conference, Sberbank demonstrated upgraded versions of its model, as well as AI-driven products ranging from humanoid robots to health-scanning ATMs. One of the biggest obstacles for Russia’s AI ambition is the Western sanctions on microchips, as it limits Russia’s capacity to scale up its computing infrastructure. Putin’s selective cooperation The Russian President has said repeatedly that he regards foreign AI dominance as a threat to Russian culture and security. As far back as 2023, he warned that Western-trained AI systems could reflect Western values, ignoring or even “canceling” Russian traditions, history, and public policy. However, in late 2024, he announced an “AI Alliance Network” with BRICS members (Brazil, China, India, South Africa) and other nations to develop AI and build alternative regulation and market channels together. In early 2025, he ordered Sberbank and the government to deepen AI cooperation with China. According to recent research , Russia’s lower chamber of parliament, the State Duma, has been working on AI regulation since 2023, and there is reportedly a working group ordered to produce AI laws by 2026.

However, the Bitcoin derivatives market revealed an astonishing story of resilience that defied expectations. This remarkable stability in the face of price pressure offers crucial insights for cryptocurrency investors. What Makes the Bitcoin Derivatives Market So Resilient? The Bitcoin derivatives market has demonstrated exceptional steadiness despite recent price movements. According to Cointelegraph analysis, key metrics continue to show market confidence rather than panic. This stability suggests institutional maturity and growing sophistication among market participants. On November 19th, the monthly BTC futures premium maintained around 4% above spot prices. While slightly below the neutral 5% threshold, this figure indicates controlled optimism rather than excessive fear. The market shows measured responses instead of emotional reactions. How Do Perpetual Futures Signal Market Health? The perpetual futures funding rate for Bitcoin has consistently hovered around 4% annualized. This alignment with the two-week average reveals several important factors: Consistent trader behavior despite price fluctuations Balanced long and short positions Absence of extreme leverage situations Healthy market maker activity These conditions create a stable foundation for the Bitcoin derivatives market to operate efficiently. The funding rate stability prevents sudden liquidations that could trigger cascading effects. Why Does Options Data Matter for Bitcoin Investors? The BTC options delta skew maintained a stable 11% throughout the past week. This crucial metric provides deep insights into trader sentiment and risk assessment. A stable skew indicates that professional traders haven’t significantly altered their risk perceptions. This consistency in the Bitcoin derivatives market options space suggests that experienced participants view recent price movements as normal market behavior rather than fundamental shifts. The data reveals calculated positioning rather than emotional trading. What Does This Stability Mean for Future Bitcoin Price Action? The current Bitcoin derivatives market conditions create a favorable environment for sustainable growth. The absence of extreme fear or greed indicators suggests that any price movements will likely be more gradual and less volatile. This stability provides several advantages: Reduced risk of flash crashes More predictable trading conditions Improved institutional participation Healthier long-term development The Bitcoin derivatives market functioning as a stabilizing force represents significant progress in cryptocurrency market maturation. This development benefits all market participants through reduced volatility and improved liquidity. Key Takeaways from Current Bitcoin Derivatives Market Analysis The remarkable stability in the Bitcoin derivatives market during recent price tests demonstrates growing market sophistication. Traders appear to be learning from past volatility episodes and adjusting their strategies accordingly. This evolution in market behavior suggests we’re witnessing the maturation of cryptocurrency trading. Furthermore, the consistent metrics across futures, perpetuals, and options indicate coordinated market understanding. Participants across different Bitcoin derivatives market segments share similar risk assessments and trading approaches. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Bitcoin derivatives market? The Bitcoin derivatives market includes financial contracts like futures and options that derive their value from Bitcoin’s price. These instruments allow traders to hedge risk or speculate on price movements. Why is derivatives market stability important? Stability in the Bitcoin derivatives market reduces overall volatility, prevents cascading liquidations, and encourages institutional participation. It signals market maturity and sophisticated risk management. How does the futures premium indicate market sentiment? The futures premium shows whether traders are willing to pay more for future Bitcoin delivery. A stable premium around 4-5% suggests balanced optimism without excessive speculation. What does options delta skew measure? Options delta skew measures the difference in implied volatility between put and call options. A stable skew indicates consistent risk assessment among options traders. Can derivatives market stability predict future prices? While not a perfect predictor, derivatives market stability suggests reduced likelihood of extreme volatility. Stable conditions often precede more sustainable price movements. How do perpetual funding rates affect traders? Stable funding rates prevent sudden position liquidations and reduce trading costs. They indicate balanced market conditions between long and short positions. Found this analysis of Bitcoin derivatives market stability helpful?

The move represents one of Washington’s largest tech decisions in the Middle East, enabling both Gulf countries to possess hardware capable of training and running state-of-the-art AI models. U.S. officials say that these approvals entail strict security rules. The conditions are intended to prevent the chips from being sent to China or any other foreign adversary. The approvals also reflect a close partnership between Washington and the two oil-rich countries, which are both committed to becoming global leaders in AI. U.S. tightens control as sales approved The Commerce Department confirmed that G42 (UAE) and Humain (Saudi Arabia) will receive computer-equipped AI chips, comprising Nvidia’s GB300 processors . These are some of the most advanced chips Nvidia has ever produced. Approvals were granted only after both companies committed to “rigorous security and reporting requirements,” the U.S. added. Officials did not provide specifics but said their focus was heavily on preventing technology transfer to high-risk countries, particularly China. That followed months of talks between Washington and the Gulf governments. The talks were part of broader bilateral arrangements that focus on economic cooperation, cybersecurity safeguards, and new commitments to better governance with technology. G42 had already taken measures to appease American concerns. Last year, the Emirati firm committed to ceasing the use of Huawei equipment and unwinding its ties with Chinese companies. That decision paved the way for a $1.5 billion investment from Microsoft, which led to President Brad Smith joining G42’s board of directors. Saudi Arabia’s Humain has publicly stated that it will not buy Huawei gear, following U.S. expectations for secure AI development. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are both racing to build world-class AI industries. These are the new Nvidia approvals that will provide them with the raw computing power necessary to train next-generation AI models, operate large data centers, and entice global tech partners. G42 is growing at a rapid pace across various sectors — from outer space technology to national genomics projects. The company is constructing massive data centers and cloud infrastructure to fund AI labs and government projects all over the Emirates. Humain, in Saudi Arabia, is working towards its own national strategy. It plans to create giant “AI factories” to house hundreds of thousands of GPUs. The facilities are designed to provide power for projects in healthcare, higher education institutions, freight delivery services, transportation authorities, and government agencies. The Nvidia AI chips approvals come as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman strengthens ties with the Trump White House. The UAE, meanwhile, committed earlier this year to spend $1.4 trillion on the American side, further cementing its strategic alliance with Washington. U.S. balances innovation and national security Inside Washington, the decision has inspired debate. Many officials in the Trump administration view the sale as a response to China’s growing presence in the Middle East. U.S. companies, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle, can anchor the region’s AI buildout. It keeps Gulf nations inside America’s technological infrastructure. Nevertheless, some national security officials remain skeptical, as they worry that even with heavy monitoring, powerful AI chips can still be misused. They also worry that Beijing might someday gain access to data centers or research facilities located in the Gulf through commercial, scholarly, or hidden connections. Nonetheless, the American administration believes that strict operational conditions will ensure that the technology remains secure. Washington’s shift also indicates, in effect, that AI hardware is becoming increasingly part of Washington’s diplomatic toolkit. Gulf nations seek to develop AI capacity, while the United States aims to exert influence, maintain oversight, and foster economic cooperation. Nvidia, meanwhile, retains access to two of the world’s fastest-growing markets for high-performance computing. G42 and Humain approvals may be only the start. The two countries are expected to demand even more chips as they seek to emerge as global leaders in artificial intelligence, data infrastructure, and advanced technology manufacturing.

The latest data reveals a significant shift that every crypto investor needs to understand. The Altcoin Season Index has dropped five crucial points to just 26, signaling a potential change in market dynamics that could impact your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market indicator for cryptocurrency investors. This important metric defines an “altcoin season” as a period where 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 26 suggests we’re firmly in Bitcoin season territory. Why Should You Care About This Altcoin Season Index Drop? The five-point decline in the Altcoin Season Index matters because it reflects changing investor sentiment and capital flows. When the index moves lower, it indicates: Bitcoin is outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies Investor confidence may be shifting toward established assets Market risk appetite could be decreasing Capital rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin is occurring How Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Work? Understanding the mechanics behind the Altcoin Season Index helps you make better investment decisions. The index excludes stablecoins and wrapped coins from its calculation, focusing purely on performance comparisons. A score closer to 100 indicates strong altcoin season conditions, while lower scores like the current 26 point toward Bitcoin dominance. What Investment Strategies Make Sense Now? With the Altcoin Season Index sitting at 26, investors should consider several approaches. First, recognize that Bitcoin seasons often precede altcoin rallies. Historical patterns show that after extended Bitcoin dominance, capital typically flows back into altcoins. However, timing these transitions requires careful market observation and risk management. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify strategically rather than abandoning altcoins completely Monitor the Altcoin Season Index weekly for trend changes Focus on fundamentals rather than short-term price movements Set clear entry and exit points for your altcoin positions When Might We See the Next Altcoin Season? Predicting the exact timing of market shifts remains challenging, but the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable clues. The current reading suggests we’re not in altcoin season territory yet. However, market conditions can change rapidly based on several factors including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic trends. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Market Landscape The Altcoin Season Index drop to 26 presents both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. While Bitcoin appears to be dominating currently, this often sets the stage for future altcoin rallies. By understanding what the Altcoin Season Index measures and how to interpret its movements, you can make more informed decisions about your cryptocurrency portfolio allocation and timing. Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 26 mean? An Altcoin Season Index of 26 indicates that Bitcoin is significantly outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies. The index measures how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are beating Bitcoin’s performance over 90 days. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The Altcoin Season Index typically updates regularly as market data becomes available, providing ongoing insights into market dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. While a low Altcoin Season Index suggests Bitcoin dominance, it often precedes altcoin rallies. Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance rather than making reactionary decisions. What’s the difference between Bitcoin season and altcoin season? Bitcoin season occurs when Bitcoin outperforms most altcoins, while altcoin season happens when 75% of top cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict market crashes? The index measures relative performance between assets rather than predicting absolute price movements or market crashes. It’s best used as one of several market analysis tools. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for trading decisions? While valuable for understanding market trends, the index should complement rather than replace comprehensive research and risk management in trading decisions. Found this analysis helpful?

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted a Glassnode chart showing that Dogecoin’s net supply on centralized exchanges has just turned positive, noting on X: “Dogecoin supply on exchanges just turned positive! This shift has marked sharp rebounds before.” Dogecoin Rebound Loading? The chart in his post, “DOGE: Exchange Net Position Change – All Exchanges,” tracks monthly exchange inflows and outflows as a histogram, alongside DOGE’s price in US dollars. Green bars indicate net inflows (more DOGE moving to exchanges than leaving), while red bars show net outflows. From mid-2024 through late 2024, the series alternates between modest red and green periods before a sustained cluster of strong green bars emerges around the fourth quarter of 2024. During that phase, net inflows rise to several billion DOGE per month. At the same time, the price line accelerated from below $0.10 to a local peak to $0.48, illustrating how heavy exchange-side activity accompanied the rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakdown Or Bottom? On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone After that peak, the structure changes. Through early and mid-2025, the histogram becomes more mixed, with smaller positive and negative reads as price oscillates broadly between roughly $0.12 and $0.30. Heading into late 2025, however, the chart shows a pronounced sequence of red bars, with net outflows extending down toward roughly −5 to −6 billion DOGE while the price trends lower from the mid-$0.20s toward the low-$0.20s and below. The final data point, emphasized by a circular highlight on the right edge of the chart, marks a clear break in that pattern: a tall green bar crosses back above the zero line, indicating that net flows have turned positive again. At that moment, the price line sits slightly above the $0.15 mark on the vertical scale. Martinez interprets this as a “major rebound signal,” pointing to previous instances where a similar transition from persistent outflows to strong inflows coincided with sharp directional moves. DOGE On Thin Ice Below $0.16 A second chart he shared, an ATH-partitioned UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), sets out where the current DOGE supply last moved on-chain. A single, dominant bar appears around $0.07392452 and accounts for 28,260,298,271.803 DOGE, or 18.62% of the measured supply. Martinez summarizes this by stating that 27.4 billion DOGE have accumulated at roughly $0.08, calling it the “most significant support level.” Between that $0.07–$0.08 block and approximately $0.16, the URPD shows a shaded “GAP” with only small intermediate bars around levels such as $0.096, $0.125 and $0.155. Above the gap, a smaller but still notable cluster appears at about $0.162633395, containing 4,399,496,300.739 DOGE (2.9% of supply). “Below $0.16, support for Dogecoin $DOGE disappears quickly,” Martinez warns, adding that the “next real demand zone sits at $0.07.” Related Reading: One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst A third chart, a cost-basis distribution heatmap, tracks DOGE’s price against horizontal bands representing where holders’ cost bases are concentrated. It confirms two core cohorts: a lower band between $0.0812497 and $0.08279775 with 27,397,971,652.123432 DOGE, and an upper band from $0.20103297 to $0.20486326 containing 12,156,333,652.493444 DOGE. Together with the newly positive exchange flows, these data points define a market caught between a dense realized floor around $0.08 and a substantial holder cluster near $0.20, with the latest flow reversal now in focus for traders tracking DOGE’s next move. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.158.

54631970,630587,1763600432,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54631970.jpeg,First Bitcoin-Backed Municipal Bond Launches In New Hampshire,https://bitcoinist.com/first-bitcoin-backed-municipal-bond-new-hampshire/,"New Hampshire has authorized the first US municipal security explicitly backed by Bitcoin, approving a $100 million “conduit” bond that uses over-collateralized BTC rather than tax revenues or project cash flows as its primary backstop. The decision by the state’s Business Finance Authority (BFA) positions New Hampshire as an early test bed for integrating digital assets into the roughly $140 trillion global bond market. New Hampshire Continues To Lead US States Into Bitcoin Adoption Governor Kelly Ayotte framed the move as a way to attract capital while insulating residents from balance-sheet risk, saying she is “proud that New Hampshire is once again first in the nation to embrace new technologies with this historic Bitcoin-backed bond,” and calling it “an innovative way to bring more investment opportunities to our state and position us as a leader in digital finance without risking state funds or taxpayer dollars.” The bond follows a standard conduit structure: the BFA authorizes the issuance, but the credit risk rests with the private borrower, not the state’s general fund. What is novel is the collateral package. The borrower must post about 160 percent of the bond’s notional value in Bitcoin, held by digital asset custodian BitGo . If BTC’s price falls and the collateralization ratio approaches roughly 130 percent, automatic liquidation of part of the Bitcoin stack is triggered to protect bondholders and preserve principal. The BFA oversees the framework but does not guarantee repayment. SCOOP: New Hampshire Launches First Bitcoin-Backed Municipal Bond The Granite State just became the first to approve a muni bond backed by $BTC , a milestone that could pave the way for digital assets to enter the $140 trillion global debt market. https://t.co/18XTtMK9Tw — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 19, 2025 The structure was designed by Wave Digital Assets and municipal specialist Rosemawr Management, with BitGo as custodian and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe as legal counsel. Wave co-founder Les Borsai described the transaction as “the opening of a new debt market,” arguing that it shows how “public and private sectors can collaborate to responsibly unlock the value of digital assets.” Orrick partner Orion Mountainspring called it “the first municipal security backed by cryptocurrency” and a potential “game-changer for digital currency and municipal finance.” Fees and any Bitcoin appreciation associated with the transaction will flow into a dedicated Bitcoin Economic Development Fund, intended to support innovation and business growth in the state, rather than the general budget. The bond also dovetails with New Hampshire’s recently authorized Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which allows the state treasury to allocate up to 5 percent of funds into highly capitalized digital assets, in practice making Bitcoin the only viable candidate under today’s market conditions. Republican representative Keith Ammon, the driving force behind much of the state’s Bitcoin legislation, has presented the framework as a controlled way to test BTC as high-grade collateral for public finance without exposing taxpayers to direct losses. Because the bond is not a general-obligation security and relies on over-collateralization plus pre-defined liquidation thresholds, officials argue that Bitcoin’s volatility is ring-fenced within the structure. Whether the model scales beyond this initial authorization will depend on investor demand, pricing and ratings treatment once an actual borrower brings a deal to market. For now, New Hampshire has moved the concept of Bitcoin-backed public debt from theory into the machinery of US municipal finance, creating a live template other states and issuers can study or choose to emulate. At press time, BTC traded at $91,401.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 01:00:32

54633793,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=864645,1763602990,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54633793.jpeg,Semrush joins Adobe to power next-gen generative AI marketing,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/adobe-snaps-up-semrush-to-power-ai-marketing/,"Adobe has reached a deal to acquire Semrush in a cash transaction for approximately $1.9 billion, the companies announced on Wednesday. Adobe’s acquisition is a bold step in the broader effort to develop its generative AI marketing capabilities further and reveal how to make brands more visible across the digital landscape. Adobe says it will purchase Semrush at $12 a share, a premium of roughly 77.5% above Semrush’s recent trading price. Following the announcement, Semrush shares surged more than 74%, suggesting investor enthusiasm was evident. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending approval from regulatory authorities and shareholders. Adobe is acquiring the firm to integrate Semrush’s generative engine optimization and search engine optimization solutions into its Experience Cloud tools, which include Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Analytics. The aim is to help marketers understand not just how its brand looks on more conventional websites, but also how it appears in AI-powered interfaces, including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini . Adobe’s President of Digital Experience, Anil Chakravarthy, presented the acquisition as a response to a new battleground in a rapidly evolving landscape. Generative AI, when deployed to search for and discover brands, is a significant way for companies that don’t adapt to this new “engine” to be left behind, putting them at risk of irrelevance. Semrush’s Chief Executive, Bill Wagner, also stated that the merger will provide marketers with a 360-degree view of the brand’s engagements—whether on owned channels, the broader web, or AI-driven platforms. Semrush powers marketing with big data insights Semrush had been steadily growing ever since. In Semrush’s Q2 2025 earnings report , ARR grew to $435.3 million, representing approximately 15% year-over-year growth, fueled by large customers such as Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and TikTok. Semrush is well-positioned from a financial standpoint, with an ARR exceeding $400M and a non-GAAP operating margin of greater than 12%. The site serves approximately 117,000 clients – including tens of Fortune 500 companies— and still generates substantial revenue. For Adobe, the deal is, to some degree, about tools — it’s a way into systems that help marketing teams decide how and where to advertise online, from the relative tide pools of banner ads, tweets on Twitter, and posts on Facebook. Semrush’s data and platform enable Adobe to serve up something distinct: A look at what is possible with traditional SEO, as well as how GEO is just starting to change. Adobe plans to incorporate Semrush’s functions across its Experience Cloud and new developments – such as Adobe Brand Concierge, which is expected soon- to enable marketers to attend to their marketing needs in one place. This provides Adobe with greater capabilities to help brands work with massive language models and chat-based discovery — not just ranking search engine databases, but also being seen by AIs. This integration between Adobe’s creative offerings and Semrush’s marketing intelligence enables brands to create a seamless content creation process while gaining access to a wealth of visibility information. Integration hurdles could slow Adobe’s plans The deal is significant from a strategic perspective, but it is a tough one. Adobe is paying a steep premium, while Semrush has not yet experienced clear, standalone growth. Analysts say it prioritizes strategic value over short-term financial benefits, rather than immediate profits. To be successful, Adobe must seamlessly integrate Semrush’s platform into a single, unified system that minimizes disruptions to the existing business and customer experience. Buyers of these services are also likely to be sensitive to price increases, as Adobe will own the software. If an acquisition succeeds, it could be a game-changing digital marketing technology, as even competitors such as Ahrefs, Moz, or other SEO platforms would likely compete with Adobe’s AI-first, integrated alternative. This move could also lead to cross-selling opportunities throughout Adobe’s creative, analytics, and marketing platforms, as well as establish its footing as a marketing powerhouse powered by AI.

Large institutional movements often signal upcoming market shifts. Moreover, this particular Bitmain wallet ETH withdrawal could indicate several possibilities: Strategic portfolio rebalancing by Bitmain Preparation for upcoming Ethereum network upgrades Institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value Potential involvement in decentralized finance protocols How Does This Impact Ethereum’s Market Position? The timing of this Bitmain wallet ETH withdrawal coincides with several key market developments. Ethereum has been showing resilience despite broader market fluctuations. Therefore, this massive movement could reinforce positive sentiment around the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Market analysts are closely watching how this Bitmain wallet ETH withdrawal might affect: Short-term price volatility for ETH Institutional adoption trends Exchange liquidity conditions Overall market confidence in major cryptocurrencies What Can We Learn From This Transaction?

Large movements often precede market trends that affect portfolios of all sizes. Understanding these institutional moves helps you: Anticipate potential market shifts Make better timing decisions for your investments Recognize patterns in cryptocurrency adoption Stay informed about major player strategies Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitmain and why is this withdrawal significant? Bitmain is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturers. Their substantial ETH holdings and movements can influence market sentiment and indicate institutional positioning. How was this transaction identified as belonging to Bitmain? Onchain analytics platforms like Onchainlens use pattern recognition, transaction history, and wallet behavior analysis to identify likely ownership of cryptocurrency addresses. Could this large withdrawal affect Ethereum’s price? While single transactions rarely determine market prices, large movements from known entities can influence trader psychology and potentially create short-term volatility. What does withdrawing from BitGo indicate? BitGo is a major institutional cryptocurrency custodian. Moving funds from custody services often signals preparation for active deployment rather than long-term storage. Is this type of large transaction common? While cryptocurrency sees billions in daily transactions, movements of this size from identified institutional wallets remain relatively rare and noteworthy. Should individual investors be concerned about such large movements? Not necessarily concerned, but aware. Understanding institutional behavior helps individual investors make more informed decisions about their own strategies.

This temporary halt in deposits and withdrawals comes as the platform prepares for a significant network upgrade. If you’re holding 0G tokens, understanding this development is essential for managing your digital assets effectively. Why Did Upbit Announce the 0G Suspension? The primary reason behind the Upbit 0G suspension is an upcoming hard fork for the ZeroGravity network. Hard forks represent major protocol changes that require temporary transaction halts. Therefore, Upbit must ensure all systems align with the new network specifications. This precautionary measure protects user funds during the transition period. How Does the Upbit 0G Suspension Impact Traders? The temporary Upbit 0G suspension means traders cannot move their ZeroGravity tokens during the specified period. However, it’s important to note that spot trading typically remains operational. Here’s what you need to know: Deposit and withdrawal functions will be temporarily disabled Existing 0G balances remain secure in your Upbit wallet Trading activities may continue depending on market conditions The suspension period usually lasts until network stability is confirmed What Should You Do During the Upbit 0G Suspension? While the Upbit 0G suspension is in effect, traders should monitor official communications closely. Upbit typically provides regular updates about the resumption timeline. Moreover, this temporary pause offers an opportunity to research the hard fork’s potential impact on 0G’s value proposition. When Will Normal Services Resume After the Upbit 0G Suspension? Exchange officials haven’t specified an exact timeline for lifting the Upbit 0G suspension . Historically, such interruptions last until the network upgrade completes successfully. The exchange will announce resumption through official channels once they verify network stability and security. Why Are Hard Forks Necessary for Cryptocurrencies Like 0G? Hard forks represent crucial evolution points for blockchain networks. The Upbit 0G suspension highlights how exchanges manage these technical transitions. Network upgrades often introduce enhanced features, improved security, or scalability solutions. Consequently, temporary inconveniences lead to long-term benefits for the ecosystem. What Can We Learn From This Upbit 0G Suspension? This Upbit 0G suspension demonstrates the cryptocurrency industry’s maturation. Exchanges now implement proactive measures to ensure user protection during network changes. While temporary, such suspensions reflect the industry’s commitment to security and technological progress. The temporary Upbit 0G suspension serves as a reminder that blockchain technology continues evolving. Though inconvenient for short-term traders, these necessary pauses ensure long-term network health and security. As the cryptocurrency landscape matures, such procedural suspensions become standard practice during significant upgrades. Frequently Asked Questions How long will the Upbit 0G suspension last? The duration varies depending on network upgrade completion. Upbit will announce the exact resumption time through official channels. Can I still trade 0G during the suspension? Spot trading typically continues unless otherwise specified. However, deposit and withdrawal functions remain temporarily disabled. Will my 0G tokens be safe during the suspension? Yes, your tokens remain secure in your Upbit wallet. The suspension primarily affects transaction functions rather than storage security. Why do exchanges suspend services during hard forks? Exchanges pause services to ensure compatibility with new network protocols and prevent potential transaction errors or fund loss. How will I know when services resume? Upbit will make official announcements through their website, social media channels, and app notifications. Should I be worried about the hard fork? Hard forks are routine network upgrades. The temporary suspension demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to user protection during technical transitions. Found this guide helpful?

54633907,630438,1763604029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54633907.jpeg,"Bitmine Keeps Buying Ethereum Despite Market Drop: 21,054 ETH Arrive In New Wallet",https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-keeps-buying-ethereum-despite-market-drop/,"Ethereum has come under heavy selling pressure over the past few days as the broader crypto market entered a deep corrective phase. Yet, despite the volatility and widespread fear, ETH has managed to hold firmly above the key $3,000 level — a zone many analysts consider essential for maintaining the broader bullish structure. Now, as price stabilizes and buyers begin to re-emerge, several market observers are starting to call for a potential recovery, arguing that Ethereum may be nearing the end of its downturn. Adding fuel to this narrative is the continued accumulation from major players, most notably Tom Lee’s Bitmine. Tom Lee — a well-known Wall Street strategist, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, and long-time Bitcoin and Ethereum bull — has been one of the most influential voices in the digital asset market for nearly a decade. His firm Bitmine operates as a large institutional crypto investment entity focused on long-term accumulation, market-making, and strategic positioning during periods of fear. According to recent on-chain data, Bitmine has continued buying ETH even as prices fell, signaling strong conviction in the asset’s long-term outlook. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the broader market, where short-term holders have been capitulating. Bitmine Continues Accumulating ETH Despite Market Weakness According to fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain, accumulation activity around Ethereum is far from slowing down. A newly flagged wallet, 0xE2ed, believed to be associated with Tom Lee’s Bitmine, received 21,054 ETH (worth $66.57 million) from Kraken just a few hours ago. This move reinforces the view that large, sophisticated players are treating the recent correction as an opportunity rather than a threat. The timing of this transfer is notable. Ethereum has been under sustained selling pressure for weeks, with sentiment turning sharply bearish as the market grappled with fear, liquidations, and a broader rotation into stablecoins. Yet despite this environment, Bitmine-linked wallets continue to absorb supply aggressively. This pattern aligns with Bitmine’s broader strategy: accumulating high-quality crypto assets during periods of uncertainty to position for long-term upside. Large inflows to accumulation wallets during drawdowns have historically suggested strong conviction among institutional players, often preceding phases of recovery and renewed strength. Suppose this wallet is indeed tied to Bitmine. In that case, it signals that some of the market’s most well-capitalized participants remain confident in Ethereum’s long-term value, regardless of short-term volatility. ETH Price Analysis: Testing Long-Term Support Amid Heavy Volatility Ethereum’s weekly chart shows the asset navigating a critical zone as price hovers just above $3,000, a level that has historically acted as a major demand area. After weeks of sustained selling pressure, ETH has pulled back from the $4,500 region and is now retesting its long-term moving averages. The 200-week MA, in particular, is positioned closely beneath the current price, acting as a structural anchor that has supported Ethereum in previous cycle corrections, including the deep capitulation seen in mid-2022 and the recovery phase of 2023. The recent candle structure reflects heightened volatility, with long wicks suggesting strong reactions from buyers near the $3,000 threshold. Volume has increased slightly during this downturn, indicating active participation from both sellers locking in profits and buyers positioning for potential reversal. Yet ETH remains below its 50-week MA, showing that short-term momentum continues to lean bearish. Still, the broader pattern resembles earlier cycle pullbacks where Ethereum retraced sharply before forming higher lows and resuming its macro uptrend. If ETH can maintain this support band and reclaim the $3,300–$3,500 region, it may signal renewed strength. But a weekly close below $3,000 risks opening the door to deeper correction targets near $2,700.

As the global financial system moves toward higher costs, weaker currencies, and increasing inefficiencies, BTC is emerging as the most compelling alternative because it works more effectively. Economic Pressure Points That Will Accelerate Bitcoin Uptake In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital finance, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin’s future has often been intertwined with fervent ideological conviction. A media company, known as TFTC on X, has highlighted why BTC adoption won’t be driven by ideology, but rather by economics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Accepted By 4 Million Businesses, Thanks To Jack Dorsey Every merchant today is focused on handing over 2–3% of every transaction to payment processors and lives under the constant threat of chargebacks. Especially for small businesses, those costs and risks compound fast. However, BTC eliminates all of it with no processing fees, no chargebacks, just instant, final settlement straight into the merchant’s wallet. As Miles, a crypto enthusiast, consistently pointed out, the economic incentives are so overwhelmingly strong that adoption becomes inevitable. Merchants save thousands on fees, and they can pass those savings back to their customers through instant cashback rewards for using BTC. This dynamic creates a self-reinforcing flywheel effect, allowing Merchants to lower their operational costs and increase their profit margins. At the same time, consumers would get tangible rewards and better value for their money by simply using BTC. Both sides will benefit immensely, while the BTC network will grow stronger. When the underlying math is this incredibly favorable, adoption is no longer a philosophical stance, but it’s an economic certainty. The Path To Reclaiming Bullish Momentum While the economic incentives will be responsible for Bitcoin’s next rally, analyst Rekt Capital has revealed a historical demand area, marked in orange, which has played a pivotal role in dictating BTC’s next major trend. The first time price tapped this zone, it produced a sharp +20% rebound before breaking down. After this breakdown, the BTC price moved to lower levels to absorb the remaining buy-side liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Bullish Confluence: Death Cross And Key Support Signal Upside Once BTC reclaimed the orange region as support, it triggered a +37% rally to new all-time highs. On the second retest, this same support zone showed signs of strength. Currently, BTC is finding support at this same historical demand area. What would happen next will be critical in determining whether this demand area will continue to strengthen or if signs of weakening will finally emerge. Furthermore, BTC will need to break the multi-week downtrend, marked in black on the chart, to relieve fear of fading support. A rebound from this demand area that fails to break the multi-week downtrend would only result in a yield of +10% move, which suggests that the support zone may be weakening.

Officials say it’s an unprecedented scale mission, even comparing it to the Manhattan Project and the space race. The administration views AI not only as a technological tool but also as a strategic asset vital to national security, economic growth, and global influence. Genesis Mission will enlist national laboratories nationwide to ramp up research on next-generation AI technologies. Officials are also aiming to develop greater alignment among government agencies, tech organizations, and academic institutions through strong public-private partnerships, laying the groundwork for a robust, coordinated ecosystem around the development of artificial intelligence. Its goal, officials note, would be to expedite scientific innovation and put the U.S. at the forefront of the global AI race. The mission will span various fields, including data science and computing, engineering, materials science, and neuroscience, senior officials said. The administration also hopes to drive breakthroughs that will change not only the economy and national defense but also our destiny itself by ensuring that the best research efforts link with industry, federal resources, and its people. Administration moves to centralize AI regulation Alongside the Genesis Mission, the Trump administration is drafting an executive order that will solidify its authority over the regulation of AI within the federal government. It would permit the federal government to challenge state laws it deems unconstitutional and potentially restrict federal funds for states with so-called overly restrictive statutes. A patchwork of state rules, officials say, may hinder innovation, increase costs for companies, and create uncertainty for U.S. AI developers. The centralization of a federal scheme will create a single set of standards, aiming to streamline the regulatory environment and encourage companies to scale technologies rapidly. The order also sends a clear message to the private sector: the federal government will be the primary source of rules governing artificial intelligence nationwide, thereby reducing the potential for disparities across states. Simplified federal oversight is a tool to promote innovation in the digital age while ensuring that AI efforts align with national priorities. At the same time, it portends possible legal and political disputes over federal vs. state power that could loom in the next few months. Trump pushes U.S. to lead the global AI race Genesis Mission is part of a broader plan to keep the United States at the forefront of global AI development. Global competitors, most notably China, claim to have attempted to stoke aggressive growth in AI under more centralized regulatory regimes. The administration views the United States as poised to fall behind technologically and strategically unless it takes proactive steps. These objectives include improving existing research infrastructure while building new data centers and advanced high-tech supercomputing systems. The administration intends to accelerate the deployment of AI through a combination of federal research and private-sector innovations in areas such as scientific discovery, defense, healthcare, and industrial applications. Experts say the efforts are grand, but it has their traps. There will be legal issues with states regarding federal power, and expedited efforts could overlook important ethical considerations, such as data privacy and minimizing bias. However, the administration is presenting Genesis Mission as the most effective solution for protecting our tech future. Genesis Mission, which envisions the United States as being the world’s most innovative, capable, influential, and competitive nation in artificial intelligence, builds state-of-the-art research, regulation, and industrial cooperation at an unprecedented level.

Just hours ago, this pioneering Bitcoin investor transferred his entire remaining holdings of 2,499 BTC to the Kraken exchange, a transaction valued at an astonishing $228 million. This massive transfer from a long-term Bitcoin investor immediately sparked intense speculation across financial markets. Why Would a Bitcoin Investor Make Such a Massive Move? When a seasoned Bitcoin investor moves this amount of cryptocurrency to an exchange, the crypto community takes immediate notice. Large-scale deposits typically signal one thing: potential selling activity. However, experienced Bitcoin investors sometimes have multiple strategies beyond simple liquidation. This particular Bitcoin investor might be considering various options including: Portfolio rebalancing strategies Taking profits after substantial gains Preparing for other investment opportunities Estate planning or wealth management moves The timing of this Bitcoin investor’s decision comes during a period of relative market stability, making the move even more noteworthy for market analysts. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Markets? Market reactions to large transfers from early Bitcoin investors often create immediate ripple effects. When a prominent Bitcoin investor moves hundreds of millions in cryptocurrency, it typically triggers several market responses. Trading volumes often spike as other investors react to the news. Price volatility can increase significantly as market participants interpret the Bitcoin investor’s intentions. However, it’s crucial to remember that not every exchange deposit leads to immediate selling. Some Bitcoin investors use exchanges for other purposes like: Securing assets in exchange wallets Preparing for staking or lending activities Facilitating institutional transactions Diversifying across multiple platforms Understanding Early Bitcoin Investor Psychology Early Bitcoin investors like Owen Gunden possess unique market perspectives having witnessed Bitcoin’s journey from obscurity to mainstream adoption. Their moves often carry significant weight because these Bitcoin investors have demonstrated remarkable patience and conviction through multiple market cycles. When such a Bitcoin investor makes a substantial move, it’s worth examining potential motivations beyond surface-level interpretations. These seasoned Bitcoin investors typically consider factors that newer market participants might overlook. Their decisions often reflect deep understanding of market cycles, regulatory developments, and technological advancements affecting cryptocurrency valuations. Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts This development offers valuable lessons for anyone interested in cryptocurrency markets. The move by this early Bitcoin investor demonstrates several important principles about cryptocurrency investing. Market movements by established Bitcoin investors provide learning opportunities for understanding market dynamics. Large transactions remind us about the importance of having clear investment strategies regardless of market conditions. Moreover, this situation highlights why monitoring blockchain activity through services like Lookonchain has become essential for serious market participants tracking significant Bitcoin investor behavior. Frequently Asked Questions Why do large Bitcoin deposits to exchanges often indicate selling? Exchanges provide the liquidity needed for large sales. When Bitcoin investors move significant amounts to exchanges, they’re typically preparing to convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency or other assets. How early is Owen Gunden as a Bitcoin investor? While specific details about his initial acquisition aren’t public, holding 2,499 BTC suggests very early involvement, potentially dating back to Bitcoin’s earlier years when prices were substantially lower. Could this Bitcoin deposit have other purposes besides selling? Absolutely. While selling is the most common interpretation, Bitcoin investors sometimes use exchanges for staking, lending, or transferring between accounts. Some institutional transactions also require exchange intermediation. How might this affect Bitcoin’s price? Large potential sell pressure can create short-term volatility, but Bitcoin’s market depth has grown significantly. Single transactions, while large, rarely dictate long-term price trends in today’s mature market. Should retail investors follow early Bitcoin investors’ moves? While educational, retail investors should make decisions based on personal research and risk tolerance rather than blindly following any single Bitcoin investor’s actions. How can I track large cryptocurrency movements? Blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Chainalysis, and various on-chain analysis tools allow monitoring of significant cryptocurrency transactions in real-time.

In 2028, $SACHI is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $0.65, with an average price of $0.45. By 2031, $SACHI could trade between $0.60 and $1.35, with an average price of $0.95 SACHI is one of the new players in the Web3 gaming world. The coin combines high-quality Unreal Engine 5 graphics with blockchain-based economies to make a gaming universe that is always available and immersive. SACHI focuses on gameplay first and tokens second. Its “play first, wallet later” philosophy gives its token holders console-quality experiences right away—no wallet, no setup, no hassle—making it one of the easiest Web3 games to get into so far. SACHI is also building the foundation for a modern, seamless, and deeply social gaming world with help from major infrastructure partners like Microsoft Azure and Aethir, as well as real-time pixel-streaming technology. With the recent listing (November 19, 2025) of the $SACHI token on MEXC, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is $SACHI likely to go up? What will $SACHI be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the SACHI price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency SACHI Ticker $SACHI Current Price $0.07495 Market Cap – Trading Volume (24-Hour) $213.45K Circulating Supply 560,000,000 SACHI All-time High – All-time Low – 24-hour High $0.13311 24-hour Low $0.036 $SACHI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.07495 Price Prediction $0.09 Fear & Greed Index – Sentiment – Volatility – Green Days – 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI – $SACHI price analysis $SACHI/USDT price analysis 1-day chart The 1-day chart on Nov 20 shows that $SACHI is very volatile after its MEXC launch. There is a huge change from $0.03600 to $0.13311, and then the price stays stable around $0.074–$0.075. This pattern shows that the initial listing spike has cooled off and the market is now looking for a fair value zone. SACHI/USD chart by mexc.co The price is stable because the candle body is tight and the volume is low. If buyers stay above $0.07, SACHI might try to test the $0.10–$0.13 zone again. But if it drops below $0.06, it could go down even more to $0.045–$0.05. What happens next depends on how much volume comes back. If it doesn’t, $SACHI may trade sideways for a while. $SACHI/USDT price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart for $SACHI shows price movements that happen very early and are very volatile, but there isn’t much structure because it just got listed. The huge green candle that went from $0.036 to $0.13311 suggests that the first breakout was aggressive and was probably caused by listing hype and low liquidity. $ SACHI/USD chart by mexc.co Since then, the price has stayed around $0.074–$0.075, forming small red candles that show momentum is slowing down, but there hasn’t been a clear reversal yet. The market is still figuring out what fair value is because there aren’t any moving averages or trend structures. $SACHI might test $0.10 again if interest rises, and it might test $0.05 support again if interest falls. Expect prices to move up and down until there is more liquidity. $SACHI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 – – SMA 5 – – SMA 10 – – SMA 21 – – SMA 50 – – SMA 100 – – SMA 200 – – Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 – – EMA 5 – – EMA 10 – – EMA 21 – – EMA 50 – – EMA 100 – – EMA 200 – – What to expect from $SACHI price analysis next? SACHI’s price movements show that there will be some early-stage volatility as the token settles down after its debut on MEXC. The market is now looking for a fair value range after a strong start that sent the price up to $0.13311 and then settled around $0.074–$0.08. If more people buy and the listing keeps going up, SACHI could test the $0.10–$0.13 zone again. But because there isn’t much liquidity and there isn’t much historical data, pullbacks to $0.050–$0.060 are still possible. Short-term movement will depend a lot on what happens on the exchanges, how involved the community is, and any announcements about the ecosystem that are coming up. Expect a lot of ups and downs, but also some attempts to go up as more people become aware. Is $SACHI a good investment? SACHI aims to build a big gaming ecosystem on Unreal Engine 5 and get people to sign up by using its “play-first, wallet-later” model and listing on MEXC. It has a lot of potential, but it’s still in the early stages. The token might be worth keeping an eye on if you believe in the execution of its roadmap, the growth of the gaming Web3 space, and SACHI’s community momentum. But if you care more about lower risk or proven fundamentals, SACHI might be too risky right now. What will $SACHI be worth in 2025? By the end of 2025, SACHI is expected to reach a maximum price of $0.09 How much will $SACHI cost in 2030? According to analysts’ predictions, $SACHI Token is predicted to trade at an average price of $0.72, with a maximum price of $1.05 by 2030. Can $SACHI reach $20? SACHI is still very early in its development, so it’s very unlikely that it will reach $20. To reach that level, there would need to be a huge increase in value, a lot of people using it, listings on major exchanges, and a big drop in the amount of coins in circulation. $20 is still way too high for realistic short-term expectations unless SACHI becomes a top-tier gaming ecosystem. Where to buy $SACHI? Users can purchase $SACHI at MEXC Global, which is the main centralized exchange where $SACHI is officially listed and actively traded. You can also find it on some supported markets, like Holder.io, which shows the SACHI/USDT trading pairs. Before you buy, always check the official contract address and make sure you’re using a trusted exchange. Will $SACHI reach $10? It’s very unlikely that SACHI will reach $10 under the current conditions. To reach $10 from its recent range of about $0.07 to $0.08, it would need to grow by more than 100 times, which would require a lot of new users, a lot of new exchanges, and steady growth in the ecosystem. $10 is still very speculative and unlikely to happen in the near future because there are no proven long-term fundamentals or large-scale demand. Will $SACHI reach $100? Under any realistic market conditions, it is almost impossible for SACHI to reach $100. To reach $100 at its current price, it would need to rise by thousands of percent and push its market cap into the tens of billions, which is much higher than what most early-stage gaming tokens can do. For SACHI to get to that level, it would need a lot of people around the world to start using it, a lot of major exchanges to list it, a lot of new users to join, and a lot of coins to be taken out of circulation. None of these things are happening yet. Even though crypto can be unpredictable, $100 is not a reasonable or likely goal for SACHI based on its fundamentals, maturity, and tokenomics. Does $SACHI have a good long-term future? SACHI has a lot of potential if it can make its AAA Web3 gaming universe a reality, get a lot of players, and keep making good partnerships with companies like Microsoft Azure and Aethir. Its “play first, wallet later” model is different and might appeal to regular gamers. But it’s still very early, very speculative, and completely dependent on how well it’s done. There is a chance of long-term success, but it is not certain. Recent news/opinion on $SACHI Recent news about $ SACHI has gotten a lot of attention because the token is at a very important time for its ecosystem. The November 19 listing on MEXC Global lets gamers and traders from all over the world join in. It comes after the token generation event on November 18. The token’s “play-first, wallet-later” Web3 gaming model and community incentives based on airdrops helped it get more attention and gain traction early on. Its partnerships with Microsoft Azure, Aethir, and TokaCity show how big its goals are. But because the project is still in its early stages, is speculative, and has a short trading history, $ SACHI is still a high-risk investment. Community involvement and interest in real-world gaming will be important in figuring out if the hype turns into real value. $SACHI price prediction November 2025 The price of Hedera is expected to be at least $0.05 in November 2025.

SACHI price prediction 2027 By 2027, SACHI’s average market price is projected to reach $0.32, with a possible low of $0.20 and a high of $0.46, driven by gaming adoption and infrastructure upgrades.

SACHI price forecast 2029 By 2029, SACHI’s average price is forecast at $0.58, with a potential low of $0.36 and a high of $0.82, supported by maturing GameFi demand and deeper ecosystem integration. SACHI ($SACHI) price prediction 2030 By 2030, SACHI’s average market price may reach $0.72, with lows around $0.48 and highs of $1.05. However, this is due to sustained Web3 gaming growth at this time. SACHI price prediction 2031 By 2031, SACHI’s average price is expected to be $0.95, with a projected low of $0.60 and a peak potential of $1.35, assuming mass adoption, stable tokenomics, and expansion into mainstream gaming. $SACHI price predictions 2025 – 2030 $SACHI market price prediction: Analysts’ $SACHI price forecast Firm Name 2025 2026 Mexc $0.036 $0.0378 Cryptopolitan’s SACHI ($SACHI) price prediction Cryptopolitan forecasts $SACHI price to range between $0.07 and $0.80 by the end of 2025.

CRCL's business is still heavily reliant on USDC issuance and short-term interest rates, though, making it vulnerable to both falling interest rates and a potential crypto market downturn. While I believe there could still be further downside, I am now more neutral on Circle's stock after the recent decline. Circle's ( CRCL ) third-quarter results were strong, with efforts to diversify revenue beginning to pay off. This will only play out slowly, though, and in the meantime there is little to prevent a complete implosion of Circle's business in the event of a recession. I previously highlighted the enormous risks Circle was facing, and its share price is down over 40% since then. Short-term interest rates continue to fall, although this has been fairly modest so far. Bitcoin's price is also down materially in recent weeks, which could temper demand for stablecoins. Despite this, I am now more neutral on Circle's stock after the recent decline, as the longer term narrative remains fairly compelling. Having said that, there will little to support Circle's share price if macro conditions continue to deteriorate. Market Conditions The most important recent development for stablecoins is the introduction of a far more favorable regulatory environment. While the full impact likely won't be felt for some time, Circle is best positioned to capitalize on this situation due to its focus on compliance. Stablecoins in circulation increased 59% YoY in Q3, supported by surging markets. Circle’s market share also increased to 29% in the quarter. Stablecoin transaction volumes were reportedly up around 130% YoY, with USDC’s share growing to 40%. While this is positive, the recent market pullback is likely to temper demand for stablecoins in the short term. If this situation evolves into a bear market or recession, USDC's market capitalization could drop significantly, despite secular tailwinds. Figure 1: Bitcoin Price and USDC Market Capitalization (source: Created by author using data from) Circle Business Updates Circle's business continues to be dominated by the issuance of USDC, a US-dollar-denominated stablecoin. Circle also now offers the EURC stablecoin, but its market cap is still negligible. This is important as it means that Circle's revenue is predominantly dependent on short-term interest rates. Circle is building financial infrastructure that extends well beyond just USDC, though. This includes the Arc layer-1 blockchain, which is tailored for stablecoins. Circle recently launched the Arc public testnet with more than 100 participants. While this is an interesting strategic move, it is not guaranteed to be successful. Arc faces fierce competition, and it is a late entrant into the market. This must be weighed against the fact that Circle has a distribution advantage and could use incentives to drive adoption. For example, Circle is already considering introducing a native token on the Arc Network. Circle also offers CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol), an infrastructure solution that enables the movement of USDC across blockchains, improving liquidity and the user experience. CCTP volume reached 31.3 billion USD in Q3, up 640% YoY. Circle has suggested that this represented around 47% of the bridged volumes that it tracks. Circle also has the Circle Payments Network, a stablecoin payments solution targeted at financial institutions. It abstracts the complexity of the underlying blockchain system and enables fast, low-cost, and compliant global payments. CPN was only launched in May 2025 but is already seeing significant transaction volume growth. Support for 5 new chains was added in the quarter, and Circle continues to expand the CPN product portfolio. This includes CPN Console, a self-service solution for CPN members, and CPN Payouts, which enables automated stablecoin payouts on CPN. There are now 29 network members and a pipeline of 500 financial institutions waiting to join. CPN transaction volume is currently at around a 3.4 billion USD annual run rate. The other important part of Circle's business at the moment is USYC, a tokenized money market fund. Circle acquired this product to support the rising use of yield-bearing digital assets as collateral in margin trading. USYC is now the second largest TMMF globally, with roughly 1 billion USD AUM. Financial Analysis USDC in circulation reached almost 74 billion USD in the third quarter, an increase of 108% YoY. Onchain transactions using USDC also grew 580% YoY to 9.6 trillion USD. Revenue and reserve income was only up 66% to 740 million USD though, with lower interest rates offsetting a substantial portion of the volume increase (return on reserves of ~4.15%). Transaction revenue totaled 4.7 million USD in the quarter. Other revenue was 29 million USD in Q3, up from less than 1 million USD in the prior year's comparable quarter. Subscription and services revenue totaled 23.6 million USD, which primarily relates to blockchain network partnerships. Circle hasn't given specific near-term revenue guidance. USDC in circulation is expected to grow at a 40% CAGR over a multi-year period, though, which probably puts revenue growth at less than a 30% CAGR. Circle also now expects 90-100 million USD Other Revenue in 2025, which would mean that Other Revenue is fairly flat sequentially. Given the underlying trends in the business, this guidance appears overly conservative. Figure 2: Circle Revenue (source: Created by author using data from Circle) Total distribution and transaction and other costs increased 74% YoY in Q3 to 448 million USD. The increase was driven by distribution incentives and growth of USDC balances held on Coinbase's platform. As a result, Circle's RLDC margin declined to 39.5%. Circle's adjusted operating expenses only increased 35% YoY to 131 million USD though, with adjusted EBITDA reaching 166 million USD at a 22% margin. While Circle has a highly profitable business, this would soon change if interest rates were to drop significantly. Figure 3: Circle Margins (source: Created by author using data from Circle) Conclusion I remain skeptical of Circle's business due to its current dependence on interest rates and cryptocurrency speculation. The company is moving in the right direction, though, with its infrastructure solutions and tokenized money market fund continuing to grow rapidly. It will likely be years before these alternative revenue sources are large enough to justify Circle's current market capitalization. In the meantime, weakening economic conditions continue to present a serious threat to Circle's share price. Despite this, I am now more neutral on Circle's stock, as it could soon find support after the recent decline.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-20 02:32:22

Speaking at the Devconnect conference, Buterin expressed deep concerns that institutional money might compromise the very Ethereum values that made the network revolutionary. Why Are Ethereum Values So Important? Ethereum values represent the foundational principles that distinguish the network from traditional financial systems. These include decentralization, permissionless access, and censorship resistance. However, Buterin warns that these core Ethereum values face unprecedented challenges from institutional investors seeking to reshape the ecosystem for their own benefit. The Two Major Threats to Ethereum’s Future Buterin outlined two critical dangers that could emerge from excessive institutional influence: Community Exodus: The original builders and developers who created Ethereum’s infrastructure might abandon the project if it becomes merely a tool for large corporations Decentralization Collapse: Regular users and node operators could be priced out if technology development focuses exclusively on institutional needs How Can We Protect Ethereum Values? Buterin emphasized that preserving these essential Ethereum values requires conscious effort and strategic planning. The solution lies in developing protocols that remain: Global and accessible to everyone Permissionless without gatekeepers Censorship-resistant against external control What Makes a Strong Ethereum Community? A dedicated community committed to Ethereum values serves as the network’s first line of defense. This community must actively participate in governance, run nodes, and develop applications that serve diverse users rather than just institutional interests. The strength of these Ethereum values depends on everyday users maintaining control. The Path Forward for Ethereum Values Maintaining authentic Ethereum values requires balancing growth with principles. While institutional investment brings capital and legitimacy, it must not come at the cost of the network’s founding ideals. The community must remain vigilant in protecting the Ethereum values that make the platform unique in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions What are the core Ethereum values Buterin mentioned? The core Ethereum values include decentralization, permissionless access, censorship resistance, and community-driven development that serves diverse users rather than concentrated interests. How could institutional investors threaten Ethereum? Institutions might push for changes that prioritize their needs over regular users, potentially making node operation too expensive for individuals and centralizing control. What solutions did Buterin propose? Buterin emphasized developing global, permissionless protocols and strengthening community commitment to Ethereum’s original principles. Can Ethereum survive without institutional money? Yes, Ethereum initially grew through community support. While institutions bring benefits, the network’s survival depends on maintaining its core values above all. How can regular users help protect Ethereum values? Users can run nodes, participate in governance, support decentralized applications, and advocate for policies that maintain accessibility. Is this concern unique to Ethereum? While all decentralized networks face similar challenges, Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract platform makes it particularly vulnerable to institutional capture.

Analysts Weigh In After ETF Momentum Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/can-xrp-really-overtake-ethereum-analysts-weigh-in-after-etf-momentum-builds/,"The crypto market is buzzing after the launch of the first U.S. spot XRP ETFs, a development that has injected fresh institutional energy into the asset. Related Reading: Famous Trader Bets $27 Million That The XRP Price Will Crash With multiple high-performing firms entering the race, including Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale, a bold question is resurfacing across the industry: Can XRP realistically challenge Ethereum for the No. 2 spot in the global cryptocurrency rankings? XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP ETFs Ignite Institutional Momentum The launch of XRP ETFs in November 2025 marked a historic moment for the asset. Canary Capital’s XRPC debuted with over $58 million in first-day volume, the strongest ETF opening among hundreds launched this year. Franklin Templeton has now filed its Form 8-A to list the Franklin XRP ETF on NYSE Arca, signaling that another major player is just days away from going live. This influx of institutional interest mirrors the early phases of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF rollouts, characterized by short-term volatility followed by broader adoption. Though XRP’s price consolidated around the $2.12–$2.17 zone after the initial spike, analysts argue that ETF inflows operate with settlement lags through OTC desks. In other words, the actual impact on market price may not be realized until later. Can XRP Truly Compete With Ethereum’s Dominance? Despite XRP’s explosive year, marked by record utility, rising XRPL adoption, and Ripple’s $500 million strategic investment, the asset still faces a steep climb if it hopes to overtake Ethereum. Ethereum remains firmly in second place with a $373 billion market cap, supported by a massive ecosystem of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and tokenized assets. XRP, currently around $129 billion, operates on a network optimized for payments rather than programmable applications. Analysts note that while XRP’s institutional use cases are deepening, particularly in cross-border settlement, tokenization, and banking infrastructure, the lack of a native smart-contract layer limits its ability to mirror Ethereum’s developer-driven demand. For now, experts say that overtaking Ethereum is unlikely in the short to medium term. But with expanding utility, ETF-driven accumulation, and growing adoption in Japan, the U.S., and global banks, XRP’s market cap could still climb substantially. Price Outlook: Volatility Now, Bigger Moves Later From a technical standpoint, XRP is sitting at a critical support zone near $2.12, repeatedly testing the 0.382 Fibonacci level. Selling pressure remains present, with capital outflows and lower highs on the chart. Yet open interest has surged from $1 billion to over $6 billion since October, signaling strong trader engagement.

54635894,630766,1763607637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54635894.jpeg,$201M SOL Sell-Off Sparks More Fear: Can Solana Hold Above the $130 Support Zone?,https://bitcoinist.com/201m-sol-sell-off-sparks-more-fear-can-solana-hold/,"Solana (SOL) is under intense market pressure after a massive $201 million token transfer on November 17 sparked concerns about further losses. While institutional interest in Solana-based ETFs remains strong, technical indicators point to a fragile market structure that could send SOL toward the $125–$120 region if buyers fail to regain momentum. $201M Dump Raises Alarms as Solana Extends Downtrend Forward Industries, Solana’s largest corporate holder, moved 1.44 million SOL, worth roughly $201.34 million, to Coinbase Prime earlier this week, according to Onchain Lens . The transfer triggered speculation of an impending major sell-off, especially as Solana has already declined nearly 50% over the past two months. Although it remains unclear whether the tokens were sold or repositioned, the market reaction was swift. SOL briefly dipped to $128 before recovering to the $137 range. Trading volume, however, has declined by 38% to $5.65 billion, indicating elevated trader anxiety and aggressive repositioning. Technically, SOL remains in a confirmed downtrend after losing the critical $155 support level. Indicators such as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.18 and a bearish Supertrend signal show persistent selling pressure. If the price remains below the current consolidation zone, analysts warn of a potential 16% drop, placing $120 firmly in sight. Institutional Inflows Persist Despite Price Weakness The irony in Solana’s current situation is striking. Despite a weekly drop of 11%, institutional confidence is slowly picking up pace. Solana ETFs have rapidly expanded across major U.S. exchanges, with Fidelity, Canary, VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise all launching new SOL products in recent days. Fidelity’s $FSOL recorded $2.07 million in day-one inflows, while total net inflows across all U.S. Solana ETFs have soared to $420.4 million. Meanwhile, November 18 marked the 15th consecutive day of positive ETF inflows, totaling $26.2 million, led by Bitwise’s BSOL. This reflects a deeper narrative: institutional investors see Solana’s long-term fundamentals, speed, developer activity, and staking yields as compelling despite short-term volatility. Key Levels: Can SOL Hold Above $130? Analysts now highlight $125 and $120 as the most critical support zones. A failure to defend $130 could accelerate losses toward $120, with a deeper floor at $115. Conversely, a reclaim of $145, and ideally $160, would signal the first meaningful reversal in weeks. For now, Solana sits at a crossroads. Heavy selling pressure on one side, surging institutional conviction on the other. The next few days may determine whether SOL stabilizes or slides deeper into bearish territory.

His latest commentary presents the view that the broader crypto environment has entered a structural shift, one where assumptions are no longer reliable indicators of future performance. Rather than relying on historical patterns, he argues that new drivers now shape the direction of leading assets. ETF Influence and XRP’s Position At the center of his analysis is the belief that multiple exchange-traded funds dedicated to a single cryptocurrency fundamentally alter how that asset behaves. According to the researcher, once an asset reaches that stage, it is no longer confined to Bitcoin’s movements or the influence of cyclical trends that once defined the entire industry. He emphasizes that ETFs rely on liquidity, activity, and market demand. Not on adherence to legacy expectations about Bitcoin’s dominance or the traditional four-year cycle. Ripple Bull Winkle presents XRP as an example of this evolving structure. He suggests that even in the event of a Bitcoin downturn, XRP’s performance could remain unaffected. The reasoning behind this outlook lies in the presence of institutional participation and regulatory clarity , which he views as the primary factors driving modern market behavior. THE BREAKAWAY MOMENT HAS BEGUN Bitcoin can fall into a full bear market… and XRP will still be completely fine. Because once an asset gets multiple ETFs, it stops living under Bitcoin’s shadow. ETFs follow liquidity, not tradition. The four-year cycle everyone… — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 17, 2025 A Shift Away from Uniform Market Behavior The comparison he draws to the stock market underscores his point. In his view, the market is moving toward a landscape in which cryptocurrencies operate as distinct asset classes with unique catalysts, investor profiles, and liquidity conditions. He notes that major companies in traditional markets do not move in unison simply because they exist within the same sector. He expects digital assets to adopt the pattern. By this logic, XRP’s trajectory does not need to align with Bitcoin’s trends. He states that the introduction of ETFs has changed the market’s script, ushering in an era in which Bitcoin’s dominance gradually weakens while assets supported by utility and liquidity assume clearer, independent price structures. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions and Perspectives The discussion prompted responses from community members who shared similar interpretations of this evolving market framework. One commenter stated that comparing Bitcoin and XRP is inappropriate due to their differing purposes, adding that XRP’s long-term utility positions it differently within the market. Another user noted that ETF-driven assets should not be expected to follow Bitcoin’s historical bull and bear cycles, suggesting that future price action may resemble traditional market behavior rather than the halving-based patterns observed in previous years. Ripple Bull Winkle frames this moment as the beginning of a new phase for digital assets. His view positions XRP among the assets moving into a more defined and independent market identity, shaped by institutional mechanisms and real-world demand rather than legacy cycles.

Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,150 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $3,050 and entered a bearish zone. The decline gathered pace below $3,000 and the price dipped below $2,950. A low was formed at $2,870 and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,165 swing high to the $2,870 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $3,050 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,165 swing high to the $2,870 low. The next key resistance is near the $3,100 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,100 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,150 level. A clear move above the $3,150 resistance might send the price toward the $3,200 resistance. An upside break above the $3,200 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,320 resistance zone or even $3,350 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,100 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,000 level. The first major support sits near the $2,940 zone. A clear move below the $2,940 support might push the price toward the $2,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,820 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,750 and $2,740. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

The preferred shares all trading at a discount to par likely limit Strategy's ability to use those products for continued BTC purchases. Worse than that, Strategy likely has about $80 million in cash and roughly $150 million in dividend obligations due before the end of the year. The market seems to be daring the company to sell Bitcoin. I suspect it will simply keep diluting the common instead. Shares of Strategy ( MSTR ) have been in freefall since early October . MSTR falling in price is not something that I'm particularly surprised by given the declines in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I've been stressing caution through my MSTR coverage on Seeking Alpha for well over a year. Perhaps more important than the MSTR declines, Strategy's preferred stocks ( STRK )( STRF )( STRD )( STRC ) are now also collapsing. This directly challenges my prior thinking, and in this update, I'll detail why I think the market has lost confidence in Strategy's Bitcoin flywheel. The Preferred Stocks Are Unraveling Strategy Stocks (Seeking Alpha) As of writing, each of Strategy's preferred stocks is down significantly during intraday trading. These stocks are down between 3% and 8%. For income investments, these are absolutely massive moves. In recent months, I've made the case for why I felt one of Strategy's income-based products could conceivably do well when Bitcoin's price went down. In reality, the opposite has been true, and I'm now forced to reassess my thinking. While I have not been bullish on either the STRK or STRD shares in the past, I have been bullish on the STRF shares. To be clear, I do still hold STRF shares. But I also see some serious problems that I think warrant trimming that position. First, STRD and STRK are now trading below IPO price. Beyond that, STRF has fallen below $100 per share for the first time since June and is currently at its lowest price level since May. What this means is that every single dollar-based preferred stock that Strategy offers is currently trading below par. Since MSTR shares are also trading at a sizable discount to mNAV, it puts Strategy in a very precarious position with limited options as the company's December dividend payment due date quickly approaches. The Problem For those who have followed either my work or the stock itself, this shouldn't be a surprise. Strategy does not actually generate positive income from operating its software business. We have to strip out gains or losses on digital assets that were purchased years prior to get a real assessment of the company's software business operations. On a trailing twelve-month basis, Strategy's adjusted operating loss is over $42 million: Millions Q3-24 Q4-24 Q1-25 Q2-25 Q3-25 Revenue $116.1 $120.7 $111.1 $114.5 $128.7 Cost of Revenue $34.3 $34.2 $34.0 $35.8 $38.0 SG&A $68.9 $72.4 $68.1 $70.2 $68.1 R&D $33.3 $25.7 $24.4 $24.1 $22.6 Operating Income -$20.4 -$11.6 -$15.4 -$15.6 $0.0 Source: Seeking Alpha The only reason Strategy has been able to buy Bitcoin to the degree that it has is due to the company's ability to raise capital through various instruments, including convertible notes, preferred stocks, and good old-fashioned common stock dilution. Raising money to buy BTC was easy when MSTR traded at a significant premium to mNAV. BTC buys vs MSTR mNAV (Strategy & BitcoinTreasuries, Analyst's Chart) That is no longer the case, and we can see in the chart above how weekly acquisitions have fallen in line with MSTR mNAV compression. Anecdotally, it is quite obvious that MSTR shareholder appetite for more dilution of the common is virtually gone, judging by sentiment online. But it's important to keep in mind that 89% of the Bitcoin purchase capital raised since preferred stock ATMs launched in March has actually come from the common ATM. Strategy can just switch to issuing more preferred stock through ATMs then? Maybe not, actually. To illustrate why, let's look at one of Strategy's recent Bitcoin acquisition filings: November 10th Filing (Strategy) I've crudely circled the nominal value versus net proceeds for each of the four preferred ATM raises during the week of November 3rd. Strategy was really only able to utilize STRF and STRC because those were the two products that it could use to generate greater proceeds from the stock issuance than the nominal value of the obligation it was creating. That was not the case for STRK or STRD, which is why those raises were so much smaller by comparison. The point is, Strategy does not want to issue $6.4 million in preferred stocks to generate just $5.5 million in proceeds. It would much rather do the opposite. Now it can't. At the end of September, Strategy had $54.3 million in cash and equivalents. Since then, the company has raised about $318 million through its ATM programs and purchased almost $292 million in BTC with that capital. That leaves, at best, $80 million or so in cash to pay out nearly $150 million in dividend obligations before the end of the year. Preferred Class Shares Dividend/Shr Divis Due EOY STRK (Due Dec) 13,974,912 $2.00 $27,949,824 STRF (Due Dec) 12,676,383 $2.50 $31,690,958 STRD (Due Dec) 12,344,308 $3.06 $37,724,205 STRC (Due Nov+Dec) 29,587,063 $0.88 $51,777,360 Total Dividends Due by EOY $149,142,347 Source: Strategy, Analyst's Calculations, estimated dividend payments To be sure, Strategy could simply not pay the STRD dividends in December, though I suspect doing so would irreparably damage the company's ability to continue raising capital should it wish to continue doing so in the future. But even if it doesn't pay STRD shareholders in December, the company would still have a dividend shortfall through the other three products. Strategy's Next Move There are a variety of ways Executive Chairman Michael Saylor and company could play the precarious situation that Strategy now finds itself in. But I think these three are the most straight forward: Keep raising capital through preferred stocks Sell Bitcoin to pay dividends Continue diluting common stock holders I think option 1 is unlikely due to what I just laid out in the section above. Strategy cannot tap the preferred ATMs while all four of them are under par without severely damaging trust in his income products, in my opinion. However, if STRF recovers from current levels and retakes par, we could see Strategy begin to lean on that instrument a bit more despite its relatively small ATM. Option 2 is also unlikely because it goes counter to what Saylor has been saying for years. The time to sell BTC to pay the dividends was a month ago when Bitcoin was well over $110 per coin. Given the weakness in the market, Strategy selling BTC could trigger a deeper cascade lower in the asset. Which would result in bigger problems for the company. Option 3 seems like the easiest 'kick the can down the road' path. Thus, it seems to me to be the most likely. Closing Summary Again, I have to stress that Strategy had already been heavily relying on MSTR dilution to fund purchases to this point. Given the market dynamics currently on display in the preferred stocks, Strategy's ability to raise through its income products going forward is likely minimal. Frankly, I think the market is actually daring the company to sell Bitcoin to pay its preferred obligations in December. Furthermore, at a basic mNAV of 0.9, one could argue it behooves the company to sell Bitcoin to buy back its common stock to close its own mNAV discount. While I highly doubt buying back MSTR is something the company is considering doing, I have to imagine there is at least some internal discussion about buying back some of the preferred stocks while they're under par to minimize the company's perpetual dividend obligations. I could certainly be wrong for being bullish on STRF earlier this year. But I don't think I'm going to be wrong on continuing to avoid MSTR.",MSTR|STRF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-20 03:10:13

In an X post on Thursday, the WLFI team said some wallets were breached before the platform went live, either through phishing attacks or exposed seed phrases. It said that the incident did not stem from flaws in WLFI’s own platform or smart contracts, and blamed third-party security lapses that allowed attackers to take control of private wallets. The project said it responded by freezing affected wallets in September and verifying ownership. WLFI Rolls Out KYC Checks And New Wallet Process To Secure User Funds Users who reported compromise were asked to complete fresh know-your-customer (KYC) checks and submit new wallet addresses, so funds could be moved to safer accounts. 1/ Prior to WLFI’s launch, a relatively small subset of user wallets were compromised via phishing attacks or exposed seed phrases. Since then, we’ve tested new smart contract logic to safely reallocate user funds and verified users’ identity via KYC checks. Shortly, users who… — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) November 19, 2025 In parallel, engineers built and tested new smart contract logic to handle bulk reallocations. The team said reallocations will now begin for users who opened support tickets and passed the required verification steps, while wallets linked to users who have not yet engaged will remain frozen. Those users can still start the process through the help centre. WLFI framed the slow rollout as deliberate, saying it chose to prioritise the safety of funds over speed, even though the root cause lay outside its own systems. The message aimed to reassure holders who saw wallets locked for weeks while the team designed and tested the migration process. WLFI Trading Exploded On Binance With Nearly $1B Volume In First Hour The security issue arrives only weeks after WLFI’s high-profile debut. World Liberty Financial launched its WLFI token on Sept. 1, following teasers earlier in 2024. Trading began on decentralized venues with sharp swings, including a drop of more than 15% on launch day . Momentum then shifted to major exchanges. Trading volumes surged on Binance and elsewhere, with about $1b worth of tokens changing hands in the first hour, according to CoinMarketCap. Prices moved between $0.24 and $0.30, roughly in line with futures pricing ahead of the listing. At the top of that range, the Trump family’s stake, reported as 22.5b tokens out of a 100b supply, carried a paper value of more than $6b , making WLFI its single largest asset, the Wall Street Journal reported. The run-up gave the project instant visibility across both political and crypto circles. WLFI Stake Drops To $3.15B As Token Trades Well Below Launch Levels Market conditions have since cooled. As of Nov. 20, the family’s WLFI holdings are worth about $3.15b on paper, based on a token price of $0.13 and the same 22.5b token stake. These are locked governance tokens that confer voting rights and a share of revenue from presales, estimated at $400m to $500m realized so far, rather than full economic claims on the business. Phishing links, fake support channels and poor key storage remain the weakest points in consumer-facing crypto, even on projects with high visibility and substantial resources.

FIGR's Q3 revenue surged 55% year-over-year to $156.4 million, far exceeding Wall Street expectations, driven by ecosystem and technology fees. The company boasts >50% adjusted EBITDA margins, rapid loan origination growth, and a successful new crypto exchange product launched in August 2024. Reiterating a buy rating, I recommend using near-term dips as buying opportunities given FIGR's profitability and long-term market potential. Amid the sharp correction in the stock market from recent highs, crypto assets are also facing a correlated reckoning, with Bitcoin now sitting stubbornly under $100k. The sharp and highly visible crash in the world's largest crypto asset has also taken down a number of very attractive stocks in the blockchain space, like Circle ( CRCL ) and Figure ( FIGR ), which have little to do with crypto speculation and enjoy long-term secular tailwinds from the blockchain's capacity to dramatically improve our payments infrastructure. Figure, in particular, just reported its first earnings quarter since going public in September at $25 per share. Though Figure is up from post-IPO levels, the stock is down about 25% from highs above $49 reached in August, technically putting the stock in a bear market. In my view, it's a great time for investors who are unfamiliar with this name to take a look at this stock with fresh eyes. Data by YCharts I last wrote a buy article on Figure in September, shortly after the IPO, when Figure was trading in the mid $30s. Since then, I've gained on my position, but a number of positive fundamental factors have also moved in Figure's favor. Its recently opened exchange product is delivering substantial revenue growth, and may actually benefit from recent crypto market volatility. Meanwhile, its core loan origination product is also showcasing rapid growth, while diversifying Figure away from its original base of HELOC loans. And perhaps most importantly, Figure is minting incredible adjusted EBITDA profits, which make the stock's slide more irresistible. I'm reiterating my buy rating here. As a reminder for investors who are newer to Figure, here is what I consider to be the core bull case drivers for the stock in the long haul: Figure is a vast improvement over existing lending infrastructure. Per the company's own estimates, the company provides 93% savings versus the cost to originate a traditional loan, and an 80% reduction in due diligence costs for securitizing collateralized products. Transactional and recurring revenue. The company's core lending products earn an upfront 3% origination fee on all loans originated through the Figure platform, while the company also earns traditional mortgage servicing revenue for all the debt under its administration. Figure Exchange opportunity. The company launched its own crypto trading exchange in August 2024, which is driving substantial revenue growth for the company. Stablecoin issuer. The company also offers a regulated, yield-bearing stablecoin (YLDS), which can benefit from continued interest in holding digital assets that serve as a means of payment and don't fluctuate in value. Unlike rival Circle ( CRCL ), which sponsors the much larger USDC coin, net interest income is just a small slice of Figure's overall revenue, meaning that Figure won't be hugely impacted if the Fed keeps cutting short-term rates. Already immensely profitable. Though Figure is still in the early stages of addressing what it believes to be a $2 trillion market opportunity in lending and $4 trillion in crypto and digital assets, the company is already generating a >50% adjusted EBITDA margin. Stay long here and use any near-term dips as a buying opportunity. Q3 download In mid-November, Figure released Q3 results, which were the first earnings results since the company went public in September. Though the stock is down since the print, the big beat to consensus expectations is a strong indicator of positive sentiment for the stock going forward. The Q3 earnings summary is shown below: Figure Q3 results (Figure Q3 earnings deck) Figure's revenue grew 55% y/y to $156.4 million, absolutely crushing Wall Street's expectations of $119.5 million (+18% y/y) by a massive margin. Of course, Figure is a very complex business with multiple income streams, so we need to take it piece by piece. The top contributor to growth is the company's ""ecosystem and technology fees"", which grew about ~5x y/y to $35.7 million, or 23% of the company's total. This was driven by the launch of Figure Exchange, which only had a small and partial-quarter contribution in Q3 of last year. We do expect this revenue line to decelerate in Q4 and beyond as Figure starts to comp last year's launch against full-quarter contributions. Still, we think Figure Exchange's broadening selection of cryptocurrencies as well as increasing interest in Bitcoin, especially given recent volatility, are all positive indicators for Figure. As a side note here: though Figure doesn't provide monthly metrics, many other exchanges do, giving us possible insight into how crypto market trading activity is moving past the close of Q3. Robinhood (HOOD) recently released trading activity for the completed month of October, which indicates that nominal crypto trading volumes on the Robinhood app (excluding the recent purchase of Bitstamp) rose 49% y/y to $13.9 billion, and nominally higher than September: which is a strong indication that we should expect Figure to have healthy trading revenue in Q4. Robinhood October trading activity (Robinhood October metrics release) Meanwhile, in the company's core lending arm, loan origination fees grew 13% y/y to $21.4 million, and servicing fees grew 22% y/y to $7.9 million. The company notes in the chart below that its total consumer loan volume grew 70% y/y to $2.47 billion in originations in Q3, which was driven by additional patents in the network and a broadening scope beyond HELOC loans. Figure key metrics (Figure Q3 earnings deck) The company notes that partners are increasingly turning to Figure to help originate first-lien loans, and not just HELOCs. Per CEO Michael Tannenbaum's remarks on the Q3 earnings call: Total consumer loan marketplace volume reached almost $2.5 billion in the third quarter, representing a 70% increase year-over-year. This growth reflects continued expansion across our origination partner network and increased utilization of Figure Connect for liquidity. As more partners leverage the platform to fund and sell loans, we're seeing meaningful gains in both scale and efficiency. A standout example being first lien lending, where adoption has accelerated sharply among both new and existing partners. Firstly, volumes nearly tripled year-over-year, making it one of our fastest-growing products this quarter. Partners are leaning into Figure Connect as a liquidity solution, enabling faster funding, improved execution and lower cost versus traditional channels."" We note that interest income also supplemented Figure's results, with interest growing 40% y/y to $17.9 million (11% of company revenue) despite compression in interest rates, thanks to growing issuance of YLDS. We note here that Figure has a nice counterweight and hedge against interest rates: if rates go up, Figure will see better net interest spreads, but if rates come down as they are highly expected to do, Figure should benefit from greater loan origination activity that will help to offset softer net interest spreads. Figure is also showcasing immense profitability chops. Adjusted EBITDA, as shown in the chart below, jumped 75% y/y to $86.4 million, reflecting a 55.4% margin that improved 10 points y/y: Figure adjusted EBITDA bridge (Figure Q3 earnings deck) Valuation and key takeaways At current post-earnings share prices near $37, Figure trades at an $8.22 billion market cap. Netting off the $1.79 billion of cash, restricted cash, loans held for immediate sale and investments on Figure's balance sheet against $466 million of debt gives the company an enterprise value of $6.90 billion. For next year, FY26, Wall Street analysts peg Figure's revenue at $604.6 million, or 24% y/y growth. If we conservatively assume a 48% adjusted EBITDA margin against that revenue profile (flat to YTD 2025 actuals, and lower than the 55% margin that Figure notched in Q3, given that Q2-Q3 tend to be seasonal peaks for loan originations), adjusted EBITDA would be $290 million.

The Bitcoin Layer 2 project BOB has just unveiled its token distribution plan, and the numbers are turning heads across the cryptocurrency community. With nearly half of the total supply dedicated to ecosystem growth and community development, this approach represents a significant shift in how blockchain projects value their supporters. What Makes BOB Tokenomics So Special? The BOB tokenomics model stands out for its community-first approach. The project will release 10 billion tokens total, with a massive 44.76% allocated directly to the ecosystem and community. This substantial allocation demonstrates the team’s commitment to building a truly decentralized network where users have real ownership and influence. Why does this matter? Traditional crypto projects often reserve the lion’s share for insiders and early investors. However, BOB tokenomics flips this model by prioritizing long-term community growth over short-term profits. This strategic decision could potentially create stronger network effects and more sustainable development. Breaking Down the BOB Token Distribution Let’s examine the complete BOB tokenomics breakdown in detail: Ecosystem and Community : 44.76% (4.476 billion tokens) Early Backers : 20.09% (2.009 billion tokens) Core Contributors : 19% (1.9 billion tokens) Foundation : 10% (1 billion tokens) Initial Claims : 4.15% (415 million tokens) Community Sale : 2% (200 million tokens) This transparent BOB tokenomics structure ensures that no single group dominates the network. The careful balancing act between different stakeholders creates a healthy distribution that supports both initial development and long-term sustainability. How Will the Community Allocation Work? The massive 44.76% community allocation in BOB tokenomics serves multiple purposes. This portion will likely fund various initiatives including: Community governance programs Ecosystem development grants User rewards and incentives Network security enhancements Educational initiatives This approach to BOB tokenomics ensures that the community has both the resources and the influence to shape the project’s future direction. It represents a fundamental shift from traditional corporate structures to truly decentralized community governance. What Challenges Might This BOB Tokenomics Model Face? While the BOB tokenomics model appears promising, it’s not without potential challenges. Managing such a large community allocation requires sophisticated governance mechanisms and transparent decision-making processes. The project must ensure that these tokens are distributed fairly and used effectively to benefit the entire ecosystem. Moreover, the success of this BOB tokenomics approach depends heavily on community engagement and participation. Without active involvement from token holders, even the most generous allocation could fail to achieve its intended purpose of creating a vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystem. Why This BOB Tokenomics Approach Matters for Bitcoin Layer 2 The innovative BOB tokenomics model could set a new standard for Bitcoin Layer 2 projects. By prioritizing community ownership and ecosystem development, BOB demonstrates how Layer 2 solutions can build sustainable networks that complement Bitcoin’s security and decentralization principles. This forward-thinking BOB tokenomics strategy aligns perfectly with the core values of the Bitcoin ecosystem while introducing modern token distribution mechanisms that reward participation and contribution. It represents a bridge between Bitcoin’s proven security model and innovative token economic designs. Conclusion: A New Era in Token Distribution The revolutionary BOB tokenomics model marks a significant step forward in how cryptocurrency projects approach community building and token distribution. With 44.76% of tokens dedicated to ecosystem and community growth, BOB sets a powerful precedent for future Bitcoin Layer 2 projects. This community-centric approach not only rewards early supporters but also creates a foundation for long-term, sustainable growth that benefits all participants in the ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What is the total supply of BOB tokens? The total supply is 10 billion BOB tokens, with detailed allocations across six different categories including ecosystem, community, and core contributors. How does the 44.76% community allocation compare to other projects? This allocation is significantly higher than many traditional crypto projects, demonstrating BOB’s strong commitment to community-led growth and decentralized governance. When will the community sale occur? Specific dates for the community sale haven’t been announced yet, but the allocation represents 2% of the total supply for this purpose. What benefits do community token holders receive? Community token holders can participate in governance, earn rewards, and help shape the project’s future direction through various ecosystem initiatives. How does BOB’s tokenomics support the Bitcoin ecosystem? As a Bitcoin Layer 2 project, BOB’s tokenomics are designed to complement Bitcoin’s security while enabling new functionality and community participation. What mechanisms ensure fair distribution of community tokens? While specific mechanisms haven’t been detailed, the foundation allocation and structured distribution suggest careful planning for fair and transparent token distribution.

Massive crypto liquidations totaling $464 million swept through perpetual futures markets, with Ethereum taking the hardest hit. This dramatic event highlights the extreme volatility that continues to define digital asset trading. What Triggered These Massive Crypto Liquidations? When prices move rapidly against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close trades to prevent further losses. This process creates a cascade effect that amplifies market moves. The recent crypto liquidations demonstrate how quickly conditions can change in digital asset markets. Ethereum bore the brunt of this storm with $222 million in forced position closures. Surprisingly, 87% of these ETH liquidations were long positions, indicating most traders were betting on price increases before the downturn hit. How Did Major Cryptocurrencies Fare? The crypto liquidations distribution reveals important market patterns: Ethereum (ETH) : $222 million liquidated, 87.03% long positions Bitcoin (BTC) : $170 million liquidated, 74.97% long positions Zcash (ZEC) : $72.62 million liquidated, 94.99% short positions This data shows that most traders were positioned for upward moves in major assets like Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, Zcash presented a different story where the vast majority of liquidations affected short sellers. Why Do Crypto Liquidations Matter to Traders? Understanding crypto liquidations is crucial for risk management. These forced closures can create domino effects that push prices even lower. When long positions get liquidated, it often means selling pressure increases, potentially triggering more liquidations. The scale of recent crypto liquidations serves as a stark reminder about leverage risks. Traders using high leverage become vulnerable to sudden price swings that can wipe out their positions in minutes. What Can We Learn From This Volatility? Market events like these crypto liquidations provide valuable lessons. First, they emphasize the importance of proper position sizing and risk management. Second, they show how sentiment can shift rapidly in cryptocurrency markets. The concentration of crypto liquidations in long positions suggests many traders were caught off guard by the price movement. This pattern often occurs when market sentiment becomes overly optimistic without fundamental support. How to Protect Yourself From Future Liquidations Surviving periods of heavy crypto liquidations requires strategic planning: Use conservative leverage ratios Set stop-loss orders appropriately Diversify across different assets Monitor market conditions regularly Maintain adequate margin buffers These crypto liquidations demonstrate that even experienced traders can get caught in sudden market moves. Therefore, preparation remains your best defense against unexpected volatility. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Liquidation Landscape The recent $464 million in crypto liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of market risks. While Ethereum led this particular downturn, the phenomenon affects the entire digital asset ecosystem. Understanding these mechanisms helps traders make informed decisions and manage exposure effectively. As cryptocurrency markets mature, we may see reduced volatility over time. However, for now, crypto liquidations remain an integral part of the trading landscape that demands respect and careful navigation. Frequently Asked Questions What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close leveraged positions that have lost too much value, preventing further losses beyond a trader’s initial margin. Why did Ethereum have the highest liquidation volume? Ethereum likely had the highest liquidation volume due to its large market capitalization, high trading volume, and significant leverage usage by traders betting on price movements. How can I avoid getting liquidated? You can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, setting appropriate stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and closely monitoring your positions during volatile periods. Do liquidations always make prices drop further? While long position liquidations typically create selling pressure that pushes prices lower, short position liquidations can have the opposite effect by forcing buybacks. How often do large liquidation events occur? Significant liquidation events tend to happen during periods of high volatility, which can occur multiple times per year depending on market conditions and catalyst events. Are liquidations bad for the cryptocurrency market? While liquidations cause short-term pain for affected traders, they help maintain market stability by preventing uncontrolled losses and excessive leverage buildup in the system.

The Bitcoin options market is flashing warning signs that every trader should understand. According to Glassnode’s latest analysis, bearish sentiment is taking hold as implied volatility approaches levels not seen since the October 10 mass liquidation event. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Options Market Shift? The current Bitcoin options market reflects growing concern among traders. When Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90,000, implied volatility surged dramatically. This spike was particularly noticeable in short-term contracts, indicating heightened sensitivity to immediate risks. Glassnode identifies two key factors behind this volatility expansion: Increased demand for downside protection through put options Unwinding of short gamma positions that suffer during volatility spikes Why Are Put Options Trading at a Premium? The most telling signal from the Bitcoin options market comes from put option pricing. Currently, one-week put options trade at approximately 14% premium over calls. This means traders are willing to pay significantly more for protection against potential price declines. This premium indicates several market realities: Traders anticipate potential downside movement Hedging activity has increased substantially Market participants are preparing for volatility How Does Implied Volatility Impact Your Trading Strategy? Implied volatility serves as the market’s fear gauge. When IV rises in the Bitcoin options market, it signals uncertainty and potential price swings. The current levels mirror those seen during significant correction periods, suggesting traders should exercise caution. Consider these implications for your trading approach: Option premiums become more expensive during high IV periods Hedging strategies may require larger capital allocations Risk management becomes increasingly important What Can We Learn from Current Market Positioning? The Bitcoin options market provides valuable insights into trader sentiment and potential price direction. The current put premium suggests that experienced traders are positioning for possible declines. However, remember that options markets can sometimes act as contrarian indicators when extremes are reached. Key takeaways for informed decision-making: Monitor IV levels for timing entries and exits Consider the cost of protection in your risk calculations Watch for sentiment shifts that might signal reversal opportunities Navigating the Current Bitcoin Options Market Environment Understanding the dynamics of the Bitcoin options market helps traders make better decisions. The current bearish positioning doesn’t guarantee downward movement, but it does highlight market concerns. Successful traders use this information to adjust their strategies rather than following the crowd. Remember these principles when analyzing options data: Options markets often anticipate moves before spot markets Extreme positioning can sometimes precede reversals Always combine options data with other technical and fundamental analysis FAQs: Bitcoin Options Market Questions Answered What does put option premium indicate? When put options trade at a premium, it shows traders are willing to pay more for downside protection, indicating bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin options market. How does implied volatility affect option prices? Higher implied volatility increases option premiums because it suggests larger expected price moves, making both puts and calls more expensive. Why are short-term contracts more volatile? Short-term options in the Bitcoin options market react faster to price movements and news events, making them more sensitive to immediate market conditions. What is gamma positioning? Gamma measures how quickly an option’s delta changes as the underlying price moves. Short gamma positions lose money during volatility expansions. Can options data predict Bitcoin price direction? While the Bitcoin options market provides sentiment indicators, it shouldn’t be used alone for price predictions. Combine it with other analysis methods. How often should I monitor options market data? Regular monitoring of the Bitcoin options market helps identify sentiment shifts, but avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Ripple is exploring exactly that possibility with a groundbreaking proposal to introduce XRP staking to the XRP Ledger. This potential development could fundamentally change how users interact with one of cryptocurrency’s most established networks. What Exactly is XRP Staking and Why Does It Matter? XRP staking represents a potential evolution in how the XRP Ledger operates. Currently, XRP holders cannot earn rewards through traditional staking mechanisms like other cryptocurrencies. However, Ripple’s engineering team, led by J. Ayo Akinyele, is actively discussing how to implement this feature. The proposed XRP staking system would allow token holders to participate in network security while earning rewards. This approach aligns with growing demand for passive income opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. Moreover, it could significantly enhance XRP’s utility within the decentralized finance ecosystem. How Would XRP Staking Benefit the Network? Implementing XRP staking offers multiple advantages for both the network and its participants. First, it creates stronger incentives for long-term holding. Second, it enhances network security by rewarding users who help maintain consensus. Enhanced network security through increased participation Passive income opportunities for XRP holders Improved decentralization of the XRP Ledger Stronger DeFi integration capabilities Therefore, the introduction of XRP staking could address several key challenges facing the network while opening new possibilities for growth. What Challenges Might Ripple Face with XRP Staking Implementation? While the benefits are compelling, implementing XRP staking presents technical and regulatory considerations.

However, the engineering team appears confident they can navigate these challenges successfully. Their approach focuses on maintaining the network’s efficiency while adding staking capabilities. How Could XRP Staking Transform the Cryptocurrency Landscape? The potential introduction of XRP staking represents more than just a feature update—it signals Ripple’s commitment to evolving with market demands. As decentralized finance continues growing, staking capabilities become increasingly valuable. This move could position XRP more competitively against other major cryptocurrencies that already offer staking. Furthermore, it demonstrates Ripple’s proactive approach to enhancing token utility beyond payment functionality. What Does This Mean for Current XRP Holders? For existing XRP investors, the staking proposal offers exciting possibilities. It provides a pathway to generate returns beyond price appreciation. Additionally, it strengthens the fundamental value proposition of holding XRP long-term. New revenue streams without selling tokens Enhanced network participation opportunities Increased token utility and demand drivers Stronger community engagement through active involvement Consequently, the XRP staking feature could fundamentally reshape investment strategies for XRP enthusiasts. Frequently Asked Questions About XRP Staking When will XRP staking become available? No official timeline exists yet. Ripple is currently in discussion and research phases regarding XRP staking implementation. How would XRP staking work technically? While details remain unclear, it would likely involve validating transactions and maintaining network consensus in exchange for rewards. Will XRP staking affect transaction speed?

Dogecoin CBD Points To $0.08 As Strongest Support In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin support is looking from the perspective of the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). The CBD is an indicator created by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode that tells us about the amount of DOGE supply that was last purchased or transacted at the various price levels that the coin has visited in its history. Generally, investors are sensitive to retests of their cost basis and can be prone to showing some kind of reaction during one. The more holders that have their cost basis at the same level, the larger the market reaction upon a retest. Thus, the levels that the CBD identifies as being dense with supply could potentially be significant ones for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Panic: 65,200 BTC Sent To Exchanges At Loss Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Dogecoin CBD over the past couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, a major Dogecoin cost basis level is located around $0.20, hosting the break-even level of 12.1 billion DOGE. The latest bearish momentum, however, has meant that the memecoin has plunged under this mark, putting all these investors into a state of loss. Underwater holders may look forward to a retest of their cost basis so that they can exit with their entire investment back. This can make large supply zones above the asset’s price potential resistance barriers. Considering that the $0.20 level is so huge, it’s possible that DOGE may find notable impedance at it, should a retest take place in the near future. In the scenario that Dogecoin continues to decline, it might have to find support at a major cost basis center below. Such investors who were in profit prior to the retest may decide to buy more at their break-even level, thinking it to be a profitable entry point to accumulate more. From the chart, it’s visible that at the levels below, there aren’t any large cost basis zones until all the way down to $0.08, implying support may be thin for the asset. Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin Now In “Good Buy Zone,” Says Analytics Firm The $0.08 level, though, is extraordinary in the amount of supply that it hosts the acquisition point of: 27.4 billion DOGE. The analyst has noted that this makes the line DOGE’s “most significant support level.” It now remains to be seen how Dogecoin will develop in the near term and whether a retest of one of the big cost basis centers will take place. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.158, down 10% over the last week.

54638417,630667,1763611240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54638417.jpeg,XRP Long-Term Holders Shift From Euphoria to Anxiety as NUPL Signals Trouble,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-long-term-holder-shift-from-euphoria-to-anxiety/,"XRP is under heavy selling pressure as fear spreads across the crypto market, pushing sentiment into one of its most fragile stages of the cycle. What was once a euphoric rally earlier this year has steadily shifted into denial among long-term holders — and now anxiety is beginning to dominate. With XRP flirting dangerously with a drop below the $2 mark, investors are watching closely, aware that this level carries major psychological and structural weight. For now, XRP has managed to hold above $2, but the defense of this threshold is becoming increasingly difficult as liquidity thins and macro uncertainty intensifies. A break below this zone could trigger a deeper reset, while a successful rebound would reinforce it as a key long-term demand area. This shift in sentiment is also reflected in on-chain metrics : long-term holders, previously sitting comfortably in profit, are now watching their unrealized gains compress. Historically, transitions from euphoria to denial and into anxiety have often preceded major market inflection points, making the current moment especially significant. XRP NUPL Signals Growing Market Anxiety Analyst Ali Martinez shared new data showing that XRP’s Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) has now dropped below 0.5 — a level that historically marks a transition from confidence to growing anxiety among holders. NUPL measures the difference between the total unrealized profit and loss in the network, helping identify where investors stand emotionally within the market cycle. When NUPL is above 0.5, it typically reflects optimism or belief, often associated with rising prices and strong conviction. But when it falls below 0.5, sentiment weakens, indicating that investors are no longer comfortably in profit. XRP dipping below this threshold means a significant portion of the market is losing confidence as unrealized gains shrink. Investors who were previously sitting on sizable profits are now seeing those margins erode, pushing them into a more defensive psychological state. Historically, this signals that the market is shifting toward anxiety — a stage where many holders begin doubting whether upside momentum will return. This decline in NUPL aligns with XRP’s current price behavior near the $2 support level, emphasizing how fragile the market has become. While anxiety can fuel panic selling, it has also marked the beginning of long-term accumulation phases in past cycles. The next move for XRP may depend on whether fear intensifies — or whether strong hands step in to absorb supply. Testing Critical Support as Selling Pressure Deepens XRP continues to trade under heavy selling pressure, with the chart showing a clear series of lower highs and persistent failures to reclaim key moving averages. The price is now hovering near $2.14, testing a crucial support zone that has repeatedly acted as a psychological and structural level for buyers throughout the year. Each attempt to break above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages has been met with rejection, signaling that momentum remains firmly on the side of the sellers. Volume has gradually increased during recent downswings, suggesting that the sell-offs are driven more by capitulation than simple profit-taking. The sharp decline toward $1.20 in October still stands out as a sign of extreme volatility and liquidity stress, and although XRP quickly recovered from that anomaly, it highlighted how fragile the market structure had become. Since then, price has failed to establish a sustained uptrend, instead forming a tighter and more compressed consolidation beneath the major moving averages. If the $2 support level breaks decisively, XRP could revisit deeper liquidity pockets around $1.75–$1.90, where buyers previously stepped in during September. However, holding above $2 would keep the possibility of a recovery alive, especially if market sentiment stabilizes.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $77.09 million in net inflows on November 19th, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. This surprising reversal comes at a crucial time for digital asset investors seeking stability and growth opportunities. What Drove This Bitcoin ETFs Inflow Surge? The recent inflow data reveals fascinating patterns about institutional behavior. BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with an impressive $62.23 million inflow, demonstrating strong confidence from major players. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Mini BTC followed closely with $53.84 million, showing diversified interest across different Bitcoin ETFs products. However, the picture wasn’t uniformly positive. Fidelity’s FBTC experienced $21.35 million in outflows, while VanEck’s HODL saw $17.63 million leave. This mixed performance highlights how investors are carefully selecting their Bitcoin ETFs exposure rather than making blanket decisions. Why Should Investors Care About Bitcoin ETFs Movements? Tracking Bitcoin ETFs flows provides crucial insights into institutional sentiment. These investment vehicles have become barometers for professional money managers’ views on cryptocurrency. When Bitcoin ETFs see consistent inflows, it typically indicates: Growing institutional confidence in digital assets Increased mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency Potential price support for Bitcoin markets Enhanced market liquidity and stability How Do Bitcoin ETFs Impact Broader Crypto Markets? The relationship between Bitcoin ETFs and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem is increasingly important. Significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs often precede positive momentum across digital assets. This occurs because institutional money flowing into regulated Bitcoin ETFs products creates a foundation of stability that benefits the entire market. Moreover, the end of the five-day outflow streak suggests that professional investors might be seeing current price levels as attractive entry points. This could signal a broader market recovery ahead, making Bitcoin ETFs a key indicator to watch. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs Investors? Looking forward, several factors could influence Bitcoin ETFs performance. Regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and Bitcoin’s inherent volatility will continue to play significant roles. However, the recent inflow reversal demonstrates the resilience of institutional interest in cryptocurrency through regulated Bitcoin ETFs channels. For investors considering Bitcoin ETFs, this data provides valuable context. The mixed flows among different providers suggest that due diligence remains essential when selecting specific Bitcoin ETFs products for your portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track Bitcoin’s price, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly holding cryptocurrency. Why did Bitcoin ETFs see outflows for five days? Market volatility, profit-taking, and macroeconomic concerns typically drive short-term outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. How significant is $77 million for Bitcoin ETFs? While not massive in isolation, breaking a five-day outflow streak signals important sentiment shifts among institutional investors. Should I invest in Bitcoin ETFs now? Investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and portfolio strategy, though the recent inflow reversal suggests renewed institutional interest. Which Bitcoin ETFs performed best? BlackRock’s IBIT led with $62.23 million inflows, followed by Grayscale’s Mini BTC with $53.84 million. How often do Bitcoin ETFs flow data update?

Technical Signals Show Change in Momentum Analyst Ali Martinez reported a bullish divergence between ADA’s price and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The price has continued to post lower lows, but the RSI is rising. This divergence may reflect a loss of selling strength. A TD Sequential “9” buy signal has also appeared on the daily chart. These setups are often monitored for early trend shifts. Martinez commented, “ A rebound is coming! ” as long as the divergence remains intact. In addition, ADA is trading slightly below its 4-hour 9-period simple moving average (SMA), which stands at $0.47. The asset has moved sideways since mid-November, narrowing its range. This shows that momentum remains weak but stable. Source: TradingView The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and the histogram has reversed to positive. Though the signal is still forming, it implies that the latest sell-off might be losing its strength. On-Chain Flows Remain Negative Recent on-chain data shows continued outflows from spot exchanges. On November 19, net outflows totaled $1.80 million, according to CoinGlass. Traders appear to be withdrawing ADA from exchanges, possibly for long-term holding. Source: CoinGlass Despite these outflows, ADA’s price has continued to fall. This trend points to weak demand, with buyers not stepping in despite the lower available supply. Outflows alone have not supported a recovery in price. Sentiment and Whale Activity Remain Mixed Platform data from Market Prophit shows that public sentiment toward ADA is currently negative, while its internal model indicates a bullish outlook. This reflects a split view across participants.

This persistent trend raises important questions about investor sentiment toward Ethereum-based investment products and their future trajectory in the digital asset space. Why Are ETH ETFs Experiencing Continuous Outflows? The consistent withdrawal pattern from ETH ETFs suggests investors are reevaluating their positions in Ethereum-focused funds. Market analysts point to several potential factors driving this trend, including regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and shifting investment strategies. The seven-day outflow streak represents one of the longest continuous withdrawal periods for cryptocurrency ETFs this year. Data compiled by TraderT reveals the depth of this investor retreat. The outflows aren’t isolated to a single fund but represent a broader market sentiment affecting multiple ETH ETF providers simultaneously. This pattern indicates systemic concerns rather than issues specific to individual fund management. Which ETH ETFs Are Leading the Outflow Trend? The outflow distribution reveals significant concentration among major players: BlackRock’s ETHA led the exodus with $26.14 million in withdrawals Grayscale’s ETHE followed with $15.69 million exiting the fund Invesco’s QETH stood alone with $2.93 million in net inflows All other ETH ETFs reported no net changes in flows This distribution pattern highlights how even established financial giants like BlackRock aren’t immune to the current market sentiment affecting ETH ETFs. The concentration of outflows in these major funds suggests institutional investors might be driving this trend. What Does This Mean for ETH ETF Investors? For current and prospective ETH ETF investors, this seven-day outflow streak serves as a crucial market indicator. The persistent withdrawals could signal several market dynamics at play. However, it’s essential to consider this within the broader context of cryptocurrency market cycles and institutional adoption patterns. Investment professionals recommend monitoring these key aspects when evaluating ETH ETFs during outflow periods: Long-term adoption trends versus short-term market movements Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency funds Overall market liquidity and trading volumes Comparative performance against other digital asset classes Is There Hope for ETH ETFs Recovery? Despite the concerning outflow trend, some positive signals emerged from the November 19 data. Invesco’s QETH managed to attract $2.93 million in net inflows, demonstrating that not all investors are abandoning ETH ETFs. This divergence in performance among different funds suggests that specific fund characteristics and management strategies might influence investor decisions. The current situation with ETH ETFs reflects the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investments. While short-term outflows create headlines, the fundamental value proposition of Ethereum and its ecosystem continues to develop. Institutional interest in blockchain technology and decentralized applications remains strong, potentially supporting future recovery for ETH ETFs. Key Takeaways from the ETH ETFs Outflow Data The seventh consecutive day of outflows from ETH ETFs presents both challenges and opportunities for market participants. The $38.9 million withdrawal on November 19, combined with the preceding six days of outflows, creates a significant pattern that demands attention from investors and analysts alike. However, market veterans understand that cryptocurrency investments often move in cycles. The current outflow trend from ETH ETFs might represent a temporary adjustment rather than a long-term shift in investor sentiment. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the role of ETH ETFs in portfolio diversification and institutional access remains fundamentally important. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the ETH ETFs outflows? The outflows likely resulted from combined factors including market volatility, regulatory concerns, and portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors. How long has this outflow trend been happening? The November 19 outflow marked the seventh consecutive trading day of net withdrawals from ETH ETFs. Which ETH ETF performed best during this period? Invesco’s QETH was the only fund to record net inflows, attracting $2.93 million while others experienced outflows. Should I be concerned about investing in ETH ETFs? Like all investments, ETH ETFs carry risk. The current outflows represent short-term market sentiment rather than fundamental issues with Ethereum’s technology. How do ETH ETFs differ from direct Ethereum ownership? ETH ETFs provide regulated exposure to Ethereum price movements without requiring direct cryptocurrency ownership or storage. Will this outflow trend continue? Market trends are unpredictable, but historical patterns suggest cryptocurrency investments often experience cycles of inflows and outflows.

The Japanese yen’s alarming plunge to a 10-month low has sent shockwaves through currency markets, while other Asian currencies struggle to find stable footing. This developing situation presents both risks and opportunities for informed traders. How Did Asia FX React to the Fed Minutes? The latest Federal Reserve meeting minutes revealed deep divisions among policymakers, creating volatility across Asia FX markets. While most Asian currencies showed initial stability after recent declines, the underlying tension remains palpable. The split within the Fed indicates ongoing debate about the timing and pace of future interest rate adjustments, directly impacting currency valuations worldwide. Why the Yen Hit a 10-Month Low The Japanese yen’s dramatic decline represents one of the most significant movements in recent forex market history. Several factors contributed to this collapse: Diverging monetary policies between Japan and the United States Stronger-than-expected US economic data Bank of Japan’s continued accommodative stance Reduced safe-haven demand amid global market recovery Understanding Forex Market Dynamics Post-Fed Announcement The forex market typically experiences heightened volatility following major central bank announcements. The current situation demonstrates how currency trading strategies must adapt to changing monetary policy expectations. Traders are closely monitoring: Currency Pair Current Trend Key Support Level USD/JPY Bullish 148.50 EUR/JPY Neutral-Bullish 158.00 AUD/USD Bearish 0.6350 USD/CNY Range-bound 7.3000 Currency Trading Strategies in Volatile Markets Successful currency trading during periods of central bank uncertainty requires careful risk management and strategic positioning. The current Asia FX environment demands: Increased position sizing awareness Broader stop-loss placements Focus on fundamental analysis over technical signals Regular monitoring of central bank communications What’s Next for Asian Currencies? The path forward for Asia FX markets depends heavily on several key factors. The Federal Reserve’s eventual policy direction will play a crucial role, but regional economic developments and geopolitical considerations will also influence currency movements. Traders should prepare for continued volatility while watching for potential breakout opportunities. The dramatic movements in Asia FX markets, particularly the yen’s concerning decline, highlight the fragile balance in global currency markets. As central banks navigate complex economic landscapes, currency traders face both significant risks and potential rewards. The divided Fed message serves as a powerful reminder that in forex markets, uncertainty often creates the most compelling opportunities for those prepared to act strategically. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the yen to hit a 10-month low? The yen’s decline resulted from monetary policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan , combined with reduced safe-haven demand. How do Fed minutes affect currency markets? Federal Reserve minutes provide insights into policymakers’ thinking, influencing interest rate expectations and currency valuations globally. Which Asian currencies are most affected by Fed policy? Currencies with high correlation to US interest rates, particularly the Japanese yen, South Korean won, and Singapore dollar, show strongest reactions. What is the outlook for Asia FX markets? Markets expect continued volatility as traders assess the timing of potential Fed rate cuts and regional economic performance. How should traders approach current market conditions? Emphasize risk management, monitor central bank communications closely, and maintain flexibility in trading strategies.

While each asset has seen short-term relief after steep declines, analysts warn that failure to clear nearby hurdles could trigger another leg lower. Bitcoin attempts recovery but faces heavy resistance Bitcoin found support near $88,500 after an extended decline pushed the market leader below the $92,000 threshold earlier in the week. Bears remained active as BTC slipped beneath $93,000 and $92,500, ultimately reaching a low of $88,570. The cryptocurrency has since staged a modest recovery, climbing above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downswing from $93,747 to $88,570. BTC is still trading below $93,000 and remains capped by the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. An additional challenge is forming on the hourly chart: a bearish trend line with resistance near $93,500. Analysts note that even if Bitcoin attempts another recovery wave, selling pressure could reappear near the $92,500 area, which aligns with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline. A successful close above $93,750 would be needed to regain upward momentum, potentially allowing BTC to test $94,500 and even $95,000. Further gains could open the path toward $95,500 and $96,200. However, failure to break the $93,500 barrier may lead to renewed weakness. Immediate support lies at $91,150, followed by a more substantial zone around $90,500. A sustained move below $90,000 would increase downside risks, potentially dragging Bitcoin back toward $88,500. The major support for the asset sits at $86,500, a level that could accelerate losses if breached. Technical indicators reflect a market at a turning point. The hourly MACD is losing momentum in the bearish zone, while the RSI has climbed above 50, signaling an attempt by buyers to regain control. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $92,700. XRP rebound stalls as key technical barriers hold XRP mirrored Bitcoin’s price action, attempting a recovery after dropping sharply below $2.150 and $2.120. A low formed at $2.025, and while the token has since moved higher, it remains capped below the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. The latest rebound brought XRP toward the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline from $2.525 to $2.025, but a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.150 continues to limit upside attempts. A break above this level is viewed as essential for shifting near-term sentiment. The first significant resistance sits at $2.20. If cleared, XRP may rise toward $2.250 and then $2.2750—near the 50% retracement of the recent decline. Further gains could target $2.320, $2.350, and ultimately $2.420, though these levels remain distant given current conditions. On the downside, failure to overcome $2.150 risks another drop. Initial support is located at $2.050, followed by $2.020. A close below $2.020 would expose XRP to deeper losses toward $1.9650 and $1.920, with the potential to extend declines to $1.880. The token was trading at $2.13 at press time. Both Bitcoin and XRP are at critical junctures as traders watch whether recovery efforts can overcome entrenched resistance levels. While momentum indicators suggest attempts at stabilization, the broader trend remains fragile. A rejection at key barriers could reignite selling pressure, leaving the market vulnerable to further downside in the near term.

A Bitwise representative claimed that despite the selling pressure in recent weeks, Bitcoin is still very close to bottoming out and that current prices represent an “opportunity zone for long-term investors.” According to the analyst, the large outflows from Bitcoin ETFs were one of the key drivers of the risk-off movement that began in mid-October. However, there's also a shared view that a return to these funds will accelerate the recovery. Bitwise, noting the continued interest from institutional investors, believes Bitcoin will lead the recovery, just as it has typically led the way in declines. While the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs is seen as a major institutionalization step for the sector, analysts argue that it has a double-edged effect. Greater liquidity also enables faster declines. “New players, hedge funds, and large portfolio managers engaging in arbitrage are entering and exiting the market. This increases volatility, especially during periods of uncertainty,” he said. The longer-term picture is different. Bitwise argues that volatility is declining on a 10-year trend and that Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly institutional asset thanks to new investor profiles entering the market. The company states that asset managers and financial advisors, in particular, are regularly adding Bitcoin to their model portfolios, generating stable and long-term demand. It's reported that there's been a significant slowdown in corporate treasury purchases, which played a significant role in the first half of this year. “This weakening demand was one of the factors that accelerated the decline in October. However, low prices always present an opportunity for long-term institutions,” the report stated. Another focus of the markets is the Fed's interest rate decisions. Despite Bitcoin being described as a “store of value independent of the fiat currency system,” its recent high correlation with macroeconomic expectations has sparked debate. A Bitwise analyst stated that Bitcoin will inevitably be affected by Fed policies in the short term due to its increasing “cyclical dominance” since the pandemic. Related News: Bitcoin Price Continues to Fall - So What's Behind This Relentless Decline? Experts Weigh In The market has largely priced in the possibility of a December interest rate cut. The analyst noted that Bitcoin's recent bottoming at $90,000 and its subsequent recovery alongside other risk assets support this view. While Bitwise hasn't officially announced a target for 2025, it has shared a clear forecast for 2026: $200,000. This expectation is based on the prediction that institutional demand will increase exponentially. The company argues that a broad wave of institutional investors, from industry funds and university endowments to pension funds and corporate balance sheets, is “inevitable.” Harvard's Bitcoin purchase was cited as a symbolic example of this trend. *This is not investment advice.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the world’s leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at $93,017.81 on the Binance USDT market, marking one of the most significant Bitcoin price surge events in recent history. What’s Driving This Massive Bitcoin Price Surge? The cryptocurrency market is experiencing unprecedented momentum as Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory. This Bitcoin price surge represents more than just numbers on a chart—it signals growing institutional confidence and mainstream adoption. Several key factors are contributing to this remarkable performance: Institutional investment continues to pour into Bitcoin ETFs and direct holdings Global economic uncertainty is driving safe-haven asset demand Technological advancements in the Bitcoin network are enhancing utility Regulatory clarity in major markets is boosting investor confidence How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Movement? Breaking the $93,000 level represents a psychological barrier that many analysts considered crucial for sustained bullish momentum. This Bitcoin price surge demonstrates the cryptocurrency’s resilience and growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Moreover, the consistent upward movement suggests strong underlying fundamentals rather than speculative trading alone. The current trading volume on major exchanges like Binance indicates substantial institutional participation. This Bitcoin price surge is particularly noteworthy because it comes amid broader market stability, suggesting organic growth rather than reactionary movements. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For both seasoned traders and new investors, this Bitcoin price surge presents important considerations. The market’s strength at these levels indicates potential for continued growth, but also highlights the importance of strategic planning. Here are key takeaways for investors: Diversification remains crucial despite Bitcoin’s strong performance Risk management strategies should be reviewed and updated regularly Long-term perspective often outperforms short-term trading in volatile markets Stay informed about regulatory developments and market trends Will the Bitcoin Price Surge Continue? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the current market dynamics suggest continued positive momentum. The Bitcoin price surge we’re witnessing is supported by strong fundamentals including: Increasing adoption by traditional financial institutions Growing recognition as an inflation hedge Technological improvements enhancing network efficiency Expanding global acceptance as payment method However, investors should remain cautious and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and while this Bitcoin price surge is impressive, market corrections are natural and expected. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $93,000? The Bitcoin price surge is driven by multiple factors including increased institutional investment, growing mainstream adoption, positive regulatory developments, and global economic conditions favoring alternative assets. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at $93,000? While Bitcoin has reached new highs, many analysts believe there’s still potential for growth. However, investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon, and never invest more than they can afford to lose. How does this Bitcoin price surge compare to previous bull markets? This Bitcoin price surge differs from previous cycles due to greater institutional participation, improved regulatory clarity, and more sophisticated market infrastructure, potentially indicating more sustainable growth. What’s the next major resistance level for Bitcoin? Analysts are watching the $100,000 psychological barrier as the next major milestone, though market movements depend on various economic and regulatory factors. Should I be concerned about a price correction? Price corrections are normal in any financial market. Long-term investors typically focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value rather than short-term price fluctuations. How can I stay updated on Bitcoin price movements?

This update links new state-level exposure, a billion-dollar on-chain transfer and a fragile bounce into one picture of where the market stands. Four Governments Confirm New Channels for Holding Bitcoin Four governments have recently disclosed Bitcoin exposure through mining programs, direct purchases, ETFs and test portfolios. The United Arab Emirates, El Salvador, Luxembourg and the Czech Republic now all appear in public records as nation states with some form of BTC on their books. Four Nations Add Bitcoin Exposure. Source: The Bitcoin Historian In the UAE, blockchain analysts traced several thousand BTC to wallets tied to a government-backed mining operation. The coins come from mined rewards rather than exchange buys, yet the holdings still sit under state control and now show up in on-chain data. El Salvador continues to add Bitcoin directly to its national stash. Officials have announced new acquisitions worth around $100 million in recent weeks, extending a policy of buying BTC during market pullbacks and holding it as part of the country’s long-term strategy. Luxembourg is using a fund structure instead of spot coins. Its Intergenerational Sovereign Wealth Fund plans to place a small share of assets into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and related products, giving the state price exposure while custodians handle the underlying assets. The Czech Republic has taken a more experimental route. The Czech National Bank built a $1 million test portfolio that includes Bitcoin, a U.S. dollar stablecoin and a tokenized deposit. Officials say the basket sits outside formal foreign-exchange reserves and serves mainly as a research tool, yet it still marks disclosed central-bank exposure to BTC. While governments adjust their policies, large holders on-chain are also on the move. Whale Address Receives 10,145 BTC From BitMEX Cold Wallet Meanwhile, on-chain data show a whale address has received 10,145 BTC, valued near $1 billion at recent prices. A portfolio view for address 3JBM969wvpxEnfYLQ3LYayB3DVk52ZZpGq records a single inflow of 10.145K BTC from a BitMEX cold wallet roughly five hours ago, placing the full stack under that wallet’s control. Satoshi Era Whale 10,145 BTC Move. Source: 0xNobler As a result, traders are already debating whether the move signals long-term accumulation or simple internal rebalancing. The transfer has also revived speculation about whether a “Satoshi-era” holder is positioning for a market bottom, even though the transaction alone does not reveal the whale’s strategy. Analyst Says Bitcoin Bounce Shows Early Stabilization but Volatility Remains Elevated Bitcoin’s rebound h as offered the first signs of stabilization, even as volatility stays elevated, according to analyst Michaël van de Poppe. He noted that the recent drop left markets “overextended to the downside,” and the latest bounce reflects early attempts to find footing in a key support zone. Bitcoin Support Zone Analysis. Source: CryptoMichNL At the same time, he cautioned that reversals rarely happen quickly. Poppe expects Bitcoin to move sideways for a period as the market builds a new base following the sharp decline. The chart shows liquidity already cleared below recent lows, leaving room for consolidation before any sustained upward move can begin. He added that the current price region remains attractive for long-term positioning, emphasizing that accumulation in this zone could prove beneficial over the coming years.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 05:26:24

Pseudonymous crypto market analyst Axel Bitblaze has now found that the asset’s latest decline appears to be forming the pattern seen in the first quarter of 2025, when the asset topped in January and fell 17% while the S&P 500 continued to hit new highs. At the time, he noted that many believed Bitcoin was simply cooling off. However, four weeks later, the S&P 500 also peaked, and both markets plunged in tandem, which ended up triggering a six-week stretch in which BTC dropped 25% and the index slid 21%. One Last Bearish Trigger? Bitblaze argued that current conditions look strikingly similar. Bitcoin peaked on October 6 and has already fallen about 18% in recent weeks, while the S&P 500 has only now begun to turn lower. According to this breakdown, the sequence resembles the same cycle – Bitcoin begins to fall early without a clear bearish catalyst; equities continue to rise because they typically lag; investors eventually sense broader weakness and stocks break down; BTC’s sell-off briefly intensifies; Bitcoin regains strength sooner than equities; a final market spill follows; and then a reversal takes shape. Bitblaze said the market is likely in phase three or four of this pattern, with most of Bitcoin’s downside already realized. The analyst added that if markets are waiting for one last bearish trigger, it may already be forming, while pointing to rising Japanese bond yields, liquidity pressures at smaller US banks, and market sensitivity to rumors involving high-profile political figures. As such, the current downturn is mostly tied to the first two factors, which are potentially “slow burn” problems that often erupt without warning. “So yeah… feels like we’re close to the end of the damage, not the start. But one more shakeout wouldn’t surprise me at all.” Bearish Forces Still Dominate Despite a slight improvement in short-term signals, another analyst, Axel Adler Junior, believes the BTC market structure remains clearly bearish. The fast version of the Bull-Bear Structure Index has climbed from a critical reading of -41.89 on November 17 to -27.82, which indicates that bearish pressure has eased as prices stabilize near $91,000. However, he noted that the indicator is still well below the -25% threshold, and shows negative taker flow, derivatives pressure, and ETF outflows continue to dominate. Meanwhile, the slow, smoothed version of the index has weakened further after falling from -14.04 to -21.90, which means that deeper structural bearish trends are still gaining strength. Additionally, Coinbase Premium Gap has dropped to -$90, which happens to be one of its lowest levels this year. This signals weakened institutional participation. The premium typically rises when major players accumulate BTC, but the current negative reading shows retail-dominated trading on Binance is setting the tone.

At the same time, analysts expect the end of the US government shutdown to pave the way for a surge of new crypto ETF approvals in 2026. Even though current ETFs are dealing with major outflows and pressure on prices, some analysts believe a new regulatory cycle could lead to renewed institutional participation and innovation in the sector. ADIC Expands Bitcoin Position The Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC) escalated its exposure to Bitcoin by almost tripling its holdings in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) during the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg report . The move is being interpreted as a strong signal that institutional appetite for digital assets is still strong across the United Arab Emirates, even during a turbulent period for Bitcoin’s price. ADIC is an investment arm of Mubadala Investment Company, and reportedly increased its IBIT position from 2.4 million shares to nearly 8 million by the end of September. At the time, the position was valued at around $520 million based on IBIT’s closing price of $65 per share. The buying spree happened just before a dramatic surge in Bitcoin that pushed the asset to an all-time high of above $126,000 on Oct. 5. Since then, Bitcoin has retreated sharply, and recently even fell below $90,000 before stabilizing close to $92,089. This downturn dragged IBIT’s price down as well, with the ETF closing Wednesday at $50.71, This is roughly 23% lower than its value at the end of Q3. iShares Bitcoin Trus ETF price (Source: Google Finance ) Despite the pullback, many in the industry see ADIC’s aggressive accumulation as a clear sign of long-term conviction. The council told Bloomberg that it views Bitcoin as the digital equivalent of gold, which is a narrative that is increasingly embraced by institutional allocators looking for alternative stores of value. M2 treasury manager Zayed Aleem described the move as “fantastic to see,” and argued that it is a big step forward for the UAE to become a global digital-asset hub. Crypto commentator MartyParty also called ADIC’s position a strategic play on Bitcoin’s long-term store-of-value role. However, IBIT’s recent performance raised eyebrows. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the fund is currently undergoing an “ugly stretch,” and pointed to a wave of outflows that has intensified alongside Bitcoin’s price correction. On Tuesday, IBIT logged its largest single-day outflow since launch at $523.2 million, which contributed to $3.3 billion in outflows from Bitcoin ETFs over the past month. Despite this, year-to-date flows are still strong at +$25 billion, and since its January 2024 launch, IBIT has accumulated over $63 million in net inflows. For now, analysts are still split on Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. Some warn of sustained volatility, while others argue that the current range represents a prime accumulation opportunity. Analysts See ETF Boom Ahead Meanwhile, the end of the US government shutdown and the return to a normal legislative calendar could open the door to a wave of new crypto ETF approvals in 2026, according to several market analysts. Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan told CNBC that demand for crypto ETFs and exchange-traded products is “huge,” and he expects a major expansion of offerings once the SEC resumes a full regulatory pace. Hougan predicted a surge of more than 100 new products, ranging from single-asset funds to index-based crypto ETPs. He explained that index-focused products will likely become especially popular as investors look for simple, passive ways to gain exposure to the digital asset market. Matt Hougan’s interview with CNBC However, the current ETF environment is still a bit challenging. Despite strong investor interest, crypto ETFs have been facing major outflows that are adding even more pressure to already-weakened cryptocurrency prices. Canary Capital’s new XRP ETF, XRPC launched on Thursday with $58 million in first-day trading volume, but XRP still fell roughly 13% over the past week. Bitcoin ETFs are showing similar strain, with around $1.1 billion in outflows so far in November, putting them on track for their worst month since launch. Bitcoin’s drop below the average ETF cost basis of roughly $89,600 left many ETF investors holding unrealized losses. Analysts noticed that Bitcoin ETF holders largely stayed resilient through October’s market crash, with only about $1 billion in outflows following the sell-off. Eric Balchunas said long-term Bitcoin whales, rather than ETF retail investors, were responsible for most selling pressure in October and early November. Since then, the market downturn has deepened and ETF outflows have continued to accelerate. Despite this, some analysts are still optimistic that renewed regulatory activity in 2026 could unlock a fresh phase of ETF innovation and institutional participation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 05:30:00

This strategic move represents a significant leap forward for institutional participation in blockchain-based finance. But what makes this USDG0 stablecoin integration so revolutionary for the RWA sector? Why USDG0 Stablecoin Marks a Turning Point for RWAs The USDG0 stablecoin brings something crucial to the table that previous solutions lacked: regulatory clarity combined with advanced technical infrastructure. Built on LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, this USDG0 stablecoin offers seamless cross-chain functionality while maintaining the regulatory compliance that institutions demand. This combination addresses two major hurdles that have traditionally slowed institutional adoption. Plume’s decision to integrate the USDG0 stablecoin signals a maturation of the entire RWA ecosystem. The platform recognizes that for real-world assets to truly flourish on-chain, they need stable, regulated settlement layers. The USDG0 stablecoin provides exactly this foundation, enabling more sophisticated financial instruments and smoother transactions. How Does This USDG0 Stablecoin Integration Benefit Investors? The adoption of USDG0 stablecoin brings multiple advantages to the Plume ecosystem: Enhanced regulatory compliance through Paxos’ established framework Improved cross-chain interoperability via LayerZero technology Greater institutional confidence in RWA transactions Reduced settlement risks with regulated stablecoin infrastructure Expanded accessibility to real-world asset investments This USDG0 stablecoin integration means that institutions can now participate in RWA markets with the same level of regulatory comfort they experience in traditional finance. The move demonstrates how seriously Plume is taking institutional requirements while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized finance. What Challenges Does the USDG0 Stablecoin Overcome? Traditional RWA platforms have struggled with several key issues that the USDG0 stablecoin directly addresses. Regulatory uncertainty has been a major barrier, with many institutions hesitant to engage with unregulated stablecoins. The USDG0 stablecoin, being Paxos-issued, brings established regulatory oversight that changes this dynamic completely. Technical limitations have also hampered previous efforts. The Omnichain Fungible Token standard underlying the USDG0 stablecoin eliminates fragmentation across different blockchain networks. This means assets can move seamlessly between ecosystems while maintaining their value and properties – a crucial requirement for sophisticated financial operations. The Future Impact of USDG0 Stablecoin Adoption Looking ahead, the integration of USDG0 stablecoin could catalyze several important developments. We may see increased institutional capital flowing into RWA markets as compliance concerns diminish. The proven success of this USDG0 stablecoin implementation could also encourage other platforms to follow Plume’s lead, creating a domino effect across the industry. Moreover, the technical foundation provided by the USDG0 stablecoin opens doors to more complex financial products. Think tokenized real estate, compliant securities trading, and institutional-grade lending protocols – all operating with the stability and regulatory clarity that the USDG0 stablecoin provides. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Blockchain Participation The adoption of USDG0 stablecoin by Plume represents more than just another partnership announcement. It signals the beginning of a new phase where regulated, institutional-grade infrastructure becomes the standard rather than the exception. This move demonstrates that the blockchain industry is maturing rapidly, addressing real-world needs with sophisticated solutions like the USDG0 stablecoin that balance innovation with compliance. Frequently Asked Questions What is the USDG0 stablecoin? The USDG0 stablecoin is a regulated digital currency issued by Paxos and built on LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, designed for cross-chain functionality and institutional use. Why is Plume adopting USDG0? Plume is integrating USDG0 to expand regulated stablecoin infrastructure within its RWA ecosystem and facilitate greater institutional participation in real-world asset markets. How does USDG0 differ from other stablecoins? USDG0 combines Paxos’ regulatory compliance with LayerZero’s cross-chain technology, making it uniquely suited for institutional RWA applications that require both regulatory clarity and technical interoperability. What benefits does USDG0 bring to RWA markets? The stablecoin provides regulated settlement layers, reduced counterparty risk, improved cross-chain functionality, and greater institutional confidence in blockchain-based real-world asset transactions. When will USDG0 be fully integrated into Plume? While the announcement has been made, specific timeline details for full integration are typically released gradually as development milestones are achieved. Can retail investors access USDG0 through Plume? While primarily designed for institutional use, the integration aims to benefit the entire ecosystem, though specific access details may vary based on jurisdictional regulations.

Market sentiment remains mixed, but there is now more clear liquidity shifting toward projects displaying transparency in development, practical utility, and community engagement. Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana have each seen notable technical setups, while early stage PayFi project Remittix has emerged on the radar for its real-world payment architecture and fast-paced presale progress. As market volatility begins to pick up, longer-term investors are assessing which digital assets represent the most sound fundamentals and credible roadmaps. Below is a look at the best crypto to buy now as traders diversify beyond Bitcoin. 1. Remittix (RTX) Remittix stands out from the sea of projects as investors rotate to utility-driven assets, and it secures a top position on this list due to a focus on real-world financial infrastructure rather than speculative momentum. The project is building a full PayFi ecosystem that integrates crypto-to-fiat transfers, remittances, and daily payments into one seamless application targeted at the 19 trillion USD global payments market. The presale continues to accelerate, now with total funds raised at 28,165,960.66 USD and 686,111,564.44 tokens sold at a price of 0.1166 USD. This steady growth reflects the rise in demand from crypto investors who value transparency, potential adoption, and verified development practices. One of Remittix’s core strengths is its live beta wallet , which allows users to test early PayFi functions ahead of the full launch. Development updates are informed directly by community feedback, reinforcing a practical user centered approach. Security remains a major focus, with Remittix completing both a CertiK audit and full team KYC verification. The project has also confirmed multiple upcoming CEX listings, including BitMart, strengthening its long term accessibility. With its clear financial utility and structured development timeline, Remittix stands out as one of the best crypto presales to buy now. Key RTX Features • 28.16 million USD raised in the presale • 686 million tokens sold • CertiK audited and KYC verified team • Beta wallet live and actively updated • Crypto to fiat conversions, transfers, and payments in one app • Multiple CEX listings secured, including BitMart • Targeting the global payments market 2. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, while remaining one of the foundational assets to the crypto market, recent price movement shows signs of short-term weakness. ETH changeS hands for 2,941.11 USD, down 6.76 percent in the past 24 hours, with a market capitalization of 354.5 billion USD. Trading volume is 32.3 billion USD, down 36.91 percent as investors scale back for the time being. Ethereum needs to recover the 3,200 USD level to set up a meaningful recovery, says Innovator of Afrika. In that respect, a move above this threshold can re-open upside targets between 3,400-3,600 USD. As the biggest smart contract platform, Ethereum remains particularly integral to blockchain technology. It powers thousands of decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces-core components of Web3 development. The architecture also sees growing institutional adoption-with staking infrastructure and layer 2 scaling networks in place to better facilitate efficiency. Ethereum’s strong network effects and further developing ecosystem keep long-term investors tuned in. Short-term market sentiment may remain conservative, but Ethereum is one of the best altcoins anyone can buy now, especially for those wanting digital asset exposure with true sustainable utility. 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is presenting an important technical setup as it enters what analysts describe as the final corrective leg. Currently, the asset changes hands at 0.4523 USD, down 5.99 percent in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of 16.22 billion USD. Trading volume has jumped significantly to 847.92 million USD, up 34.82 percent, indicating a growing interest by traders. According to analysis by GainMuse, ADA is interacting with a crucial demand block close to the 0.45 USD level, which has consistently absorbed sell side pressure. If the support can hold, it might form a recovery towards the upper trendline, while a deeper dip might delay progress given that the token is still in a falling channel. Cardano remains a favorite project among longer-term crypto investors because of its academic development model, peer-reviewed research framework, and keen focus on secure, scalable blockchain technology. The network continues to grow in smart contract functionality, opening up fresh use cases in DeFi, identity solutions, and on-chain governance. While the short-term price structure for ADA is cautious, the longer-term fundamentals of this project continue to be attractive to those investors who like their blockchain platforms to grow more slowly and methodically rather than in volatile, hype-driven jumps. Cardano’s disciplined approach makes it a notable contender among today’s best crypto to buy now. 4. Solana (SOL) Solana is maintaining investor attention as it attempts to stabilize after retesting a key structural boundary. SOL is priced at 133.08 USD, down 5.57 percent in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of 73.78 billion USD and trading volume at 5.24 billion USD, down 40.89 percent. Recent analysis from GainMuse indicates that Solana produced a bullish daily candle after tagging the lower boundary of its descending channel, suggesting early signs of strength. Analysts note that a failure to hold above recent reaction lows could delay a potential climb toward the 160 USD region. Solana remains one of the most active and developer friendly smart contract ecosystems in the cryptocurrency market. Its high throughput, low transaction fees, and growing network of decentralized finance applications have made it a popular choice for blockchain developers and Web3 builders. Solana’s ability to deliver fast, scalable performance supports growing interest from both institutional and retail crypto investors. Although market fluctuations continue, Solana maintains strong long term potential and stands as one of the best altcoins to buy now as investors rotate out of Bitcoin and explore faster, application driven networks.

Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, commented, “We’re rolling out easy access to DEX trading in Brazil now in the Coinbase app. Our US users have been enjoying this product and are excited to bring it to new markets! Onchain trading is getting more and more accessible.” The DeFi Mullet service first launched in the US on October 8 to streamline the DeFi experience. Armstrong, at the time, had pledged to expand to other countries and networks. Crypto community members describe Coinbase’s decision as promising In its Wednesday press release, Coinbase explained that its DEX integration eliminates the typical DeFi complications and provides a seamless, straightforward path into onchain trading. The firm also wrote, “Using our DEX integration, users can trade on popular DEXs, like Aerodrome and Uniswap, without leaving the familiar ease of the Coinbase interface. When users submit a trade, DEX aggregators automatically scan the available liquidity across top DEXs to find the best prices.” Moreover, with a self-custody wallet, people can trade without being charged by the network, while still retaining complete control over their tokens, it added. However, it hasn’t yet shared a date for the Brazil launch. Aibra, an X user, commented on Coinbase’s decision, expressing approval of its path forward while suggesting more alignment with the Base app is needed. He noted the campaign could have included deposits from a Base app wallet without issue. Another commenter noted that Coinbase’s development into new markets was encouraging, adding that it shows global ambitions are taking shape. One by the domain name Alex Dulub, remarked , “Great to see this expanding! Every time onchain access reaches a new market, the expectations around reliability and safety rise with it. That is how real adoption compounds.” Brazil is still to implement a new regulatory framework for crypto assets by February 2026. The country’s central bank rolled out new anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing rules aimed at cracking down on illegal activity. Once enforced, all virtual asset service providers, including custodians and intermediaries, will be required to secure authorization from the central bank to operate their businesses. Crypto providers must also follow strict guidelines on transparency, governance, internal controls, and cybersecurity—similar to those expected of banks. Despite the regulatory developments, Brazil has become one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets in Latin America, with its adoption rate steadily increasing over the past few years. More than 10% of the country’s population already owns some form of digital asset, according to recent data, a figure above the global average. Interest is soaring as concerns about inflation, currency volatility, and a growing fintech ecosystem make accessing cryptocurrency easier than ever. The country is evaluating whether to tax international crypto transactions as it prepares to implement the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, which is now backed by over 70 nations. Coinbase’s stock has dropped by over 25% in October In Q3, Coinbase reported that Base saw growing use across trading, payments, lending, and social platforms, and also introduced Flashblocks for ultra-fast block confirmations of 200ms. The company is steadily building a Bitcoin treasury, increasing its holdings by 2,772 BTC in the third quarter to a total of 14,548 BTC, currently valued at $1.3 billion. Its net income surged to $432.6 million, more than five times higher than a year ago, as revenue rose 55% to $1.9 billion. Despite earlier gains, Coinbase stock has fallen 25.2% in the past month to $257.29, trading almost at its 2025 starting level, compared with MARA and Strategy, which are down 33.8% and 35.6%.

The massive Bitcoin withdrawal from BitGo involves 1,300 BTC valued at approximately $120 million, all moving within just six hours. This enormous transaction has cryptocurrency analysts and investors buzzing with questions about what this could mean for the market. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal Mean? The blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain first spotted this significant activity. The new address, starting with 3AXFhi, began moving these substantial funds in a coordinated pattern. This Bitcoin withdrawal represents one of the largest single movements from a major custodian like BitGo in recent months. The timing and scale of this transaction have naturally raised eyebrows across the crypto community. When we see a Bitcoin withdrawal of this magnitude, several questions immediately come to mind. Is this an institutional player repositioning assets? Could it be a whale preparing for a major market move? The concentrated nature of this Bitcoin withdrawal suggests careful planning rather than random activity. Why Are Large Bitcoin Withdrawals Significant? Major Bitcoin withdrawals often signal important market developments. Here’s what makes this particular transaction so noteworthy: Market Impact Potential : $120 million represents substantial buying or selling power Custodian Behavior : Movements from established platforms like BitGo carry different weight than exchange transfers Timing Patterns : The six-hour window suggests urgency or specific timing requirements Address History : The new address lacking transaction history adds mystery This Bitcoin withdrawal follows a pattern we’ve observed with institutional players who often move large sums in coordinated batches. However, the complete anonymity of the receiving address makes this case particularly intriguing. How Do Major Bitcoin Withdrawals Affect Market Sentiment? Large-scale Bitcoin withdrawals can influence market psychology in several ways. When substantial amounts leave custodial services, it often indicates one of two scenarios: either investors are moving to cold storage for long-term holding, or they’re preparing to deploy capital elsewhere. This specific Bitcoin withdrawal comes at a time when the market is particularly sensitive to large movements. The cryptocurrency community is closely watching how this Bitcoin withdrawal might affect: Short-term price volatility Exchange liquidity levels Institutional investment patterns Market confidence indicators Historical data shows that massive Bitcoin withdrawals often precede significant price movements, though the direction isn’t always predictable. What Should Investors Watch After This Bitcoin Withdrawal? Following this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal, market participants should monitor several key indicators. Track whether the withdrawn Bitcoin remains in the new address or gets distributed to multiple wallets. Observe if similar large Bitcoin withdrawals occur from other major custodians. Watch for any unusual trading patterns that might connect to this movement. The most crucial aspect is understanding that while individual transactions can be dramatic, they form part of larger market patterns. This Bitcoin withdrawal, while impressive, should be considered alongside other market fundamentals and technical indicators. Key Takeaways from This Major Bitcoin Movement This $120 million Bitcoin withdrawal serves as a powerful reminder of several cryptocurrency market realities. Large players continue to move significant amounts, demonstrating ongoing institutional interest. The efficiency of blockchain technology enables tracking of these substantial movements in real-time. Most importantly, single transactions rarely tell the complete story – context and follow-up activity provide the full picture. As we continue monitoring this Bitcoin withdrawal and its aftermath, remember that cryptocurrency markets thrive on both transparency and mystery. The ability to track transactions publicly while maintaining participant privacy creates the dynamic environment that makes this space so fascinating. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin withdrawal? A Bitcoin withdrawal refers to moving Bitcoin from one wallet or exchange to another. This particular Bitcoin withdrawal involved transferring funds from BitGo’s custodial services to a new external address. Why is this Bitcoin withdrawal significant? This Bitcoin withdrawal is notable due to its large size ($120 million), the short time frame (6 hours), and the mystery surrounding the receiving address, which had no previous transaction history. How can I track large Bitcoin transactions? You can monitor large Bitcoin withdrawals using blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or specialized analytics platforms like Lookonchain, which detected this particular transaction. Does a large Bitcoin withdrawal always affect prices? Not necessarily. While large Bitcoin withdrawals can indicate major player movements, price impact depends on whether the Bitcoin gets sold, held, or redistributed to other addresses. What is BitGo? BitGo is a leading digital asset trust company and security platform that provides custodial services for institutional investors holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Should I be concerned about large Bitcoin withdrawals? Large Bitcoin withdrawals are normal market activity. While interesting to observe, they typically represent portfolio management rather than market manipulation when occurring from regulated custodians.

The token traded in a tight range as some dip buyers returned, but crypto volumes stayed cautious with traders still wary of macro risk and the next batch of US data. The dollar edged higher ahead of a long-delayed jobs report, keeping risk appetite contained even as equities bounced.

Speaking to Fox Business, Saylor argued that Bitcoin’s price swings have actually narrowed over time as institutional adoption has increased. “We are getting a lot less volatility,” he said, adding that “Bitcoin is stronger than ever.” Michael @Saylor has pushed back against concerns that Wall Street’s growing presence in Bitcoin has amplified the asset’s volatility. #Strategy #Bitcoin https://t.co/ttN5ApxrDY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 19, 2025 AI Chip Optimism Fuels Asia Equity Surge With Japan And Korea Leading Gains Equity markets took their cue from Nvidia. Tech-heavy markets in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan led the charge after chief executive Jensen Huang talked up powerful demand for the firm’s AI chips from major cloud providers and brushed aside worries about an AI bubble. MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 1.2%, rebounding from a one month low, while futures linked to the S&P 500 climbed roughly 1.3%. Wall Street had already snapped a four day losing streak on Wednesday as investors began to question whether the latest anxiety over AI valuations had gone too far. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped around 3.2% and South Korea’s Kospi surged about 2.6 per cent, fuelled by sharp gains in chipmakers and tech suppliers tied to Nvidia’s boom. Names such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Advantest rallied between 4%-9% in local trade. SoftBank Group gained about 3.5% even after fully exiting its stake in Nvidia in October, reflecting the broader bid for tech risk. Weakness In Chinese Tech And EV Names Leaves Hong Kong Trailing Regional Gains Not every market joined the party. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped around 0.1% and a key mainland gauge erased an earlier rise of roughly 0.7% to trade flat, with losses in electric vehicle makers and mixed moves in Chinese tech firms. Xiaomi continued to fall after signalling higher global smartphone prices because of rising chip costs, while worries about slowing EV demand after the expiry of subsidies kept pressure on the sector. Attention now turns back to Washington. Investors are waiting for September’s delayed jobs report, due later in the global session, to gauge the health of the US labour market and the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Minutes from the Fed’s October meeting, released on Wednesday, showed policymakers cut interest rates while warning that moving too far could risk entrenched inflation and a loss of public trust in the central bank.

As Ethereum continues to evolve beyond just a cryptocurrency into a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem, investors worldwide are asking the critical question: Can ETH realistically reach $10,000? Our comprehensive Ethereum price prediction analysis examines the technical indicators, market fundamentals, and emerging trends that could propel ETH to new heights by 2030. What Factors Influence Ethereum Price Prediction? Understanding ETH price analysis requires examining multiple dimensions. The transition to proof-of-stake through Ethereum 2.0 has fundamentally changed the network’s economics. Reduced issuance and increased staking rewards create structural support for higher prices. Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are driving adoption while reducing transaction costs, making Ethereum more accessible to millions of new users. Technical Analysis for Ethereum Forecast Our cryptocurrency forecast methodology combines traditional technical analysis with blockchain-specific metrics. Key resistance levels at $4,000 and $6,800 represent significant psychological barriers. The 200-week moving average has consistently provided strong support during market downturns. On-chain data reveals that long-term holder accumulation accelerates during price corrections, indicating strong conviction among institutional investors. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Key Indicators Indicator Current Status Bullish Signal RSI Neutral Not overbought MACD Positive Upward momentum Volume Increasing Growing interest Staking Ratio 25% Reduced selling pressure Market Trends Driving ETH Value The evolving Ethereum market trends showcase several positive developments. Institutional adoption through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations continues to grow. The DeFi ecosystem, despite occasional setbacks, maintains Ethereum’s position as the dominant smart contract platform. NFT markets, while volatile, demonstrate Ethereum’s cultural relevance beyond pure financial applications. 2025-2030 Price Projections: Realistic Expectations Our Ethereum price prediction model considers three primary scenarios: Conservative: $6,500-$8,000 by 2025 Moderate: $8,000-$12,000 by 2027 Bullish: $15,000+ by 2030 The path to $10,000 requires sustained network growth, continued institutional adoption, and favorable regulatory developments. Each successful Ethereum upgrade improves scalability and reduces environmental concerns, addressing key criticisms that previously limited mainstream acceptance. Risks and Challenges in ETH Price Analysis While our ETH price analysis remains optimistic, several challenges could impact the trajectory. Regulatory uncertainty remains the single largest risk factor. Competition from alternative layer-1 blockchains continues to intensify. Technological risks associated with complex upgrades could create temporary setbacks. However, Ethereum’s first-mover advantage and robust developer community provide significant defensive characteristics. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on our comprehensive cryptocurrency forecast , strategic accumulation during market corrections appears prudent. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to Ethereum’s long-term potential. Monitoring key technical levels and fundamental developments helps investors make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions to short-term price movements. Conclusion: The Path to $10,000 Ethereum’s journey to $10,000 represents more than just price appreciation—it symbolizes the maturation of decentralized technology into mainstream finance. While the path may include volatility and temporary setbacks, the fundamental case for Ethereum’s long-term growth remains compelling. The combination of technological innovation, growing adoption, and evolving tokenomics creates a foundation for sustained value creation that could potentially exceed even the most optimistic Ethereum price prediction models.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-binance-announces-it-will-support-this-altcoins-network-upgrade-here-are-the-details-8/,"Binance has announced that it will temporarily halt certain transactions on November 20, 2025, to support a planned upgrade to the THORChain (RUNE) network. Binance to Support THORChain (RUNE) Network Upgrade: Transactions to Be Temporarily Suspended on November 20 As part of the preparation for technical work to maintain the highest level of user experience, the exchange will suspend deposits and withdrawals for all tokens on the THORChain network as of 20:00. The network upgrade is expected to occur around 9:00 PM, once block height 23,761,879 is reached. Binance emphasized that all technical steps necessary for the upgrade process will be handled automatically by the exchange, eliminating the need for users to perform any manual actions. According to the statement made by the exchange, trading of tokens on the THORChain network will not be affected during the upgrade and spot trading pairs will continue to operate normally. Binance will reactivate deposits and withdrawals once the upgrade is complete and the network is confirmed to be stable. No further announcements will be made for this phase. While THORChain's upcoming network update is stated to aim to increase network functionality and performance, the support provided by Binance in this process is critical to protecting users' asset security. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s Days Under $90K May Be Over,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/the-final-dip-bitcoins-days-under-90k-may-be-over/,"Bitcoin slid below the $92,000 mark on Wednesday, trading at $91,500 at press time after a one-day drop of 5% that left the token down 17% in the last 30 days. Related Reading: With 42% Of XRP Holders Underwater, Analysts Say The Altcoin Could Crash Even Further Market players were rattled after a stretch of heavy swings that began with a peak early in October. According to market trackers, price pressure has pushed sentiment into deep fear as investors reassess risk. Winklevoss Sees Opportunity According to posts on X by Cameron Winklevoss, prices under $90,000 may not last long. “This is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy bitcoin below $90k!” he said. Cameron and his brother Tyler have long compared Bitcoin to modern gold and have suggested it could one day reach $1 million, a view that frames the current pullback as a buy window rather than a lasting setback. Some industry leaders echoed that view, calling the fall a chance for long-term buyers to accumulate. This is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy bitcoin below $90k! — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) November 18, 2025 October Shock Still Echoes Bitcoin’s recent slide followed a new high of $126,200 on October 6, 2025, and heavy liquidations four days later that erased close to $20 billion in leveraged positions. Analysts tracking market cycles say this pullback fits a common pattern after the April 2024 halving, with major peaks often arriving 400–600 days afterward. Reports from The Kobeissi Letter suggest much of the current weakness looks like a routine unwinding of margin positions rather than a collapse in underlying demand. Whales Are Accumulating According to Glassnode, wallets holding 1,000 BTC rose from 1,354 on October 27 to 1,384 on November 17, an increase of 2.5%. At the same time, smaller holders moved away; addresses with less than one BTC dropped from 980,577 to 977,420 in the same period. Markus Thielen of 10X Research said large holders have been buying while absorbing selling pressure. Some of the buying activity has been quietly taking place, and it is being watched closely by analysts.

Here’s how the figure compares for Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP Retail Realized Price Puts Profit Margin Around 60% In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how retail profitability compares between the top assets in the sector: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Retail investors refer to the smallest of entities in the market, who don’t hold a significant balance on an individual level (typically less than $1,000). To calculate the profit-loss balance of this cohort, Glassnode has made use of the Realized Price indicator. The Realized Price measures the average cost basis or acquisition level of a given segment of the network. When the asset’s spot price trades above this level, it means the group is in a state of net unrealized gain. On the other hand, it being under the metric implies the dominance of loss among the cohort members. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price for the retail investors on the XRP network: As displayed in the above graph, XRP has witnessed bearish price action recently, but its price still has a notable gap over the Realized Price of the retail entities. More specifically, this group is in an average profit of 60% right now. Ethereum retail holders are also in the green, but their profitability isn’t quite as good, sitting at 40%. Both XRP and Ethereum, however, pale in comparison to Bitcoin. Even after the price crash , BTC retail addresses are still in an average profit of more than 100%. Now, what are retail investors doing with their profits? On-chain analytics firm Santiment has shed light on the matter in an X post . As the chart below for the holdings of this cohort shows, selling has occurred on all three networks recently. Bitcoin retail was accumulating until the latest price plunge, but this bearish wave has spooked them into selling 0.36% of their supply over the last five days, which is the highest rate of distribution in two months. Ethereum retail has been exiting for a while now, and the trend has only continued during the past month as the cohort’s holdings have gone down by 0.90%. XRP’s small hands have shown a more mixed behavior, first participating in a sharp selloff, and then following on with slight accumulation. Overall, the group’s supply is down 1.38% since the start of November. “Prices move the opposite direction of small wallets’ behavior,” noted Santiment. “So we’re keeping an eye on retail traders continuing to panic sell as a positive sign for crypto’s recovery.” XRP Price XRP has fallen alongside the rest of the market as its price has returned to $2.13.",XRP|bitcoin|btc|ETH|Ethereum|XRP Profit|XRP Retail|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-20 06:00:34

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-the-pendulum-has-swung-in-xrps-favour-heres-why/,"XRP spent years facing doubt from traders and analysts. Many expected that institutional interest would remain limited. That expectation is now fading. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto commentator on X, highlighted this change. He shared a recent discussion between Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and Scott Melker. His post pointed to a clear shift in tone as the industry begins to treat XRP as a serious focus. It’s crazy watching the narrative flip in real-time… They were skeptical of $XRP for YEARS now they're openly calling the XRP community “huge, committed, and excited The pendulum has swung. The tone shifted from “XRP? Nah” ➜ to “XRP is a priority focus. pic.twitter.com/4QCulzm1W3 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 16, 2025 A Clear Change From Industry Leaders In the video he shared, Melker dubbed XRP’s base a “huge community that is excited.” Hougan described XRP as “a reasonable project.” He said he is not surprised that recent XRP product launches show strong engagement because there are people who love XRP. The remarks showed how sentiment has moved. Hougan acknowledged that some crypto investors still view XRP with skepticism. However, he stressed that this does not affect the asset’s momentum. He pointed to a huge committed community that continues to drive demand. Xaif used the conversation to show how different the market now sounds compared to previous years. The language has shifted from hesitation to recognition. Institutional Entry Builds Ahead of a Key Launch This moment arrives as Bitwise prepares to launch its XRP ETF between November 19 and 20. The firm plans to enter the market with the lowest fee among competing XRP funds. The pricing is a deliberate move to capture early interest from investors seeking efficient exposure. It also shows Bitwise’s confidence in the asset’s demand profile. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Xaif’s post ties this development into the larger trend. XRP is no longer treated as a fringe product. Major firms are positioning themselves to compete for market share . The timing, combined with rising institutional attention, marks the real change in how XRP fits into the wider investment landscape. Community Support Shapes the Asset’s Momentum Community support remains central to this shift. Both Hougan and Melker acknowledged the active and loyal XRP user base. Their remarks align with what long-time holders have demonstrated through years of market cycles. As Xaif noted, “It’s crazy watching the narrative flip in real-time.’ The community stayed present even during difficult periods. Institutions now see stability as a strategic advantage. Xaif highlighted this point as part of his broader message. The negative sentiment that once surrounded XRP has weakened. The community’s consistency, combined with upcoming institutional products, has increased XRP’s market relevance.

South Korean exchange giant Coinone just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s creating waves across the crypto community. The platform revealed plans for a significant Band Protocol rebranding initiative that promises to reshape how investors perceive and interact with this innovative blockchain project. What Does the Band Protocol Rebranding Actually Mean? The Band Protocol rebranding represents more than just a cosmetic change. Coinone confirmed they’re streamlining the project’s name from ‘Band Protocol’ to simply ‘Band,’ while maintaining the familiar BAND ticker symbol. This strategic move aims to create a cleaner, more memorable brand identity in the crowded cryptocurrency marketplace. Think about it – simpler names often stick better in people’s minds. The updated logo will complement this new direction, though specific design details remain under wraps. This isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about positioning Band for broader adoption and recognition. Why Would Coinone Initiate This Rebranding Now? Market evolution drives strategic decisions, and the Band Protocol rebranding comes at a pivotal time. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, projects need clear, distinctive identities that resonate with both seasoned traders and newcomers. Consider these key benefits driving this change: Enhanced brand recognition – Simpler names are easier to remember and share Market positioning – Standing out in a competitive landscape User accessibility – Reducing complexity for new investors Future growth – Preparing for expanded adoption and use cases How Will This Band Protocol Rebranding Affect Investors? If you’re holding BAND tokens, you might wonder how this Band Protocol rebranding impacts your investments. The good news is that the fundamental technology and tokenomics remain unchanged. Your BAND tokens will continue functioning exactly as before, with the same utility and value proposition. However, successful rebranding often brings increased visibility and potentially broader adoption. As more people recognize and understand the project through its simplified identity, demand could naturally increase. This strategic move demonstrates the team’s commitment to growth and market relevance. What Challenges Might This Rebranding Face? While the Band Protocol rebranding offers numerous advantages, it’s not without potential hurdles. Transition periods can create confusion among existing community members and investors accustomed to the original branding. Clear communication and consistent messaging will be crucial during this phase. Additionally, the crypto community is known for its strong attachments to established brands. Winning over skeptics and ensuring smooth transition across all platforms and exchanges will require coordinated effort and transparent execution. Looking Ahead: The Future After Band Protocol Rebranding This bold Band Protocol rebranding initiative signals confidence and forward-thinking strategy. By simplifying their identity while maintaining core functionality, Band positions itself for the next phase of blockchain adoption. The move suggests the team is thinking long-term about market positioning and user experience. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues evolving, such strategic pivots become increasingly important. Projects that adapt and refine their messaging while delivering solid technology tend to thrive in competitive markets. Frequently Asked Questions Will the BAND token ticker change? No, the BAND ticker symbol will remain unchanged across all exchanges and trading platforms. When will the Band Protocol rebranding take effect? Coinone hasn’t announced specific dates, but typically such transitions happen over several weeks to ensure smooth implementation. Do I need to do anything with my BAND tokens? No action is required from token holders. Your existing BAND tokens will automatically reflect the new branding across supported platforms. Will this affect Band Protocol’s technology or partnerships? The rebranding is purely cosmetic and doesn’t impact the underlying technology, existing partnerships, or development roadmap. Why keep the BAND ticker if changing the name? Maintaining the BAND ticker ensures continuity for traders and prevents confusion in markets where the symbol is already established. Will other exchanges follow Coinone’s lead? While not confirmed, it’s common for major exchanges to coordinate on significant branding changes to maintain consistency across platforms.

The company will begin by developing its own data centers in Texas and New York City in partnership with Fluidstack. The first facilities are scheduled to open in 2026. The project is expected to create thousands of jobs and strengthen the U.S. position in the global technology race. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told CNBC that the investment will help build “more powerful AI systems” capable of driving major scientific breakthroughs. Rising AI Spending Sparks Bubble Concerns The scale of financial commitments in the industry has reached unprecedented levels. Oracle has reportedly concluded a $300 billion cloud-services contract with OpenAI, while Meta, recognized as an extremist organization in Russia plans to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. Yet these investments remain far ahead of actual earnings. According to the Financial Times, the combined valuations of ten leading AI startups, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI — have surged by nearly $1 trillion in just a year, despite most of them still operating at a loss. Investor Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2008 mortgage crisis, recently closed his hedge fund Scion Capital, saying its valuation models were “no longer in sync with the markets.” On X, Burry accused major tech firms of artificially boosting profits by using overly aggressive depreciation schedules on AI hardware, which typically lasts only two to three years. He estimates this could understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, inflating Oracle's and Meta’s profits by over 20%. Jared Bernstein, former chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers, also warned that an AI bubble is a “likely outcome,” citing extreme valuations and a widening gap between investment and credible revenue expectations. He noted that the share of economic activity flowing into AI investment is now nearly a third higher than what flowed into the internet sector during the dot-com bubble. Harris Kupperman, founder of Praetorian Capital, estimates that AI data centers built in 2025 will face $40 billion in annual depreciation while generating only $15–20 billion in revenue. Optimists See a Foundation, Not a Bubble Not everyone sees a looming collapse. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC that massive spending on AI infrastructure is essential for maintaining U.S. competitiveness. “Investing in AI means not only buying GPUs and chips, but also investing in cooling systems, IT infrastructure, electrical networks, and power supplies,” Fink said. Physical limits, such as power grid capacity, construction bottlenecks, and chip availability could naturally slow down industry expansion, preventing purely speculative overreach. Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst, added a broader perspective: “Of course there’s a bubble. Bubbles are healthy. They channel capital and talent into a new trend, create losses, but also give birth to long-lasting companies that change the world.” Anthropic’s $50 billion commitment reflects the company’s belief in AI as a transformative force. Whether this marks the beginning of a technological renaissance or the inflation of a new financial bubble remains to be seen.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-20 06:14:11

This surprising scenario is playing out across America’s wealth management landscape. According to a groundbreaking survey, 35% of young, high-net-worth investors have made this exact move – all because their previous firms failed to provide adequate cryptocurrency access. Why Is Cryptocurrency Access Becoming a Deal-Breaker? The recent survey conducted by stablecoin infrastructure startup Zerohash reveals a seismic shift in investor priorities. When researchers polled 500 wealthy U.S. investors, they discovered that cryptocurrency access now ranks among the top criteria for choosing financial advisors.
