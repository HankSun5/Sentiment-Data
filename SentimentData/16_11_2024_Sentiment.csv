By highlighting Dogecoin’s resistance and support levels, the analyst has underscored the major hindrance to the meme coin hitting the $1 milestone. Dogecoin Price Roadmap To The $1 Target In his X post, Trading Jesus shared a Dogecoin chart on the 1-hour timeframe showing the support and resistance levels as the Dogecoin price aims for the $1 mark. Currently trading at $0.36, the crypto analyst has indicated that the next resistance level for Dogecoin is $0.44. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could See Swift 175% Surge As DOGE/BTC Pair Records Major Breakout This crucial level could trigger major selling pressures for the meme coin as investors start liquidating their holdings. However, if Dogecoin can successfully break above the $0.44 level, the meme coin could enter a bullish phase, with its next price high at around $0.56. Trading Jesus has highlighted the $0.56 price increase as a profit-taking level at which traders and investors could begin selling their Dogecoin for potential gains. The analyst has also pinpointed a higher resistance level at $0.73336 if Dogecoin can maintain its bullish momentum above that level. At the $0.73336 resistance level, Trading Jesus has predicted that Dogecoin could see its price surging to the highly coveted $1 milestone. His chart revealed Dogecoin’s next bullish target to be $0.996 if its price continues increasing. On the flip side, Trading Jesus has also shown the support levels for Dogecoin if it fails to break past key resistance levels. The first support at $0.34 represents a crucial level where buyers might step in if the price of Dogecoin drops. This support level ultimately acts as a barrier to prevent more price drops. If Dogecoin declines below the $0.34 support level, the cryptocurrency could experience further downward pressure, leading to a drop towards the $0.25 mark. If more pullbacks occur, Trading Jesus has revealed that the Dogecoin price could bottom to new lows around the $0.18 level. Analyst Remains Bullish Despite DOGE’s 8% Price Decline While analysts foresee the Dogecoin price hitting $1, others have predicted even higher all-time highs for the popular meme coin. A crypto analyst known as the ‘Cantonese Cat’ on X has unveiled a weekly DOGE price chart projecting a potential leap to $4. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Major Price Crash For Shiba Inu, But It’s Not All Bad News In the chart, the analyst indicated that Dogecoin is on its way to hitting the $0.42 price level at the 0.786 Fibonacci level. Breaking past this level could trigger a surge towards the 1.618 Fib, representing a price increase above $4.0. The Cantonese cat has revealed that investors and traders likely have three to four weeks to accumulate at Dogecoin’s current price of $0.36 before it shoots up to $4.

Gensler’s aggressive regulatory approach has irked many in the industry, particularly the Ripple executives. Today, critics are taking Gensler to court over what they claim as the agency’s “gross government overreach.” Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor According to Eleanor Terrett of Fox Business, 18 states are already frustrated with Gensler’s management style, affecting the crypto industry. Republican attorney generals, including Kentucky’s Russell Coleman, are leading the lawsuit, arguing that the current SEC chair is bullying the sector. Lawsuit Argues That Gensler Is ‘Overstepping His Authority’ The states’ lawsuit reflects the growing discontent over Gensler’s approach to crypto regulation. According to Attorney General Coleman, the agency is trying to remove the regulatory authority away from states on cryptocurrency enforcement. 🚨SCOOP: 18 U.S. states have filed to sue the @SECGov and its commissioners, accusing them of unconstitutional overreach and unfair persecution of the #crypto industry under the leadership of agency chief @GaryGensler. The lawsuit, signed by 18 Republican Attorneys General,… pic.twitter.com/wxOovuIRQH — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 14, 2024 Gensler’s “regulation by enforcement” removes the states’ control over regulation and deprives them of the opportunity to define their economic policies. The attorneys further explained that the agency’s crypto crackdown is intense, aggressive, and far removed from its original mandate. According to the petitioners, Gensler’s management style is more about control than upholding the law or protecting consumers. The lawsuit aims to stop Gensler from aggressively attacking the industry and instead create clear and established rules for stakeholders. Gensler’s Long-Running Feud With Crypto The crypto industry currently sees Gensler as its enemy. Immediately after becoming SEC chief, Gensler led investigations and inquiries against the most prominent crypto companies. He has consistently argued that many companies work in “legal gray zones.” Ripple Labs, the developer of XRP, has a long-running feud with the SEC over the sale of its digital token. The regulator has argued that the company broke the law by selling tokens (XRP) without registering these as securities. Last year, Ripple Labs scored a court victory when US district judge Analisa Torres found Ripple’s XRP was covered by the country’s securities law when marketed to institutional investors.

He emphasized that courts have consistently supported the agency’s actions aimed at protecting investors, rejecting claims that the SEC lacks the authority to enforce securities laws. However, with Republican Donald Trump winning the selections, Gensler may have a few options left. Trump has consistently signaled his support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and promised to replace him as SEC chair once he starts work in the Oval Office.

Despite a 90% YTD rise, Bitcoin remains below its inflation-adjusted all-time high, with recent progress and future catalysts yet to be fully priced in. Trump’s pro-crypto stance, including potential regulatory reforms and initiatives like a US Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve, could significantly boost Bitcoin's adoption and price. Risks include regulatory uncertainty and the challenge of achieving bipartisan support for pro-crypto legislation, which could impact Bitcoin's adoption and price trajectory. Investment Thesis It is becoming increasingly difficult not be bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the stars are starting to align: Trump’s election and the institutional and corporate adoption trends hint to a sustained bullish move for BTC over a longer period of time, beyond charts and BTC cyclical pattern. Bitcoin Price YTD (GuruFocus) While Bitcoin is already up over 90% YTD and considerably outperformed both the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, I do believe that the integral part of the performance until now was a catch-up move to recover from the bear market. From an inflation-adjusted basis , Bitcoin just passed its 2021 all-time high and both the progress achieved recently and the near future catalysts still have to be priced in. Bitcoin Price YTD (GuruFocus) Bitcoin Price 3Y (GuruFocus) Trump Election While Kamala Harris was not a critic of the crypto sphere, Donald J. Trump was perceived as a much stronger backer of favorable crypto legislation. There is a double reason to that: the Democratic party and Trump himself. Indeed, the Democratic party is overall perceived as more negative with regards to crypto because the most vocal anti-crypto public figures stem from that party, in particular Elizabeth Warren (US Senator) and Gary Gensler (SEC Chair). Elizabeth Warren called Bitcoin “ a plaything for terrorists and money launderers "". Gary Gensler in his role of SEC Chair famously said about crypto “ it’s unlikely this stuff is going to be a currency .” The SEC sued Ripple in 2020 (before Gensler took office) claiming the company illegally raised money by selling a token (XRP) without registering it as a security. Since Gensler became SEC Chair, the number of lawsuits and fines rapidly multiplied leaving crypto market participants a sentiment of being somewhat persecuted: under Gensler’s SEC, the crypto industry received more than 100 enforcement actions through 2023 and spent over $400 mn defending itself against Gensler . Gensler’s SEC has been marked by a strong preference for enforcement over legal clarification. And that’s where Trump comes into play: he emerged as the most crypto-friendly candidate, as shows the 9% intraday surge of BTC reaching a new all-time high at $76,000 on the day of his election. He had announced at the Bitcoin Conference 2024 that he would “ fire Gary Gensler on Day 1 ”. While legally he cannot fire Gensler, just like he cannot fire Powell, the former did remain silent and it is broadly assumed that Gensler will leave office (unlike Powell who already confirmed that he is not leaving). Trump has several other arguments that could cause Bitcoin to continue rallying as new details are disclosed and announcements are made. The first one is that has skin in the game: he owns a crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. This project of governance platform is new and the launch has not been particularly successful. And per se that doesn’t matter: it’s the fact that he is open to cryptos to the point of launching his own crypto firm. In addition, his connections to the crypto world make it likely that he will appoint pro-crypto advisors and people in key positions. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, already announced that his firm will act as a crypto advisor for a Trump administration . Last but not least, Trump also announced the goal to create a US Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve where all confiscated Bitcoins would be held, and promised to make the US the “capital of crypto”. Adoption Trends The adoption trends show encouraging signs that more people invest more into Bitcoin. Indeed, November 7 was the single best day of BTC ETF inflows since the launch of those ETFs. ETF Inflows (CoinGlass) BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) alone registered $1.1 bn of net inflows, roughly 82% of the total $1.34 bn ETF inflows. There is also a noticeable uptrend in ETF inflows since June. On top of the ETF inflows, which are primarily indicative of institutional investors adoption, there is another metric that shows bullish signs: the corporate adoption trends. Indeed, as of today 29 different publicly companies own Bitcoin . All together, they own close to 2% of the BTC supply and the top holder is MicroStrategy Inc. ( MSTR ) which stock is up approximately 400% YTD, showing the markets appreciate the BTC accumulation strategy of the company co-founded by Michael Saylor. Corporate Holdings of BTC (CoinGecko) The list quite logically includes primarily crypto miners and crypto exchanges, but companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla Inc. (TSLA), and Block Inc. ( SQ ) are non-crypto firms holding BTC. And they have all outperformed the major US indexes on a 1-year basis, which shows that the markets likely value positively the holdings of BTC by listed companies, especially in a BTC uptrend phase. Risks As for every investment, there are risks. The high reward profile of the asset since inception compensates for the risks, although those have to be taken into account. The main risk to adoption uptrend is continued regulatory lack of clarity: a simple “no” of Gary Gensler not leaving the SEC Chair role could significantly impact BTC price but also adoption trends. If the SEC, whether chaired by Gary Gensler or someone else, does not manage to work on a comprehensive approach of clarity above enforcement, potential new BTC adopters, especially institutional and corporate, may prefer to remain on the sidelines. Additionally, President-elect Trump may surround himself with pro-crypto advisors and legal counsels to draft new regulatory propositions. However these pieces of legislation need to pass both Houses (House of Representatives and Senate). And it could be particularly intricate to achieve a bipartisan agreement on a clear and positively worded framework on a topic still as controversial as crypto. Bottom Line Beyond technical analysis based on charts that are often based on past patterns, Bitcoin’s continued outperformance may start to be disconnected from past cycles. Indeed, this is the first time the US have a pro-crypto President (Trump during his first mandate was still a crypto skeptic) willing to reach out to the crypto community to draft a new regulatory environment that would be more positive for crypto participants. A clearer legal framework could further boost adoption trends, particularly ETF inflows and corporate adoption. Ultimately, Bitcoin could be poised for a more solid, longer term uptrend beyond charts.",BSQKZ|IBIT|MSTR|SQ|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-16 00:05:53

Its break below this key level could pave the way for even greater losses, leaving traders to question whether the bulls can stage a comeback or if further declines are inevitable. As downside risks grow, this analysis aims to examine WIF’s recent drop below the critical $3.582 support level and explore the potential implications of this bearish shift for future price movement. By assessing current market sentiment, key technical indicators, and possible support zones, we seek to determine whether WIF is positioned for more losses or if a reversal may be on the horizon. Examining WIF’s Drop Below The Critical $3.582 Support Level On the 4-hour chart, WIF has recently broken below the $3.582 level, triggering bearish momentum as the price moves toward the $2.896 support range and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). As the bearish trend develops, the market is closely watching for any signs of stabilization or a deeper slide toward key support zones. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped from the overbought zone to 53%, signaling a reduction in upward momentum. This move toward neutral territory suggests that buying pressure may be waning, and market participants will be looking for indications of continued decline or a potential shift in momentum. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Set To Skyrocket 2,500%, Predicts Renowned Economist On the daily chart, WIF is showing strong negative strength, highlighted by a bearish candlestick pattern that has pushed the price below the critical $3.582 support. This pattern indicates that sellers are firmly in control of the market, relentlessly driving the price lower, prompting a strong likelihood of further drops in the near term. An analysis of the 1-day RSI suggests WIF may face extended losses as it has dropped from a high of 80% to 64%, indicating a reduction in buying pressure. Typically, this decline points to a possible weakness of bullish momentum, with more downward pressure likely if the RSI continues to wane. Potential Support Zones To Watch If WIF Continues To Drop If WIF continues to drop, key support zones to watch out for include the $2.896 level, which has previously acted as a critical point for price stabilization. Below this, the next support level to monitor is positioned around $2.257, where WIF may find additional buying interest. A break below these levels could open the door to further declines toward other psychological support zones.

The analyst further explained what to expect from the flagship crypto moving forward, having entered this phase of the bull run. What To Expect From Bitcoin In ‘Thrill’ Phase In an X post, Ash Crypto revealed that Bitcoin is entering the thrill phase. Based on this, he told market participants to expect high volatility and more liquidation. Overall, the analyst remarked that the Bitcoin price trend will be to the upside as it continues to hit new all-time highs (ATHs). He predicts that BTC will rally to as high as $150,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Major Price Crash For Shiba Inu, But It’s Not All Bad News His accompanying chart showed that the thrill phase of the market cycle is when investors and traders may get overexcited about the bull rally and decide to go all in with leverage. However, as Ash Crypto indicated, this could go wrong since there will be a lot of liquidations during this period. Despite this being a bull market, the Bitcoin price has, at different times, corrected after reaching new highs and flushing out over-leveraged longs in the process. Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Research, also explained earlier in the year that bull markets aren’t straight lines up and that significant price corrections are expected. However, in the long run, the bears get the short end of the stick in a bull run as prices trend upwards. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently revealed that over $800 million will be liquidated if Bitcoin rebounds towards $93,000. This is a price level that BTC just reached two days ago as it rallied to a new ATH of $93,400. The Bitcoin price has since corrected and dropped below $90,000. This was partly due to the US PPI inflation data, which was higher than forecasted. That development has cast some doubts about whether the Fed will be willing to further cut interest rates in December. More Price Correction In The Short Term? Ali Martinez suggested that the Bitcoin price could experience further declines in the short term. In an X post, the crypto analyst said that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that Bitcoin is in overbought territory, which typically signals a potential price correction ahead. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Drive The Dogecoin Price To $1 This Bull Market This price correction could also happen as Bitcoin investors look to secure profits. Martinez revealed that $5.2 billion in BTC profits have been realized and that the sell-side risk ratio has surged to 0.524%. He warned market participants to stay alert and proceed with caution. Bhutan Government falls among whales that are already securing profits as they recently sold $33 million worth of BTC, just weeks after selling $66 million BTC. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,780, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

SHIB, the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization, is now trading at approximately $0.00002803 with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.69 billion. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Watch: 60% Rally Catches Whale Attention – Is More Growth Ahead? This steep surge inspired a new wave of enthusiasm among investors, both retail and institutional, as SHIB continues to prove itself to be more viable in the meme coin space. The upward rise of the coin sparked interest on X (Twitter), a site that has garnered over 41,300 postings mentioning SHIB in recent hours, keeping the speculation going. $SHIB ❤️❤️💥❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/k2TmXwhPil — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) November 13, 2024 Lucie’s Bullish Outlook For Shiba Inu Lucie, the marketing director of Shiba Inu, has been publicly vocal about her favorable assessment of the token, asserting that SHIB will soon achieve a price target of $0.00006. She recently emphasized SHIB’s exceptional lifetime performance in a tweet, which includes an astonishing increase of over 1.9 million percent against the dollar since its inception. The tweet created interest, and propelled SHIB to a seven-month high of $0.00003031 then sold off slightly, despite the fact that Lucie did not give an exact timeline as when this should happen. Her enthusiasm is contagious, and many investors are holding out at this point awaiting SHIB to continue on its upward trend, potentially reaching new heights to surpass its October 2021 all-time high of $0.00008616. Whale Activity Indicates Profit-Taking Opportunity Along with the price increase, SHIB has seen increased activity from large holders, or “whales,” who are frequently major market movers. Recently, a whale with the address “0xd6b” returned to the market after an eight-month absence, coinciding with SHIB’s recent advances. This whale, an early investor who previously profited $120 million from SHIB, transferred 100 billion SHIB, worth $2.81 million, to the Gemini Exchange. This move shows that the whale may be profiting from the continued rally. While such moves frequently foreshadow a possible cooling spell, they also indicate that significant investors are closely monitoring SHIB’s price behavior, which contributes to overall market sentiment. Looking Ahead: Could Altcoins Surge? As Shiba Inu maintains its recent momentum, the future is bright. While Lucie has cautioned that we may not yet be experiencing a full “Altcoin Season,” SHIB’s burgeoning social media presence and excitement over its possible rally suggest a shift in investor opinion. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor The anticipation of a breakout that can take SHIB up to new levels has left the investors quite bullish, and most are waiting for possible developments in the market.

Key Reasons Explained,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-is-xrp-price-up-today-key-reasons-explained/,"The XRP price is experiencing a significant uptick, rising 20% over the past two days and an impressive 47% in the last five days. The surge can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including speculation surrounding SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s potential resignation, favorable regulatory tailwinds under the incoming Trump administration, increased whale activity, and a notable technical breakout. #1 Speculation About SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s Resignation A primary driver behind XRP’s recent price movement is the growing speculation regarding the possible resignation of Gary Gensler, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On November 14, Gensler delivered a speech at the Practicing Law Institute’s 56th annual conference on securities regulation, where he lauded the efforts of the SEC. “It’s been a great honor to serve with them, doing the people’s work, and ensuring that our capital markets remain the best in the world,” Gensler stated. The crypto community on Xinterprets this speech as a potential farewell address, especially in light of the upcoming transition following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Investors anticipate that the Trump administration will appoint a pro-crypto chairman to lead the SEC. “I will fire Gary Gensler on day one,” Trump pledged during the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, echoed these sentiments on X: “Joined Cantor’s annual Crypto Conference today – safe to say that the US is ready to be the crypto capital of the world with the next Trump Administration. Also an apt shirt to wear..on perhaps what are Gary Gensler’s last days in office?!” After Gensler’s resignation, there’s speculation that the SEC might reconsider its appeal against Ripple Labs, potentially alleviating regulatory pressures that have weighed heavily on the XRP price over the last years. #2 Regulatory Tailwinds For XRP Under Trump The anticipated policy shift under the incoming Trump administration is another critical factor contributing to the XRP price appreciation. The administration is reportedly preparing to adopt a more permissive stance toward crypto, with plans to appoint industry-friendly candidates to key regulatory positions. “Chatted with Tony Romm about how the incoming Trump Administration is already engaging proactively with the crypto industry on clear rules of the road… what a breath of fresh air!” Garlinghouse remarked today on X. Further emphasizing the potential positive impact, Garlinghouse stated via X: “I’ve shared some thoughts on what the Trump administration could mean for crypto and wanted to also recognize the XRP family’s patience and unwavering support. A lot has happened since XRP was the 2nd most valuable digital asset. It’s been – at times – a frustrating journey. ~6 years since the SEC started meddling in the crypto market, picking winners and losers… ~4 years since the SEC sued Ripple. He added, “Now FINALLY we see a light at the end of the tunnel as these external (frankly unnatural and manipulative) market factors fade. The tides are shifting, headwinds are turning to tailwinds, and the opportunity for those of us who believe in the future for XRP is enormous!” #3 Increased XRP Whale Activity Whale activity, indicative of large-scale investments by major holders, has also played a significant role in the XRP price surge. On-chain analysis firm Santiment reports on X: “Wallets with at least 1M XRP now hold a combined 45.61B tokens, their highest amount held since June 2018. In the past 2 years, whales & sharks have reversed course and accumulated 3.44B more XRP, a +8.16% increase. Traders have enjoyed a +40% return in the past 7 days.” #4 Technical Breakout Complementing the fundamental drivers are technical factors contributing to the XRP price action. XRP has broken above a six-year-long symmetrical triangle pattern, a significant technical indicator that suggests the potential for sustained upward momentum. Historically, such breakouts have preceded notable price increases, and in XRP’s case, the price had previously declined by as much as 97% during the formation of this pattern. At press time, XRP traded at $0.85.

Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-to-800k-galaxy-digital-ceo-unveils-bold-5-10-year-forecast/,"Now that Bitcoin short-term price action remains bullish, driven by US President Donald Trump’s vocal support for crypto, analysts ponder the following question: How will Bitcoin perform in five to 10 years? For Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, using gold as a benchmark, Bitcoin can hit $800,000 in five to 10 years. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor In a Bloomberg Television interview, Novogratz joins other analysts on their bullish take on the top digital asset. He added that Bitcoin will remain upward and trade at $800k in the next five to 10 years, approximating gold’s $16 trillion market value. Bitcoin To Match Gold’s Market Cap: Analysts Trump’s win is arguably one of the triggers for Bitcoin’s recent price action. A few days ago, Bitcoin edged out silver in the list of Top 10 assets in the market cap department. Today, the digital asset tops Saudi Aramco on the same list, with a valuation of $1.79 trillion. With the continuous climb in digital assets, many ask if they match gold’s market cap. According to Novogratz, the shift in market interest among the new generation of consumers and traders is helping Bitcoin. He stated that today’s investors prefer Bitcoin, which is considered a digital store of value. Aside from Novogratz, other market analysts and industry personalities use gold as Bitcoin’s benchmark. For example, Howard Lutnick and Anthony Scarammucci have also compared both assets, saying that Bitcoin will beat gold’s market cap soon. Bitcoin To Trade In $500k Level If It Becomes Part Of US Reserve The Galaxy Digital founder also predicts that Bitcoin’s price will hit $500k if the US government decides to integrate the digital asset as part of the Treasury. Novogratz made this bold projection based on the current bullish trend and potentially favorable policies for crypto. Novogratz added that if the US decides to acquire up to 1 million BTC, then this will force other governments to invest as well, pushing the demand. In addition, Trump’s support for Bitcoin and crypto is also fueling the bullish run of the asset. Novogratz Not Confident On Government’s Decision To Add BTC As Reserve Asset Although Novogratz identifies a $500k target, he thinks the US Treasury will likely not add this asset. He predicts that there’s a considerable chance the bill may not pass the Senate’s approval, although the House gives its go-signal. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Watch: 60% Rally Catches Whale Attention – Is More Growth Ahead? Novogratz remains bullish on Bitcoin and advises the US government to acquire more and double down on its campaign to promote digital assets. He added that the government doesn’t need to support the USD with other assets. In the same Bloomberg interview, he further shared that he’s heavily invested in Bitcoin and will welcome the possibility of the reserve bill getting approved.

This development, highlighted by a CryptoQuant analyst known as G a a h, points out a notable change in BTC’s investor behavior within the crypto space and also suggests quite an interesting trend for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crosses $93,000 – Is There More Room for Gains or Are We Nearing a Peak? Bitcoin Reserves On Exchanges Reach Five-Year Low According to the analyst, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have diminished significantly throughout 2024, reflecting a shift towards long-term holding strategies among market participants. This trend suggests that investors increasingly transfer their assets to private wallets, reducing the supply available for immediate sale and contributing to buying pressure in a market already constrained by supply. According to G a a h, this behavior indicates a broader sentiment shift, with market participants displaying increased confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value amidst “economic uncertainty and rising inflation.” By moving Bitcoin away from exchanges, investors reduce the likelihood of sudden sell-offs, which can lead to increased price stability. However, the reduced supply on exchanges may also lead to heightened volatility, especially if demand continues to grow or remains consistent. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: With that said, this scenario signals a potentially more volatile but more resilient Bitcoin market, with less selling pressure and a growing dominance of long-term holders, which could open up space for new price peaks. BTC’s Upward Momentum Cools Off Following an all-time high (ATH) of $93,477 on Wednesday, November 13, BTC has faced quite a noticeable correction, now down by 4% from this peak. So far, the asset has been unable to continue its upward momentum and appears to be seeing more sell-offs. When writing, Bitcoin trades below $90,000 with a current trading price of $89,779, down by 1.4% in the past day. This price decline resulted in roughly $49 billion subtracted from its market capitalization valuation on Wednesday. For context, as of today, BTC’s market cap sits at $1.775 trillion, a nearly 5% decrease from the $1.835 trillion valuation two days ago. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume dropped from over $100 billion earlier this week to below $85 billion.

Although the top cryptocurrency has witnessed a slight pullback in the past 24 hours, rebounding to an earlier price level could spell trouble for the bears. Bitcoin Bears Could Be Under Trouble According to analysis shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on X, more than $800 million is at risk of liquidation if the flagship digital asset reclaims the $93,000 price level. Notably, BTC’s current ATH stands at $93,477. Related Reading: Binance Dominates As Bitcoin Futures Volume Hits New Peaks Amid Historic Price Rally At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $89,480, down 1.9% in the past 24 hours. On the 4-hour chart, BTC’s next prominent support level appears to be around the $86,000. The digital asset has already tested this support level three times, and a further dip to this price could send BTC tumbling toward $81,600, its next major support. If BTC fails to hold above $81,600, a decline to $79,700 may follow. While a lower BTC price would favor the bears, a reclaim of the $93,000 level could severely hurt them. Such a move would risk over $800 million in liquidations, potentially forcing bearish traders to capitulate. Data from Coinglass shows that contracts worth more than $508 million were liquidated in the past 24 hours. Of this, $355 million were long, while $153 million were short. A recent analysis by prominent crypto analyst @CryptoKaleo suggests that Martinez’s warning for bears may be justified. According to @CryptoKaleo, BTC could retrace to $86,000 before embarking on another rally to set new ATHs – possibly beyond $100,000. The analyst stated: Just a little dip and a bit more ranging then send to $100K+. Honestly think this is the best case scenario for alts if we somehow get it. Would look for outperformance while BTC is accumulating around $90K. What’s Behind BTC’s Run? Multiple factors have contributed to BTC’s historic price action, including the halving earlier this year, the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising institutional adoption of the digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Surpass 1 Million BTC Holdings In Less Than A Year Since Launch – Details Inside However, Trump’s win in the 2024 US presidential elections – a result seen as pro-crypto – served as a major catalyst for BTC’s surge. Since Trump’s victory on November 5, BTC has climbed from around $69,000 to a high of $93,000, recording gains of more than 30% in just 10 days. Despite this impressive price rally, experts suggest that BTC may have further room to grow. For instance, a recent research report predicts that BTC’s bullish momentum could continue until mid-2025 when it is expected to peak. Additionally, relatively low profit-taking during this bull run could further propel BTC to new heights. However, bulls should remain cautious of a significant CME gap around the $78,000 level, which could be a magnet for price correction. At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at $2.904 trillion, reflecting a 3.7% decline over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance is at 60.97%, underscoring BTC’s continued strength in the market.

Trump's victory has fuelled optimism in the crypto market, leading to significant gains in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. If Trump delivers his promises, Bitcoin could further stretch gains to $100,000 or even $110,000, making it a multi-trillion dollar asset. Risks include potential profit-taking and the possibility that Trump's promises were mere campaign tactics, which could lead to a significant pullback in Bitcoin's price. On Wednesday, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) spiked to hit a new all-time high of $93,409 mainly driven by President-elect Trump’s victory on November 4. The crypto community is buoyed by what Trump promised during his re-election campaign rather than anything he’s already delivered to the industry. Trump's win has been good for crypto During the Bitcoin event in Nashville, Trump promised that if elected, he would fire the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, Gary Gensler. Gensler's tenure has seen the SEC charge several cryptocurrency companies, including Binance, Coinbase ( COIN ), Robinhood’s ( HOOD ) crypto unit, and others, for allegedly breaching securities laws. The president-elect also promised to make Bitcoin a reserve currency in the U.S., and most importantly, advocated for a crypto-friendly regulation. Both these two promises are particularly exciting to the crypto community, due to the potential impact it would have on the global markets. Trump’s huge election win explains why many crypto traders are optimistic about the future, and thus the current rally that has seen Bitcoin trade above $90,000, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) cross $3,200 and several other altcoins hit new all-time highs. However, sentiment-driven rallies tend to be short-lived, which is why, even if Bitcoin hits $100,000 before January, it could still experience a pullback in the weeks or months following Trump’s swearing-in. Trump's win can have a better impact Firstly, once the sentimentality is out of the window, investors will begin to assess their options with a longer-term view whilst keeping a close eye on Trump’s ability to deliver on his promises. If Trump made Bitcoin a reserve currency in the U.S., it could be a matter of time before other countries do the same, in which case, it would result in increased demand for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. There has been a lot of debate about whether or not Bitcoin has essentially replaced gold as a safe-haven asset, with some research failing to yield conclusive results after putting the theory to the test. The crypto community will also be watching to see what measures Trump takes towards implementing a regulatory framework that encourages crypto innovation and attracts more mainstream players to the industry. Investors will want to see progress from the previous administration. Whilst the SEC may be seen as being one of the stumbling blocks for the crypto industry in the U.S. over the last three years, it also made some key regulatory milestones with the approvals of Spot Bitcoin and Spot Ethereum ETFs. Since the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) has surged to a market cap of $40.9 billion, making it one of the biggest ETFs across all categories. BlackRock is one of the several traditional asset managers that expanded their product offerings to include digital assets in January. $100,000 may not necessarily be the short-term ceiling Trading View Technically, Bitcoin has completed an upward channel breakout to trade above $90,000. The latest spike in price comes hot on the heels of the pre-election gains that saw the BTC-USD rally from about $52,000 in September to over $73,000 at the start of November. The last time Bitcoin experienced such a rally was between January and March after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs. But what Bitcoin is experiencing now is a spike never seen before, after setting a new record daily gain of $8.4k on Monday. Given the intense buying activity over the past ten days, many have started to predict that the BTC-USD could hit $100,000 before the end of the year. But given it’s already trading above $90,000, unless some profit-taking kicks in even $110,000 looks realistic at this point. If Bitcoin hits $110, it will be worth north of $2.1 trillion, becoming a multi-trillion dollar asset for the first time. However, if Bitcoin experiences some profit-taking, potentially halting its climb in the short term, declines below its post-Spot ETF approvals high are unlikely. Still, the $55,000 level provides long-term support, which could become effective if Trump takes longer than anticipated to begin to implement his ‘crypto manifesto’. Stephen Wundke, Strategy and Revenue Director at quantitative digital asset investment firm Algoz, who claims to have successfully predicted the path of the BTC price this year to date, believes that if Trump delivers on his word to the crypto community, the macroeconomic forces would likely play a huge role in rallying the bitcoin price and the crypto market overall. Wundke who believes much of Bitcoin’s price movement this year has been dictated by macroeconomic factors also can’t wait to see if the pioneer cryptocurrency maintains this trend or deviates to take an independent path. “If the broader-based, crypto market and its various altcoins is also to enjoy a strong rally then it will be because President-Elect Trump is good to his word from the BTC Nashville Conference, where he laid out a strong case for the integration of cryptocurrency into the mainstream of federal finance,” Wundke argued, responding to my commentary outreach. However, it remains to be seen whether or not Trump made those promises for campaign purposes without having any intention of honouring them. There is already speculation that the SEC chair Gary Gensler will resign at the end of December, which generally would fulfill one of Trump’s first promises. During the Nashville Bitcoin event, the President-Elect vowed to fire Gensler on day one. Once that happens, traders will be looking forward to the plans that Trump will put in place to deliver his other promises, starting with appointing a more crypto-friendly person to be the chair of the SEC and then establishing a Bitcoin treasury. Risks Bitcoin’s latest rally has attracted significant inflows, which means at some point in the near future, some investors may start taking profits. That could lead to a significant pullback in the BTC-USD price, as has been the case multiple times in the past. From a fundamental perspective, if Trump fails to put measures in place to deliver on his promises, investors could interpret his remarks at the Nashville Bitcoin event as nothing than campaign tactics, in which case, Bitcoin could begin to shed a lot of the gains it has made over the past three months. Conclusion While Bitcoin’s latest rally is driven by Trump’s big election win, many traders will be waiting to see whether he delivers on the promises he made to the industry. After rallying to trade above $90,000, Bitcoin now seems destined to touch $100,000 by the end of the year, before potentially touching $110,000. The higher figure could be achieved based on how quickly Trump implements his ‘crypto manifesto’.",ETH-USD|IBIT|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-16 11:00:00

Analyst Forecast 2021-Like Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-ada-to-reach-6-by-september-2025-analyst-forecast-2021-like-rally/,"Cardano (ADA) has seen a massive rally in the last few weeks, surging over 81% in the past fourteen days. As the cryptocurrency continues breaking past key levels, a renowned crypto analyst highlighted its potential 2,000% climb. Related Reading: Analysts Bullish On Dogwifhat (WIF) $5 Target As Price Retests $4 Resistance Cardano To Hit $6 By Q3 2025 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez forecasted that Cardano might hit the $6 mark by September 2025. Earlier this year, the analyst noted that ADA’s chart reassembled a pattern similar to 2020, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could experience a rally like 2020-2021’s bull run. Per the post, ADA broke out from its two-year consolidation in early 2020 before retracing 75% and consolidating for most of the year. By November 2020, the token bounced from the accumulation range and started its massive 4,000% rally, which lasted around nine months. This year, Cardano has seen a similar move during the first leg of the cycle, reaching its year-high of $0.81 before retracing 75% and consolidating between the $0.6-$0.27 price range for the last eight months. Following the crypto market’s recent rally, fueled by Trump’s victory in the US elections and the Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce interest rates by 0.25, Cardano has experienced a massive 50% weekly surge. Martinez previously forecasted that ADA could experience the second leg’s initial jump on November 18, around two weeks after the US elections. However, the cryptocurrency reclaimed the $0.6 support zone and broke above the $0.65 horizontal level earlier today. This performance represents an eight-month high for Cardano, which has been heavily criticized for underperforming against most altcoins. According to the chart, ADA might move sideways around this range for the following days before challenging its year-high price. If ADA continues replicating the last cycle’s pattern, the cryptocurrency could reach the long-awaited $1 by year-end. Additionally, it could surpass its previous $3.09 all-time high (ATH) by Q1 2025 before entering price discovery mode. Martinez suggested that Cardano could rise over 2,000% toward the $6 mark, reaching its top between July and September 2025. ADA Among Today’s Market Leaders While most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 move sideways, ADA has soared 21 % in the last 24 hours. The token surged as the third-best performer today, behind XRP and ALGO. Besides the general economic and geopolitical factors, its recent performance has also been fueled by speculation surrounding Cardano’s potential involvement with Trump’s administration. On Thursday, a member of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the United Nations (UN), Shawn, shared on X that re-elected President Trump is exploring a federal voting and identity verification system based on blockchain technology. Related Reading: Dogecoin Frenzy Arrives In Korea: ‘Kimchi Premium’ Returns Amid DOGE’s 110% Rally Speculation arose when another X user claimed that Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson is “already in talks with the Trump administration,” arguing that “they’ve been working with the state of Wyoming on voting systems for a couple of years now.” Cardano has rallied an impressive 84% in the last month, breaking above the $0.65 mark for the first time since late March and recovering its top 10 crypto spot. As of this writing, ADA trades at $0.67.

Dogecoin Whales Have Just Added 140 Million DOGE To Their Wallets As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Dogecoin whales have continued their buying push during the last 24 hours. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which keeps track of the total amount of DOGE that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins group, for instance, contains all investors who own between 1 and 10 DOGE. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Is Finally Back: These Metrics Point To An Explosion In Interest In the context of the current topic, the 10 million to 100 million coins group is of focus. At the current exchange rate, the lower end of this range converts to about $3.7 million, while the upper one to $37 million. These are clearly significant amounts, so the only investors who would qualify for this cohort would be the big-money ones. The group certainly doesn’t include all holders of this kind as the upper limit is ‘just’ $37 million, but it does the contain smaller of the whales, who are still an important part of the DOGE ecosystem. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution specifically for this Dogecoin group over the past few weeks: From the above graph, it’s visible that the Dogecoin supply held by these whales has been riding an uptrend recently, with a particularly sharp increase coming during the past few days, coinciding with DOGE’s massive rally. Considering this timing, it’s likely that these investors have been helping support the run. In the last 24 hours, the memecoin has seen a reversal in direction, with its price suffering a pullback of around 7% as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has registered a red day. Interestingly, despite the decline, the Supply Distribution for the 10 million to 100 million coins group has continued to head up. In total, these humongous investors have added a net 140 million DOGE to their holdings, worth almost $52 million at the moment. This accumulation naturally suggests that the whales don’t think that the rally is over just yet. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Co. Take Over Social Media: Why Memecoin Frenzy Is Bad For Bitcoin It only remains to be seen, though, whether the positive sentiment from these large investors can induce a fresh surge in Dogecoin, or if their bet would fail this time around.

Analyst Explains",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/as-bitcoin-rises-why-is-ethereum-struggling-to-catch-up-analyst-explains/,"While Bitcoin has faced strong bullish momentum in recent weeks, achieving new all-time highs consistently for days, Ethereum has been an underperformer, unable to catch up with BTC’s bullish pace. Even compared to other crypto assets (altcoins) in the market, Ethereum has failed to make a major rally that melts faces. Instead, as Bitcoin achieved a peak above $93,000, leading the overall crypto market in a bullish market, Ethereum has only been able to surge to just $3,396 over the same period BTC broke multiple resistances to achieve consistent new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price at $3,000: Can Support Prevent Further Losses? So far, ETH remains roughly a 37.5% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878, seen 3 years ago in November 2021. At the time of writing, the asset faces a correction alongside the rest of the crypto market, including Bitcoin. ETH has declined by 2.3% in the past day, currently trading at $3,023. Why is Ethereum Struggling to Catch Up? The underperformance of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin has caught the attention of market analysts. One key observation comes from a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, who provided a possible explanation for Ethereum’s price stagnation. According to Darkfost, the taker buy-sell ratio is a crucial metric to consider, particularly on the Binance exchange. This ratio is an indicator of short-term market sentiment, and when it remains below 1, it suggests there is more selling pressure than buying interest. It can also indicate a hesitation among traders to accumulate ETH at current levels, which could contribute to a lagging price performance. Darkfost noted: The taker buy-sell ratio on Binance remains bearish, as it has been below 1 most of the time over the past month. This indicates that traders are more willing to sell than buy ETH, which could explain why ETH is currently underperforming compared to BTC. Is There Still Hope For ETH? Despite Ethereum’s struggle to match Bitcoin’s gains, some analysts remain optimistic about the long-term potential of ETH. For example, a well-known crypto analyst, Kingpin Crypto, expressed a bullish sentiment regarding ETH at its current price levels. In a recent post on X, Kingpin Crypto suggested that ETH trading around the $3,000 mark presents a notable buying opportunity. $ETH – Buy with conviction around the orange line and retire. I know the BTC pair is underwhelming and feels like it will be down only forever. However, I am telling you… Ethereum will make a NEW ATH this cycle. pic.twitter.com/T2r2TDmkb7 — Kingpin Crypto (@Kingpincrypto12) November 15, 2024 Similarly, another crypto analyst, Yoddha, shared an analysis indicating a potentially bullish pattern for Ethereum. According to the chart shared by Yoddha, ETH’s historical price movements often include a phase of retesting followed by a sharp surge in value. Yoddha highlighted that Ethereum may have already completed its retest phase, suggesting that a strong price rally could be on the horizon.

What could this mean for the price of the premier cryptocurrency? What Does The Falling NVT Golden Cross Mean For Price? In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Burakkesmeci revealed that the price of Bitcoin might have reached a “local bottom.” This exciting prognosis is based on the latest movement by the “NVT Golden Cross” metric. For context, the “Network Value to Transactions” ratio is an on-chain indicator that estimates the difference between the Bitcoin market capitalization and transaction volume. Typically, a high NVT value signals that an asset’s price is high compared to the network’s transaction volume, suggesting that the coin is overvalued. Related Reading: BNB Price Poised for Takeoff: Will It Be The Next to Rally? Conversely, when the value of the NVT metric is low, it implies that the coin’s market value is small relative to the transaction volume. Usually, this indicates that the asset is undervalued and its price could still have room for upside movement. Now, the Golden Cross indicator is a modified iteration of the NVT ratio, and it helps to mark gradual buy and sell zones in short-term trends. According to Burakkesmeci explained that when the NVT GC exceeds 2.2 (the red zone), it means that the price in a short-term trend is overheating (and the formation of a potential local top). On the other hand, the NVT Golden Cross dipping below -1.6 suggests that the price decline is wearing out, signaling a potential bottom. Burakkesmeci noted that these local tops and bottoms are regions rather than just precise levels. As shown in the chart above, the NVT Golden Cross has crossed beneath -1.6 and is currently around -3.3, suggesting that the Bitcoin price is at a local bottom. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, this could represent a “gradual buying opportunity” for investors looking to get into the market. Bitcoin Market In Extreme Greed Investors will want to proceed with caution especially as the Bitcoin market seems to be overheating in the long term. According to another CryptoQuant analyst, the Fear & Greed Index has flagged extreme greed for the premier cryptocurrency. Typically, when the Fear & Greed Index moves toward one end, there is a potential for market reversal depending on the sentiment. In this case, where the market is in extreme greed, the Bitcoin price may be about to witness a correction.

While Donald Trump’s success at the United States elections might have kickstarted the recent rally, the growth of the premier cryptocurrency — and the general crypto market — seems to have developed a life of its own. Interestingly, the market has been left wondering where the next market top is, with some pundits and commentators believing that the BTC price rally has come to an end. However, a prominent on-chain analytics firm has come forward to say that the Bitcoin price still has room for some upside movement. Four Reasons Why $100,000 Is Possible For Bitcoin Price: CryptoQuant In its latest weekly report, CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is yet to be overvalued despite its recent positive momentum. According to the blockchain platform, the market leader could soon reach the highly-coveted price level of $100,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Explodes 112% – Is $1 The New Target After This Historic Rally? The rationale behind this projection is based on valuable metrics, such as the MVRV (market value to realized value) ratio. As the name suggests, this indicator measures the ratio between the market value and the realized value of a cryptocurrency. As such, the MVRV helps to assess the tops and bottoms of the Bitcoin market. CryptoQuant noted that Bitcoin is not yet overvalued at the current price levels, as the MVRV metric is still outside the overvalued region. This ultimately means that the bullish price action is not overheated, and the Bitcoin price could still make a play for higher prices. What’s more, the Trader On-chain Realized max band is pointing to $100,000 as the next target for the Bitcoin price. According to CryptoQuant, the last time the max band reached its current level was in March 2024 when the premier cryptocurrency surpassed the $70,000 level for the first time. Another on-chain observation that supports the continuous Bitcoin price rally is the demand growth. CryptoQuant highlighted that investor demand in the United States has returned since the presidential election, with Coinbase Premium remaining positive in the past few days. Finally, crypto market liquidity has continued to increase over the past few weeks, as stablecoins make their onto exchanges. For context, more than $3.2 billion in USDT has flowed into exchanges since the US election, signaling the potential of a sustained Bitcoin price rally. Tread With Caution However, CryptoQuant sounded a warning in its report, saying that some selling action could follow the recent price rally. While some Bitcoin miners have started offloading their assets for profit, the blockchain firm also noted that the Bitcoin selling seen so far is still insignificant but could rise quickly soon.
