With the Ethereum ETF landscape still unfolding—staking approval likely months away—top analysts are already turning their focus to early-stage plays with asymmetric upside. And MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that charge. Why ETH ETF Staking Isn’t the Only Play This Cycle Ethereum’s momentum is undeniable. The SEC approved spot ETH ETFs in 2024, and now institutional inflows are at all-time highs. BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone commands $7.9 billion AUM, and new proposals to allow staking inside ETFs could unlock a wave of yield-hungry capital. However, the final greenlight isn’t expected until late October 2025 or Q1 2026, as IRS guidance and regulatory debates are still ongoing. That gives traders a limited-time window to capitalize on altcoins moving faster and earlier—especially tokens with the kind of raw upside Ethereum no longer offers. 21Shares Ethereum ETF Chart: JustETF While ETH ETFs have drawn in $2.27 billion in July alone and staking functionality is expected by Q4 2025, smart money isn’t waiting. They’re rotating early—into narratives, into momentum, into conviction-fueled assets that haven’t hit the mainstream yet. And the data is clear: MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer under the radar—it’s under accumulation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Where Culture Meets Catalysts This isn’t just another memecoin hoping for viral tweets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a culturally charged, zero-tax asset built for scale, momentum, and message. With a 170 billion fixed supply, fully audited contracts (by HashEx and CertiK), and no centralized token wallets, it’s designed for sustainable growth—not pump and dump mechanics. But it’s the on-chain activity that’s now confirming what analysts have hinted for weeks: New wallets up 137% in July Six-figure buys flagging across blockchain tracking tools Presale caps filling at record speed Telegram and X communities doubling weekly Early alpha groups and institutional Degen funds are labeling it the “next 100x legend”—not just for its upside, but for its timing. While the market obsesses over ETF delays and regulatory red tape, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already creating real wealth at the edge of visibility. It’s not just a trade. It’s a movement-powered opportunity with serious structural mechanics behind it. The 45,000% Potential—Why Analysts Are Confident Analysts tracking early-stage multipliers are now projecting up to 45,000% ROI for MAGACOIN FINANCE based on early entry, scarcity models, and compounding community momentum. That’s the kind of math that defined SHIBA INU’s rise—and it’s happening again, just with a very different token design and cultural alignment. Presale access is still open, but signs point to an imminent sellout. For those who waited too long on PEPE, DOGE, or FLOKI, this is the redo they didn’t think would come again. Conclusion Ethereum’s ETF and staking rollout will reshape the market—but that story is already priced in. MAGACOIN FINANCE is what’s next. With everything aligned—narrative, numbers, and next-wave timing—this could be the defining altcoin play of 2025. The window is open, but not for long.

According to journalist Eleanor Terrett in a post on X, Storm’s defense had requested General Partner Tom Schmidt to testify on communications touching on Tornado Cash Know Your Customer (KYC) considerations. He refused to testify, pleading the Fifth Amendment. “The defense had wanted Schmidt to testify, but he invoked the Fifth through his lawyer. It’s unclear whether he’ll be granted immunity (something the defense had reportedly been advocating for), or whether he’d testify if that happens.” Eleanor Trent His testimony might shed light on in-house deliberations of regulatory compliance, such as a 2020 email correspondence between Storm and his team asking for input on incorporating KYC features. Prosecutors have yet to confirm whether Schmidt will be offered immunity or whether he will be allowed to give evidence next week. Failure to testify may undermine Storms’ push to demonstrate that Tornado Cash thought about involving the regulator on matters relating to regulatory compliance prior to sanctions. Storm is accused of conspiracy to commit money laundering, operating an unregistered money transmitter, and breaching the U.S. sanctions. The DOJ has claimed that Tornado Cash has enabled billions in illegal transfers, such as those involving the North Korean Lazarus Group . Although the U.S. government has reached an agreement to withdraw criminal charges related to civil sanctions against t he crypto mixer, the criminal case has not been closed. Dragonfly’s Haseeb responds to subpoena, criticism Dragonfly Managing Partner Haseeb Qureshi issued a public response on X following the DOJ’s suggestion of potential charges. He affirmed that the company had invested in Tornado Cash according to a legal opinion stating that it is not in violation of the current rules. Dragonfly invested into PepperSec, Inc., the developers of Tornado Cash, in August of 2020. We made this investment because we believe in the importance of open-source privacy-preserving technology. Prior to our investment, we obtained an outside legal opinion that confirmed that… — Haseeb ＞|＜ (@hosseeb) July 25, 2025 Qureshi explained that their interest in privacy-preserving technology compelled the move. He emphasized that Dragonfly never operated or had control over the protocol. He labeled the possible charges as “outrageous” and cautioned that charging investors over the actions taken by portfolio companies would establish a dangerous precedent. He asserted that such a step would discourage any future investment in privacy-centered crypto projects. Trial nears closing U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla said it was possible that arguments would wind up as early as Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. As reported by Inner City Press, “two or three doctors” and possibly a Chainalysis expert will testify on behalf of Storm as part of his defense. The prosecutors intend to finish their case by Thursday, after which the Storm team will offer the final arguments. Storm’s defense hinges on proving that he and his co-founders were not deliberately involved in illicit transactions and that Tornado Cash was a trusted code and not a money laundering platform. These emails sent to Dragonfly will be relevant in determining whether or not Storm requested legitimate legal control in the creation of the platform. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

CCTV and Dcar put level 2 advanced driver‑assist packages from more than twenty EV makers through simulations of high‑risk situations on both expressways and urban roads, judging how each system coped under demanding conditions. The clips shared by Dcar rapidly circulated across Chinese social networks, according to Reuters . On the expressway portion, Tesla claimed the top spot among 36 contenders, with its Model 3 and Model X navigating five of the six test scenarios successfully. In contrast, BYD’s Denza Z9GT and the Huawei‑supported Aito M9 each stumbled in three challenges, while Xiaomi’s SU7 cleared just one. On Friday, HIMA, the Huawei‑led auto alliance, took to Weibo to decline any remarks on the “so‑called test.” Tesla tops China test despite data restrictions “Due to laws against data export, Tesla achieved the top results in China despite having no local training data,” said Elon Musk on his X account on Friday. Musk has referred to Tesla’s situation as a “quandary,” highlighting that U.S. regulations prevent its AI software from being trained in China. The company is pursuing permission to transfer data collected in Shanghai back to the United States for further algorithm refinement. Wang Yao, deputy chief engineer at the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, told a forum in Shanghai earlier this month that local marques need to admit they’re trailing Tesla’s assisted‑driving capabilities. Reflecting on a demo in which a Tesla Model Y autonomously traveled from its Austin, Texas factory to a customer roughly thirty minutes away, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun remarked, “we will continue to learn” from Tesla’s pioneering work. This Dcar assessment coincided with rising worries over driver‑assist safety in China. In March, a Xiaomi SU7 was involved in a highway crash that killed three people. Chinese regulators crack down on overhyped driver-assist marketing Chinese state media pointed to overhyped marketing as a culprit in drivers misusing these systems. Regulators have since banned terms like “smart driving” and “autonomous driving” in ads for driver‑aid features. This week, the public security ministry announced it will define legal responsibilities for a technology that has not yet reached true autonomy and warned that distracted drivers face serious safety and liability risks when relying on assisted‑driving modes. Xiaomi saw its EV order tally dip in the wake of the March accident, but that slump proved temporary. Its newest electric SUV, introduced last month, quickly attracted a robust first wave of buyers. Meanwhile, deliveries of China‑produced Tesla EVs in June ticked up 0.8% year‑on‑year, ending an eight‑month slide, even as they remained under pressure on a quarterly basis from more affordably priced local alternatives.

This figure has grown by almost 50% since the end of May and could exceed last year’s record. The primary sources of capital inflow are crypto funds, the CME futures market, and venture investments. The main catalyst is an improved regulatory environment in the U.S. Analysts say the GENIUS Act has brought clarity to stablecoin regulation and set a benchmark for other countries. Another document, the CLARITY Act, could make the United States more attractive to crypto companies compared to the EU and its MiCA regulation, according to analysts. Improved legislation is stimulating activity in the markets. Venture capital funding has increased, and public companies are showing new momentum. Analysts have noted the successful IPO of Circle, as well as growth in new applications filed with the SEC. Demand for Ethereum Investors are also showing increased interest in altcoins. Ethereum has been the main beneficiary, thanks to its dominance in DeFi and its growing use in corporate reserves alongside Bitcoin. Asset managers are interested in launching altcoin ETFs with staking functionality. In particular, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) exchange-traded fund from BlackRock attracted $10 billion in a year, according to Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas. He noted that this instrument became the third in history in terms of how quickly it reached this milestone. The first two are Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity. Balchunas also observed that assets in the fund grew from $5 billion to $10 billion in just ten days. The fund entered the top five in terms of inflows over the past week and month. On July 25, net inflow into spot Ethereum ETFs amounted to $332.2 million. Almost all of this amount—$324.6 million—came from the BlackRock fund. The total inflow into all nine spot Ethereum ETFs traded in the U.S. reached $8.65 billion. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of such products in May 2024.

On Threads, Zuckerberg praised Zhao’s contributions saying “Shengjia has already pioneered several breakthroughs including a new scaling paradigm and distinguished himself as a leader in the field. I’m looking forward to working closely with him to advance his scientific vision.” Zhao will work directly with Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, the former Scale AI CEO who’s now Meta’s chief AI officer. In recent weeks, Zuckerberg has rapidly boosted Meta’s AI team, with a $14 billion commitment to Scale AI. He unveiled Meta Superintelligence Labs in June, bringing together leading researchers and engineers. Zuckerberg’s June memo credits Zhao with co‑creating ChatGPT, contributing significantly to GPT‑4’s development, including its compact variants 4.1 and o3, and heading OpenAI’s synthetic data initiatives before his move to Meta. Although Zhao appeared alongside other recruits in that memo, CNBC reported that Zuckerberg clarified on Friday that Zhao actually co‑founded the lab and “has been our lead scientist from day one.” Within Meta Superintelligence Labs, teams will concentrate on foundational AI architectures like the open‑source Llama series, alongside various product builds and core research projects. Is Meta finally winning over OpenAI talent? Earlier in July, Zuckerberg revealed that Meta intends to dedicate “hundreds of billions of dollars” to its AI infrastructure, adding that “the next few years are going to be very exciting!” This latest hiring surge follows the underwhelmed developer response to the Llama 4 models released in April, prompting a strategic overhaul to more effectively challenge rivals such as OpenAI and Google. Altman says Meta offered $100 million to his employees. Meta denies it. WIRED reported that Meta has made at least ten of these offers to OpenAI employees. One senior researcher was asked to be chief scientist but turned it down, according to people involved. They also said the equity in the deal vests right away in the first year. “That’s about how much it would take for me to go work at Meta,” said an OpenAI staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity. Others said they compared the financial incentives with the chance to shape projects at Meta versus OpenAI, with several feeling their contributions would be greater at OpenAI. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone challenged the figures. “These statements are untrue—the size and structure of these compensation packages have been misrepresented,” he said. “Some people have chosen to greatly exaggerate what’s happening for their own purposes.” A senior Meta engineer confirmed a salary of roughly $850,000 per year—substantial but small compared with the new offers. Engineers one level above (E7) average about $1.54 million annually, based on user data from Levels.FYI. Recently, on “Lenny’s Podcast”, Anthropic cofounder Benjamin Mann revealed that his team wasn’t sways by Meta’s generous recruitment packages. He emphasized that Anthropic’s workforce is driven by the company’s purpose. “It’s not a hard choice,” Mann said, adding that while other AI firms lost people to big paydays, Anthropic has held onto its experts. Mann added that huge offers could be reasonable based on individual circumstances. His comments underscore a fierce talent war among leading tech firms, with signing bonuses reportedly climbing as high as $100 million. “I’m pretty sure it’s real,” Mann added. Whether or not Zuckerberg has made big offers to Altman’s employees, in the past few years, half of OpenAI’s safety team has left. Last year, former researcher Daniel Kokotajlo told Fortune that “people who are primarily focused on thinking about AGI safety and preparedness are being increasingly marginalized.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Tokens will be redistributed according to a new unlocking schedule. The sale coincided with a change in the rules for calculating staking rewards. The Celestia Foundation announced it has purchased all remaining TIA tokens from Polychain Capital for $62.5 million. This deal marks the exit of one of the project’s key early investors and comes ahead of a network upgrade that will alter how staking rewards are distributed. All remaining Polychain-held TIA tokens were transferred at approximately $1.44 per token, matching the market price in early July 2025. The foundation will redistribute these tokens to new investors with a rolling unlock schedule, effective from August 16 to November 14. The Celestia Foundation did not disclose the names of the new holders. The deal appears motivated by a desire to address criticism directed at Polychain, which reportedly sold large amounts of staking rewards despite most tokens being locked under a vesting schedule. Analysts estimate Polychain may have sold up to $242 million worth of TIA, including $179 million from liquid staking rewards. The firm’s initial investment in Celestia was about $20 million during Series A and B funding rounds. To address concerns, an update called Lotus is planned for the Celestia network in late July. This upgrade will lock staking rewards in proportion to each account’s unlocked token balance, aiming to reduce speculative pressure from addresses with large vesting balances. For example, if 50% of an account’s tokens are unlocked, only half of its staking rewards will be accessible. If all tokens are locked, both the tokens and staking rewards will remain inaccessible until the unlock period ends.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-25 22:58:36

As one of the top Layer-1 protocols, it offers native staking, a solid consensus model, and long-term scaling goals. However, BlockDAG is quickly capturing attention with its bold progress and swelling ecosystem. Utilizing advanced DAG-based technology, mobile mining features, and a fast-growing pool of more than 4,500 active builders, BlockDAG (BDAG) is positioning itself as a frontrunner in the crypto race. While both projects aim for broad adoption, BlockDAG is already moving with visible speed, unlike Cardano, which is still leaning heavily on its past achievements. The question now is: which one really earns the title of top crypto to watch in 2025? BlockDAG’s Builder Base Hints at Real Use, Not Just Plans Currently, BlockDAG is standing out as one of the most developer-focused ecosystems in the space. The platform has successfully brought over 4,500 developers on board through multiple hackathons, fueling the launch of more than 300 live use-case-driven projects. These projects span DeFi systems, AI utilities, Web3 dashboards, and payment tools, all built using BlockDAG’s high-performance architecture. The team’s goal is to power over 1,000 decentralized applications by the year 2026. Unlike traditional chain setups, BlockDAG’s directed acyclic graph structure supports faster processing and higher scalability. This gives builders the tools they need to scale apps for practical use. Mining accessibility is also a major win, thanks to the X1 mobile app, which allows smartphone-based participation. Additionally, physical devices like the X10 miner improve mining access across regions. BlockDAG has now crossed $351 million in presale funding, selling 24.3 billion coins so far. Its current price of $0.0016, locked until August 11th, is available with good potential onwards. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, showcasing real market confidence driven by real features, not just hype. With these achievements, BlockDAG is clearly standing among the top cryptos to watch in the ongoing cycle. Cardano’s Stability Now Faces a High-Speed Rival Cardano is known for its slow-but-steady approach, built on academic papers and a layered design that focuses on long-term sustainability. Using a proof-of-stake model, it remains one of the most energy-efficient chains available. Over time, Cardano has rolled out major features such as native assets, the Hydra scaling upgrade, and governance models, though some have been slower to implement than anticipated. New attention is coming Cardano’s way thanks to bullish chart patterns and a stronger emphasis on governance changes. The introduction of the Reeve platform could help boost user participation, and the July 24 AMA aims to clarify the project’s direction. However, a prominent ADA whale recently voiced concerns over how project funds are being used, urging more community participation in key proposal voting. Despite those concerns, ADA continues to attract attention from those who value foundational tech. Yet in 2025, speed, real-world utility, and builder involvement are proving to be just as essential for any chain looking to stay relevant. Tech Showdown: DAG Agility vs. Layered Planning BlockDAG’s DAG-first approach allows rapid progress, real-time scalability, and user-friendly mining via both apps and hardware. Meanwhile, Cardano offers a battle-tested and structured base but is now being pushed to act faster and share more power with its community. While Cardano continues to promise gradual evolution, BlockDAG is already delivering real tools and active deployments. For those examining more than just token rankings, BlockDAG’s pace and accessibility put it firmly in the spotlight for short-term developments and long-term adaptability. Final Call! Cardano still holds a strong place in the Layer-1 lineup thanks to its disciplined growth and technical depth. It remains focused on enhancing its chain through updates and governance upgrades. Yet BlockDAG is redefining what counts: speed, openness, and creator participation. The presale performance, deep builder community, and working tech show that BlockDAG is more than just a trending name. With over 4,500 developers, 300+ functioning projects, and a target to support 1,000+ dApps by 2026, it’s doing more than following the path; it’s setting it. As its August 11 global launch nears, BlockDAG stands tall as the top crypto to watch for both immediate gains and future impact.

As speculation intensifies, top voices across crypto are asking: Can XRP really reach $4 in 2025? But while XRP gains attention from traditional institutions, another token is turning heads for very different reasons. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 100x gains faster. XRP Price Prediction 2025: Institutions Fuel the Climb On X, crypto analyst John Squire reposted a now-viral video clip: “The CEO of SBI—Japan’s largest banking group—just said ‘$XRP will be a very high price.’ He’s not guessing. He knows what’s coming.” With ETF flows, whale activity, and centralized support all converging, some insiders now expect a short-term XRP target of $4.00—though others are asking whether the current rally is already near exhaustion.

He delivered his comment departing the White House on his way to Scotland, where he’ll spend several days golfing and meeting with international dignitaries. “We’re working very diligently with Europe, the EU,” he told Reuters before boarding Marine One. Pressed again on the odds of a successful deal, he said, “That’s the big one right now … I think the EU has a pretty good chance of making a deal right now.” Trump tells EU it must “Buy Down” 30% tariff to seal trade agreement Only a day earlier, the European Commission declared that a compromise with Washington seemed attainable . Even so, EU capitals’ have planned to hit retaliatory duties on €93 billion ($109 billion) of American imports if negotiations collapse. The EU’s executive branch, representing 27 member states, has consistently stated its chief goal is to prevent the imposition of the 30% levies that the President has signaled could take effect on August 1. For any deal to materialize, he indicated the EU must “buy down” that levy, although he did not explain how. Some EU officials propose basing a potential arrangement on the outline of the U.S.‑Japan accord, in which incoming European exports would face a uniform 15% rate upon entry into the U.S. Nevertheless, the administration warned these accounts are still largely speculative, with trade adviser Peter Navarro advising Bloomberg News that the EU’s announcement should be taken with “a grain of salt.” The EU hasn’t said what it will give in return yet. According to a diplomatic source, the bloc has no plans for the type of investment commitments Japan provided in its U.S. agreement. Trump looks forward to meetings with Starmer and Swinney On Monday, Trump will visit his Aberdeen golf course to open a new 18-hole course named after his mother. While leaving the capital, he said he looked forward to meeting Labour leader Keir Starmer and Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney. He noted that both have previously expressed support for U.S. Democrats. Swinney had openly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 campaign. According to British and American officials, the visit provides both leaders a chance strengthen their good relations. Major discussion points will involve seeking a resolution to Russia’s conflict in Ukraine and enhancing defense and security cooperation. Since assuming leadership last year, Starmer has focused on keeping close ties with the U.S. In May, he negotiated the United Kingdom’s inaugural U.S. tariff‑cut deal, which maintained existing quotas and duty bands for British cars, eliminated levies on aerospace products, and left steel tariffs in place. Starmer plans to push for lower steel tariffs, but officials from both countries admit a deal probably won’t happen on this visit.

48947009,https://cryptonews.com/?p=387387,1753485021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48947009.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 25 July – XRP, Pepe, Shiba Inu",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-25-july-xrp-pepe-shiba-inu/,"Crypto progenitor Bitcoin’s historic move to an unprecedented price high of $122,838 last Monday reignited strong bullish sentiment among traders. Although the asset has since retreated by 5.7%, optimism remains high for another potential breakout. The rapid ascent in Bitcoin’s value has simultaneously propelled major altcoins and many of the best meme coins upwards. Tokens such as XRP, TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have all marked fresh all-time highs within the last year, reinforcing confidence in a broader market expansion. Currently, the total crypto market cap hovers just below the $4 trillion mark. A slight market-wide correction of 5.3% over the past day indicates a stabilisation phase as prices consolidate after this powerful upswing. With expectations of a significant bull run mounting, investors are turning their focus towards digital assets with the potential to surpass previous price peaks. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payments Crypto Leader Reaches New Price Records Ripple’s XRP continues to cement itself as a key bridge between traditional finance systems and blockchain networks. On July 18, XRP climbed to a fresh record of $3.65, overtaking its former 2018 high of $3.40. XRP trades around $3.11, marking a 14.3% decline from its peak, suggesting it is entering a correction period. Nonetheless, recent developments keep traders hopeful for renewed upward movement. With its lightning-fast settlement times, negligible fees, and frictionless cross-border transacting sans intermediaries, XRP has attracted considerable institutional adoption, including from the United Nations. Following four years of litigation, Ripple secured a major victory in 2023 when a U.S. court determined that XRP’s retail sales were not securities transactions. By 2025, the SEC closed its case, ending years of regulatory uncertainty and solidifying XRP’s market standing. This clarity has driven substantial capital inflows into XRP, resulting in a price surge of over 413% in the last 365 days, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 81% increase over the year. XRP’s RSI dipped to 60 from Monday’s overheated level of 86, indicating growing selling momentum. After a remarkable 44% rally over the past month – significantly outperforming Bitcoin’s 9% rise – traders are now realising their profits and will likely continue doing so over the weekend, depreciating the price and providing a buy-in opportunity. Over the past 7 days, XRP declined by 10% and may continue easing until its RSI reaches a neutral 50 and its price aligns with its 30-day moving average. Further losses are likely to be minimal, since XRP enjoys strong psychological support near its previous resistance level at $3. Between late last year and early April, XRP formed a bullish flag pattern, a structure often preceding strong upward moves, implying that a push towards $4 could materialise by autumn. Pepe ($PEPE): The Biggest Frog in Crypto Eyes New Price Highs In less than two years, Pepe ($PEPE) rose to become one of the top three meme coins, leveraging its cultural relevance to build substantial market dominance. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic frog character, Pepe has delivered impressive returns to early holders, reaching a market cap over $5.1 billion. Since its launch in April 2023, Pepe has inspired countless copycats, yet none have managed to match its momentum. The token’s profile skyrocketed further when X CEO Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe-themed avatar. Currently trading around $0.00001221, Pepe has gained 23% in the past month. Despite this, it remains 56.4% below its late-2024 historic peak of $0.00002803. Earlier this year, Pepe charted a falling wedge formation, a technical setup often preceding upward breakouts. With its RSI at 52 and downtrending, a selloff is ensuing which could discount the popular meme coin further over the weekend, presenting a prime opportunity for investors to buy in. While crypto’s broader $3.9 trillion market dipped 5.3%, Pepe has held the fort with only a 2% decline, mirroring Bitcoin and reflecting the fact that larger market cap meme coins can often retain value more like traditional cryptocurrencies as the market grows. Pepe enthusiasts remain hopeful that favourable crypto market conditions and geopolitical stability will ignite another surge before summer concludes. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Ethereum-Based Dogecoin Challenger Could Triple in Price Since launching in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become the second-largest meme cryptocurrency after Dogecoin, with a market cap stretching to nearly $8 billion. SHIB has slipped 0.3% in the past 24 hours and is now trading near $0.00001347. Given the fact that crypto’s wider $79 billion meme coin market dipped 4.4% in the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu’s nominal decline highlights its robustness and resillience as a meme coin. The token remains well-positioned for a potential major rally. Recent chart patterns highlight two bullish formations – a descending wedge from November to March and a bullish flag since mid-May – both of which imply continued upward momentum. Should SHIB break past its key resistance at $0.000022 with ongoing market optimism, analysts expect it could rise above $0.00003 before the end of summer. Some forecasts suggest it might even reach between $0.00006 and $0.00009 by year-end if the industry enters a bull market. Unlike most meme tokens, Shiba Inu offers real-world utility via Shibarium, its Ethereum-based Layer-2 network designed to reduce fees, enhance transaction speeds, and improve scalability and privacy. Snorter ($SNORT): Low Price Presale for a Meme Coin and Advanced Crypto Trading Bot Hybrid Identifying promising early-stage projects is critical to maximising crypto returns. While dominant altcoins continue their momentum, emerging tokens still present lucrative opportunities. One such rising project is Snorter ($SNORT) , a hybrid trading bot and meme coin built on Solana, with future cross-chain integrations planned. Snorter operates directly within Telegram, providing traders with real-time market updates in their chats. Offering transaction fees as low as 0.85%, Snorter competes with bots like BonkBot, Maestro, and Trojan. Its suite of features includes MEV-protected swaps, copy trading, rug pull detection, and limit order sniping, positioning it as a comprehensive tool for traders. Investor demand has been robust, raising over $2.3 million in its presale to date. Its staking program offers yields of up to 174% APY, incentivising early adopters. Priced just below ten cents, token costs rise incrementally with each presale phase, encouraging prompt entry. Whether you’re a veteran trader or a newcomer exploring meme coins, Snorter aims to deliver a powerful yet intuitive platform for navigating the ever-changing crypto markets.

Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $122,838 last Monday, a milestone that analysts suggest could hasten the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies if upward trajectory persists, supported by legislation from US lawmakers. So, there is fresh optimism across digital asset markets. And if its well-founded, then the next bull phase could exceed the legendary highs witnessed in 2021, pushing major altcoins into uncharted valuation territory. Below are the digital assets Perplexity AI predicts could deliver significant gains by Christmas. XRP (Ripple): Perplexity AI Predicts Holders will More Than 6x Their Bags in the Next Five Months Perplexity forecasts Ripple’s XRP (XRP) could surge to $20 by end-2025, implying a 6.4X from its current market value of around $3.12. This optimistic outlook stems from XRP’s robust market performance this year. On July 18, XRP set a fresh record high at $3.65, surpassing its previous peak of $3.40 established in 2018, signalling ongoing bullish momentum. Over the past month, XRP has risen by 42%, outperforming Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies highlighted in this report. Investor confidence has been buoyed by XRP’s expanding use cases, regulatory clarity, and speculation around a possible XRP spot ETF, factors that could trigger further capital inflows. XRP facilitates rapid, low-cost, and regulation-compliant cross-border transactions. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) recognised XRP as an innovative blockchain-based solution that eliminates traditional intermediaries in global payments. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 In 2023, a landmark US court ruling determined that XRP’s retail sales do not constitute securities transactions, effectively ending the SEC’s aggressive stance against Ripple and removing a major regulatory overhang. By March this year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the SEC had formally closed the case, clearing a significant hurdle and strengthening market sentiment. Currently trading approximately 14.3% below its all-time high, XRP could reach Perplexity’s more conservative $7 target by year-end if it breaks decisively above resistance. Although its RSI has slipped to 59, suggesting short-term profit-taking, this correction is likely to consolidate XRP’s strong recent gains. Under highly bullish conditions, Perplexity believes XRP could hit Perplexity’s bull-case scenario of $20, if major catalysts, such as comprehensive US crypto policies under a Trump administration, materialise to fuel a rally rivalling 2021’s crypto boom. Over the past year, XRP has gained 415%, far outperforming Bitcoin’s 87% increase. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Perplexity Predicts the World’s Biggest Meme Coin will Double by Christmas Originally launched in 2013 as a parody token, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a leading digital asset with a market capitalisation exceeding $34.7 billion, driven by strong community support and increasing utility and adoption. DOGE tends to follow Bitcoin’s price trajectory, combining meme culture momentum with the underlying strength of its capitalization. At its current price of $0.2312, DOGE has climbed 40% over the last month and now is in a consolidation phase. Its RSI has dropped to 58 from Wednesday’s 80, indicating a sell-off has brought it into neutral territory after it was overbought. This means we can expect some minor depreciation over the weekend, as reflected by the fact Dogecoin dropped about 3% overnight. However, this retracement is natural, and provides a healthier base for DOGE’s next advance. Technical charts show a descending wedge pattern formed between November and April, typically seen as a prelude to a bullish run upwards. Perplexity predicts that DOGE could achieve $45 by New Year, representing a doubling from present levels. DOGE’s adoption as a payment method continues to expand. Tesla accepts it for select merchandise, while PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE transactions, strengthening its real-world utility. Cardano ($ADA): Perplexity AI Predicts an 4x Surge for This Sustainable Blockchain Cardano ($ADA) has jumped 40% in the past month due to consistent demand for this world-leading altcoin and Ethereum challenger. It also attracted attention from President Donald Trump, who proposed creating a Strategic Crypto Reserve on Truth Social, referencing Bitcoin predominantly but also hinting the government could hold on its books any ADA seized through law enforcement operations. Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson founded Cardano to challenge his former project. Cardano is acclaimed for its rigorous academic approach, eco-friendly architecture, and scalable infrastructure. With a market cap of $29.4 billion, ADA is one of the leading Ethereum alternatives and continues to gain traction against platforms like Solana. Perplexity predicts ADA could rise to $3.50 by end-2025, marking an easy 4X up from its current price of $0.8102 From a technical perspective, ADA has been consolidating within a falling wedge pattern since late 2024. A breakout above its immediate resistance of $1.10 could drive prices toward $1.50 by autumn. Even without an aggressive bull market, achieving Perplexity’s $3.50 target by New Year would comfortably exceed ADA’s previous record high of $3.09. TOKEN6900: Emerging Meme Coin Eyes 1000x Gains While Perplexity AI predicts substantial growth among established altcoins, their large market caps can restrict exponential returns. For investors seeking outsized profits, newly launched meme tokens offer significant speculative opportunities. TOKEN6900 (T6900) is a recent ERC-20 meme token that initiated its presale last week. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 The project has already raised over $1.1 million, highlighting strong early interest and potential for rapid appreciation upon exchange listing. Unlike other meme tokens pivoting towards utility, TOKEN6900 fully embraces its hype-driven nature, leveraging irony, aggressive marketing, and collective FOMO to fuel its growth. The project’s website explicitly states: “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” TOKEN6900’s branding references SPX6900, another meme coin rooted in satirical humour reminiscent of the late-1990s tech bubble. Its total supply is 930,993,091 tokens – exactly one more than SPX6900’s presale allocation – further cementing its parody-driven narrative. This unconventional strategy appears effective, given its rapid fundraising milestones. While it lacks underlying utility, TOKEN6900 offers staking opportunities, enabling holders to earn passive income alongside speculative gains. Prospective investors can join the presale on the official website , with the token currently priced at $0.0067. Prices rise nominally as the presale rises through the funding rounds, so early buyers secure optimal entry points to capitalise on potential future growth. Keep up to date with the project by following its official X and Instagram accounts.

The rise was driven by strong investor demand, as the shares offer a 9% annual dividend. These preferred shares have higher payout priority than regular shares. Bitcoin enthusiast and co-founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Michael Saylor, has announced an increase in the offering of preferred shares from $500 million to $2.8 billion, citing strong investor demand, according to Bloomberg . The new shares, named Stretch (STRC), offer a 9% annual dividend and have no fixed maturity date, an uncommon feature even among complex exchange-traded instruments. The publication highlighted this move as further proof of Saylor’s unique strategy: transforming a former IT company into a global Bitcoin treasury giant. Strategy initially announced the issuance of STRC shares to raise $500 million for additional Bitcoin purchases. Despite the complexity of the company’s capital structure and rising risks, there has been overwhelming demand for the new issue. Shares are being sold at a discounted price of $90 per share, compared to the nominal $100—a move designed to attract even more investors, especially among Saylor’s retail following. In recent years, Strategy has introduced several innovative financial instruments, including other share types such as Strike, Stride, and Strife, which have proven popular with investors. According to a person familiar with the deal, the new Stretch shares rank above regular common shares in the capital structure but remain subordinate to convertible bonds. The company can adjust the dividend monthly to keep the market price near $100, offering price flexibility and trust—underscoring Strategy’s unconventional approach to corporate finance. “This is not the first example of financial engineering by Strategy. If a company is valued above its fundamental value, it is a good opportunity to raise capital,” said Campbell Harvey, professor of economics at Duke University. Overall, Strategy’s shares have risen 43% year-to-date. The company’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached 607,770 BTC, valued at over $70 billion at the time of writing. Saylor continues to inspire other public companies to pursue similar crypto treasury strategies. Notably, private and public companies worldwide have accumulated a total of 1.18 million BTC.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|TREASURY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-25 23:24:00

However, he also anticipates a sharp market correction following such a rally, warning investors to prepare accordingly. XRP Price Outlook and Cycle Top Projections Zach Rector, a well-known figure in the XRP space, continues to maintain a bullish outlook, stating that XRP has the potential to rise dramatically in the ongoing market cycle. According to Rector, a price top ranging from $20 to $30 is plausible . Despite this optimistic target, he cautioned that a major pullback could follow once XRP reaches those levels. Rector’s position is based on long-standing market behavior. He acknowledges that although some market dynamics have evolved, the core investor psychology, particularly the tendency to take profits during peaks, remains unchanged. He believes this will likely lead to a correction of up to 50% after XRP reaches its projected high. In follow-up remarks, Rector elaborated that while the traditional four-year crypto cycle may not apply as rigidly as it once did, investor behavior still drives market volatility. He emphasized that understanding these emotional responses is essential for portfolio risk management. The 4 year crypto cycles have been disrupted but people are still going to take profits. Which is why I still believe after a $20-$30 XRP top we will see atleast a 50% correction. Not encouraging folks to trade this move but instead, just making sure you are ready to stomach that… — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) July 22, 2025 Views Among Analysts Not everyone in the XRP community agrees with Rector’s outlook. Johnny Utah, another well-known XRP proponent, challenged the idea that a major correction is inevitable. He argued that the current market is fundamentally different due to increased regulatory clarity, expanding real-world adoption, and rising institutional interest, particularly through financial instruments like ETFs . Utah’s viewpoint mirrors that of Michael Saylor, an advocate for Bitcoin and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, who recently suggested that Bitcoin may not experience a substantial correction until it reaches much higher valuations. Utah believes the same may hold for XRP, suggesting that the traditional correction phase could be bypassed due to these new market conditions. While Rector acknowledged these changing factors, he remained firm in his prediction, emphasizing that global liquidity cycles still influence market movements regardless of macroeconomic developments or regulatory advancements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Cycle Top Forecasts Several other analysts have issued optimistic projections for XRP’s potential peak. Tony Severino anticipates a rapid rise to $13, citing technical breakout patterns and referencing the pace of XRP’s movement in previous bull markets. He believes this upward move could occur within a matter of weeks. Market analyst CasiTrades initially set a near-term target range of $6.50 to $8 for July. However, if the current market momentum continues, she believes XRP could reach as high as $26 before the end of the year. Another analyst, EGRAG, analyzed historical data and predicted a likely average peak around $20. He also noted that if XRP follows its 2017 trajectory, the price could extend to as much as $33. His overall forecast places the likely range for a cycle top between $7 and $21. Meanwhile, Ripple Van Wickle estimates that XRP could reach approximately $14 if Bitcoin climbs to $140,000. In a similar vein, Armando Pantoja expects XRP to achieve a maximum value of $25 over the next two years . He also dismissed common concerns about the asset’s market capitalization becoming a limiting factor. While many analysts agree on a bullish outlook for XRP, opinions diverge on how the asset will behave after reaching its peak. Some believe the market will follow familiar correction patterns, while others argue that structural changes in the crypto space may lead to a new market dynamic. As the debate continues, investors are advised to stay informed and manage expectations amid developing conditions.

Trading in the $170–$180 range, SOL is forming a bullish ascending triangle pattern and is positioned just under key resistance at $185. Analysts now give 95–99% odds of ETF approval, with a decision expected within days. Post-ETF targets range from $228 to $300+, with many pointing to $253 as a likely average. Solana looks poised for a big move. But while it may offer a 2x to 10x return, early investors are already scanning the horizon for the next big 100x coin—and many believe they’ve found it in MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Coin With Real Momentum (and 500x Potential) While SOL preps for a bullish ETF run, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already on fire. A politically themed meme coin with real fundamentals and a red-hot presale, MAGACOIN FINANCE has exploded in popularity, drawing over $10.5 million in investment and more than 5,200+ verified presale buyers in just a few weeks. Let’s break down why MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a whale favorite: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s smart contracts are fully audited by HashEx , a trusted blockchain security firm. The project follows a zero-tax , no hidden unlocks , community-driven model—designed for real holders, not early dumps. The prices are increasing every few hours , making this one of the most time-sensitive opportunities in the altcoin market. Presale buyers will get early access to high-APY staking rewards, creating both passive income and long-term holding incentives. Analysts say up to 500x gains are achievable after launch. In more bullish projections, MAGACOIN FINANCE could see 20000%+ returns , putting early buyers in prime position for life-changing profits. The project has become the best crypto presale to buy in 2025 with a capped 170 billion supply , no stealth inflation, and increasing CEX listings on the horizon. With investor demand soaring and capital inflows shattering previous records, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the stage for legendary gains. Every signal points to MAGACOIN FINANCE outpacing the competition as the most aggressive growth play in the market, fueled by innovation and relentless community expansion. Meme Power Meets Market Strategy MAGACOIN FINANCE blends the viral power of meme coins with solid fundamentals—offering a political meme identity, a growing cult following, and real token utility. It’s being called “the next SHIBA with better tokenomics” , and some traders are comparing its early-stage momentum to SOL in its infancy. Whales, retail traders, and meme coin hunters are piling in—not just for the laughs, but for the 500x upside potential. Final Thoughts Solana is a safe and promising bet in 2025, especially with ETF approval on the horizon. But for investors looking beyond 10x gains—toward 100x, even 500x territory — MAGACOIN FINANCE offers that rare combination of early-stage entry, viral appeal, and smart design . With thousands of new buyers joining daily, time is running out to catch this rocket before the next presale stage ends.

The company will use a private investment in public equity (PIPE) model. The project aims to legitimize Toncoin ownership via public markets. The Ton Foundation and investment firm Kingsway Capital Partners are working to launch a treasury company, according to Bloomberg. The initiative will focus on custodial services for Toncoin, with an initial investment target of $400 million. According to informed sources, the company will use a private investment in public equity (PIPE) structure, in which a public company issues shares to a select group of private investors. One of the investors will be Kingsway, headed by Manuel Stotz, who also serves as the current president of the Ton Foundation. Neither Stotz nor representatives from the foundation commented at the time of publication. The project is receiving financial backing from Cohen & Co, which previously helped organize a $1.5 billion structure linked to Ethereum. Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading company in establishing public crypto holdings, has also shown interest in the project. Increased interest in such initiatives is due to the success of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), founded by Michael Saylor, which invested heavily in Bitcoin and saw its shares jump over 3,400% in five years. More than 100 entities have since developed models to own crypto assets via the stock market. The new Ton Foundation project aims to follow this model by concentrating assets in Toncoin for institutional investment. Although TON is formally separate from Telegram, its price remains sensitive to news about the messaging platform and its founder, Pavel Durov. At the time of publication, Toncoin is ranked 21st among crypto assets by market capitalization, at $7.7 billion, having declined nearly 40% since the start of the year while Bitcoin has surged alongside Telegram’s continued expansion. Experts believe the project could strengthen Toncoin’s institutional adoption and open a new channel for token investment in public markets, particularly in the US, where the fund is expanding its presence.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|BTC|TREASURY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-25 23:36:13

The cryptocurrency fell by nearly 10% over the past few sessions, marking its largest daily loss since April. On Wednesday alone, XRP plunged 10.33%, raising concerns among short-term traders and futures market participants. This drop also had a noticeable effect on futures open interest. According to CoinGlass , XRP futures open interest dropped from $10.94 billion to $9.10 billion—a 16.8% decrease. This suggests that leveraged traders may be rapidly exiting positions or being liquidated, reducing speculative confidence in the short term. Third-Largest Long Liquidation in 2025 Hits Binance XRP’s decline appears to be driven by a combination of whale movements and long liquidation pressure. Crypto analyst Darkfost pointed out that a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen recently transferred significant amounts of XRP. More than 50 million XRP tokens have moved, with roughly $140 million reportedly sent to exchanges. Of these, 42 million XRP were transferred on Thursday alone, following 84 million moved the previous Friday. This cascade of activity contributed to Binance recording the third-largest long liquidation event for XRP in 2025. Approximately $86 million in long positions were wiped out within hours as a result. Despite this, Cointelegraph has noted continued whale accumulation. Currently, 2,743 wallets each hold over one million XRP, totaling 47.32 billion tokens. This accounts for 4.4% of the circulating supply. Whale Flows Signal Caution The sentiment among large holders may be changing. Data from CryptoQuant indicates that the 90-day average for whale flow has turned negative. This is significant, as the metric flipped positive in early May—preceding XRP’s strong rally. The current reversal may indicate that whales are reducing their holdings, potentially signaling a local price peak. Key Levels in Focus as Market Awaits Direction Even with recent volatility, XRP’s higher time frame structure remains bullish. Last week’s multimonth high reconfirmed an upward trend, although the recent drop brought prices near critical support. On the four-hour chart, the $3.00 mark stands out as psychological support. Thursday’s decline swept liquidity near $2.95, establishing it as an immediate area of interest. A move above $3.25 would suggest a bullish shift in market structure on lower time frames. This would likely establish $2.95 as a local bottom. However, sustained selling could push the price into the $2.66–$2.86 range. The $2.64 zone, previously a strong resistance level in Q2, now serves as major support. XRP bulls are likely to maintain control unless price closes below both $3.00 and $2.64, which would suggest a possible trend reversal and further downside risk.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-25 23:49:14

The token of Maple Finance ( SYRUP ) is currently changing hands for $0.475, up by 7.95% over the past 24 hours. This comes after the DeFi platform for institutional lending unveiled a proposal to increase allocations for purchasing the crypto asset on the open market. The MIP-018 proposal, which will be open for voting by Syrup holders on July 25th, aims to raise token buybacks from 20% to 25% to increase staking rewards. “MIP-018 proposes to allocate 25% of protocol fee revenue from Q3 2025 to buyback SYRUP tokens and distribute these as rewards to stakers of SYRUP. This proposal builds on the success of Q1 and Q2 buybacks, advancing a mechanism that’s fast becoming a cornerstone of value distribution and staker alignment in the Maple ecosystem.” Maple’s buyback mechanism proportionally distributes the bought-back tokens to SYRUP stakers based on their staking amount at the time of each distribution. The program aims to reward long-term stakers, increase staking incentives and sustain the token’s utility. “By continuing to implement this buyback mechanism, Maple Finance aims to leverage its growing protocol revenue to directly benefit those most active in its governance, fostering a more robust and engaged community.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

One builds from a scholarly model. The other captures attention by prioritizing quick setup, scale-readiness, and ease of use. While Cardano continues to be part of the long-standing names in the crypto space, BlockDAG is gaining significant ground through its unique parallel block model and a presale that has already secured over $351 million. The growing traction isn’t fueled by marketing alone. It’s being driven by real participation, especially from people who are newer to the crypto space. The comparison isn’t about ideologies anymore. In 2025, it’s increasingly about ease of access, and that’s shaping up to be the most valuable feature. Cardano: Strong Fundamentals, But Slower to Deliver Cardano was created with the vision of using peer-reviewed research to guide its development. Its Ouroboros protocol, based on proof-of-stake, that emphasizes security and energy efficiency. With a split-layer design that separates settlement from computation, Cardano brought long-term structure to the forefront and won credibility among technical builders. However, that same methodical structure can slow down practical rollouts. Because of its cautious and research-focused approach, real-time functionality and broader feature sets have taken time to arrive. For newcomers, Cardano’s entry process is not beginner-friendly. Staking ADA involves learning delegation and setting up wallets like Daedalus or Yoroi, steps that require a decent grasp of crypto concepts. Even in 2025, retail user tools remain limited, and ease of use still hasn’t become a central focus. While Cardano’s system remains technically strong, it’s tailored more for users who already understand crypto intricacies. BlockDAG’s DAG Architecture Focuses on Speed Where Cardano favors a tiered design for long-term structure, BlockDAG’s architecture is shaped for immediate performance. Built on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), the system enables simultaneous block confirmations, avoiding the bottlenecks of sequential structures. This translates to higher transaction throughput and rapid settlement, all while maintaining network integrity. That capability isn’t theoretical. BlockDAG’s infrastructure is already live and capable of handling large-scale demand. While other chains are testing for scalability, BlockDAG has made it a core design feature from the beginning. This is one of the key reasons why its presale has attracted immense attention. With more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins already sold and over $351 million raised in funding, BlockDAG’s momentum speaks volumes. The current presale price of $0.0016 is valid until August 11, while the launch price of $0.05 implies a potential ROI of 3,025%. Early backers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, underlining the project’s performance. Which Platform Provides a Better User Experience? Functionality isn’t just measured by what’s under the hood; it’s about how easily users can interact with the platform. On Cardano, the user journey involves technical knowledge and multiple configuration steps, especially for staking. Users need to understand epochs, pool structures, and wallet delegation mechanics. This creates a barrier for those not already deep in the crypto space. In contrast, BlockDAG simplifies access. Users can sign in via its dashboard, purchase BDAG at low rates, or use the X1 mining app straight from their smartphones to earn passively. There are no complex conditions to meet. It’s designed to allow people to start engaging without prior crypto experience. At the still-low price of $0.0016, BDAG offers accessible entry without requiring big upfront amounts. Combined with its 3,025% potential ROI, it becomes clear why it’s considered among the best cryptos under $1 in 2025. For people seeking high gains and easy onboarding, BlockDAG removes friction entirely. Wrapping Up! Cardano’s structured and steady pace continues to find support among technical communities. However, the crypto environment in 2025 is rapidly shifting toward platforms that deliver speed, usability, and real-time engagement, and this is where BlockDAG has an edge. With a system already capable of scaling, tools that connect with users directly, and measurable traction, BlockDAG has crossed $351 million in presale funding, engaged over 200,000 users, and recorded 2 million downloads of its X1 mining app. While many projects claim to be the best choice, BlockDAG is making its case with numbers and usability. Priced at $0.0016, BDAG offers a rare chance to buy in before the full launch at $0.05. The countdown has begun, and those still undecided may miss one of the best-performing crypto coins of the year.

In a recent livestream shared on X, Ramos discussed current market conditions and the growing strength of altcoins, which he believes may signal that XRP will no longer revisit its earlier lower price levels. During the 10-minute broadcast, Ramos expressed interest in purchasing XRP at more favourable entry points, particularly near the $2 range. However, he also indicated that such a price retracement is increasingly unlikely. His analysis was prompted by XRP’s recent price surge, during which it traded at approximately $3.50 at the time of his remarks. Factors Behind the $2 Price Floor Outlook Ramos pointed to several developments in the broader cryptocurrency market to support his position. Chief among them is the observed decrease in Bitcoin dominance, which he says has declined from 66% to approximately 60%. This shift, in his view, suggests that capital is flowing into alternative cryptocurrencies, boosting their market presence. IF You OWN $XRP I Got News For You – UNDER $2 XRP might be GONE! – Bitcoin Dominance Crashing – Altcoins PUMPING Hard – XRP reaching $4 in July – GOING All in it's a priority pic.twitter.com/o7nVQuXKrE — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) July 21, 2025 He argued that this trend may indicate the onset of an “altcoin cycle,” a period during which altcoins outperform Bitcoin in terms of market returns. Historically, these periods have been associated with rapid price increases for a wide range of tokens, including XRP. Ramos believes this growing altcoin strength will make a return to sub-$2 levels for XRP increasingly improbable. XRP’s Rising Cost and Accessibility Concerns Alongside Ramos’s forecast, other voices within the XRP community have raised concerns about XRP’s affordability for retail investors following its recent price performance. Edoardo Farina, another well-known supporter of XRP, recently stated that the average retail investor is unlikely to afford holding 10,000 XRP, which was valued at over $22,000 at the time of his comment. He described such holdings as increasingly inaccessible for everyday buyers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Echoing this sentiment, community member Xena remarked that the cost of acquiring 1,000 XRP, valued at over $3,000, has moved beyond the financial capacity of many individual investors. Despite the strong upward momentum, XRP has experienced a short-term price pullback. After briefly reaching $3.50, the token declined to $3.06 at the time of reporting. This marks a 2.54% drop in the last 24 hours and an 11.41% decline over the past seven days. While some investors may view this dip as a potential reentry point, analysts like Ramos argue that the broader trajectory suggests a higher long-term valuation range, making price levels below $2 increasingly unlikely going forward.

Both are gaining momentum, but only one is capturing the imagination of retail and institutional investors alike as a clear leader in this next wave of opportunity. Cardano, the veteran blockchain platform, is building toward a more decentralized and scalable future. But MAGACOIN FINANCE—leaning into transparency, compliance-readiness, and viral investor demand—is increasingly seen as the frontrunner in the race not only to $5, but to a possible 100× return. Cardano Rebuilds on Strong Technical Footing There’s no denying Cardano’s resilience. Long favored for its academic roots and methodical development, the platform continues to grow its DeFi ecosystem and expand its governance capabilities. The much-anticipated Chang Hard Fork is ushering in the Voltaire era, where ADA holders can vote, manage treasury functions, and guide the protocol’s direction. Layer-2 scaling with Hydra is also progressing, offering real-world applications a path to cheaper, faster transactions. And Cardano’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) has climbed meaningfully—signaling renewed investor interest and active use. With ETF speculation on the horizon, ADA certainly has upside. But many investors question how much of its future is already priced in—and whether its slower pace of innovation could leave it outpaced by newer, leaner projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Clear Breakout Challenger in 2025 In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just participating in the market—it’s leading a shift. Built on a community-first, compliance-aligned framework, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the attention of analysts and early institutions for one reason: it’s designed for where crypto is going next. Its fixed supply, fully decentralized tokenomics, and lack of venture capital involvement give it a level of structural purity that’s rare in today’s market. Investors are flocking to it not just for the meme energy, but for what’s under the hood: smart contract audits by CertiK and HashEx, a roadmap filled with actual product rollouts, and early traction from real users seeking more than hype. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Holds the Advantage While Cardano continues to build steadily on its established strengths, MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving with a sense of urgency that’s hard to ignore. It’s not just another token riding market momentum—it’s tapping into a breakout story that’s still in its early chapters. With U.S. regulations evolving and investor focus shifting toward compliant, community-driven projects, MAGACOIN’s strong brand identity and fast-growing support base give it a distinct edge. In a market where timing and narrative matter, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a first mover in the next big cycle. Investors who waited for Bitcoin at $10K or ETH at $300 often cite the same regret—ignoring early signs of conviction. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum fast. With listings on the horizon and growing interest, this early-stage window won’t stay open for long. Final Thoughts With the cryptocurrency seeing a record-level surge, investors already have their gaze on MAGACOIN FINANCE as the clear altcoin to watch. While Cardano continues to build, MAGACOIN is already accelerating—drawing capital, community, and attention with every new milestone. The $5 mark is a symbolic target—but the real win lies in long-term upside. For those seeking the next altcoin with real breakout potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is more than a competitor—it’s the early winner of the next FOMO cycle.

According to a settlement administrator’s portal, The Bank of Canton will pay $300,000 to settle a lawsuit accusing the Canton, Massachusetts-based lender of negligent data security practices. Class members in the lawsuit, defined as the existing, former and prospective clients of The Bank of Canton in the US impacted by the cybersecurity incident, will receive up to $2,500 for ordinary losses and up to $10,000 for extraordinary losses. Claimants must provide documentation to prove the losses they suffered as a result of the data breach. Class members who choose not to file documentary evidence can opt for an alternative cash payment of $100. Claims must be submitted by October 9th, with a final approval hearing for the settlement scheduled to be held in a Massachusetts court on October 21st. Payments will be made once the settlement is approved by a judge. The Bank of Canton is settling the lawsuit a little over a year after the incident occurred. On or around May 27th of 2023, cybercriminals allegedly gained access to MOVEit Transfer, a file transfer software system used by a third-party service provider of the bank. The lawsuit alleged the incident led to the sensitive data of the Bank of Canton’s customers, potentially including, account name, account number(s), and Social Security numbers being exposed. The lawsuit was subsequently filed in November of 2023. Despite agreeing to settle, The Bank of Canton denies the allegations made in the lawsuit.

In the Q2 earnings call, Tan said he’s pausing some factory projects and being more cautious with spending. He criticized the investments made under former CEO Pat Gelsinger as “excessive and unwise,” adding on a conference call, “I do not subscribe to the belief that if you build it, they will come.” Under Gelsinger’s leadership, Intel had pursued a transformation into a prominent foundry for third‑party clients, particularly emphasizingthe development of the advanced 14A node. However, during Thursday’s conference, Tan signaled that Intel’s deployment of that process will proceed in a limited, step‑by‑step fashion. He said they won’t start full-scale 14A production until enough customers are on board. According to Bloomberg that announcement triggered asell‑off, driving the stock to $20.70 in New York, its largest single‑session decline in more than a quarter‑year. Investors worry that putting off new manufacturingsteps means Intel is giving up its long‑held lead in chipmaking. Intel’s plans stir acquisition talk Intel’s recent challenges have fueled speculation about potential divestitures or acquisitions, yet no definitive suitor has surfaced. Interested parties for its fabrication facilities, such as TSMC, have reportedly withdrawn their interest. Tan reiterated his intention to maintain an integrated manufacturing and design organization, while divesting smaller subdivisions. This week, Intel announced plans to carve out its networking group as an independent entity. The company added that it is courting strategic backers, without disclosing identities, a move initially revealed by CRN. In the filing, Intel projected Q3 revenue between $12.6 billion and $13.6 billion, yet fell short of profit targets. It warned of narrower margins leading to a forecasted breakeven quarter, below the 4‑cent per share gain analysts anticipated. In Q2, Intel reported revenue of $12.9 billion, virtually unchanged year‑over‑year and surpassing the $11.9 billion consensus. The quarter’s results included a 10 cent per share loss versus the 1 cent profit Wall Street analysts had anticipated. Intel lags behind rivals despite 13% stock gain By Thursday’s market close, Intel’s share performance had risen 13% year‑to‑date, in line with the broader chip manufacturing sector. But Nvidia and AMD have done even better, thanks to their lead in AI chip design. Tan’s immediate focus remains on stabilizing Intel’s balance sheet. To date, he has enacted widespread layoffs and reduced capital expenditure plans. The firm announced it would suspend its planned facilities in Germany and Poland and decelerate development at the Ohio site. Management confirmed approximately $18 billion of capital investment for new fabrication sites and machinery in 2025, with less spending next year. Since his March appointment, Tan conceded that Intel must rebuild its competitiveness in PC and server CPU markets. He is likewise formulating a strategy to enter the AI accelerator arena, currently led by Nvidia. Intel said PC demand got a boost because manufacturers stocked up in advance of possible tariffs, but it still lost market share in both its PC chip business and its outside foundry operations. CFO Dave Zinsner added that the expected economic slowdown never arrived, helping lift orders, and noted some customers pulled orders forward to avoid those tariffs. Intel’s PC division delivered $7.9 billion in sales, exceeding the $7.3 billion consensus figure. Data‑center revenue came in at $3.9 billion versus $3.7 billion anticipated, and the foundry segment recorded $4.4 billion, in line with estimates. Previously, Intel established goals to reduce operating expenses to roughly $17 billion in 2025 and $16 billion in 2026, targets it still expects to meet. During Gelsinger’s tenure, Intel invested tens of billions in new fabs to attract external clientele and reclaim its process leadership. In an internal memo sent Thursday, Tan criticized that strategy as overly aggressive, noting that rapid outlays lacked sufficient demand and left production capacities underused.

The latest update from the software development platform Alternative reveals a significant shift: the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has climbed to a notable 72 as of July 26th. This places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, a two-point increase from the previous day, signaling a prevailing positive sentiment despite underlying market dynamics. But what does this really mean for you, the investor, and the broader crypto landscape? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does 72 Signify? In the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrencies, emotions can run high, significantly influencing market movements. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a vital barometer, designed to measure these very emotions. Ranging from 0 to 100, it provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment among crypto investors. A score of 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear,’ suggesting that investors are overly worried, potentially leading to panic selling. Conversely, a score of 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed,’ indicating that the market is overbought and perhaps due for a correction, driven by irrational exuberance. The recent rise to 72, firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests a widespread optimism. This isn’t just a fleeting feeling; it points to strong buying pressure, increased market activity, and a general belief among participants that prices will continue to rise. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market pullbacks, as irrational exuberance can lead to unsustainable price bubbles. However, it can also reflect genuine bullish momentum driven by positive developments and increasing adoption. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for making informed decisions, rather than being swept away by the prevailing sentiment. Decoding the Market’s Mood: The Six Pillars of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The power of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach. It doesn’t rely on a single metric but aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently, to paint a comprehensive picture of market sentiment. This holistic view helps to provide a more accurate reflection than any single indicator could offer. Let’s break down these pillars: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, as investors become nervous about sharp price swings. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values. High buying volumes and strong positive momentum often indicate a greedy market, as more money flows in. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for specific crypto-related hashtags. A rapid increase in post volume and positive sentiment often points towards growing excitement and potential greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component traditionally gathered investor sentiment through weekly polls. These surveys directly gauged whether investors felt the market was bullish or bearish, providing a direct insight into their psychological state. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be shifting away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, a decreasing dominance can suggest growing confidence in altcoins, potentially indicating greed. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing Google search queries related to cryptocurrencies, this factor gauges public interest. A surge in search terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto crash’ might signal fear, while searches for ‘buy Bitcoin’ or ‘best altcoins to buy’ could indicate greed. The temporary pausing of the surveys component means the index is currently relying on the other five factors, which still provide a robust assessment of the market’s emotional state. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Opportunities and Risks for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone, it presents a double-edged sword for investors. On one hand, it signals strong market confidence and potentially continued upward price momentum. This can be an exciting time for those holding assets, as their portfolios may see significant gains. The prevailing optimism can attract new capital, further fueling rallies. However, the ‘Greed’ zone also carries inherent risks. History has shown that periods of extreme greed can lead to irrational behavior, such as: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Investors might rush into assets without proper research, driven by the fear of missing out on quick profits. This often leads to buying at local tops. Overvaluation: Assets may become significantly overvalued, detached from their fundamental utility or development progress. Increased Volatility: While momentum is high, a market driven by greed can be prone to sharper corrections as early investors take profits, or as minor negative news triggers a cascade of selling. Ignoring Red Flags: The pervasive optimism can cause investors to overlook cautionary signals or fundamental weaknesses in projects. For savvy investors, a high ‘Greed’ score isn’t necessarily a signal to sell everything, but rather a prompt for heightened caution and strategic planning. It’s a time to review your portfolio, consider taking some profits, and avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on emotion. Beyond the Numbers: Limitations and Nuances of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool, it’s essential to understand its limitations. No single indicator can perfectly predict market movements, and this index is no exception. Here are some nuances to consider: Not a Sole Indicator: The index should be used as one piece of a larger analytical puzzle. It complements, rather than replaces, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and macroeconomic considerations. Bitcoin-Centric: While it measures overall crypto sentiment, its components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and dominance. Altcoin-specific sentiment might vary. Lagging or Leading?: Sometimes the index can be seen as a lagging indicator, reflecting sentiment that has already built up. At other times, a rapid shift in the index can precede significant market moves. Dynamic Market: The crypto market evolves rapidly. What constitutes ‘fear’ or ‘greed’ can shift over time as market participants mature and new trends emerge. Impact of Paused Surveys: The temporary absence of survey data means one direct measure of investor psychology is missing, potentially affecting the holistic nature of the index. Responsible investing always involves a diversified approach to information gathering. The index offers a fantastic psychological overlay to your existing market analysis. Strategic Approaches in a ‘Greedy’ Market: Leveraging the Crypto Fear & Greed Index So, how can you effectively leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index when it’s in the ‘Greed’ zone? It’s about using it as a guide for emotional discipline, rather than a definitive buy or sell signal. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Risk Exposure: When greed is high, consider reducing your exposure to highly speculative assets or taking some profits off the table, especially from assets that have seen parabolic rises. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue with a consistent DCA strategy, but perhaps be more selective about new entries. A ‘greedy’ market might not be the best time for large lump-sum investments. Set Profit Targets and Stop-Losses: Define clear entry and exit strategies. High greed often leads to overextension, making it crucial to protect your gains with pre-determined profit targets and stop-losses. Focus on Fundamentals: In a market driven by emotion, revert to the fundamentals. Investigate projects with strong technology, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities, rather than chasing hype. Patience and Discipline: The index serves as a reminder to be patient and disciplined. Don’t let FOMO dictate your actions. Wait for better entry points or consolidate gains. By combining the insights from the index with sound investment principles, you can navigate the emotional swings of the crypto market more effectively and protect your capital. Conclusion: The ascent of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 72, signaling a strong ‘Greed’ sentiment, is a significant development for the cryptocurrency market. It reflects a period of heightened optimism and strong buying interest, driven by various factors from market momentum to social media buzz. While this environment can be exhilarating and offer potential for gains, it also calls for a disciplined approach to investing. Understanding the components of the index and acknowledging its nuances are crucial for making informed decisions. By using the index as a psychological compass rather than a definitive roadmap, investors can better navigate the market’s emotional tides, identify potential risks, and capitalize on opportunities while safeguarding their investments. Stay informed, stay strategic, and always prioritize your own research in this dynamic financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini’s co-founder, recently claimed JPMorgan abruptly halted Gemini’s crypto banking onboarding. This alleged move, he suggested, was a direct consequence of his public criticism of JPMorgan’s new policy to charge fintech companies for customer bank account data access, a decision reported by Bloomberg. The Unfolding Drama in Crypto Banking : What Exactly Happened Between JPMorgan and Gemini? In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Tyler Winklevoss detailed the alleged sequence of events. He asserted that JPMorgan, a titan in the traditional banking world, had paused Gemini’s onboarding. The timing, he suggested, was not coincidental, coming shortly after he voiced strong opposition to JPMorgan’s decision to levy fees on fintech firms for accessing customer bank account information. Winklevoss characterized this move as anti-competitive, arguing that it aims to stifle innovation and weaken the burgeoning fintech and crypto sectors. This isn’t the first time Gemini has reportedly faced banking hurdles. Winklevoss also claimed that his firm had previously been “off-boarded” during what he termed “Operation ChokePoint 2.0.” This phrase, widely used within the crypto community, refers to an alleged coordinated effort by a previous U.S. administration to limit banking access for businesses deemed “high-risk,” a category that often included crypto companies. Such actions, if true, highlight a persistent challenge for legitimate digital asset businesses seeking stable and reliable financial services. The implications of such a halt are significant. For a crypto exchange like Gemini, access to robust banking services is fundamental for operations, including facilitating fiat deposits and withdrawals for users, managing treasury, and conducting essential business transactions. When a major financial institution allegedly withdraws or pauses such services, it can create operational bottlenecks and raise concerns about the stability and accessibility of the crypto ecosystem. Is This ‘Operation ChokePoint 2.0’ in Action? Understanding the Allegations Against Crypto Banking The term “Operation ChokePoint 2.0” resonates deeply within the crypto industry, evoking memories of a period where many crypto businesses struggled to secure or maintain banking relationships. While the original “Operation Choke Point” was a U.S. Department of Justice initiative targeting fraudulent businesses, the crypto community adapted the term to describe an alleged informal campaign by regulators and banks to de-bank crypto firms. This often meant banks, under perceived pressure, would suddenly close accounts or refuse services to crypto-related entities, citing vague “risk management” concerns. Why do traditional banks often appear hesitant or even hostile towards the crypto sector? Several factors contribute to this cautious approach: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, comprehensive regulations for cryptocurrencies and digital assets makes banks wary of potential legal and compliance risks. They fear being penalized for facilitating illicit activities if proper frameworks are not in place. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC) Concerns: Despite robust AML/KYC procedures by crypto exchanges, the decentralized nature of some cryptocurrencies and past illicit use cases lead banks to perceive the sector as inherently high-risk for money laundering and terrorist financing. Reputational Risk: Banks are often concerned about negative public perception or association with a sector still grappling with scams, hacks, and volatility. Technological Gap: Integrating traditional banking systems with new blockchain technologies can be complex and costly, requiring significant investment in infrastructure and expertise. The alleged actions by JPMorgan, as described by Winklevoss, suggest that these underlying tensions persist, creating a challenging environment for legitimate crypto banking operations. If true, it paints a picture where established financial giants might leverage their market dominance to control access and competition, rather than fostering a level playing field for innovation. Why Does This Incident Matter for the Future of Fintech and Crypto Banking ? This alleged halt goes beyond a single business dispute; it touches upon fundamental questions about competition, innovation, and the future of finance. Here’s why it’s a critical development: 1. Potential for Anti-Competitive Practices: If a major bank like JPMorgan can use its market power to restrict access for fintech and crypto firms, it raises serious concerns about anti-competitive behavior. Charging for data access or halting services could be seen as a way to protect existing revenue streams and stifle disruptors. 2. Impact on Innovation: Fintech and crypto companies thrive on innovation, often by offering more efficient, cheaper, or more accessible financial services. If they are denied essential banking infrastructure, their ability to innovate and scale is severely hampered, ultimately limiting consumer choice and progress. 3. The Battle for Data Control: The dispute over charging for customer bank account data highlights a broader struggle for control over financial data. Fintechs argue for open access to facilitate services like budgeting apps or personalized financial advice, while banks seek to monetize or control this data. This incident underscores the high stakes in this data battle. 4. User Experience and Market Access: Ultimately, these disputes affect everyday users. If crypto exchanges face banking difficulties, it can lead to slower transactions, higher fees, or even limited access to services for individuals and businesses engaging with digital assets. A healthy crypto banking ecosystem benefits everyone. The incident serves as a stark reminder that despite growing institutional interest in crypto, the underlying infrastructure and relationships with traditional finance remain fragile and subject to significant friction. Navigating the Regulatory Maze: Actionable Insights for Securing Your Crypto Banking Future For crypto businesses navigating this complex landscape, securing stable banking relationships is paramount. While challenges persist, there are strategies to mitigate risks and build resilience: Diversify Banking Relationships: Relying on a single banking partner can be risky. Explore relationships with multiple banks, including smaller, more crypto-friendly institutions or specialized digital asset banks that understand the unique needs of the industry. Prioritize Regulatory Compliance: Proactively invest in robust AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance programs. Demonstrate a commitment to meeting or exceeding regulatory expectations. This builds trust with financial institutions and regulators. Build Strong Legal and Compliance Teams: Having in-house experts who understand both financial regulations and blockchain technology is crucial. They can help navigate complex legal landscapes and ensure operational integrity. Advocate for Clearer Regulations: Engage with policymakers and industry associations to advocate for clear, comprehensive, and sensible regulations for digital assets. A well-defined regulatory framework benefits both crypto businesses and traditional financial institutions by reducing uncertainty. Explore Hybrid Models: Consider models that blend traditional banking services with decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions for certain operations, where appropriate and compliant. This can offer alternative pathways for liquidity and financial services. The key is to demonstrate transparency, adhere to best practices, and actively work towards bridging the gap between the nascent crypto industry and the established financial system to ensure a robust crypto banking future. What’s Next for Crypto Banking : Collaboration or Continued Conflict? The alleged halt by JPMorgan on Gemini’s onboarding process is a vivid illustration of the ongoing power struggle between old and new finance. While some traditional financial institutions are cautiously embracing blockchain technology and digital assets, others appear to maintain a protective stance, potentially viewing crypto and fintech as threats rather than opportunities for collaboration. The future of crypto banking hinges on several factors: regulatory clarity, technological integration, and the willingness of both sides to find common ground. Will traditional banks eventually fully integrate crypto services, or will the industry see the rise of entirely new, crypto-native financial institutions that bypass traditional gatekeepers? The answer will likely involve a mix of both, driven by market demand and regulatory evolution. One thing is clear: Tyler Winklevoss’s vocal stand against JPMorgan highlights a critical need for open dialogue and fair competition. As the digital economy continues to expand, ensuring equitable access to essential financial services for innovative companies will be crucial for fostering growth and ensuring that the benefits of technological progress are widely shared. In conclusion, the alleged halting of Gemini’s onboarding by JPMorgan, as reported by Tyler Winklevoss, serves as a powerful reminder of the deep-seated challenges and tensions that persist in the realm of crypto banking . It underscores the critical need for regulatory clarity, fair competition, and a willingness from both traditional finance and the crypto sector to forge pathways for mutual growth. This incident is not merely a dispute between two entities; it’s a symptom of the broader struggle to integrate a disruptive technology into a long-established financial system. The path forward will undoubtedly be complex, but the resilience and advocacy of figures like Winklevoss signal a continued fight for a more open and equitable financial future.

Investors are increasingly turning to presale opportunities in search of the next major breakout token. With Bitcoin trading above $120,000 and altcoin dominance rising, momentum is building behind early-stage crypto presale projects with strong fundamentals and narrative appeal. Among the best crypto presale contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting significant attention. The politically themed decentralized token has millions in its ongoing presale and is positioning itself as one of the most promising altcoins of the current market cycle. Bitcoin’s Surge Rekindles the Presale Narrative Bitcoin is retesting its all-time high of $123,000 following a rally that pushed the price above $120,000. The exponential moving averages are stacked below the current price, indicating strong bullish momentum. The 20-day EMA, now at $118,600, is acting as dynamic support. Both on-chain and derivatives data remain bullish. Futures open interest has risen 2% to $87 billion, while options volume has surged past $110 billion. On Binance, trader sentiment is skewed heavily long, with a long-to-short ratio of 1.87. Bitcoin’s weekly chart reveals an inverse head and shoulders pattern, with projected upside targets ranging from $135,000 to $140,000. While large-cap assets tend to lead during the early stages of a bull market, historical trends suggest that presales and lower-cap tokens often deliver the highest returns as capital begins rotating further out on the risk curve. As Bitcoin’s dominance starts to decline, investors are increasingly exploring tokens with higher upside potential, and one of the favored altcoins is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Best Crypto Presale to Buy: MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE blends political meme culture with real decentralized architecture. Interestingly, it’s riding the meme wave and building infrastructure, community, and trust. Key strengths include: Audit-certified: Smart contracts audited by CertiK and HashEx Tokenomics: Fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, no central wallet or VC allocations Growing community: Over 6,464 unique wallet addresses, with new additions daily Unlike typical meme coins, this crypto presale has a roadmap focused on utility and long-term growth. Its politically charged narrative taps into a niche but passionate user base, comparable to early SHIBA INU and Dogecoin, but with better structure and decentralization. Analysts Predict 1000x Potential for This Crypto Presale Crypto analysts and newsletters have increasingly spotlighted MAGACOIN, with mentions tripling in the last month. Many predict a potential 1000x return based on the current presale price and projected post-launch demand. This bullish outlook is not based on hype alone. MAGACOIN’s development team has already integrated major wallet support (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet) and is laying the groundwork for CEX listings and staking. While many meme tokens see short-lived pumps, MAGACOIN is working toward sustained relevance through transparency, utility, and community-led governance. Final Call: A Time-Sensitive Opportunity With MAGACOIN FINANCE now in its final presale stage, investors have a closing window to secure discounted tokens before the price increases. As altcoin season heats up and Bitcoin approaches new highs, early entries into high-upside crypto presales could yield exponential returns. For those seeking the next breakout altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a unique blend of narrative strength and technical legitimacy. With analysts projecting significant post-launch growth, this may be one of the most promising presale opportunities in the current market cycle.

That’s the question on every trader’s mind as MoonBull ($MOBU) captures the spotlight with an exclusive whitelist, while Bonk (BONK) and Doginme (DOGINME) volumes rise, even as prices slip. The buzz is building, and the competition for the next big crypto is heating up. If you’re watching for high-energy projects and communities that move fast, this moment is tough to ignore. Across the meme coin world, two patterns are emerging. Price dips are making headlines for Bonk and Doginme, yet active trading volumes are showing that interest isn’t fading.

If there’s one thing to remember, it’s that these whitelist spots are limited and filling fast. Bonk’s Volume Climbs Despite Ongoing Price Drop Bonk (BONK) is no stranger to the spotlight. As one of Solana’s leading dog-themed meme coins, it keeps finding ways to drive attention. While the price has slipped 2.27% in the last day and 3.02% over the week, trading volume is up by 2.22%. That’s a clear sign that, even in a downturn, Bonk remains a favorite among active traders. Integrated deeply into Solana’s DeFi scene, Bonk’s use in lending, borrowing, and staking continues to draw new holders. The increasing volume during price dips shows the kind of ongoing engagement that meme coins thrive on. Traders are staying active, and Bonk’s flexible role in decentralized finance keeps it in play for those betting on community-driven projects. Bonk’s ability to maintain high activity, even when the price slides, points to the resilient spirit of meme coins on Solana. While it’s already launched and widely traded, Bonk remains an essential part of today’s meme coin movement. Doginme’s Trading Volume Rises Through a 17% Weekly Dip Doginme (DOGINME) has been buzzing across social channels since its creation, inspired by a viral moment that captured the crypto crowd’s imagination. Its price is down 1.27% in the last 24 hours and a steep 17.19% over the past week. But here’s what stands out: trading volume is up 6.31%, showing that community engagement remains strong. Doginme stands out for its origin story, born from a collective attitude of self-belief and perseverance, rather than complex technical features. Its market performance is almost entirely driven by community trends and online hype, not by any underlying utility or DeFi integration. Even as the price has taken a hit, Doginme’s rising trading volume signals that traders aren’t backing away. The coin’s popularity continues to rely on the “dog in me” spirit, creating a meme-driven ecosystem that’s still finding new supporters and active speculation. Concluding Remarks Across the market, traders are seeing the same trends. Bonk and Doginme show that meme coin activity is alive and well, with volume climbing even as prices dip. But it’s MoonBull’s whitelist surge and exclusive rewards that are driving the most excitement for those chasing the next big crypto. The window to get whitelisted for MoonBull is closing quickly. Every sign points to MoonBull’s early supporters getting the best deals, rewards, and access before the mainstream finds out.

48951898,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=182906,1753491310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48951898.jpeg,PUMP Presale: The Astonishing $8.2 Million Profit Exit of a Major Investor,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pump-presale-profit-exit/,"BitcoinWorld PUMP Presale: The Astonishing $8.2 Million Profit Exit of a Major Investor In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, stories of massive gains and strategic maneuvers often capture the headlines. Recently, one such event has sent ripples through the market: a prominent investor in the PUMP presale successfully exited their entire position, realizing an astonishing $8.2 million in profit. This remarkable liquidation highlights the immense potential, and inherent risks, within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. The Astonishing Exit: How a Major Investor Cashed Out from the PUMP Presale The crypto community was abuzz when news broke of the largest institutional holder of PUMP completing a full liquidation of its presale allocation. According to on-chain analytics firm EmberCN, this investor transferred a staggering 8 billion PUMP tokens, valued at approximately $20.11 million, to the digital asset prime brokerage FalconX. This move marked the complete divestment of their initial investment and the culmination of a highly profitable venture. Let’s break down the key figures of this incredible PUMP presale journey: Initial Investment: 100 million USDC Tokens Acquired: 25 billion PUMP Acquisition Terms: Same price as retail investors, crucially, with no lock-up period. Liquidation Period: Began on July 16 and concluded early Friday. Total Realized Profit: A colossal $8.2 million. This investor’s ability to exit such a substantial position without a lock-up period is a critical detail, differentiating their terms from many traditional private placements and highlighting the unique dynamics of certain crypto presales. Understanding the PUMP Presale Phenomenon: What Makes It So Attractive? To truly grasp the significance of this $8.2 million profit, it’s essential to understand the mechanics of crypto presales, particularly those facilitated by platforms like pump.fun. A presale is an early fundraising round where investors can acquire tokens before they are publicly listed on exchanges. For many, it’s an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially high-growth project. Platforms like pump.fun have democratized the meme coin creation process, allowing anyone to launch a token without extensive coding knowledge. This has led to a proliferation of new tokens, many of which gain traction rapidly, creating volatile yet potentially lucrative opportunities for early investors. The allure lies in the possibility of exponential returns if the token gains widespread adoption and market cap. Strategic Masterclass: Dissecting the Investor’s PUMP Presale Strategy The investor’s success wasn’t merely luck; it was a calculated move within a high-risk environment. Their strategy can be analyzed through several lenses: Early Entry: Investing 100 million USDC in the private PUMP presale round meant securing a massive allocation at the earliest possible stage. This provided a significant advantage, as the token’s value likely appreciated considerably from its initial presale price. Massive Capital Deployment: The sheer scale of the investment ($100 million) allowed for an acquisition of 25 billion PUMP tokens. In volatile markets, larger positions can yield disproportionately higher profits when prices move favorably. No Lock-up Period: This was arguably the most crucial element. Unlike many institutional investments that come with vesting schedules or lock-up periods, this investor had immediate liquidity. This flexibility allowed them to begin liquidating their holdings as early as July 16, capitalizing on peak market conditions and avoiding potential downturns that could have eroded their gains. Strategic Liquidation: The phased exit from July 16 to early Friday suggests a deliberate strategy to offload such a large volume without causing a drastic price crash, although any major exit can induce market volatility. This case serves as a prime example of how sophisticated investors can leverage unique market structures and terms to maximize their returns in the highly speculative crypto market. What Does This Massive Exit Mean for the Market and Future PUMP Presale Ventures? A liquidation of this magnitude naturally raises questions about its broader implications. For the PUMP token itself, a large sell-off could exert downward pressure on its price, depending on market demand and liquidity. However, the fact that the investor managed to exit with such a substantial profit suggests that there was sufficient market depth to absorb the sell pressure without a complete collapse. More broadly, this event: Highlights Profit Potential: It serves as a powerful testament to the high-reward nature of early-stage crypto investments, particularly in the presale phase. Underlines Liquidity Importance: The successful exit underscores the importance of a token’s liquidity and the platform’s ability to facilitate large transactions. Influences Investor Sentiment: Such stories can inspire new investors to explore presale opportunities, though it’s vital to temper enthusiasm with a realistic understanding of the risks. Shapes Future Presale Terms: Projects might review their presale terms, especially regarding lock-up periods, to balance early investor incentives with long-term token stability. Lessons from the PUMP Presale Exit: Actionable Insights for Retail Investors While the scale of this investor’s capital might be beyond the reach of most retail participants, there are valuable lessons to be learned from this profitable PUMP presale exit: Due Diligence is Paramount: Before investing in any presale, conduct thorough research on the project, its team, utility (if any), and community. Don’t chase hype without understanding the fundamentals. Understand the Terms: Always scrutinize the presale terms, especially regarding vesting schedules, lock-up periods, and token distribution. The absence of a lock-up was key for this investor. Risk Management is Crucial: Presales are inherently high-risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio instead of putting all your eggs in one basket. Have an Exit Strategy: Knowing when to take profits is as important as knowing when to enter. This investor had a clear plan to liquidate their holdings. For retail investors, setting profit targets and stop-losses can be invaluable. Beware of FOMO: The fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to impulsive decisions. While the allure of quick profits is strong, maintain a rational approach to investing. The crypto market is a double-edged sword, offering both unprecedented opportunities for wealth creation and significant potential for loss. Stories like the PUMP presale profit exit remind us of the former, but they should also serve as a stark reminder of the need for caution and informed decision-making. Navigating the Volatile World of Crypto Presales While the story of the PUMP presale investor is inspiring, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and risks associated with meme coin presales and the broader crypto market. Not every presale will yield such astounding returns, and many projects fail to gain traction, leading to significant losses for early investors. The landscape is fraught with: Extreme Volatility: Prices can swing wildly in short periods, making it difficult to predict outcomes. Lack of Fundamental Value: Many meme coins lack a tangible product or service, with their value driven purely by community sentiment and speculation. Rug Pulls and Scams: The decentralized nature of some platforms can be exploited by malicious actors who launch tokens only to abandon them and abscond with investor funds. Market Manipulation: Large holders can significantly influence prices, creating pump-and-dump schemes. Therefore, while the dream of striking it rich in a PUMP presale is captivating, a pragmatic and cautious approach is always advisable. Educating oneself about the risks, understanding the project’s true potential, and never investing more than you can afford to lose are foundational principles for navigating this exciting yet perilous domain. Conclusion: A Glimpse into High-Stakes Crypto Investing The astonishing $8.2 million profit realized by a major investor from the PUMP presale serves as a powerful narrative in the ongoing saga of cryptocurrency. It underscores the incredible wealth-generation potential that exists within the nascent digital asset space, particularly for those with significant capital, strategic foresight, and favorable investment terms. While such massive gains are rare and often associated with high risk, this event offers valuable insights into the dynamics of large-scale crypto exits and the importance of liquidity, timing, and shrewd decision-making. For retail investors, it’s a reminder to approach the exciting world of presales with both ambition and a healthy dose of caution, armed with knowledge and a robust risk management strategy.

48952147,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=773997,1753491593,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48952147.jpeg,Microsoft probes suspected leak from cybersecurity partner program,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/microsoft-investigates-sharepoint-exploit/,"Microsoft is probing whether a leak from its Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP)—an early warning system for cybersecurity partners—may have enabled Chinese hackers to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in its SharePoint server software. The tech firm’s latest patch failed to fully resolve a critical flaw, exposing the tech giant’s systems to a sophisticated global cyber espionage campaign. In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft said the exploitation is being carried out by two Chinese state-affiliated groups, Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon, alongside a third group, also believed to be based in China. Microsoft probes suspected leak from cybersecurity partner program The company is now investigating whether details from its MAPP program—shared with partners ahead of public patch releases—may have been leaked, accelerating the spread of these attacks. Microsoft confirmed that it “continually evaluates the efficacy and security of all of our partner programs and makes the necessary improvements as needed.” The SharePoint vulnerability first came to light in May when Vietnamese security researcher Dinh Ho Anh Khoa demonstrated it at the Pwn2Own cybersecurity conference in Berlin, organized by Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative. Khoa was awarded $100,000, and Microsoft issued an initial patch in July. However, Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro, said that MAPP partners had been informed of the vulnerability across three waves—June 24, July 3, and July 7. Coincidentally, Microsoft noted the first exploit attempts began on July 7. Childs suggested the most likely scenario is that “someone in the MAPP program used that information to create the exploits.” While he didn’t name any vendor, he noted the exploit attempts originated mostly from China, making it “reasonable to speculate” the leak came from a company in that region. Chinese state-backed hackers exploit unpatched SharePoint vulnerability This is not the first time Microsoft has dealt with this kind of MAPP-related leak. A decade ago, the firm jettisoned China-headquartered Hangzhou DPTech Technologies Co., Ltd., for violating its nondisclosure agreement. Microsoft admitted at the time that there were risks and understood that vulnerable data could be abused. The MAPP program, which debuted in 2008, was intended to provide security vendors with advance notice of the technical details of vulnerabilities — and, on occasion, sample proof-of-concept code — so they could better protect their customers. A leaked breach now would fly directly in the face of the program’s mission—empowering defenders, not attackers. Microsoft has not disclosed whether it has identified the source of the leak, but emphasized that any NDA breach would be taken seriously. Past breaches resurface as Microsoft reconsiders MAPP program integrity In 2021, Microsoft suspected at least two other Chinese MAPP partners of leaking information about vulnerabilities in its Exchange servers. This led to a global hacking campaign that Microsoft attributed to a Chinese espionage group called Hafnium. It was one of the firm’s worst breaches ever—tens of thousands of exchange servers were hacked, including at the European Banking Authority and the Norwegian Parliament. After the 2021 incident, the company considered revising the MAPP program . But it did not disclose whether any changes were ultimately made, or whether any leaks were discovered. Under a 2021 Chinese law, companies and security researchers must report newly discovered vulnerabilities to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology within 48 hours, according to a report by the Atlantic Council. Some Chinese firms still involved in MAPP, such as Beijing CyberKunlun Technology Co Ltd., also participate in the China National Vulnerability Database—run by the Ministry of State Security—raising further concerns about dual reporting obligations. Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies, points to the lack of transparency in how Chinese companies reconcile Microsoft’s confidentiality rules with state reporting mandates. “We know some of these firms work with security agencies, and China’s vulnerability management is highly centralized,” he said. “This is an area that clearly needs more scrutiny.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Tech|Microsoft,EN,0,0,ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE|ETH|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 00:59:53

As Q3 2025 unfolds, it’s clear that the winners are real projects, not just buzz. Buyers now focus on coins with actual use, not just launches. From meme coins to Layer‑1s and Layer‑2 ecosystems, change is happening fast. Four coins stand out: BlockDAG, XRP, Ethereum, and Bonk. They all show promise, but one is truly standing out. Let’s dive in. This list reveals the top altcoins to watch, offering insight on growth, tech, and what makes each unique. 1. BlockDAG: $351 M Raised, 2,660 % ROI, 4,500 Builders BlockDAG leads the pack. This high‑speed Layer 1 network has raised $351 million so far. That’s huge attention for a new chain. They’re in Batch 29, priced now at $0.0276. But during the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, buyers can grab BlockDAG (BDAG) at just $0.0016 until August 11, a chance for big ROI. If someone compare to the $0.05 launch price, this move could mean 3,025 % gains. Early Batch 1 buyers already saw a 2,660 % return. So far, 24.3 billion coins have been sold. This shows strong momentum. What makes it stand out? Over 4,500 developers are building more than 300 apps. These include AI, DeFi, and real‑world tools. Each new app expands utility and demand. This isn’t empty hype, it’s growth in action. Many consider it one of the top altcoins to watch for strong on‑chain progress. The live demo has just launched, and excitement is through the roof. Developers and users are tuning in. With real apps, real adoption, and this one‑day offer, BlockDAG is gaining real heat. If momentum holds, it may keep climbing, making it a coin that stands out right now among alternatives. 2. Ethereum: The Go‑To Base For Crypto Builders Ethereum keeps its steady progress. It doesn’t chase the spotlight. But its role as the foundation for decentralized apps is solid. Millions in ETF inflows, over $700 million weekly, are pulling into Ethereum. Developer activity is strong, and Layer‑2 networks on top of it are growing fast. Updates aim to cut gas fees and improve speed. This draws creators in DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and more. For many, Ethereum is one of the top altcoins to watch because it’s proven, stable, and essential. Its growth may be slower, but it’s built to last. If one wants a reliable platform-driven coin, Ethereum remains a top pick. 3. XRP: Legal Clarity And Whale Interest XRP is gaining attention as U.S. legal clarity grows. Rumors of a possible XRP ETF are lifting spirits. Data shows big wallets moving XRP onto exchanges, often a sign of big market moves ahead. Price stays strong near key support levels, with the chance to reach $1.10 if momentum continues. XRP has both real use in cross‑border payments and increasing regulatory certainty. That makes it one of the top altcoins to watch, especially for those looking at compliance-friendly projects. Its mix of legal clarity and utility gives it a unique edge. 4. Bonk: Meme Power Riding On Solana Speed Bonk started as a meme coin but now shows real trade volume and community growth. Built on Solana, its quick settlement and low fees make trading easy. Small‑scale traders love it. Integration with Solana apps adds real-world use. Recent trends show Bonk still has strong cultural appeal. But it’s volatile and needs to build more beyond meme status. For active traders chasing quick moves, Bonk ranks high among the top altcoins to watch on short-term momentum. It’s colorful and fast-paced, but risky, so keep one’s eyes on it. Final Verdict Each coin brings something different: Ethereum offers a foundation, XRP brings legal clarity, Bonk has meme-inspired volume, and BlockDAG combines fast fundraising, real apps, and builder support. Among these, BlockDAG stands out with $351 million raised, over 4,500 builders, and a massive demo live now. This makes BlockDAG a top altcoin to watch among all four.

The ever-shifting dynamics of the cryptocurrency market often leave investors pondering the optimal strategy. A key indicator in this quest is the Altcoin Season Index, a widely tracked metric that offers valuable insights into the prevailing market sentiment and performance trends. As of 00:39 UTC on July 26, the Altcoin Season Index, as reported by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered a score of 43, marking a six-point increase from the previous day’s figure. This specific reading unequivocally signals that the market is currently immersed in what is known as ‘Bitcoin Season’. But what does this truly mean for you, and how should you navigate these waters? Let’s unpack the intricacies of the Altcoin Season and its implications. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index (ASI) and How Does It Work? The Altcoin Season Index (ASI) is a crucial metric developed and tracked by leading cryptocurrency price data platform, CoinMarketCap (CMC). It serves as a barometer for the broader crypto market, indicating whether altcoins are collectively outperforming Bitcoin, or vice-versa. Understanding this index is fundamental for any investor looking to optimize their crypto strategy. Here’s how the Altcoin Season Index operates: Scope of Measurement: The index rigorously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap over a 90-day period. It’s important to note that stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) are specifically excluded from this calculation to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority of these top 100 altcoins must demonstrate superior performance against Bitcoin. Specifically, at least 75% of these selected altcoins need to have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. When this threshold is met, the index typically registers a higher score, moving towards 100. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when Bitcoin’s dominance is evident. This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day period. A lower index score, moving towards 1, signifies Bitcoin Season. Score Range: The Altcoin Season Index scores range from 1 to 100, providing a clear visual representation of the market’s current state. A score of 43, as we see now, clearly falls within the Bitcoin Season range, indicating that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer over the last three months. This metric is invaluable because it helps investors gauge where the ‘smart money’ might be flowing and whether it’s a period to prioritize Bitcoin holdings or explore opportunities within the broader altcoin ecosystem. Why Are We Currently Experiencing Bitcoin Season? The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 43 isn’t just a random number; it reflects underlying market dynamics that favor Bitcoin. Several factors typically contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance and lead to a ‘Bitcoin Season’. Understanding these can help investors anticipate future shifts and make informed decisions. Here are some key reasons why Bitcoin often takes the lead: Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty, economic instability, or geopolitical tensions, investors often flock to Bitcoin. It’s perceived as the ‘digital gold’ or a safer haven compared to the more volatile and speculative altcoins. Its larger market capitalization and established infrastructure make it a more reliable store of value in turbulent times. Macroeconomic Headwinds: High inflation, rising interest rates, or broader economic downturns can lead to a general de-risking in financial markets. Cryptocurrency, being a high-risk asset class, often sees capital flow out of smaller, less liquid altcoins and into the more robust Bitcoin. Pre-Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s halving events, which occur approximately every four years, often precede significant price rallies. In the months leading up to a halving, there’s typically increased investor interest and accumulation of Bitcoin, leading to its outperformance. This pre-halving accumulation phase can often trigger a Bitcoin Season. Institutional Adoption and ETF Approvals: Major institutional interest, such as the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in various jurisdictions, funnels substantial capital directly into Bitcoin. This institutional demand can significantly boost Bitcoin’s price and market dominance, leaving altcoins relatively behind. Market Liquidity Consolidation: During periods of lower overall market liquidity, capital tends to consolidate into the most liquid assets. Bitcoin, with its vast trading volumes and deep order books, naturally attracts this liquidity, further strengthening its position. The current score of 43 suggests that over the past 90 days, a significant portion of capital has been flowing into Bitcoin, with fewer than 25% of the top 100 altcoins managing to outperform it. This reflects a period where investors are prioritizing stability and the established strength of Bitcoin over the higher-risk, higher-reward potential of altcoins. How Can Investors Navigate the Current Bitcoin Season? Understanding that we are in a Bitcoin Season is one thing; knowing how to act on it is another. While every investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals differ, there are general strategies that can help you navigate this period effectively and potentially position yourself for future gains, whether it’s the next Altcoin Season or continued Bitcoin strength. Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season Characteristics Characteristic Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Dominant Performer Bitcoin (BTC) Majority of Altcoins ASI Score Range 1-25 (typically below 50) 75-100 Investor Sentiment Cautious, ‘flight to safety’ Risk-on, speculative Typical Strategy Accumulate BTC, selective altcoin scouting Diversify into promising altcoins Market Drivers Macro factors, halving cycles, institutional inflows Innovation, new narratives, DeFi/NFT booms Here are some actionable insights for your portfolio: Prioritize Bitcoin Accumulation: During Bitcoin Season, focusing on accumulating more Bitcoin can be a sound strategy. As the dominant asset, it tends to lead the market and often recovers faster from downturns. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin can be particularly effective. Selective Altcoin Scouting: While it’s ‘Bitcoin Season’, it doesn’t mean all altcoins are dead. Some niche altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development, and unique use cases might still perform well, or present attractive accumulation opportunities at lower prices. Focus on projects with real utility and strong communities. Avoid highly speculative or meme coins during this period. Rebalance Your Portfolio: Regularly review your portfolio’s allocation. If altcoins have significantly underperformed, consider rebalancing by converting some altcoin holdings into Bitcoin or stablecoins to reduce overall risk exposure. Enhance Risk Management: Volatility remains a constant in crypto. During Bitcoin Season, altcoins can experience sharper declines. Implement stricter stop-loss orders, take profits on any short-term rallies, and avoid over-leveraging. Deep Dive into Research: Use this period to conduct thorough research on potential altcoin gems. When the market eventually shifts to Altcoin Season, you’ll be well-prepared to identify and invest in projects with strong growth potential. Look beyond price charts to whitepapers, development teams, partnerships, and community engagement. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on macroeconomic indicators, Bitcoin’s price action, and news related to institutional adoption. These factors often dictate the duration and intensity of Bitcoin Season. Remember, the crypto market is cyclical. What goes down often comes back up, but timing is crucial. Adopting a patient and strategic approach during Bitcoin Season can lay the groundwork for significant gains when the winds inevitably shift. When Can We Expect the Next Altcoin Season to Emerge? The transition from Bitcoin Season back to Altcoin Season is a highly anticipated event for many investors, as it often brings explosive gains for smaller cap cryptocurrencies. While there’s no precise timeline, historical patterns and market indicators offer clues about when the next Altcoin Season might emerge. The Altcoin Season Index will be our primary guide, looking for a sustained climb above 75. Key triggers and conditions often precede an Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Often, an Altcoin Season kicks off after Bitcoin experiences a significant rally, followed by a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows Bitcoin’s dominance to stabilize or slightly decline, and capital that flowed into BTC during its rally then seeks higher returns in altcoins. Increased Market Liquidity: A general influx of new capital into the crypto market, driven by renewed investor confidence or positive macroeconomic factors, provides the necessary liquidity for altcoins to pump. This fresh capital often flows into riskier assets once Bitcoin has absorbed the initial wave. Emergence of New Narratives and Innovations: The crypto market thrives on innovation. The rise of new sectors like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), GameFi, Layer-2 solutions, or real-world asset (RWA) tokenization can ignite interest and capital flow into specific altcoins within those ecosystems. These narratives often create their own mini-seasons within the broader Altcoin Season. Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: A clear sign of an impending Altcoin Season is a sustained decrease in Bitcoin’s market dominance percentage. As investors feel more comfortable taking on risk, they shift capital from BTC to altcoins, causing BTC dominance to fall. Positive Regulatory Developments: Clear and favorable regulatory frameworks can instill confidence in the broader crypto market, encouraging more widespread adoption and investment, which benefits altcoins disproportionately due to their higher growth potential. While the Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 43, indicating Bitcoin’s strength, observing these triggers and patiently waiting for the market to signal a shift will be crucial. Predicting the exact timing is impossible, but being prepared for the potential catalysts is key. Challenges and Opportunities in a Bitcoin-Dominated Market Navigating a Bitcoin-dominated market, as indicated by the current Altcoin Season Index, presents both unique challenges and compelling opportunities for investors. Challenges: Altcoin Underperformance: The most apparent challenge is the tendency for many altcoins to underperform Bitcoin. This can lead to frustration for investors holding a large altcoin portfolio, as their assets might stagnate or even decline while Bitcoin gains ground. Increased Volatility for Altcoins: Smaller cap altcoins, especially, can experience heightened volatility during Bitcoin Season. They might see sharper drops during market corrections and slower recoveries compared to Bitcoin. Risk of Capital Traps: Investing in altcoins that lack strong fundamentals during this period can lead to capital being ‘trapped’ in projects that may not recover or see significant gains even when Altcoin Season eventually arrives. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Seeing Bitcoin rally while your altcoin portfolio lags can induce FOMO, leading to impulsive decisions like selling altcoins at a loss to jump into Bitcoin, only to miss the eventual altcoin rebound. Opportunities: Strategic Accumulation: Bitcoin Season offers an excellent opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at potentially favorable prices before its next major leg up. Discounted Altcoins: Many fundamentally strong altcoins may become available at significant discounts. This allows savvy investors to build positions in high-potential projects at lower entry points, preparing for the next Altcoin Season. Portfolio Rebalancing: It’s a prime time to reassess and rebalance your portfolio, shedding weaker altcoin holdings and consolidating into stronger assets, whether it’s Bitcoin or select, high-conviction altcoins. Learning and Research: The slower pace for altcoins can be used to dive deep into research, understand new technologies, and identify emerging trends that will drive the next Altcoin Season. This educational period is invaluable. Risk Mitigation: By focusing on Bitcoin or stablecoins, investors can reduce their overall portfolio risk during uncertain periods, protecting capital until clearer market signals emerge. Ultimately, a Bitcoin-dominated market isn’t a signal to exit crypto but rather to adjust your strategy. It’s a period for calculated moves, patience, and diligent research, ensuring you are well-positioned for whatever the next market cycle brings. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Tides with Knowledge The Altcoin Season Index at 43 serves as a clear indicator: we are currently in a period where Bitcoin reigns supreme. This ‘Bitcoin Season’ is characterized by Bitcoin’s consistent outperformance of the vast majority of altcoins, driven by factors ranging from macroeconomic conditions to institutional interest. For investors, this isn’t a time for panic, but rather for strategic reflection and disciplined action. By understanding the nuances of the Altcoin Season Index, recognizing the drivers behind Bitcoin’s dominance, and implementing sound investment strategies like focused Bitcoin accumulation and selective altcoin scouting, you can navigate these market tides effectively. The crypto market is inherently cyclical, and while Bitcoin holds the spotlight now, the conditions for the next Altcoin Season will eventually emerge. Staying informed, managing risk, and conducting thorough research are your most powerful tools in building a resilient and profitable crypto portfolio, regardless of whether it’s Bitcoin Season or the much-anticipated Altcoin Season. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index (ASI)? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps determine if altcoins are collectively outperforming Bitcoin (Altcoin Season) or if Bitcoin is dominating (Bitcoin Season). Q2: How is Altcoin Season defined by the index? Altcoin Season is defined when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. The index score typically ranges from 75 to 100 during this period. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 43 mean? An Altcoin Season Index of 43 signifies that the market is currently in ‘Bitcoin Season’. This means that 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days, indicating Bitcoin’s strong dominance. Q4: What are the main reasons for a Bitcoin Season? Bitcoin Season often occurs due to factors like a ‘flight to safety’ during market uncertainty, macroeconomic headwinds, pre-halving accumulation, increased institutional adoption, and consolidation of market liquidity into Bitcoin. Q5: Should I sell all my altcoins during Bitcoin Season? Not necessarily. While many altcoins may underperform, it’s an opportune time for strategic accumulation of fundamentally strong altcoins at potentially lower prices. It’s also a good period to rebalance your portfolio and prioritize Bitcoin accumulation, but avoid impulsive decisions. Q6: What signals the return of Altcoin Season? The return of Altcoin Season is often signaled by Bitcoin price consolidation, increased overall market liquidity, the emergence of new and exciting crypto narratives (like DeFi or NFTs), and a sustained decrease in Bitcoin’s market dominance percentage.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has just exploded onto the top of 2025’s bull run watch lists, and the data is undeniable. XRP ETF: Big Milestone Incoming, But Timing Remains Unclear The SEC has already approved the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, a leveraged futures product offering 2x exposure to XRP’s daily price movements. That alone sent XRP soaring to nearly $3, with market confidence growing in every direction. However, spot ETF approval is still pending. Applications from Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, and WisdomTree are in review. Delays have been “procedural, not rejections,” according to SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. But there’s no official greenlight yet. XRP/USD Price Chart: Coingecko Market watchers agree: if the SEC formally drops its appeal in the Ripple case, we could see spot ETFs roll out by October 2025—bringing billions in fresh inflows and triggering a possible move toward $5–$7 for XRP. And while the XRP ETF narrative builds strength—especially with Bloomberg placing 75–95% odds on spot ETF approval by October—MAGACOIN is front-running the hype, capturing early-stage capital, community fire, and trader conviction at a speed few saw coming. MAGACOIN FINANCE: From Meme Coin to Market Meteor MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s redefining it.With a fixed supply, zero-tax trading model, and a no-VC token structure, it’s built to scale with the people, not institutions. And the community has responded in force. Here’s what’s happening right now: Whale inflows up 230% over the past 7 days 6245+ verified wallets now holding MAGACOIN FINANCE Trending presale on 500+ Crypto Twitter profiles CertiK + HashEx audits completed and verified Cross-wallet support for MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet fully integrated And the most telling sign? It’s now dominating “Top Rotation” lists in alpha groups, presale trackers, and DEX whisper chats. Influencers across the DeFi and meme coin space are hinting at deep-dive coverage, as MAGACOIN becomes the most-watched emerging asset in this cycle’s rotation. Narrative + Timing = Maximum Breakout Energy Unlike XRP, which still faces formal legal closure and ETF review stages, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already in motion. The setup is rare: a project aligned with cultural sentiment, backed by community ownership, and fueled by capital rotation from larger altcoins that have already moved. And here’s what makes the timing explosive: As traders and institutions wait for XRP’s ETF decision, they’re parking high-risk, high-reward capital in early-stage rockets like MAGACOIN—pushing it into price discovery before broader headlines even catch up. Conclusion The XRP ETF is a massive development—but it’s not the only story worth watching. As momentum accelerates, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seizing this window, building the kind of velocity and conviction that defined the best performers of past bull runs. With powerful tokenomics, real community scale, and institutional-grade infrastructure already online. MAGACOIN FINANCE is 2025’s breakout altcoin in the making.

Recently, a significant event captured the attention of on-chain analysts: a substantial ENA whale withdrawal from the major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. This move involved 13.4 million ENA tokens, valued at an impressive $7.26 million, and subsequently transferred to another wallet. What does such a colossal transfer signify, and why should it matter to you? Understanding the ENA Whale Withdrawal Event The crypto community thrives on transparency, especially when it comes to understanding market sentiment and potential future price movements. The recent ENA whale withdrawal , first highlighted by Onchain Lens on X, provides a fascinating case study. This anonymous entity, holding a significant portion of ENA, chose to move a considerable sum out of a centralized exchange environment. Such a decision by a large holder is rarely arbitrary; it often reflects a calculated strategy or a shift in their long-term outlook on the asset. Ethena (ENA) itself is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, offering a crypto-native solution for money that is not reliant on traditional banking infrastructure. Its unique approach to creating a stablecoin, USDe, through delta-hedging staked Ethereum, has garnered significant interest. Therefore, any major movement of ENA tokens by a whale can influence perceptions of the protocol’s stability and future trajectory. What Does a Binance Withdrawal Signify for ENA? In the realm of crypto market analysis, the distinction between deposits to exchanges and withdrawals from them is crucial. Generally: Deposits to Exchanges: These are often interpreted as an indication of intent to sell. When a large amount of an asset is moved to an exchange, it increases the available supply on the market, potentially leading to selling pressure and a downward price movement. Withdrawals from Exchanges: Conversely, withdrawals are frequently seen as a signal of a holding or accumulation strategy. When assets are moved off an exchange, it suggests the holder intends to keep them for the long term, perhaps for staking, participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or simply storing them in a private wallet for security. This reduces the immediate sell-side liquidity on exchanges, which can be a bullish signal. However, it’s vital to remember that these are general interpretations, not absolute rules. A withdrawal could also be for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, transferring to another exchange, or moving to a cold storage solution for enhanced security without any immediate selling intent. The anonymous nature of the whale in this ENA whale withdrawal adds another layer of intrigue, as their specific motivations remain private. The Anatomy of a Crypto Whale’s Strategy Crypto whales are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices. Their strategies can be complex and multi-faceted. When we observe an ENA whale withdrawal of this magnitude, several strategic possibilities come to mind: Long-Term Holding (HODLing): The most common interpretation. The whale might believe ENA’s value will appreciate significantly over time and prefers to secure their assets off-exchange, away from potential hacks or regulatory risks associated with centralized platforms. Staking or DeFi Participation: The ENA tokens might be moved to participate in Ethena’s own staking mechanisms or other DeFi protocols to earn yield, contributing to the network’s security or liquidity. Private Sale or OTC Deal: While less common for such a public withdrawal, large sums can be moved for private, off-exchange transactions that don’t directly impact the public order books. Security Enhancement: Moving funds to a hardware wallet or multi-signature cold storage is a common practice for large holders seeking maximum security against exchange vulnerabilities. Understanding these potential motivations is key to interpreting the broader market implications. The absence of immediate selling pressure on Binance following this large ENA whale withdrawal suggests a non-selling intent, at least in the short term. Impact on ENA Price and Market Dynamics While a single ENA whale withdrawal doesn’t guarantee a price surge, it can contribute to a positive market sentiment. By reducing the immediate supply available for sale on exchanges, it can alleviate selling pressure. If this withdrawal is indeed for long-term holding or staking, it signifies strong conviction from a major player, which can inspire confidence among other investors. However, it’s crucial for investors to conduct their own due diligence and not solely rely on whale movements. The crypto market is influenced by a myriad of factors, including: Overall market sentiment (Bitcoin’s performance often dictates the broader market) Macroeconomic conditions Regulatory developments Project-specific news and developments (e.g., Ethena protocol upgrades, partnerships) Liquidity and trading volume across various exchanges Therefore, while a large withdrawal is a noteworthy data point, it should be considered within a broader analytical framework. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, tracking whale movements, like this ENA whale withdrawal , can offer valuable insights, but it requires a balanced perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Utilize On-Chain Analytics: Tools like Onchain Lens, Whale Alert, and Nansen provide real-time data on large transactions. Familiarize yourself with how to interpret these movements. Look Beyond the Surface: Don’t jump to conclusions. A withdrawal might be bullish, but always consider alternative explanations. Is the asset being moved to another exchange? Is there a known staking program it could be entering? Combine Data Points: No single metric tells the whole story. Combine on-chain data with fundamental analysis (understanding the project’s technology, team, and roadmap) and technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators). Risk Management is Key: Even if a whale’s move seems bullish, never invest more than you can afford to lose. The crypto market remains volatile. Stay Informed: Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts. Be wary of sensationalism and always verify information. The actions of a single whale, while significant, are just one piece of a much larger and more complex puzzle in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Their moves can provide clues, but never guarantees. Conclusion: The Silent Signals of the Crypto Giants The recent ENA whale withdrawal from Binance serves as a powerful reminder of the hidden narratives playing out in the blockchain world. While the identity and precise motives of the whale remain anonymous, the on-chain data provides a compelling signal that a significant holder is opting for a non-selling strategy, at least for the time being. Such movements underscore the importance of on-chain analytics in deciphering market sentiment and potential trends. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, understanding the subtle yet impactful actions of its largest players becomes increasingly vital for navigating its opportunities and challenges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is ENA (Ethena)? ENA is the native token of Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. It aims to provide a stable, scalable, and censorship-resistant crypto-native solution for money, primarily through its stablecoin, USDe, which is backed by staked Ethereum and delta-hedged positions. What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their transactions are significant enough to potentially influence market prices due to their sheer volume. Why do whales withdraw assets from exchanges? Whales withdraw assets from exchanges for various reasons, most commonly to signal a long-term holding strategy (HODLing), to move funds to cold storage for enhanced security, to participate in staking or DeFi protocols to earn yield, or for private over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. How accurate are on-chain analytics for predicting market moves? On-chain analytics provide highly accurate data on transactions and wallet movements, offering valuable insights into market activity and sentiment. However, predicting future price movements based solely on these analytics can be challenging, as the market is influenced by numerous other factors, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory news, and project-specific developments. Should I base my investment decisions solely on whale movements? No, it is not advisable to base investment decisions solely on whale movements. While whale activity can provide interesting signals, it should be just one component of a comprehensive investment strategy that includes fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and sound risk management. Always conduct your own research before making investment decisions. Did you find this analysis of the ENA whale withdrawal insightful?

Three months ago, the markethad written ETH off as another casualty of a bruising correction; today it has more than doubled, tacking on roughly 43% in the past thirty days. Ethereum price performance from CoinGecko With analysts again floating a $5k price target, Ethereum’s comeback story is compelling—but it may not be 2025’s most explosive play. A fledgling meme-powered altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) has already drawn millions in presale commitments and whispers of a 10,000% upside. So, which asset offers the bigger payoff in the year ahead? MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum signals a potential 10,000% ROI MAGACOIN FINANCE has the classic asymmetry of limited downside versus parabolic potential. With a capped 170 billion supply, no VC allocation, top-of-class security, and narrative-driven hype, the token has all the fundamentals. On-chain trackers have already flagged six-figure inflows from wallets that once seeded Dogecoin and PEPE breakouts, “smart money” moving before the public listing window even opens. Presale dashboards show more than $11 million raised across 6000 unique wallets, a pace that mirrors Shiba Inu’s earliest adoption curve. Because each funding round raises the implied DEX listing price, every new tier compresses the distance to that 10,000% target. Corporate ETH treasuries are quietly powering the march toward $5k In the background of retail excitement, publicly listed firms are adding ETH to their balance sheets at a clip last seen during early Bitcoin’s corporate adoption wave in 2021. Gaming firm Sharplink has accumulated over 260,000 ETH, while Bitmine Immersion Tech and other companies collectively hold over $1.65 billion. This sends a signal to risk-aware CFOs that Ethereum now carries blue-chip credibility. That steady treasury bid, layered atop ETF inflows, is the fundamental “plank” beneath bullish $5,000 forecasts. Spot ETFs—and the looming green light for staking—turbocharge ETH demand Ether ETFs have soaked up a record $3 billion since July 4, with a single-day haul of $727 million smashing prior highs. The next catalyst is already teed up; the SEC is widely expected to approve staking for those ETFs by year-end. This will allow institutions to earn yield. The prospect of “passive” ETH staking inside a regulated wrapper could widen the funnel of traditional capital just as supply growth slides toward zero after the Merge. ETH vs. MAGA: different vehicles, same moon-shot mindset ETH’s path is paved by institutional validation, improving network economics, and incremental price discovery; MAGA’s is fueled by virality, meme culture, and a scarcity curve that forces scarcity each presale round. While ETH is a blue-chip protocol aiming to be the world’s settlement layer, MAGA is a politically charged community token engineered to ride social narratives. Blend them in a forward-looking portfolio and get ballast plus torque—steady appreciation from ETH and lotto-ticket upside from MAGA. Why MAGA still might steal the show Ethereum’s resurgence feels inevitable, but the blue-chip token is no longer in the early days, when it could multiply by triple digits. MAGACOIN FINANCE lives on the opposite end of that spectrum—high risk, hyper-charged reward, and a ticking clock as supply thins. History favors investors who act early rather than perfectly. ETH may yet print $5k, but MAGA’s presale clocks are already spinning down. The window is open; the only question is who steps through before the crowd does.

Just moments ago, the company received a staggering $140 million worth of USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle, directly from Circle’s own wallet. This substantial transfer, flagged by on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, has ignited widespread discussion about its potential implications, particularly regarding large-scale Ethereum purchases . Could SharpLink Gaming be gearing up to significantly expand its already considerable Ethereum holdings? What Does SharpLink Gaming’s $140 Million USDC Influx Mean for Potential Ethereum Purchases ? The sudden influx of $140 million in USDC into SharpLink Gaming’s coffers is a development that demands attention. According to initial reports, these funds were reportedly raised through recent stock sales. This detail is crucial, as it indicates a strategic decision by the company to convert traditional equity into digital assets, specifically stablecoins, which often serve as a bridge to other cryptocurrencies. Here’s why this is significant: On-Chain Transparency: The beauty of blockchain technology is its transparency. The transaction, from Circle’s wallet to SharpLink Gaming, is verifiable on the blockchain, lending credibility to the reports. Strategic Capital Allocation: Raising capital through stock sales and then moving it into a stablecoin like USDC suggests a deliberate strategy. Companies often hold stablecoins as a temporary measure before deploying them into volatile assets, or to facilitate large, timely transactions without immediate exposure to market fluctuations. Historical Precedent: SharpLink Gaming is no stranger to the Ethereum ecosystem. The company currently holds approximately 360,000 ETH, valued at about $1.34 billion at current prices. This existing large holding makes the idea of further Ethereum purchases not just speculative, but a logical extension of their current treasury strategy. This move positions SharpLink Gaming as a significant player to watch in the institutional crypto space. The question isn’t just if they will make Ethereum purchases , but when and how large these might be. Why Are Companies Making Strategic Ethereum Purchases in Today’s Market? The trend of corporations adding cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum, to their balance sheets is gaining momentum. While Bitcoin often grabs headlines for institutional adoption, Ethereum’s unique utility and ecosystem are making it an increasingly attractive asset for forward-thinking companies. Several factors contribute to this growing interest: 1. Diversification and Growth Potential: Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin is seen as ‘digital gold,’ Ethereum powers the vast decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors. Its ecosystem offers diverse growth opportunities. Technological Innovation: Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades, particularly the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Consensus Layer and Execution Layer), promise enhanced scalability, security, and sustainability, making it a more robust long-term investment. 2. Utility and Ecosystem Exposure: DeFi and NFTs: Companies holding ETH gain exposure to the burgeoning DeFi market, which offers lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries. Similarly, the NFT market, primarily built on Ethereum, represents a new frontier for digital ownership and monetization. Web3 Infrastructure: Ethereum is a foundational layer for Web3, the next iteration of the internet. Investing in ETH is akin to investing in the underlying infrastructure of a new digital economy. 3. Inflation Hedge and Store of Value: Scarcity and Deflationary Tendencies: With the implementation of EIP-1559 and the Merge, Ethereum has exhibited deflationary periods, where more ETH is burned than created, potentially increasing its scarcity and value over time. Alternative Asset Class: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum offer an alternative store of value, providing a hedge against traditional inflation. 4. Market Sentiment and Institutional Validation: Growing Acceptance: The increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by mainstream financial institutions, coupled with regulatory clarity in some regions, makes it less risky for corporations to hold digital assets. Follow the Leaders: When companies like SharpLink Gaming, or even larger entities, publicly engage in significant crypto holdings, it can signal confidence and encourage others to explore similar strategies. However, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. Companies undertaking such strategies must have a robust risk management framework in place. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market and Future Ethereum Purchases ? A substantial move like SharpLink Gaming’s $140 million USDC receipt and the subsequent speculation about Ethereum purchases can send ripples across the entire crypto market. Here’s how: Increased Demand for ETH: If SharpLink Gaming does proceed with significant ETH buys, it would directly contribute to increased demand for Ethereum, potentially influencing its price upwards. This is especially true for large, concentrated purchases that can absorb significant market liquidity. Market Sentiment Boost: Institutional involvement is a strong bullish signal. When publicly traded companies allocate significant capital to cryptocurrencies, it can boost investor confidence and attract more retail and institutional money into the market. It validates crypto as a legitimate asset class. On-Chain Analysis Validation: This event underscores the power of on-chain analysis. Tools and analysts like @EmberCN provide invaluable real-time insights into market movements, allowing investors to track large fund flows and anticipate potential shifts. This transparency is a core tenet of the decentralized economy. Precedent for Other Companies: Success stories of companies holding crypto on their balance sheets could encourage other corporations, particularly those in tech, gaming, or digital marketing sectors, to consider similar strategies. This could lead to a broader trend of institutional Ethereum purchases . The current market environment, characterized by evolving regulatory discussions and increasing mainstream adoption, makes such corporate treasury management decisions even more impactful. SharpLink Gaming’s actions could serve as a case study for how companies are adapting to the digital asset landscape. SharpLink Gaming’s Existing ETH Stash: A Foundation for More Ethereum Purchases ? It’s worth reiterating SharpLink Gaming’s current impressive holdings: approximately 360,000 ETH. At the time of the original report, this was valued at about $1.34 billion. This makes them a significant holder in the Ethereum ecosystem. This existing position suggests that their leadership is already comfortable with Ethereum as a strategic asset. The potential for an additional $140 million in Ethereum purchases would further solidify their commitment and potentially elevate their status as one of the largest corporate holders of ETH. This could also mean they are preparing for future developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as staking opportunities or leveraging DeFi protocols with their existing holdings. The move by SharpLink Gaming highlights a broader trend where companies are not just dabbling in crypto but are integrating it into their core financial strategies. This evolution signifies a maturation of the digital asset market, moving beyond speculative retail trading to strategic corporate treasury management. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Crypto Strategy SharpLink Gaming’s receipt of $140 million in USDC, reportedly from stock sales, and the subsequent speculation about significant Ethereum purchases , represents a pivotal moment. It underscores the growing confidence among some corporations in the long-term value and utility of digital assets, particularly Ethereum. This event serves as a powerful reminder of the transparency and insights offered by on-chain analysis, allowing the market to observe and react to large institutional movements in real-time. As the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world continue to blur, we can expect more such strategic allocations by companies looking to diversify their assets, hedge against inflation, and capitalize on the immense growth potential of the decentralized economy. Whether SharpLink Gaming uses all, some, or none of this USDC for immediate ETH buys, the very act of this large transfer and its source signals a deliberate and bold step into the digital asset realm. It’s a testament to the evolving landscape where cryptocurrencies are increasingly viewed not just as speculative investments, but as integral components of a forward-thinking corporate financial strategy. The crypto community will undoubtedly be watching closely for SharpLink’s next move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC and why would SharpLink Gaming receive it? USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, meaning 1 USDC is intended to always be redeemable for $1 USD. Companies like SharpLink Gaming might receive USDC because it offers the stability of fiat currency while retaining the benefits of blockchain transactions, such as speed, lower fees for large transfers, and global accessibility. It’s often used as a bridge between traditional finance and volatile cryptocurrencies, or as a temporary holding asset. Q2: How does SharpLink Gaming’s existing Ethereum holding compare to other companies? While exact rankings fluctuate, SharpLink Gaming’s reported holding of approximately 360,000 ETH (valued at around $1.34 billion) makes it one of the most significant corporate holders of Ethereum. While some larger tech companies might have indirect exposure through venture arms, few publicly traded companies hold such a substantial direct stake in ETH on their balance sheets. Q3: What are the risks associated with a company making large Ethereum purchases? Key risks include price volatility, as the value of ETH can fluctuate significantly; regulatory uncertainty, as governments worldwide are still developing clear guidelines for cryptocurrencies; and security risks, such as potential hacks or loss of private keys. Companies must have robust risk management, security protocols, and a clear understanding of the market before making substantial Ethereum purchases . Q4: How can on-chain analysis like @EmberCN’s help in understanding market movements? On-chain analysis involves examining data directly from a blockchain, such as transaction volumes, wallet addresses, and token movements. Analysts like @EmberCN track large transfers, whale movements, and exchange flows to identify potential market trends, institutional activity, and shifts in supply and demand, providing a transparent view of the underlying market dynamics that are not available in traditional financial markets. Q5: Will this lead to more companies making significant Ethereum purchases? SharpLink Gaming’s move could certainly act as a catalyst. As more companies witness the successful integration of digital assets into corporate treasuries and understand the strategic benefits of assets like Ethereum (e.g., exposure to DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 infrastructure), it could encourage others to explore similar strategies, potentially leading to a broader trend of institutional Ethereum purchases . Q6: What is the significance of the funds coming from ‘stock sales’? Funds originating from ‘stock sales’ mean SharpLink Gaming converted a portion of its equity into cash, which was then moved into USDC. This signifies a deliberate financial decision by the company’s management to reallocate capital from traditional stock assets into the digital asset space, highlighting a strategic shift in their treasury management approach.

One such event recently unfolded, spotlighting a newly established wallet that has rapidly ascended to the ranks of an Ethereum whale . This significant development, involving the accumulation of hundreds of millions of dollars in Ether (ETH), prompts crucial questions about market movements, institutional strategies, and the future trajectory of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Who is This Mysterious Ethereum Whale? On-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens recently brought to light a fascinating development: a newly created wallet received an additional 13,696 Ether (ETH), worth approximately $49.97 million, from Galaxy Digital. This substantial transfer was not an isolated incident. In fact, it contributed to the wallet’s staggering total holdings of 100,972 ETH, now valued at roughly $380 million. Such a colossal sum immediately classifies this address as a major player, or an Ethereum whale , in the crypto ecosystem. An Ethereum whale is generally defined as an individual or entity holding a very large amount of ETH, enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. Their movements are closely watched because large buys can signal strong confidence, while large sells can trigger price drops. This particular wallet’s rapid accumulation suggests a strategic, long-term play rather than speculative day trading. Tracking these wallets is made possible through on-chain analytics platforms like Onchain Lens, which meticulously monitor public blockchain data. While the identity behind the wallet remains anonymous, the source of the funds – Galaxy Digital – provides a significant clue regarding the nature of this accumulation. Understanding the Significance of Large ETH Whale Movements Why does the movement of an Ethereum whale matter so much? The cryptocurrency market, while decentralized, is still heavily influenced by supply and demand dynamics. When a single entity controls a substantial portion of an asset, their actions can send ripples throughout the market. Here are a few reasons why these large accumulations are noteworthy: Market Sentiment: A massive accumulation by a new wallet can be interpreted as a bullish signal. It suggests that a large investor, potentially an institution, sees significant upside potential in ETH, which can inspire confidence among smaller investors. Liquidity Impact: When a whale accumulates, they are essentially removing a large amount of ETH from the circulating supply, which can reduce liquidity on exchanges. If sustained, this could lead to price appreciation if demand remains constant or increases. Future Price Action: While not a guarantee, historical data often shows that periods of significant whale accumulation precede upward price movements. These entities typically have access to deep market research and strategic insights. Institutional Interest: The involvement of a major player like Galaxy Digital often points to increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, lending more legitimacy and stability to the market. Consider the past. There have been numerous instances where large Bitcoin or Ethereum accumulations by anonymous wallets or known institutions have coincided with major market rallies. While correlation doesn’t always imply causation, the patterns are too frequent to ignore. Analyzing the Source: Galaxy Digital’s Role The fact that a significant portion of this ETH came from Galaxy Digital is a crucial detail. Galaxy Digital is a leading diversified financial services and investment management company dedicated to the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. Founded by Michael Novogratz, it’s a prominent player in the institutional crypto space, offering services ranging from asset management to trading and investment banking. When an institution of Galaxy Digital’s caliber facilitates such a large transfer, it typically implies one of two things: Client Custody: Galaxy Digital might be acting as a custodian for a high-net-worth individual or another institution. In this scenario, the newly created wallet could belong to one of their clients who is strategically building a substantial ETH position. This highlights growing institutional demand for direct crypto exposure. Internal Strategy: Less likely, but still possible, is that this accumulation is part of Galaxy Digital’s own balance sheet strategy or a new fund they are launching. However, given the ‘new wallet’ status, client custody seems more probable. The involvement of such a reputable entity adds a layer of professionalism and strategic intent to this Ethereum whale activity, distinguishing it from purely speculative individual actions. Potential Scenarios and Market Implications for Ethereum (ETH) The emergence of this new Ethereum whale could lead to several intriguing market scenarios. While predicting the future is impossible, we can consider potential outcomes based on historical patterns and current market dynamics: Bullish Scenarios: Sustained Accumulation: If this wallet continues to accumulate, it would further reduce the available supply of ETH on exchanges, potentially driving up its price. Long-Term Hold (HODL): If the whale intends to hold these assets for the long term, it signals strong confidence in Ethereum’s fundamental value and its future as a decentralized computing platform. Catalyst for Rally: Such a significant institutional-backed accumulation could act as a catalyst, encouraging other large investors to enter or increase their ETH positions, leading to a broader market rally. Bearish Considerations (Less Likely in this Context, but Important to Note): Future Selling Pressure: While currently accumulating, a large wallet always carries the potential for future selling pressure if the holder decides to offload their assets. However, given the nature of institutional accumulation, this is usually a long-term strategy, not short-term speculation. Market Volatility: Any significant transaction by a whale, whether buying or selling, can introduce short-term volatility. Traders need to be aware of this potential. The broader implications tie into Ethereum’s ongoing evolution, particularly with its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and future scalability improvements. A large Ethereum whale holding such a substantial amount of ETH also potentially gains significant influence in network governance if they participate in staking or voting. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For individuals interested in the crypto market, observing the movements of an Ethereum whale like this new address can offer valuable insights. Here are some actionable takeaways: Stay Informed with On-Chain Analytics: Tools like Onchain Lens provide transparency into blockchain activities. Regularly checking these platforms can help you spot trends before they become widely known. Understand Institutional Flows: Pay attention to news and reports concerning institutional involvement in crypto. Their participation often validates the asset class and can signal long-term growth. Develop a Long-Term Perspective: Large accumulations often indicate a long-term bullish outlook from sophisticated investors. Consider whether your own investment strategy aligns with such a perspective. Manage Risk: While whale movements can be indicative, they are not infallible predictors. Always conduct your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification remains a key strategy. This event underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market, where sophisticated players are making calculated, large-scale investments based on fundamental analysis and strategic foresight. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum? The emergence of this formidable new Ethereum whale , backed by significant transfers from Galaxy Digital, marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing narrative of institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency space. With holdings now exceeding $380 million, this wallet represents not just a massive accumulation of Ether but also a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s enduring value proposition and its future potential. While the identity of this whale remains shrouded in anonymity, their actions speak volumes. They signal a deepening institutional interest, a potential for reduced market liquidity, and a reinforcement of bullish sentiment for ETH. As the crypto market continues to evolve, keeping a keen eye on such significant on-chain movements will remain crucial for understanding underlying trends and anticipating future market dynamics. This monumental accumulation is a powerful reminder that big players are increasingly recognizing and acting upon the long-term value embedded in the Ethereum ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ether (ETH). While there’s no precise threshold, holdings typically in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of ETH are considered whale-level, giving them significant potential influence over market prices through their buy or sell orders. Q2: How do analysts track these large ETH whale movements? Analysts use on-chain analytics platforms (like Onchain Lens, Etherscan, Whale Alert, etc.) that monitor public blockchain data. Since all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are transparent, these platforms can track large transfers to and from specific wallet addresses, providing insights into accumulation, distribution, and overall market sentiment. Q3: Does a whale accumulation always mean the price of ETH will go up? Not always, but it’s often considered a bullish indicator. Large accumulations suggest strong confidence from a major investor, which can positively influence market sentiment and potentially reduce circulating supply. However, market prices are influenced by many factors, and a whale could eventually sell, causing price drops. Q4: What is Galaxy Digital’s role in this ETH transfer? Galaxy Digital is a prominent institutional player in the crypto space. In this context, they likely acted as an intermediary or custodian, facilitating the transfer of ETH to a client’s newly created wallet. This highlights increasing institutional engagement and the professionalization of crypto asset management. Q5: Should I invest in ETH because of this whale activity? While whale activity can be a strong signal, it should not be the sole basis for your investment decisions. Always conduct thorough research, understand the fundamentals of Ethereum, assess your own risk tolerance, and consider diversifying your portfolio. Consult with a financial advisor if needed.

Trump’s Crypto Bill: A Historic Turning Point for Retail Crypto Use This isn’t just another bill—it’s a historic win for crypto utility in America. President Trump’s proposed $600 exemption will allow digital asset payments under that threshold to bypass the usual capital gains tax burden that’s held crypto back from mainstream retail use. The Landmark GENIUS Act, the exemption removes one of the biggest frictions in crypto adoption: capital gains reporting for everyday purchases. That means coffee, groceries, or donations under $600 won’t trigger a tax event—and that changes everything for payment-ready meme coins like MAGACOIN. While a competing $300 version of the bill (backed by Senator Cynthia Lummis) remains on the table, the White House has made it clear: the $600 threshold has its full support. Industry leaders are backing the move, and lawmakers are preparing to fast-track this provision as part of a sweeping legislative package—one that includes the GENIUS Act and other pro-crypto frameworks. Trump’s stance has already triggered a narrative shift. Crypto payments are no longer a tax nightmare—they’re on the verge of becoming frictionless. And that opens the floodgates for tokens built with utility and mass appeal in mind. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Movement With a Real Setup MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rewriting what a meme coin can be in 2025. With a 170B hard cap, no VCs, zero-tax design, and a message rooted in political decentralization, MAGACOIN isn’t trying to be the next DOGE it’s building the new standard. Every metric signals lift-off: Whale inflows are up 200% week-over-week On-chain volume has broken prior ATHs across multiple DEX trackers Telegram groups mentioning MAGACOIN FINANCE have grown 3x in July, now crossing 40K+ active mentions Cross-wallet integration with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet is already live But what’s supercharging MAGACOIN’s appeal now is political tailwind. How Trump’s Crypto Exemption Supercharges MAGACOIN Utility With microtransactions under $600 soon to be tax-free, MAGACOIN becomes a functional, frictionless payment token in the U.S. economy. Whether it’s coffee, e-commerce, or campaign donations, MAGACOIN now fits directly into the mainstream crypto payments narrative —without triggering capital gains tax. It’s a rare setup: a meme coin with both regulatory momentum and real-world utility , backed by cultural identity and grassroots virality. That’s why MAGACOIN is rapidly outpacing competitors on every front— narrative, traction, and timing . Conclusion Trump’s tax exemption is a game-changer—but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one coin that was built for this exact moment. With momentum accelerating across every key metric, and a cultural narrative that fuses memes with monetary reform, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t following the bull run—it’s leading it.

Operationally, CleanSpark has boosted its hash rate above 50 EH/s and shifted to a 'produce and sell' Bitcoin strategy, enhancing liquidity and decoupling somewhat from Bitcoin price swings. Rising energy costs and lack of transparency on mining costs present risks, but higher Bitcoin prices currently offset these pressures, supporting strong margins. Despite inherent volatility and risks, CleanSpark trades at an attractive valuation, remains profitable across various Bitcoin price scenarios, and I maintain a buy rating. Amid a sky-high stock market, I continue to believe that investors have to rotate more and more of our portfolios to lesser-known names in order to beat the major indices. For me, that means increasing my exposure to small-caps. CleanSpark ( CLSK ), in my view, is an excellent company that gives exposure to both an undervalued small-cap name plus rising Bitcoin prices. One of the most prominent Bitcoin miners in the U.S., half of CleanSpark's value alone sits in its current Bitcoin treasury, while the company continues to add to its hash rate to increase Bitcoin production. Year to date, shares of CleanSpark have jumped ~25% - roughly mirroring the rise in Bitcoin. And yet, in my view the stock still remains quite undervalued. Data by YCharts I last wrote a buy opinion on CleanSpark in April, when the stock was trading near $9 per share. Since then, CleanSpark has boosted its operational throughput while also adopting a strategy of selling more Bitcoin, to take advantage of higher prices and to ensure more consistent liquidity flow. I remain at a buy rating here, though I'm cognizant of several new risks that have emerged. Hash rate boost, increased selling Let's now start with the positive news that CleanSpark has to report. As a reminder for investors who are newer to this name, the company reports the results of its Bitcoin mining operations every month. In July, the company reported mining results for the month of June, in which CleanSpark crossed a significant threshold: exceeding a hash rate of 50 EH/s for the first time, which was its stated goal for the mid year. Meanwhile, during the month of June, the company produced 685 Bitcoin - on an annualized basis, this would equate to ~8,200 bitcoins produced annually. CleanSpark June mining results (CleanSpark July press release) But perhaps the most significant operational strategy change for CleanSpark is the fact that the company is now actively looking to sell more Bitcoin, rather than holding the majority of its production for investment. This is a fantastic way for CleanSpark to benefit from Bitcoin's meteoric rise this year (at the time of writing, up 25% to ~$118k since the start of January). The company initiated what it calls a ""Digital Asset Management"" strategy, owned by the company's treasury team. The goal is to be able to drive spot sales of Bitcoin with ""derivative overlay"" in order to take advantage of rising prices. In June, the company sold 578.5 Bitcoin, or 84% of what it produced. I view the pivot to a ""produce and sell"" strategy as a positive that should help decouple CleanSpark's value from the price of Bitcoin itself. Today, the company's Bitcoin treasury represents roughly half of its market cap value - to me, bringing down that treasury unlocks the possibility of buying back shares of reinvesting into additional production capacity. Rising energy costs and less transparency This being said, we do have to be aware of one risk: CleanSpark didn't report its usual customary ""cost per Bitcoin mined"" in its most recent quarter, only citing that mining costs have increased due to rising energy prices. The company most recently reported $34,000 per coin mined in Q1 (the December quarter), and $36,250 in Q4 (September). We had been hopeful for a falling cost trajectory, but now we know only that Q2's (March quarter) mining cost was above what it had been in Q1. Per CEO Zach Bradford's remarks on the Q2 earnings call in May on mining costs and mining difficulty: Average revenue per Bitcoin was up 10.5% quarter over quarter and nearly 69% year over year, while our marginal cost per coin rose, reflecting both increased network difficulty and higher nationwide power prices. We remained focused on margin and long-term performance rather than any single metric. I want to be clear on what that means. That means we do not manage the power prices, and when margins are healthy, we run through slightly elevated power prices, as long as this drives more value to the bottom line. As a result, the average power price printed higher while delivering increased gross profit [...] Mining difficulty rose 3.6% during the quarter, while power costs increased. Yet, thanks to improved fleet efficiency, our gross margin compression nearly matched the difficulty change, demonstrating our ability to absorb external pressures through operational gains. Our approach has never been about chasing the lowest cost per kilowatt hour. Instead, we managed to margin, making deliberate decisions, including running through higher price periods when doing so generates positive cash flow."" Still, at least for now, we take comfort in the fact that the rise in Bitcoin price should dramatically outweigh the rise in energy prices. If, taken together, increased mining difficulty plus higher electricity cost yields a ~10% sequential jump in cost per coin (from ~$34k in Q4 to ~$37k today), that gap is still more than covered by Bitcoin's rise from ~$100k in May to $118k today. We note one additional risk: in spite of the company's boost in hash rate to 50 EH/s, CleanSpark's monthly coin production has actually not increased (thanks to rising mining difficulty, which will always be the case and is at the heart of Bitcoin's scarcity). The 685 coins that the company produced in June was -1% lower than 694 coins produced in May (but higher than 633 in April). Valuation scenarios Now, we turn to a perennially difficult question to answer about CleanSpark: how do we value this company? It's an exercise that can be done, but one that rests on a number of critical assumptions. These are the key levers of my pro forma P&L: Mining throughput: 8,220 Bitcoin per year (based on current 685 monthly production, annualized) Cost per coin: $40,000 (a conservative figure based on management's directional commentary on rising difficulty and energy costs, relative to $34,000 most recently reported in Q1) Gross margin per coin: $75,000 or ~65% (based on $115k selling price and $40k cost per coin), or $616 million in gross profit dollars per year Opex: $136 million (based on 15% y/y growth versus $118.1 million in costs of payroll, G&A, and professional fees in FY24. The growth rate in opex is roughly in-line with the company's growth in hash rate). This would give us a rough adjusted EBITDA of $480 million ($616 million in gross profit dollars, less $136 million in opex excluding depreciation and amortization as above). Of course, a lot here is truly beyond CleanSpark's control, including and especially Bitcoin prices, but also energy prices and mining difficulty. It's prudent for us to stress-test the company's profitability based on a range of different Bitcoin price outcomes. Holding mining cost constant at $40k/coin: At BTC of $100,000, gross profit per coin falls to $60k, gross profit per year falls to $493 million, and adjusted EBITDA falls to $357 million (-26% less than my ""base case"" using current BTC prices). At BTC of $80,000 (roughly where BTC dipped when the market dropped in April), gross profit per coin falls to $40k, gross profit per year falls to $329 million, and adjusted EBITDA falls to $193 million. Needless to say, we think CleanSpark can remain quite profitable against a wide range of Bitcoin price outcomes, and its valuation still remains modest. At current share prices near $12, the stock trades at a $3.82 billion market cap. After we net off the 12,608 of BTC holdings in its latest June report (worth $1.49 billion at current market values), alongside $97 million of cash and $647 million of debt on the company's latest Q2 balance sheet, the company's rough resulting enterprise value is $1.78 billion. Against a ""doomsday"" scenario of ~$80k BTC prices, the stock still trades at only ~9x adjusted EBITDA, whereas in the ""base case"" scenario at current BTC prices of $118k, the company trades at Risks and key takeaways We'll emphasize here that CleanSpark is, of course, a very risky investment. The greatest driver of its profitability is Bitcoin prices - something that has proven very volatile and is completely outside of CleanSpark's control. We're also watchful of the fact that CleanSpark's rising hash rate has not really translated into a meaningful jump in monthly coin production, and we're also looking for more transparency on what rising energy prices means from a mining cost perspective. That being said, in spite of the uncertainty, I think CleanSpark remains quite substantially undervalued, thanks to its Bitcoin treasury and the sharp recent jump in Bitcoin prices.

An anonymous Ethereum whale , or perhaps two addresses controlled by the same mysterious entity, has executed a massive sell-off, offloading 3,810 ETH valued at a staggering $13.92 million. This dramatic transaction, which occurred over a mere 10 hours, has left many in the crypto community buzzing, especially given the estimated profit of $2.69 million reaped by the seller. This event, brought to light by astute on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, underscores the profound influence that large holders can exert on the volatile digital asset landscape. The Enigma of the Ethereum Whale : A Sudden $13.92 Million Sell-Off When we talk about a ‘whale’ in the crypto world, we are referring to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price. In this instance, the Ethereum whale in question made a strategic move that saw 3,810 ETH change hands. This wasn’t just a casual transaction; it was a calculated liquidation that netted an impressive $2.69 million in profit, indicating a shrewd understanding of market timing. The swiftness of the sale – completed within a 10-hour window – suggests a decisive action, possibly in response to market conditions or a pre-determined profit-taking strategy. On-chain analysts like @ai_9684xtpa play a crucial role in bringing such activities to public attention, leveraging the transparency of blockchain technology to track and interpret these large-scale movements. Their insights provide invaluable context for understanding market dynamics that might otherwise remain opaque. Why Do Ethereum Whales Make Such Moves? The motivations behind a massive sell-off by an Ethereum whale can be multifaceted, ranging from simple profit-taking to more complex strategic maneuvers. Understanding these drivers is key to interpreting their potential impact on the market. Profit Realization: The most straightforward reason. After accumulating ETH at lower prices, a whale might decide to cash out a portion of their holdings to lock in significant gains, especially during periods of market strength or perceived peak. Portfolio Rebalancing: A whale might shift capital from one asset to another. Selling ETH could mean they are preparing to invest in other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or even traditional assets, diversifying their portfolio. Market Sentiment and Outlook: Some whales are highly attuned to market sentiment. A large sale could signal a belief that ETH’s price is due for a correction, or that broader market conditions are becoming unfavorable. Conversely, it could be a reaction to specific news or regulatory developments. Operational Needs: In some cases, large entities might sell crypto to cover operational costs, fund new ventures, or meet other financial obligations outside the crypto ecosystem. Regardless of the specific reason, such large transactions often create ripples, influencing investor psychology and potentially triggering further buying or selling pressure from smaller holders. Decoding the Market Impact of an Ethereum Whale Sale When an Ethereum whale makes a move of this magnitude, the immediate question on everyone’s mind is: what will be the market impact? While a single large transaction doesn’t necessarily dictate the market’s long-term trajectory, it can certainly create short-term volatility and shift sentiment. Here’s how such a sale can influence the market: Price Volatility: A sudden influx of sell orders, especially for a significant amount like $13.92 million, can temporarily increase supply on exchanges, potentially leading to a price dip for ETH. Market makers might struggle to absorb such a large order without a price adjustment. Liquidity Testing: Large sales test the market’s liquidity. If there isn’t enough buying demand to match the sell pressure, the price drop can be more pronounced. Psychological Effect: News of a whale selling can trigger ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) on the downside, leading other investors to panic sell, exacerbating the price decline. Conversely, it can also be seen as an opportunity by savvy investors to ‘buy the dip.’ Table: Potential Market Reactions to a Large ETH Sale Timeframe Potential Impact Investor Sentiment Short-term (Hours to Days) Increased price volatility, potential temporary price dip, liquidity fluctuations. Uncertainty, fear, or opportunistic buying. Medium-term (Days to Weeks) Market re-stabilization, price recovery if fundamentals are strong, or continued downtrend if other factors align. Cautious optimism or sustained concern. The Power of On-Chain Analytics: Tracking the Ethereum Whale The ability to identify and analyze the movements of an Ethereum whale like this is thanks to the transparency inherent in blockchain technology and the sophistication of on-chain analytics. These tools and expert analysts sift through vast amounts of publicly available data to paint a clear picture of what’s happening on the network. How do they do it? Public Ledger: Every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is recorded and publicly accessible. While wallet addresses are pseudonymous, patterns of activity, transaction sizes, and connections between addresses can reveal insights into ownership and intent. Data Aggregation: On-chain analysis platforms aggregate and process this raw data, making it digestible. They can track inflows and outflows from exchanges, identify large transfers between wallets, and even estimate profits or losses based on acquisition prices. Pattern Recognition: Analysts look for unusual patterns, such as multiple large transactions originating from or going to the same cluster of addresses, suggesting a single entity’s control. This is how the two whale addresses in this recent event were believed to be controlled by the same entity. For retail investors, following reputable on-chain analysts can provide an early warning system for significant market shifts and help them make more informed decisions, rather than relying solely on price charts or news headlines. Navigating the Waves: What Should Investors Consider After an Ethereum Whale Sells? The actions of an Ethereum whale can be unsettling, but they don’t have to lead to panic. For everyday investors, understanding how to react to such events is crucial for long-term success in the crypto market. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t make impulsive decisions based solely on a whale’s move. Investigate the broader market context, Ethereum’s fundamentals, upcoming upgrades, and overall adoption trends. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Short-term price fluctuations due to large sales are common. If you believe in Ethereum’s long-term potential, temporary dips can be viewed as opportunities rather than threats. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consistently invest a fixed amount over time. This strategy helps mitigate the risk of buying at a peak and can be particularly effective during periods of volatility. Risk Management is Key: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and diversify your portfolio to avoid overexposure to a single asset. Avoid Emotional Trading: The crypto market thrives on emotions like fear and greed. Large whale movements often trigger these responses. Stick to your investment plan and avoid making decisions based on sudden surges of emotion. Remember, while whales can create waves, the underlying currents of the crypto market are driven by technology, adoption, and broader economic forces. Historical Precedents: Echoes of Past Ethereum Whale Activities The recent $13.92 million ETH sell-off by an Ethereum whale is not an isolated incident. Throughout the history of cryptocurrencies, large holders have made significant moves that have captured headlines and, at times, influenced market direction. Looking back at similar events can offer valuable perspective. For instance, there have been numerous occasions where large amounts of ETH were moved from dormant wallets after years, or significant amounts were deposited onto exchanges, signaling potential sales. Sometimes these moves led to temporary price corrections, while at other times, the market absorbed the selling pressure with minimal impact, especially during strong bull runs. Conversely, periods of significant whale accumulation often precede upward price movements, as large buyers absorb supply. The key takeaway from these historical patterns is that while individual whale actions can cause short-term ripples, the overall resilience and direction of a mature asset like Ethereum are more often dictated by its fundamental utility, development progress, and wider market adoption rather than the singular actions of one or two large holders. The Road Ahead for ETH: Beyond the Ethereum Whale’s Shadow While the $13.92 million sell-off by an Ethereum whale is a notable event, it’s important to view it within the broader context of Ethereum’s ecosystem and future trajectory. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps). Its ongoing development, including scalability solutions and upcoming upgrades, continues to strengthen its fundamental value proposition. The long-term outlook for ETH is shaped by factors far beyond the individual actions of even the largest holders. These include: Network Upgrades: Continuous improvements to the Ethereum network, such as the Dencun upgrade and future developments aimed at increasing transaction speed and reducing costs. Institutional Adoption: Growing interest and investment from institutional players, which brings significant capital and legitimacy to the ecosystem. DeFi and NFT Growth: The sustained expansion and innovation within the DeFi and NFT sectors, which heavily rely on Ethereum. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving regulations globally, which can either foster or hinder crypto growth. Ultimately, while a whale’s splash can create temporary waves, the ocean of Ethereum’s potential is vast and driven by powerful underlying currents of innovation and adoption. Conclusion The recent anonymous Ethereum whale sell-off of $13.92 million worth of ETH serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and sometimes volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such large transactions can spark immediate reactions and speculation, they are a natural part of a maturing market where significant profits are realized. Thanks to the transparency of on-chain analytics, we gain valuable insights into these powerful movements, allowing us to better understand the forces at play. For investors, the key takeaway is not to panic, but to use such events as an impetus for informed decision-making. By focusing on fundamental analysis, maintaining a long-term perspective, and adhering to sound risk management strategies, individuals can navigate the ripples created by large holders and continue to participate confidently in the exciting world of digital assets. The resilience of Ethereum’s ecosystem and its ongoing development suggest that while individual sales may cause temporary shifts, the foundational strength of the network remains robust. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum whale in cryptocurrency? An Ethereum whale refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH), typically enough to significantly influence the market price if they decide to buy or sell a substantial portion of their holdings. Their actions are closely watched by other investors. Q2: How do on-chain analysts track these large transactions? On-chain analysts track large transactions by monitoring public blockchain data. Every transaction on the Ethereum network is recorded on a transparent, immutable ledger. Analysts use specialized tools and software to identify large transfers between wallets, track wallet clusters, and analyze transaction patterns, even if the wallet owners remain pseudonymous. Q3: What was the profit made by the anonymous Ethereum whale in this sale? According to on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa, the anonymous Ethereum whale made an estimated profit of $2.69 million from the sale of 3,810 ETH, valued at $13.92 million at the time of the transaction. Q4: Should I sell my ETH if an Ethereum whale sells a large amount? Not necessarily. While a large sale by an Ethereum whale can cause short-term price volatility, it’s crucial to avoid panic selling. Consider your own investment goals, conduct your own research on Ethereum’s fundamentals, and maintain a long-term perspective. Such sales are often part of a whale’s profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing strategy and don’t always indicate a long-term bearish trend for ETH. Q5: What factors influence Ethereum’s price beyond whale movements? Many factors influence Ethereum’s price beyond individual whale movements, including network upgrades (like Dencun), the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, institutional adoption, overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, regulatory developments, and broader macroeconomic conditions.

BlockDAG, PENGU, WLD, and BNB each bring something tangible to the table. BlockDAG is shaping up as a major player in Web3 development, PENGU is evolving into a Web3 consumer brand, WLD is rolling out biometric ID infrastructure worldwide, and BNB powers one of the most active blockchain ecosystems. If you’re assessing the best cryptos to buy now, this group combines real-world momentum with strong fundamentals. From infrastructure to identity, culture, and adoption, these projects are actively shaping crypto’s next big leap. 1. BlockDAG: 4,500+ Builders & 300+ Projects Already Live BlockDAG is gaining ground as one of the most promising platforms for real-world crypto development. With more than 4,500 builders already active and over 300 projects underway, including AI apps, DeFi tools, and core infrastructure, the network is moving from vision to execution at full speed. Earlier this year, BlockDAG’s global hackathon with HackerEarth pulled in over 10,000 developers and produced more than 200 dApps, proving its strong appeal to builders. The team is pushing toward 1,000+ decentralized applications by 2026. As part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, BDAG is priced at $0.0016 until August 11. Over $351M has already been raised, with 24.3 billion coins and 18,650+ miners sold. With the official launch price locked in at $0.05, early buyers could see up to 3,025% ROI, making it one of the most explosive presale opportunities available. Out of all the best cryptos to buy now, BlockDAG leads in early-stage traction, real usage, and infrastructure-first progress. It’s already being used by builders, not just talked about. 2. WLD: Scaling Global Digital Identity With Biometric Verification WLD, trading around $1.11, is building a biometric identity protocol at global scale under Sam Altman’s leadership. With more than 1,500 Orb devices already deployed in over 30 countries, the network has verified upwards of 2 million users through real biometric data. Its World App supports privacy via zero-knowledge proofs, placing WLD in a unique position as digital ID demand surges. With a 10 billion token cap and emissions capped at 1.5% annually, its inflation is under control. Regulatory questions still hover, but WLD’s rapid adoption, deep funding, and global footprint give it strong potential in the evolving Web3 space. For buyers eyeing identity-based projects, WLD clearly ranks among the best cryptos to buy now. 3. PENGU: From NFTs to Walmart Shelves Now priced at around $0.0398, PENGU has transformed into a full-on media brand. What began as an NFT collection has expanded into animation, merchandise, and more. Its Pudgy Penguins toys are now on shelves in more than 3,100 Walmart stores, with over 2 million units sold globally. This real-world success makes it a standout among culturally driven assets and one of the best cryptos to buy now. Running on the Solana network, PENGU has a total supply of 88.8 billion tokens and rewards users through its licensing model. While long-term engagement may still be a challenge, projects like Pudgy World and high-profile investors continue to push its reach into new markets. 4. BNB: Powering One of the Largest Crypto Platforms With a price near $758, BNB continues to serve as the backbone of the Binance network. It fuels gas fees on the BNB Smart Chain, supports DeFi trading, and provides fee discounts and launchpad access for users on Binance. BNB also maintains its deflationary model with quarterly token burns. So far, between 30% and 35% of the 200 million total supply has been burned. This shrinking supply adds scarcity and strengthens the token’s economics. BNB earns its place among the best cryptos to buy now by providing real utility across one of the most active blockchain ecosystems. Despite regulatory pressures on centralized exchanges, Binance’s global operations continue to drive long-term relevance. Identifying the Best Crypto to Buy Now Each of these picks, BlockDAG, PENGU, WLD, and BNB, delivers something different: infrastructure, culture, identity, and broad utility. Together, they show how crypto is evolving beyond speculation. Still, BlockDAG clearly leads when it comes to real metrics. With 4,500 builders, 300+ active projects, and a clear roadmap to 1,000+ dApps, it’s already in motion. Its $0.0016 entry price and 3,025% upside potential make it especially compelling ahead of launch.

After an impressive rally that took its price close to previous highs, the token has now slipped below a key support level, raising questions about its short-term direction. XRP is still holding onto a bullish structure. It continues to form higher highs and higher lows, which is generally a sign of strength. This means that despite the short-term pullback, XRP hasn’t yet confirmed the start of a bear market. In fact, as long as the price stays above critical support levels, the longer-term outlook remains intact. Recent Price Action and Support Levels In the short term, XRP has broken below the $3.40 mark, which had acted as a strong support level for over a week. So, where does XRP go from here? One scenario is a period of consolidation, where the price moves sideways within a range. Support is now sitting around $2.90 to $3.00, which has held up in previous corrections. On the upside, resistance is expected around $3.30 to $3.40, the same zone that recently flipped from support to resistance. What Needs to Happen for XRP to Rally? For a real bullish push, XRP would need to reclaim the $3.25 to $3.30 zone and hold above it. A sustained move above that level could open the door for a rally towards $4.60 to $4.70, where important resistance is expected based on historical Fibonacci levels. On the other hand, if the price slips further, the next levels to watch would be $2.75 and $2.25, both seen as strong long-term support zones.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of derivatives, particularly with crypto perpetual futures liquidation events. Over the past 24 hours, the digital asset landscape witnessed a significant shake-up, with hundreds of millions of dollars in leveraged positions wiped out. This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risks involved in trading perpetual futures. Let’s dive deep into the recent breakdown and understand what these numbers truly mean for traders and the broader market. What Exactly are Crypto Perpetual Futures, and Why Do They Matter? Before we dissect the recent liquidation figures, it’s crucial to grasp the mechanics of crypto perpetual futures . Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not. This unique feature allows traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. They are incredibly popular because they offer: High Leverage: Traders can control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. 24/7 Trading: Mirroring the underlying crypto market, perpetual futures trade around the clock. Price Discovery: Their continuous nature makes them key instruments for price discovery in the crypto ecosystem. However, with great power comes great responsibility – and significant risk. The ability to amplify gains also means the potential to amplify losses, making understanding crypto perpetual futures liquidation paramount. Decoding Liquidation: The Trader’s Nightmare So, what exactly is “liquidation” in the context of crypto perpetual futures liquidation ? Simply put, it’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to a failure to meet margin requirements. When the market moves against a trader’s position, and their margin balance falls below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), the exchange automatically liquidates the position to prevent further losses to the trader and the exchange itself. This often happens rapidly and can result in the loss of the entire initial margin. Key factors leading to liquidation include: Volatile Price Swings: Sudden, sharp movements in the underlying asset’s price. High Leverage: The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to trigger liquidation. Insufficient Margin: Not having enough collateral to cover potential losses. The term “long liquidation” means that positions betting on price increases (longs) were closed out, typically because the price fell. Conversely, “short liquidation” occurs when prices rise, forcing positions betting on price decreases (shorts) to close. The Dramatic 24-Hour Breakdown: Who Got Hit and Why? The past 24 hours painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation impacting major assets. Here’s a closer look at the data: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated (USD) Percentage Long Liquidated Bitcoin (BTC) $147.42 million 79.09% Ethereum (ETH) $106.23 million 53.93% Solana (SOL) $28.21 million 65.55% This data reveals a clear trend: a significant majority of the liquidated positions were “longs.” This indicates a prevailing downward price movement across these assets that caught many bullish traders off guard. For Bitcoin, nearly 80% of the liquidated value came from long positions, suggesting a strong price correction or bearish momentum that overwhelmed leveraged BTC longs. Ethereum also saw substantial long liquidations, though slightly less pronounced than BTC, while Solana experienced considerable long pressure as well. Such concentrated long liquidations can create a “cascade effect.” As one position is liquidated, it adds selling pressure to the market, which can then trigger more liquidations, leading to further price drops. This domino effect is a critical aspect of understanding large-scale crypto perpetual futures liquidation events. Why Do These Liquidation Numbers Matter to You? Beyond the raw figures, understanding crypto perpetual futures liquidation data offers invaluable insights for all market participants, not just those actively trading derivatives: Market Sentiment Indicator: High long liquidations often signal bearish sentiment or a market correction. Conversely, high short liquidations can precede a rally. Volatility Gauge: Large liquidation sums highlight periods of extreme market volatility, indicating increased risk. Understanding Market Structure: It reveals where significant leverage is concentrated and thus where potential vulnerabilities lie. Risk Management Lessons: For traders, it’s a stark reminder of the importance of prudent risk management and avoiding excessive leverage. These events underscore the interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem. A major liquidation event in one asset can send ripples across the entire market, influencing spot prices and overall sentiment. Navigating the Perils: Challenges of Trading Perpetual Futures While the allure of high returns through leverage is strong, the challenges associated with trading crypto perpetual futures are equally potent. The primary hurdles include: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Small price movements, when magnified by leverage, can quickly erode capital. Funding Rates: Perpetual futures contracts involve “funding rates” – periodic payments exchanged between long and short positions to keep the contract price pegged to the spot price. These rates can eat into profits or add to costs, especially during prolonged periods. Emotional Trading: The rapid swings and the fear of liquidation can lead to impulsive decisions, often resulting in poor trading outcomes. Technical Complexity: Understanding margin, leverage, funding rates, and order types requires a certain level of technical proficiency. Ignoring these challenges is akin to sailing into a storm without a compass. A comprehensive understanding of the risks is the first step towards successful navigation in the derivatives market. Mastering Risk: Strategies to Mitigate Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation For those venturing into or already participating in the world of crypto perpetual futures , mitigating the risk of liquidation is paramount. Here are actionable strategies: Prudent Leverage Management: This is arguably the most critical step. Avoid maxing out your leverage. Use lower leverage ratios, especially when starting out or during highly volatile periods. A 2x or 3x leverage can still amplify gains without putting your entire capital at immediate risk. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses. This is your primary defense against sudden adverse price movements and cascading liquidations. Maintain Adequate Margin: Always ensure you have sufficient collateral in your margin account. Actively monitor your margin health and be prepared to add more funds (margin call) if your position is nearing liquidation. Diversify Your Portfolio: While specific to spot trading, the principle applies. Don’t put all your capital into highly leveraged positions on a single asset. Stay Informed and Analyze Market Trends: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data. Understanding the broader market sentiment and potential catalysts can help you anticipate significant price movements. Practice with Demo Accounts: Many exchanges offer demo or paper trading accounts. Utilize these to practice your strategies and get comfortable with the platform without risking real capital. Remember, the goal isn’t to avoid all losses, but to manage them effectively so that one bad trade doesn’t wipe out your entire trading capital. Learning from past crypto perpetual futures liquidation events is a powerful tool for future success. Actionable Insights from the Recent Liquidation Wave The recent 24-hour liquidation data offers clear takeaways for traders: Beware of Over-Leveraged Longs: When market sentiment is already fragile or showing signs of weakness, going heavily long with high leverage can be extremely risky. The high percentage of long liquidations in BTC, ETH, and SOL serves as a strong warning. Market Reversals Can Be Swift: Even seemingly stable assets can experience rapid downward movements, triggering widespread liquidations. Always be prepared for unexpected volatility. Opportunity for Astute Traders: While liquidations are painful for some, they can present opportunities for others. Periods of high volatility and price discovery often create entry points for traders with a well-defined strategy and strong risk management. By studying these patterns, traders can refine their strategies, adjust their risk exposure, and potentially capitalize on future market movements. The data from crypto perpetual futures liquidation is a powerful educational tool. Conclusion: Navigating the High-Stakes World of Perpetual Futures The recent 24-hour breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While perpetual futures offer incredible opportunities for magnified gains, they come hand-in-hand with magnified risks. Understanding the mechanics of liquidation, recognizing the patterns in the data, and rigorously applying sound risk management strategies are not just recommendations—they are necessities for survival and success in this high-stakes arena. By learning from past market shake-ups, traders can better position themselves to navigate future volatility and make more informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What causes crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position loses enough value that their margin balance falls below the exchange’s maintenance margin requirement. This is typically triggered by adverse price movements against the trader’s position, especially when high leverage is used. 2. How can traders avoid crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Traders can minimize liquidation risk by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and actively monitoring market conditions. Prudent risk management is key. 3. What’s the difference between long and short liquidation? Long liquidation happens when a trader betting on a price increase (a ‘long’ position) is forced to close their position because the price of the asset falls significantly. Short liquidation occurs when a trader betting on a price decrease (a ‘short’ position) is forced to close because the price of the asset rises significantly. 4. Does crypto perpetual futures liquidation impact the spot market? Yes, large-scale liquidations can impact the spot market. When positions are liquidated, exchanges often sell the underlying assets to cover losses, adding selling pressure to the spot market and potentially causing further price drops, creating a cascading effect. 5. Are perpetual futures suitable for beginners? Generally, perpetual futures are considered high-risk instruments due to leverage and volatility. They are often not recommended for beginners without a solid understanding of market mechanics, risk management, and trading strategies. Starting with spot trading or demo accounts is advisable. 6. What is a funding rate in perpetual futures? A funding rate is a small, periodic payment exchanged between long and short positions in perpetual futures contracts. It helps to keep the contract’s price anchored to the spot price of the underlying asset. If the funding rate is positive, longs pay shorts; if negative, shorts pay longs.

With rising uncertainty in major economies due to various political and macroeconomic conditions, BTC remains a “safer” alternative, at least for now. Another Player in The Game An AI-focused firm headquartered in Japan, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Quantum Solutions Co., is the latest addition to public companies that have adopted the Bitcoin treasury model. In the shared press release, it outlined an initial plan to raise $10 million (¥1.48 billion) for purchasing the asset, with the ultimate goal of accumulating a maximum of 3,000 BTC over the next 12 months. The board of directors meeting had decreed that a subsidiary of the enterprise would launch a new business focused on crypto investments. The company is currently assessing how the investment can potentially impact its finances for the fiscal year ending in February 2026, so the exact method of acquiring the capital has not been decided yet. The firm further stated in the news release: Amidst ongoing yen depreciation and increasing international financial uncertainty, the investment and holding of Bitcoin are gaining importance among global listed companies and institutional investors as a means of diversifying assets, mitigating currency risks, and hedging against inflation. The investment business will be promoted under a few key policies: Purchase and holding of Bitcoin for long-term value Phases of implementation will be in place for the acquisition volume and holding ratio, with constant monitoring Countermeasures for price fluctuation risk and cybersecurity, encompassing a risk management strategy Economic Conditions in Japan and The Trade Deal The shift in sentiment and adoption of Bitcoin by numerous companies comes at a time of financial instability and a crashing bond market in Japan.

A flat tariff of 15% on imports has also been introduced.

One such event recently sent ripples through the digital asset community: a colossal USDC transfer . Imagine nearly $270 million, equivalent to the GDP of a small nation, moving across the blockchain in an instant. This is precisely what transpired when 269,164,935 USDC was transferred from Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to an unknown wallet. Such a significant USDC transfer isn’t just a number; it’s a signal, a mystery, and a potential indicator of larger market dynamics at play. What Just Happened? The Colossal USDC Transfer Explained The news broke courtesy of Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions. Their report highlighted the movement of an astonishing 269,164,935 USDC, valued at approximately $269 million, from a Binance wallet to a destination currently identified only as an ‘unknown wallet.’ For those new to the crypto space, this might sound abstract, but it represents a significant shift of capital within the digital economy. The Sum: Nearly $270 million USD Coin (USDC). The Origin: Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange known for its vast trading volumes and user base. The Destination: An ‘unknown wallet,’ which means the specific entity or individual behind the receiving address has not been publicly identified. The Tracker: Whale Alert, a service that provides real-time updates on large crypto transactions, offering transparency into the movements of ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. This USDC transfer underscores the sheer scale and velocity with which digital assets can move across borders and between entities, often with a level of anonymity that sparks both fascination and debate. Why Does a Large USDC Transfer Matter? Understanding Whale Movements In the cryptocurrency ecosystem, a ‘whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. When these whales make significant moves, such as a massive USDC transfer , the market often pays close attention. Why? Because these movements can sometimes precede larger market shifts, indicate institutional activity, or simply reflect strategic decisions by major players. While a stablecoin like USDC is designed to maintain a stable value (pegged 1:1 to the US dollar), large transfers of stablecoins are still noteworthy. Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, a large USDC transfer isn’t likely to directly impact the stablecoin’s price. However, it can signal: Preparation for Trading: Whales might move stablecoins to an exchange to prepare for a large purchase of other cryptocurrencies, or off an exchange to take profits or secure assets. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional trades often happen off-exchange through OTC desks to avoid market slippage. A large stablecoin transfer could be part of such a settlement. Exchange Rebalancing: Exchanges themselves might move funds between their hot and cold wallets for security or operational purposes. Institutional Inflow/Outflow: Major financial institutions entering or exiting positions often involve large stablecoin movements. Understanding these ‘whale movements’ provides a glimpse into the underlying dynamics of the market, offering insights that go beyond simple price charts. USDC: The Stablecoin at the Heart of the Transaction The asset involved in this massive transaction is USD Coin (USDC), one of the most widely used and trusted stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market. But what exactly is USDC, and why is it so integral to the crypto economy? USDC is a digital stablecoin pegged to the US dollar on a 1:1 basis, meaning one USDC is always intended to be worth one US dollar. It is managed by Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase. Its primary purpose is to provide stability in the volatile crypto market, serving as a safe haven asset during periods of price fluctuations and facilitating easy transfers of value without the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies. Key characteristics of USDC: Characteristic Description Pegging 1:1 to the US Dollar. Backing Fully backed by cash and short-dated U.S. government treasuries held in segregated accounts. Transparency Monthly attestations by independent accounting firms verify its reserves. Utility Used for trading, lending, borrowing, and cross-border payments. Network Primarily an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, but available on multiple blockchains. The robust backing and regulatory compliance make USDC a preferred choice for large institutional players and everyday users seeking a reliable digital dollar. The very fact that such a substantial USDC transfer occurred highlights its role as a fundamental building block in the global digital finance landscape. Binance and the “Unknown Wallet”: Navigating Transparency in Crypto The transaction’s origin from Binance, a global powerhouse in the crypto exchange space, immediately adds a layer of significance. Binance processes billions of dollars in trades daily and holds vast amounts of user funds, making its movements particularly scrutinized. When funds leave a major exchange like Binance for an ‘unknown wallet,’ it often raises questions about the nature of the recipient. It’s important to clarify what an ‘unknown wallet’ typically means in the context of blockchain transactions: Not Necessarily Malicious: An ‘unknown wallet’ simply means the address is not publicly linked to a known entity (like another exchange, a specific company, or a famous individual). It does not automatically imply illicit activity. Cold Storage: Large amounts of funds are often moved from ‘hot’ exchange wallets (connected to the internet for liquidity) to ‘cold’ storage wallets (offline, for security) by exchanges or institutional investors. These cold wallets are typically unknown to the public. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: As mentioned, large institutional trades often happen through OTC desks. The receiving wallet could belong to an OTC provider or a large institutional client. Private Wallets: It could simply be a private wallet belonging to a high-net-worth individual or a large investor who prefers to keep their holdings off exchanges. While the blockchain offers transparency in tracking transactions, the identity of the wallet owner often remains pseudonymous. This balance between transparency of transactions and pseudonymity of participants is a core characteristic of decentralized finance and often a point of discussion regarding regulation and privacy. Potential Reasons Behind This Massive USDC Transfer When a whale moves nearly $270 million in USDC, speculation naturally arises. While the exact reason for this particular USDC transfer remains private, we can explore several common scenarios that might explain such a large movement: Institutional Onboarding or Offboarding: A major financial institution might be entering the crypto space by purchasing a large amount of USDC, or conversely, divesting a significant portion of their stablecoin holdings. OTC Trading Settlement: The funds could be settling a large over-the-counter trade, where a buyer acquired a substantial amount of another cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) and paid in USDC, or vice versa. Exchange Cold Storage Transfer: Binance itself might be moving funds from its operational ‘hot’ wallets to more secure ‘cold’ storage wallets to enhance security and manage liquidity. This is a routine security practice for exchanges. DeFi Protocol Interaction: A large entity could be deploying capital into a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol for lending, borrowing, or yield farming, requiring a significant stablecoin deposit. Strategic Investment or Treasury Management: A corporation or large fund might be diversifying its treasury holdings into stablecoins for liquidity management or as a hedge against market volatility. Arbitrage Opportunity: While less likely for such a large, direct transfer to an unknown wallet, some large stablecoin movements are related to exploiting minor price discrepancies across different exchanges. Each of these possibilities highlights the diverse and complex motivations behind large capital movements in the crypto world, showcasing the maturity and multifaceted nature of the digital asset market. How Do Such Transfers Impact the Crypto Market? The immediate impact of a large USDC transfer on the broader crypto market is often subtle, especially compared to the movement of volatile assets like Bitcoin. Since USDC is a stablecoin, its price is designed to remain constant. Therefore, this specific transfer won’t directly cause a price swing in USDC itself. However, the indirect implications can be significant: Liquidity Signals: A large influx of stablecoins onto an exchange can signal an intent to buy other cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to upward price pressure. Conversely, a large outflow could suggest a desire to take profits or move funds off-exchange, which might be seen as bearish. In this case, the funds moved off Binance, suggesting a potential move into cold storage, OTC deals, or off-chain activities rather than immediate market buying. Market Sentiment: Large whale movements can influence market sentiment. While this particular transfer doesn’t immediately signal bullish or bearish intent, it reminds participants of the substantial capital flowing within the ecosystem. Confidence in Stablecoins: The continuous use and large transfers of USDC reinforce its role as a reliable medium of exchange and store of value within the crypto space, bolstering confidence in stablecoins generally. Regulatory Scrutiny: Large, seemingly anonymous transactions can sometimes attract the attention of regulators, fueling discussions around KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance in the crypto industry. Ultimately, while not a direct market mover, such a massive USDC transfer is a pulse check on the health and activity of the crypto market, offering insights into the behavior of its largest participants. Protecting Your Assets: Lessons from Large USDC Transfers While this particular USDC transfer involved institutional-level sums, it offers valuable lessons for every crypto holder, regardless of portfolio size. Understanding how large players manage their assets can inform your own security practices and investment strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Storage: Just as exchanges use hot and cold wallets, consider diversifying how you store your crypto. Keep smaller amounts on exchanges for active trading (hot wallet) and larger, long-term holdings in secure hardware wallets (cold storage). Understand Stablecoins: Appreciate the role of stablecoins like USDC for stability, liquidity, and hedging against volatility. They are crucial tools in a balanced crypto portfolio. Be Aware of Market Signals: While not every whale alert is a direct trading signal, staying informed about significant on-chain movements can provide context for broader market trends. Practice Due Diligence: Always research exchanges, wallets, and protocols thoroughly before entrusting your funds. Ensure they have strong security practices and a proven track record. Prioritize Security: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and be wary of phishing attempts. Large transfers often highlight the critical importance of robust security measures. The crypto world is dynamic, and vigilance is key. Learning from the actions of major players, even in a seemingly simple USDC transfer , can empower you to navigate this exciting landscape more safely and effectively. The colossal USDC transfer of nearly $270 million from Binance to an unknown wallet is more than just a headline; it’s a testament to the scale and sophistication of the modern cryptocurrency market. While the exact intentions behind this particular movement remain private, it underscores the critical role of stablecoins like USDC, the operational intricacies of major exchanges, and the ongoing dance between transparency and privacy on the blockchain. Such whale movements, though not always directly impacting prices, serve as vital signals for market participants, offering glimpses into institutional activity, security practices, and the evolving landscape of digital finance. As the crypto economy continues to mature, understanding these massive transfers becomes increasingly important for anyone looking to navigate its complexities and harness its potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their transactions, like a significant USDC transfer , can sometimes influence market sentiment or indicate larger strategic moves due to the sheer volume of their holdings. 2. What is USDC and why is it important? USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain stable at $1. It is important because it provides stability in the volatile crypto market, facilitates fast and cheap transactions, and is widely used for trading, lending, and as a safe haven asset. 3. Why are large transfers to “unknown wallets” common in crypto? Large transfers to “unknown wallets” are common because these often represent movements to secure cold storage, settlements for over-the-counter (OTC) trades, or transfers to private institutional wallets. The term “unknown” simply means the wallet address isn’t publicly attributed to a specific person or entity, not necessarily that the transaction is illicit. 4. Does a large USDC transfer affect USDC’s price? No, a large USDC transfer typically does not affect USDC’s price. As a stablecoin, USDC is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, backed by reserves. Its value is not subject to the same supply and demand dynamics that influence the prices of volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. 5. How can I track large crypto transactions like this one? You can track large crypto transactions using blockchain explorers and services like Whale Alert. These platforms monitor public blockchain data and report significant movements of various cryptocurrencies, providing insights into whale activity and market trends. 6. Is Binance safe for large crypto holdings given these transfers? Binance is one of the largest and most widely used cryptocurrency exchanges globally, employing extensive security measures, including cold storage for the majority of user funds, insurance funds, and robust compliance protocols. While no platform is entirely risk-free, Binance continuously invests in security to protect user assets. Large transfers from exchanges often indicate internal security practices (like moving to cold storage) rather than a security breach.

While Bitcoin holds near all-time highs above $120,000, traders are increasingly pivoting to leading altcoins as new catalysts reshape the landscape. Notably, beyond these headlines, analyst attention is building around up-and-coming decentralized projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, a meme-powered altcoin rooted in community governance and political culture. ETF Inflows Ignite a New Altcoin Cycle Ethereum has led the week’s charge, jumping over 20% and drawing record-setting ETF inflows of more than $720 million in a single day. Ether’s price continues to rise as institutional demand and positive U.S. regulatory developments give bulls room to target $4,000 and beyond. With Wall Street’s largest funds and brokers expanding access, ETH’s role as a preferred institutional blockchain is cemented. Ripple’s XRP is also making waves, gaining over 10% in the past day and briefly touching a new all-time high. Open interest in XRP futures soared to $10 billion, reflecting increased leveraged bets and institutional participation. Momentum for XRP has been bolstered by the passage of the GENIUS Act and fresh optimism for U.S.-listed crypto ETFs. Dogecoin, the market’s original meme coin, is back in focus as it powers above $0.25 for the first time in months. Volume has exploded to $3.5 billion per day, and analysts point to a classic “cup and handle” breakout pattern—potentially targeting $0.32 if momentum continues. Institutional Demand and Policy Support What’s driving these moves? The simple answer is fresh capital. Over $2 billion flowed into spot crypto ETFs in just one week, marking a significant acceleration of institutional adoption. BlackRock, Charles Schwab, and other giants are opening new avenues for investor access, while positive regulatory news—including anticipated 401(k) access to crypto and the GENIUS Act’s passage—are supporting the rally. With U.S. policymakers signaling openness to crypto in retirement accounts and enforcing pro-innovation legislation, analysts predict the current momentum could be just the beginning of a broader cycle. Decentralized Innovation: MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Analyst Attention While established names dominate the charts, there’s growing analyst interest in the decentralized, politically charged MAGACOIN FINANCE. As a meme-powered altcoin designed around community governance and ideological engagement, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to build a reputation for unique upside and grassroots appeal. Momentum is building within its expanding holder base, and top analysts cite its anti-centralization ethos as a reason to watch closely as new capital enters the sector. Is a New Crypto Cycle Underway? Could projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE become tomorrow’s headline-makers as ETF adoption accelerates? With XRP, Ethereum, and Dogecoin all delivering outsized gains and institutional inflows at record highs, July’s rally signals a potential turning point for digital assets. For now, top traders are watching both the leaders and the next generation of community-driven coins as the crypto market writes its next chapter.

If you want to break through in today’s Web 3.0 space, the only way to do that is by creating a monopoly in something consumers want. Very few times has this been done in blockchain. Bitcoin stands as a new asset class, while Ethereum has proven viable for creating mainly NFTs (non-fungible tokens). There is a class of blockchain firms serving traditional financial markets as well as experimenting with stablecoins, RWAs (real-world assets) and more. And while these innovations may make a global impact, they will be dominated by a few players. That is becoming clearer, especially as Web 3.0 takes a backseat to AI. At this point in Web 3.0’s evolution, nobody cares about your whitepaper, roadmap, tokenomics or governance model. It’s no longer 2016. You’re not going to build the next unicorn through hashtags and recycled ideas. Your minute on-chain metrics are meaningless in the grand scheme of all things crypto. All it shows is a lack of adoption and a lack of product market fit, or in other words, value. As a Web 3.0 founder, your survival depends on the uniqueness of your project. You must understand and clearly explain what makes both you and your project not just special but truly one-of-a-kind. Your individuality, as well as that of your company, is your biggest strength. Remember this important truth. The best way to make your project unique entails carving out a monopoly in a niche that solves a big problem. If you find yourself leaning into jargon, perhaps your idea serves no purpose. Perhaps not even you know what it is you are attempting to do. It could be merely that the timing is wrong. Either way, your project must have tangible benefits for consumers and deliver it at least 10 times better than the next best. Ask yourself this question: Is your company story just a rehash of the same old buzzwords Web 3.0 has been throwing around now for more than a decade? If so, you might find resistance gaining traction as you share your story on X and LinkedIn. People have heard it all before. Are you highlighting the correct parts of your expertise and real-world experience? Are your product launches and milestones solving problems for consumers, or are they announcements for the sake of announcements? Avoid those. If your consumer can’t experience an announcement for themselves, don’t bother with the public relations aspect. Save that for when you have something that can improve people’s lives. While you are free to publish insights and case studies on your project, they should be hyper-focused on the unique aspects of your project. Don’t write whitepapers that are not focused on your core strengths and your mission. What does your team do better than any other team in the Web 3.0 space? All of your team’s energy should go towards this strength. Generally speaking, avoid side quests in business. Many founders grow bored with their initial vision, start a side quest, get spread too thin and run out of business. Stay focused on building a monopoly within Web 3.0. Many Web 3.0 companies put too much energy into incestuous partnerships with other Web 3.0 companies, with minimal innovation. Instead, you must look towards large corporations for partnerships that will impact your business in the way you want. Instead of focusing on partnerships with Web 3.0 companies, focus on partnerships with companies outside the space, like from the red-hot AI industry. These are the partnerships you should be announcing on social media, not partnerships with other early-stage Web 3.0 companies. This doesn’t mean you should not attend hackathons and Web 3.0 conferences, but perhaps the purpose there will be to tap into consumers, not partners. When you do speak at conferences, do you offer a unique perspective compared with the rest of the speakers and panelists, or are you repeating views of the industry that have been flogged to death already? Again, you must consider what makes your view or work in the industry unique and lean into that and only that. When you speak before an audience, take risks. Make your wildest claims, assuming they’re backed by logic and reason. Instead of posting into the void on social media – or cross-promoting projects for joint marketing campaigns, AMAs (ask me anything) and more – reach out to the largest technology journals in the world, including Reuters, Associated Press, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, TechCrunch and others. Reach out to the largest publications in your region. You may not hear back, but these are the publications with the readers you want to know your name. Offer them your insights on timely technology news stories. Don’t chase every opportunity. Focus on the big pieces of your empire – that is, big product shipments, behemoth partnerships and mainstream press. One deal with a high-impact venture capital firm, technology company or protocol can be worth 10,000 small ones. It’s similar for constant exposure in the mainstream compared to industry publications. Building a monopoly is not about testing pitches – it’s about providing value. If the market accepts you, the venture capitalists will surely follow. Web 3.0 projects have to move beyond partnering with other niche Web 3.0 projects. Hype-driven companies are no longer making a splash in Web 3.0. Founders must be unique, and so too must their projects. Crypto bubbles are not creating viable startups anymore. The Web 3.0 projects of today are those solving real problems and showing tangible results. Most past the buzzwords and tiny wins. Build what matters – on ly then will the Web 3.0 market and beyond take notice. Archer Wolfe is the CEO and founder of 1stimpression.com , a premium personal branding agency based out of Hong Kong.

Altman raised the issue on a recent episode of comedian Theo Von’s podcast. He noted that as AI moves into more sensitive areas, there’s still no legal shield for what users share. “People talk about the most personal sh** in their lives to ChatGPT,” Altman said. He pointed out that many, especially younger users, treat the chatbot like a therapist or life coach, asking “what should I do?” when facing relationship troubles or other private matters. By contrast, when someone confides in a licensed therapist, lawyer or physician, the law protects those details under doctor‐patient or attorney‐client privilege. With an AI, however, no such legal confidentiality exists yet. That gap could become a real problem in court, Altman warned, since OpenAI would be compelled to turn over chat transcripts if ordered. “I think that’s very screwed up. I think we should have the same concept of privacy for your conversations with AI that we do with a therapist or whatever — and no one had to think about that even a year ago,” he added. Lack of privacy may be a barrier for ChatGPT’s widespread usage OpenAI sees this lack of privacy as a potential barrier to wider use. Beyond the huge volumes of online data needed to train its models, the company now faces demands to hand over user chats in litigation. In one high‐profile case, OpenAI is battling a major court order as part of its The New York Times lawsuit. The ruling would force the company to retain the records of several hundred million ChatGPT users worldwide, excluding only those on the enterprise version. OpenAI has appealed the decision, labeling it “an overreach,” and arguing that if courts can override its own privacy policies, future demands for law enforcement or discovery access could multiply. Today’s tech firms regularly get subpoenas for user data in criminal investigations. But as laws evolve, so do concerns about what digital footprints might reveal. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, many users shifted to more secure apps or to Apple Health, which encrypts its records. Altman also quizzed Von about his ChatGPT usage after the host admitted he was wary of sharing personal details. “I think it makes sense … to really want the privacy clarity before you use [ChatGPT] a lot — like the legal clarity,” Altman said, underscoring that until AI enjoys the same confidentiality as traditional professionals, users may think twice before opening up.

With regulatory clarity and increased institutional flows, analysts are forecasting a potential 16x market expansion by the end of 2025. But among these heavyweights, one early-stage altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is catching attention for its strong fundamentals, ideological edge, and rapidly closing presale window. Bitcoin Eyes Breakout as Bulls Target $123K+ Bitcoin continues to display a bullish structure on all major timeframes. The flagship cryptocurrency recently surged past $123,000 before consolidating around the $116,000 to $120,000 range. A high-volume bearish candle indicates mild profit-taking, but the pattern of higher highs and higher lows remains intact. Support is holding firm at $115,000, while the next upside target remains at $123,000 and beyond. If volume supports a breakout above $120,000, analysts believe a retest of all-time highs could follow quickly. Specifically, veteran market watcher Peter Brandt has said $150,000 could be the next stop for Bitcoin as early as August. Solana Gains Institutional Traction: $337 in Sight Solana is increasingly seen as a credible Ethereum alternative, offering blazing speed and ultra-low transaction costs thanks to its hybrid Proof of Stake and Proof of History architecture. According to a report by 21Shares, analysts predict that SOL could rally from $178 to $337, representing an 89% upside. Institutional investors are also warming up to Solana due to its business-oriented ecosystem and community pragmatism. This was evident in the 2025 memecoin boom, which boosted network activity and volume. While critics highlight the platform’s history of outages and centralization risks, many investors are willing to trade those concerns for speed, usability, and scalability. Cardano Clears Resistance, Eyes Set on $0.90 Cardano (ADA) is flashing strong bullish signals after a 17% rally last week. Currently trading above $0.82, ADA has broken through key long-term resistance levels. ADA recently peaked at $0.89, marking a 20-week high and placing it #3 on Grayscale’s top-performing crypto list as of July 17. With a 681% year-to-date gain, it has outpaced competitors like Solana and Tron, fueled by regulatory tailwinds and increasing institutional inflows. Analysts believe ADA could rally to $3, though some caution is warranted given market volatility. Now ranked #10 by market cap, Cardano’s decentralized governance model and bullish sentiment may support further upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Coin with a Movement While Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano attract institutional capital, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly emerging as a breakout altcoin with a compelling narrative. Once seen as just a politically charged meme, it’s now making its way onto analyst watchlists alongside established crypto names. Backed by CertiK and HashEx audits, MAGACOIN offers 100% decentralized ownership and a capped supply, echoing the early days of Dogecoin and Solana. Its growing community on Telegram and X (Twitter) is driving momentum, with analysts projecting up to 16x returns, especially for early buyers who benefit from staking bonuses and governance rights as the final presale stage wraps up. Conclusion: Utility and Narrative Drive the Next Crypto Cycle With crypto entering a fresh growth phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. While Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano lead the charge, this community-driven altcoin blends ideology and decentralization for serious upside potential. As new listings accelerate and momentum builds, early-stage opportunities like this are disappearing fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE may be one of the year’s breakout plays.

Despite past rallies, retail sell-offs, weak technicals, and heavy whale dominance are holding DOGE back. Meanwhile, a new viral altcoin is rewriting the script, soaring 400% in just days. As investors chase real innovation and growth, Dogecoin may struggle to keep up in this new market cycle. Dogecoin Slides Again As Whales Keep Buying And Retail Keeps Selling Dogecoin is once again losing steam, dropping over 4% after last week’s brief 37% rally. The excitement that pushed DOGE higher has faded fast, and retail sentiment remains firmly on the sidelines. While whales continue to accumulate, with over 122 billion DOGE now in their hands, smaller holders are still offloading. Retail selling has persisted since early July, and new participants haven’t replaced the exit. This imbalance is weighing heavily on the price. Market data from Coinglass confirms the trend: trading volume is down nearly 47%, and open interest has dropped to $4.85 billion. Technicals paint a grim picture, too. DOGE trades below all major moving averages, including the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day, each reinforcing downward pressure. The MACD is deep in the red, and any small rally attempts are quickly overwhelmed by larger selloffs. Despite heavy whale support, DOGE continues to struggle with strong resistance levels and a lack of new retail enthusiasm. Analysts now question whether Dogecoin can ever realistically approach $1. It’s not just about memes anymore; market structure and momentum say otherwise. Without fresh retail demand and under consistent resistance, DOGE’s path to $1 is becoming harder to imagine. Meanwhile, a new altcoin is stealing the spotlight with a 400% surge, raising fresh questions about where retail energy is heading next. DeSoc Could Be The Viral Altcoin That DOGE Never Became While Dogecoin struggles to find upward momentum, a new altcoin is quietly building massive traction. DeSoc (SOCS) is capturing attention with its decentralized approach to social media, something traditional platforms have failed to deliver. A 2023 study found that 64% of Americans believe social media companies control the news too much. DeSoc takes this seriously, using blockchain to return control to users and protect their data. It’s not about memes or hype; it’s about transparency, fairness, and real utility. The team behind DeSoc has locked their tokens for two years and secured a 30-year liquidity lock, moves that signal a serious long-term vision and market stability. Unlike projects that focus solely on price action, DeSoc backs its mission with multiple security audits, with one already completed and more scheduled. This shows clear dedication to protecting investors and users alike. Its user-friendly design features customizable profiles, integrated wallets, and AI-powered content recommendations, all while safeguarding privacy. However, unlike Dogecoin, which has no real utility, DeSoc has a real-life use case. It is a platform where user ownership, the safety of data, and free speech are the primary concerns. With token distribution fully transparent and early access already generating buzz, DeSoc is shaping up to be the altcoin that doesn’t just ride a wave it builds one.

With analysts and enthusiasts forecasting a cycle top of $5, ADA’s momentum seems set to continue, but there’s another name attracting even more attention: PEPETO. With a current presale price of $0.000000143 and top analysts projecting a move to $1, PEPETO could easily outshine ADA in terms of investor returns. Cardano (ADA) Heading Toward $5, but Risks Remain Cardano is gaining traction with major technical indicators painting a strong buy picture. TradingView and CoinCodex both show bullish sentiment, and the Fear & Greed Index sitting at 74 suggests investor confidence is rising fast. Crypto Jebb, a respected name in crypto forecasting, pegs ADA’s next top somewhere between $3.50 and $5.00, buoyed by increasing total value locked (TVL), a growing DeFi ecosystem, and potential ETF approval news that could boost institutional demand. CoinCodex offers an even more aggressive outlook, suggesting ADA might hit $5.33 in 2025. However, Cardano’s daily volatility of 5.54% reminds investors that the path to $5 won’t be smooth. If ADA drops below critical support near $0.70, a correction toward $0.50 could threaten the bullish scenario. The God of Frogs ( PEPETO ) Presale Accelerates as Investor Interest Explodes While ADA charts its steady climb, The God of Frogs ( PEPETO ) is sprinting ahead. The meme-inspired token has taken the market by storm, with final stages of its presale selling out faster than projected, raising over $7.7 million, underscoring huge demand. This is no fluke. The community-first approach, meme appeal, and serious momentum are driving investor enthusiasm. The token is built on the Ethereum blockchain and operates with exchange lisitng with zero fees and a well developped swap tech, making it an attractive option for both first-time buyers and meme coin veterans. PEPE price $0.00001220 Target for PEPETO: x 100 Gains on the Horizon? Predictions from top market trackers have placed PEPETO’s potential price as high as Pepeto’s, which would represent an extraordinary x 98 return from the current presale rate. If achieved, this rally would turn modest investments into life-changing gains. Unlike many meme coins, PEPETO isn’t trying to reinvent crypto, it’s bringing fun, hype, and potential gains back into the spotlight. And investors are loving its story and value . PEPETO’s Community Vibe: All-In, All Fun PEPETO isn’t just another meme token; it’s built around a illustrated true story, hype, and community. Its roadmap is humorously titled “Redemption Day,” suggesting that the best is yet to come. With a theme built around PEPE cooking up something big, the community energy is off the charts. What really sets PEPETO apart is the 246% staking rewards making the investors be early in the market with considerable bag of tokens. That kind of reward system fuels even more participation, as listing nears. Major Listings Lined Up Post-Presale PEPETO has already secured a CoinMarketCap listing, adding credibility to the project as it pushes toward broader exchange listings. According to the team, TOP 1 tier major centralized exchange (CEX) listings are set for launch, and the goal is clear: to debut on the world’s largest exchange. This strategic planning and high-level coordination show that PEPETO isn’t a flash in the pan, it’s aiming to stick around. Investors getting in now are positioning themselves ahead of what could be one of the biggest post-launch runs this year. PEPETO is well-positioned to create many more millionaires due to its incredibly low presale entry point and viral appeal. At $0.000000143, even a modest move upward could yield massive percentage returns. With top analysts targeting a PEPE price $0.00001220 valuation, early investors are closely watching every milestone especially given that an ex founder of Pepe being behind PEPETO projects as rumours state, with exactly similar max supply 420T. Final Thoughts: PEPETO’s Moment Is Now While Cardano continues to chart a promising course to $5, The God of Frogs ( PEPETO ) is racing ahead with a goal that could shake up the meme coin scene. It combines explosive hype, a dedicated community, and a narrative that’s both entertaining and investor-friendly. With presale stages selling out rapidly, exchange listings on the way, and a loyal fanbase growing by the day, PEPETP’s run to PEPE’s price could redefine the next wave of millionaire-makers in crypto. For investors looking at both potential and fun, the choice is clear : Pepeto is more than a meme given its story and value.

This article delves into how XYZVerse could potentially deliver returns that dwarf traditional expectations and why it might outshine even the stalwarts like Bitcoin. The Rise of XYZVerse: A Sports Meme Coin with Real Utility Marketed as the first sports-related meme coin, XYZVerse ($XYZ) merges the enthusiasm for sports with the innovative possibilities of Web3 technology. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse aims to pioneer a sector by providing actual utility through gamified products. It has strategically aligned itself with significant sports entities, enhancing its legitimacy and potential for widespread adoption. Impressive Growth and Market Response The initial offering of the XYZ token showed promising growth, quickly escalating from $0.0001 to $0.005. The anticipation around its final presale stage, which could see a price jump to $0.02, is palpable. The projected market debut at $0.10 per token underscores the community and investor confidence, which could translate into substantial returns for early backers. The recent $15 million milestone in raised funds illustrates the burgeoning investor interest, which is set to reach even higher with an upcoming goal of $20 million. Community Engagement and Rewards In XYZVerse, community involvement isn't just encouraged; it's rewarded. Active members receive XYZ tokens through airdrops, ensuring that those who contribute to the ecosystem are part of its success. This inclusive approach fosters a loyal base of supporters tuned into the project's long-term vision. Detailed Look into Bitcoin's Role and Influence Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was designed as a decentralized solution to modern finance. With a capped supply and a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, it introduced the concept of digital scarcity and opened the doors to various technological advancements in the financial sector. However, even as Bitcoin continues to dominate discussions, it faces competition from innovative projects like XYZVerse, which are poised to capitalize on niche markets. Join the XYZVerse Community Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Conclusion While traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin continue to hold their value, the innovative approach of XYZVerse, integrating sports and memes with Web3, positions it as a potential market leader. This blend could not only provide entertainment but also translate into significant financial gains for early investors, challenging the traditional crypto market dynamics.

This analysis aims to dissect the unique attributes and investment prospects of each, helping you navigate potential investment opportunities. Introduction to XYZVerse and Its Market Dynamics The arrival of XYZVerse in the meme coin arena signifies a potent mix of pop culture resonance and strategic market positioning. Meme coins like PEPE and Bonk have shown that with the right combination of community support and engaging content, tokens can experience rapid value appreciation. XYZVerse's presale phase and its positioning before the altcoin season provide a critical window for early investors. Following this path might allow XYZVerse to capitalize on market trends and elevate its market value substantially. Core Advantages of XYZVerse Strong branding amplified through sports and influencer partnerships. Deflationary tokenomics with a significant token burn percentage. Allocated liquidity to ensure price stability once trading commences. A dedicated percentage of tokens to incentivize community interaction and retention. Projected Price Movements for XYZVerse The projected price paths for XYZVerse suggest a multi-phase potential growth: Initial launch price speculation driven by presale momentum. Post-launch price stabilization and potential surge based on market reception. Long-term valuation increase contingent on strategic partnerships and consistent community growth. Invest Early in XYZVerse for Potential Gains The Growth Trajectory of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Since its inception in 2020, Shiba Inu has evolved from a mere meme to a substantial player in the cryptocurrency market. Its integration with the Ethereum blockchain provides not only robust security but also compatibility with a broad spectrum of decentralized applications. With initiatives like ShibaSwap and planned NFT integrations, SHIB is paving the way for more than just speculative trading. Its market strategy and the growing ecosystem could well position it for an upward trajectory in the competitive crypto space. Comparative Analysis and Conclusion While XYZVerse offers a compelling narrative with sports and entertainment angles, SHIB's established market presence and ongoing development projects present a strong case for potential growth. Each has its merits, and the choice between them would depend on individual risk tolerance and investment strategy preferences.

According to Bitget Wallet CMO Jamie Elkaleh, institutional confidence has improved since Ripple’s partial legal win in March, paving the way for futures products like ProShares’ UXRP and fueling speculation around a potential spot ETF. “XRP is regaining market momentum as renewed ETF speculation intersects with increasing legal clarity,” Elkaleh said. “This shift is boosting market depth and signaling a structural step forward for XRP’s legitimacy in U.S. markets.” That narrative helped XRP briefly break above $3.60 before retracing to around $3.09, following $105M in long liquidations and a controversial $175M wallet transfer linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. Despite the volatility, analysts remain constructive. “Renewed ETF speculation and legal clarity... are significant catalysts driving XRP toward the $3 mark,” said Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research. “With momentum, $3.50–$4 is plausible in the coming weeks.” XRP’s ETF exposure is currently limited to futures, but analysts say any progress toward a spot product could drive a second wave of inflows — particularly if the SEC maintains its softened posture post-March ruling. Meanwhile, Solana is also catching a bid on the back of ecosystem growth and ETF chatter. The token now trades near $197, with analysts projecting $200–$250 as the next range if adoption trends continue. “ETF conversations around SOL are further amplifying interest,” Elkaleh added. “With a more crypto-friendly regulatory tone emerging in the U.S., sentiment around both XRP and SOL remains constructive.” Both assets face downside risks from macro pullbacks or renewed regulatory friction, but analysts believe fundamentals are finally starting to align with market structure. Liquidity is improving. Institutional flows are growing. And ETF products — even if only futures for now — are creating a bridge that retail and funds alike are beginning to cross. The next move may depend less on narrative — and more on whether inflows can keep pace with expectations.",Markets|XRP|News,EN,0,0,XRP|SOL|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-26 04:58:15

SOL Slips & Toncoin Stalls,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-x1-x10-miner-demo-showcases-10x-daily-gains-sol-slips-toncoin-stalls/,"Crypto price swings are back in full force this July, with major altcoins struggling to hold momentum. Toncoin (TON) price movement sparked excitement after moving past $3.60 but was again pushed back at the same level, signaling caution among traders. Looking over at the Solana (SOL) price chart, things aren’t any more reassuring. The brief rise above $190 might not hold much weight, as analysts anticipate a pullback to around $162.30 if market strength falters. While those two appear to be losing grip, BlockDAG (BDAG) is pushing forward. Its X1-X10 miner demo, held just yesterday, showcased how users could increase daily earnings tenfold, reaching up to 200 BDAG daily. Toncoin (TON) Price Movement Stalls Under $3.60 Despite a short-lived surge above $3.60, Toncoin (TON) couldn’t maintain the push. The coin is now trading near $3.34 after being rejected from that resistance for the fifth time, a sign of persistent selling pressure at that range. Technically, TON still trades above its 21-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, suggesting bullish sentiment hasn’t completely faded. However, a slip beneath that average could lead the price down toward the $2.60 zone. For now, the Toncoin (TON) price movement shows resilience, but it’s stuck under that $3.60 ceiling. Solana (SOL) Price Chart Hints at Downward Correction Solana’s bounce above $190 initially appeared strong, but some market watchers now believe it was a deceptive breakout. After surpassing $170 resistance and sweeping liquidity above, the price failed to retain its gains. As per current chart patterns, the Solana (SOL) price chart still trends inside an ascending channel, meaning confirmation of a breakout is missing. Two bearish paths are now in focus. Either Solana immediately drops toward $162.30, or it climbs once more, forms a lower high, and then declines. Regardless of the path, both suggest downside pressure in the near term. BlockDAG’s X1-X10 Miner Demo Shows Daily Mining Up to 200 BDAG BlockDAG just completed its live demo showcasing the power of its X1 app and the X10 miner, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. With the X1 app already counting over 2 million global users, it allows anyone to mine up to 20 BDAG per day with zero technical know-how. The new X10 device, roughly the size of a Wi-Fi adapter, connects to the X1 via Bluetooth and boosts daily mining rewards by up to 10x. That means 200 BDAG can be mined daily, making it a major upgrade for those seeking hassle-free earnings. It’s built to be compact, simple, and ideal for home use. With BDAG now priced at $0.0016 in Batch 29, available only until August 11, this gives early users a major edge. The listing rate is locked at $0.05, suggesting a potential 3,025% return at launch. Since the X1 app requires no upfront fees, all mined coins are pure gains. BlockDAG’s presale has surged past $352 million, with 24.3 billion c ins already sold. Early batch buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their holdings since the presale began, and the momentum doesn’t appear to be slowing. With the earning potential of the X1-X10 combo and its extremely low entry price, BlockDAG is fast emerging as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Best Crypto to Buy in 2025: Who’s Leading the Race? Toncoin (TON) price movement is repeatedly hitting a wall at $3.60, while staying above its 21-day SMA for now. However, repeated rejections hint at strong overhead resistance. Over at the Solana (SOL) price chart, hopes of a clean breakout are fading fast, with $162.30 acting as the next potential stop if weakness continues. Meanwhile, BlockDAG isn’t just showing potential, it’s showing results. Its X1 app and X10 miner combination now enables users to earn up to 200 BDAG a day without advanced setups or prior experience. The $0.0016 presale rate (available until August 11), fixed $0.05 listing price, and past 2,660% returns from early batches all suggest that BlockDAG has far more upside. Among the three, only one is turning speculation into daily income. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy in 2025 , BlockDAG’s current setup offers a rare mix of utility, affordability, and growth.

After banning retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (cETNs) back in 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is now proposing to lift that ban. If approved, everyday investors in the UK would be able to trade cETNs, regulated products that give exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, through official trading platforms. This move comes as global interest in crypto investment products continues to grow. Earlier this year, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have already attracted billions in investments from both institutional and retail buyers. Now, the UK is under pressure not to fall behind. Industry Says, ETFs Should Be Next In our response to the FCA’s consultation, CryptoUK welcomed the proposal to lift the ban on retail access to cryptoasset exchange traded notes (cETNs). But we also believe it’s time to start the conversation about retail access to crypto ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs approved in the… pic.twitter.com/tjnOLnuIWm — CryptoUK (@CryptoUKAssoc) July 25, 2025 CryptoUK, the country’s leading industry group, welcomed the FCA’s decision but made it clear, this should be just the beginning. In their official response, they argued that crypto ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are a safer and more familiar option for most investors compared to holding crypto directly. ETFs avoid self-custody risks, often have lower fees, and are already widely used in traditional finance. Firms like 21Shares and Coinbase UK echoed that sentiment, urging regulators to go beyond cETNs. They pointed out that limiting access might push investors toward unregulated offshore exchanges, increasing risk instead of reducing it. Moreover, product issuer 21Shares backed wider access too, warning the FCA against drawing the circle so small that UK savers are pushed back toward unregulated offshore platforms. Coinbase UK’s Keith Grose called the UK a “second mover” advantage player. By learning from successful models in the US and Europe, the UK can implement a clearer framework for regulated crypto products. But they also warn that delays could put the UK further behind countries like Germany and Switzerland, where retail access to crypto ETFs is already active. What This Means for Crypto The UK’s FCA is reviewing whether to allow retail investors to access crypto exchange-traded notes (cETNs), with final rules expected after summer. Key decisions include whether to expand beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, and whether spot crypto ETFs could follow. For now, cETNs may offer a regulated way for UK savers to get crypto exposure without handling private keys. But both regulators and industry stress that the risks remain high, with potential for full losses due to volatility.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-26 05:15:15

Her remarks come amid growing interest in Bitcoin as a stable store of value, especially during times of economic turbulence. Bitcoin as a Lifeline in Tough Times Appearing on Fox Business , Senator Lummis explained that Bitcoin offers Americans a safeguard against the erosion of the U.S. dollar. With inflation weighing down purchasing power, she positioned Bitcoin as a transparent, decentralized alternative that empowers individuals to regain control over their finances. The key appeal, she says, lies in Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, which contrasts with the unlimited printing of fiat currency. Lummis stressed that Bitcoin doesn’t rely on central banks or government control, making it attractive to those wary of traditional monetary policy. As inflation rises and uncertainty spreads, she believes more people will turn to Bitcoin as a form of financial shelter. Pushing Crypto Policy in Washington Lummis continues to lead crypto-friendly efforts in Congress. She’s actively advocating for legislation that supports the use of digital assets, including a proposed tax bill that removes double taxation on Bitcoin transactions and adds a de minimis exception for purchases under $300. Her broader ambition includes the BITCOIN Act, which would mandate the U.S. government to acquire up to 1 million BTC over five years. The upcoming White House crypto policy report, due July 30, is expected to reference her initiatives as progress toward establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Crypto Reaction At the time of her comments, Bitcoin was trading around $116,609, down 1.67% on the day, but showing strength in volume with over $104 billion traded in 24 hours, a sign that interest remains strong despite price fluctuations. For Lummis, this price action reflects growing institutional and global demand for Bitcoin as a resilient and borderless asset.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-26 05:21:06

PEPETO has kicked off 2025 in that fashion, boasting a strong presale and a buzzing community that cannot stop talking about it. Built on Ethereum with a focus on fast and low cost transactions, Pepeto presents itself as more than just a meme coin, with some supporters even suggesting it could echo the explosive rise of XRP. For anyone tracking meme coins, this frog is landing on the radar for all the right reasons. A Record Breaking Presale and Community Buzz The Pepeto presale has already shattered records. The team reports raising more than $7.7 million, moving about 5.9 billion tokens in the early rounds alone, and demand shows no sign of slowing. Now in last stage, each token is priced at 1 $Pepeto = $0.000000143 , and insiders hint that next stage with a much higher price is just around the corner. With the demo version of its exchange revealed, the atmosphere is full of hope and a touch of FOMO. As the Pepeto presale moves forward, excitement keeps growing. The staking reward of 246 percent APY is drawing in more participants and amplifying FOMO. The giveaway reflects that the team cares about building a strong community, not just gaining attention. This focus and the token’s upcoming launch on major exchanges point to Pepeto breaking past the meme coin bubble and seeing big price action. The Power of the Ethereum Based Layer 2 Blockchain What truly makes Pepeto stand out is that its viral appeal is backed by real utility. Built on Ethereum, the project delivers zero fee trading through PepetoSwap and smooth cross chain transfers via PepetoBridge , features that every crypto user values. Instead of relying only on memes, Pepeto combines real story related to Pepe, as rumours state that an ex founder of Pepe is behind PEPETO after beying betrayed, with lasting functionality, offering generous staking rewards of 246 percent APY and building a thriving community of over 85,000 active supporters. With its Swap tech becoming central to Ethereum’s growth, Pepeto is positioned to ride that wave and scale faster than many expected. With over $7.7 million raised in its presale and reliable and audited measures in place, this project shines brighter than meme tokens that do little more than run on hype. The Explosive Growth Potential Talk about a small coin making big noise, Pepeto is quickly becoming a name seen across trading desks and crypto news feeds. Many experts now suggest that its Top Tier 1 major exchange listings could send the price soaring, with some forecasting massive gains similar to past meme coin success stories. At its current presale price of just $0.000000143, the upside is hard to ignore. A $1,000 investment now could turn into nearly $87,000 if it simply reaches the current price of Pepe, showing just how big the growth window really is. Numbers like that put Pepeto in the same conversation as major platforms such as Solana and Cardano, which brought life changing returns during previous bull runs. For traders chasing serious upside, Pepeto could be one of the most exciting meme coin plays out there. Should it follow the classic meme coin trajectory, a rocket like surge may happen sooner than expected, with analysts hinting at even more potential heading into late 2025. Why Pepeto Looks Solid for 2025 and Beyond Meme coins are everywhere, but few bring real value to the table like Pepeto . Instead of relying only on hype, the team has rolled out PepetoSwap and PepetoBridge, giving users zero fee trading and seamless cross chain swaps, while offering one of the most generous staking rewards at 246 percent APY. On the trust front, Pepeto has already raised over $7.7 million in its presale and built a thriving community of more than 60,000 supporters, proving its strong investor confidence. PepetoSwap offers a zero fee trading platform optimized for meme coin enthusiasts, PepetoBridge enables seamless low cost cross chain transfers for enhanced interoperability, and its exchange will feature zero fee listings for only legitimate projects . This combination shows Pepeto is built for the long game, attracting investors who want both security and growth potential. Could $1,000 Turn Into $87,000? Big returns in crypto often start with small, early moves, and Pepeto could be one of those rare chances. If it simply matches Pepe’s current price of $0.00001253, early buyers could see huge gains. At today’s presale price of $0.000000143, a $1,000 investment gets you about 6.99 billion tokens. If those tokens reach Pepe’s current value, they would be worth nearly $87,000, a massive return for early participants. This potential upside is why Pepeto is grabbing so much attention in the crowded meme coin market. While many meme coins spike on hype alone, Pepeto combines viral appeal with lasting blockchain utility, setting it up for sustainable growth in the coming years. Pepeto: The Future Meme Coin Every bull run has its standout tokens, and Pepeto is making a strong case to be next. Its zero fee exchange, cross chain bridge, strong staking model, and zero tax policy make it stand out from the rest. With the presale advancing and a major exchange listing expected soon, this could be the last easy entry point before a major price move. A unique mix of meme culture, strong tech features, and growing adoption positions Pepeto as a top contender for big gains in 2025. If you are looking for the next breakout meme coin, Pepeto deserves a close watch. With its growing community, fresh tech, and plenty of room to rise, it could be one of the strongest players in the coming bull run.

BTC and XRP are no exception. Both dropped hard, driven to an extent by FUD from large sell-offs. Now, though, Santiment has outlined a big bullish sign. BTC, XRP to Reverse Trajectories? Remember Warren Buffett’s wisdom about investing – buy when others are fearful and sell when they are greedy? This narrative has been particularly impactful in the cryptocurrency market, where greed and fear often dominate investors’ thoughts. Santiment has also been a massive proponent of the thesis, and the company’s latest post highlights the recent changes in investors’ behavior. According to the overall social dominance, it determined that BTC and XRP have dropped out of the greed zone, even though both registered new all-time highs just last week and are currently trading close below them. This is mostly because BTC dumped from over $123,000 to under $115,000, while XRP slipped from $3.65 to just below $3. However, Santiment said markets tend to move in the opposite direction of what the crowd expects, which “actually makes BTC and XRP buy-low candidates.” While Bitcoin & XRP are seeing low greed levels, Ethereum’s +147% gains since early April still has traders bullish. Markets move the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations, which actually makes $BTC & $XRP buy-low candidates. Track it here: https://t.co/exVnDdgbK1 pic.twitter.com/AyheIjwngc — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 25, 2025 The same theory cannot be applied to ETH at the moment, though. The second-largest digital asset has soared by triple-digits from its April lows, and retail investors continue to be greedy, which might not be such a good sign for it. Galaxy Completes Sell-Off Perhaps driven by substantial sell-offs initiated by Galaxy Digital for a third party, BTC’s price slumped hard yesterday to a two-week low. However, Mike Novograz’s company announced late on Friday that it had successfully executed “one of the largest national bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto on behalf of a client.” “Galaxy completed the sale of more than 80,000 bitcoin—valued at over $9 billion based on current market prices—for a Satoshi-era investor, representing one of the earliest and most significant exits from the digital asset market.” With such a massive sell-off out of the picture and retail’s lack of greed for BTC, the asset could be primed for another leg up to and beyond its all-time high.

Whether you’re an experienced participant or exploring your options, finding the highest-ROI crypto comes down to real-world applications, active communities, and early access advantages. The current trend has moved beyond short-term hype. Traction, delivery, and timing now play a bigger role. With that in mind, here are four coins already showing signs of momentum: BlockDAG, XRP, SUI, and PI. Each one offers distinct strengths worth following. 1. BlockDAG: Developer Adoption & Pre-Launch Positioning BlockDAG uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture to enable parallel block creation, which helps increase speed and scalability. Unlike single-chain structures, this model allows for simultaneous block additions and better throughput. This approach not only improves performance but also supports decentralisation and broad usability in sectors like AI, fintech, and logistics. The protocol remains lightweight yet efficient, with active developer resources available now. Currently, over 4,500 developers are building on BlockDAG , contributing to more than 300 real-world applications. These include lending platforms, AI automation tools, and logistics systems. It’s not just conceptual, BlockDAG’s infrastructure is already delivering results in the field. The presale is in its 29th batch, offering BDAG coins at $0.0016 until GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. So far, 24.3 billion coins have been sold, raising $352 million. At the planned listing price of $0.05, that equates to a 3,025% return for current participants. With functioning tools and a growing development base, BlockDAG offers a clear entry point for those looking for the highest-ROI crypto before widespread exchange listings. 2. SUI: Scalable Architecture for Long-Term Growth SUI is a Layer‑1 blockchain created by Mysten Labs. Its architecture features sub-second finality and high scalability, using the Narwhal‑Tusk consensus to split transaction sequencing from execution. This separation enhances both speed and network security. There are currently 3.46 billion tokens in circulation, supporting a $13.65 billion market cap. With only a third of its total supply released, the project has room for significant expansion. SUI supports the Move programming language and continues to grow across DeFi, gaming, and NFT use cases. For developers and buyers alike, its advanced design and underutilised supply suggest it could become a strong contender for high returns. 3. XRP: Legal Developments & Expanding Utility XRP saw renewed interest following a U.S. court ruling in October 2024. The decision clarified that public trading of XRP is not considered a securities transaction, though Ripple’s institutional sales were flagged as unregistered. This provided confidence to financial institutions and market participants alike. Currently priced near $3, XRP’s market cap ranges between $176 billion and $178 billion. Ripple continues to focus on cross-border payments, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. With some forecasts suggesting a rise to $6–$15 by the end of 2025, XRP remains in the conversation for those seeking the highest-ROI crypto, thanks to its legal clarity and strong payment network integration. 4. PI: User Growth & Speculation Ahead of Mainnet Launch Pi Network has yet to launch its open mainnet, but it already has over 45 million mobile users mining daily. This enclosed structure has restricted trading, but anticipation for mainnet release remains high. Market watchers expect increased volatility and supply pressure once the network opens. Unofficial trading values have placed Pi above $40 billion in market cap, despite the lack of a confirmed listing price. The project’s future depends largely on how the launch is handled, success could drive major gains, while delays or issues could limit growth. For now, Pi remains on the radar for anyone monitoring the highest-ROI crypto category, even though it comes with notable uncertainty. High-Potential Coins Gaining Ground in 2025 Navigating the market with a focus on utility and delivery helps cut through the noise. XRP is gaining momentum from its legal resolution and use in global payments. SUI’s performance-first design and scalable system appeal to those building long-term. Pi remains speculative but carries major user volume. Then there’s BlockDAG, already showing results with more than 300 live projects, support from over 4,500 developers, and a pricing window that allows for a potential 3,025% ROI. It’s not just projecting growth, it’s already moving toward it. For those focused on the highest-ROI cryptos in 2025, these names deserve attention, with BlockDAG leading the charge through active deployment and strong fundamentals.

In a major development, seven new ETF filings tied to these top digital assets have hit the SEC, signaling a potential $4 trillion surge in institutional investment. This wave of ETF interest highlights growing confidence in blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi). As traditional finance giants double down, investors are watching closely. This could mark a turning point for mainstream crypto adoption, with rising stars like MAGACOIN FINANCE also entering the spotlight. Bitcoin: Breaking New Records and Gaining Institutional Momentum Bitcoin is currently in the midst of one of its most spectacular bull runs to date. In July 2025, the king of cryptocurrencies reached a new all-time high of $123,218, signaling an extraordinary surge fueled by institutional demand, favorable legislation, and rising inflation concerns. The U.S. Congress is making strides with crypto-friendly bills, boosting investor confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term future. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act and the GENIUS Act are examples of legislation that promote transparency and regulatory certainty for the industry. Bitcoin is now viewed as a safe-haven asset alongside gold, which is attracting a wave of investors looking to hedge against economic uncertainty. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next Big Opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE is at the forefront of this crypto revolution, combining cutting-edge technology with a strong vision for the future of decentralized finance. Analysts are already projecting up to 50x return upon listing on major exchanges. Investors Bet Big on Uniswap and Avalanche Uniswap, the dominant decentralized exchange (DEX), continues to break records. The platform recently surpassed $3 trillion in total transaction volume and now processes around $3.3 billion daily. With over 23% market share among DEXs, Uniswap remains a top choice for decentralized trading, outpacing competitors like PancakeSwap. On the other hand, Avalanche (AVAX) has witnessed explosive growth, with its price jumping 30% in the last month alone. This growth comes as Avalanche attracts increasing institutional interest and continues to evolve its ecosystem. With a market cap of $10.4 billion and a solid position in the top 20 cryptocurrencies, Avalanche is poised to continue its upward trajectory, making it one of the most promising Layer-1 blockchains. 7 New Crypto ETF Filings: A Game Changer for Investors In July 2025, the crypto ETF landscape witnessed a surge of filings that could reshape the future of altcoins. These filings include major assets like XRP , Solana , Litecoin , Dogecoin , Avalanche , and others. These filings mark an institutional recognition of altcoins, creating a bullish hope of a $4 trillion surge in the coming months. As Bitcoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche continue to redefine traditional finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is your ticket to capitalize on the rising tide of cryptocurrency adoption. Conclusion The recent wave of ETF filings featuring Bitcoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche highlights growing Wall Street interest in crypto. As seven new funds emerge, these moves could unlock a $4 trillion market surge, signaling greater mainstream adoption and positioning digital assets as key players in global finance. MAGACOIN FINANCE is primed to take advantage of this evolving landscape. With previous selling out faster, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors a unique opportunity to participate in the next wave of innovation.

On July 25, these innovative investment vehicles recorded a staggering total net inflow of $452.83 million, extending an impressive streak of positive flows to 16 consecutive trading days. This sustained momentum signals a growing confidence in Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class within traditional finance, painting a bullish picture for the digital asset landscape and marking a truly historic run for the burgeoning sector. The Unstoppable Surge: Decoding the $452.83M Influx into Spot Ethereum ETFs The latest figures, as reported by crypto analyst Trader T on X, underscore a profound shift in how institutional investors are engaging with the digital asset space. The $452.83 million in net inflows on July 25 is not just a number; it represents the culmination of more than two weeks of consistent capital injection, reflecting a robust and sustained appetite for Ethereum exposure through regulated investment products. This remarkable 16-day streak of positive flows indicates a deep and growing conviction among major financial players regarding Ethereum’s long-term potential. Breaking down the inflows reveals key players leading the charge: ETF Ticker Net Inflow/Outflow (July 25) BlackRock’s ETHA +$440.20 million Grayscale’s Mini ETH +$18.87 million Bitwise’s ETHW +$9.95 million Fidelity’s FETH +$7.30 million Grayscale’s ETHE -$23.49 million Other Spot Ethereum ETFs No Change BlackRock’s ETHA product stands out with an overwhelming $440.20 million in inflows, demonstrating the financial giant’s significant influence and investor trust. This dominance by BlackRock is a powerful indicator of where institutional capital is congregating. While Grayscale’s ETHE recorded an outflow of $23.49 million, it’s important to view this in context. ETHE, being an older trust, often sees outflows as investors rotate into newer, potentially more efficient, and often lower-fee spot Ethereum ETFs , including Grayscale’s own Mini ETH. This suggests a shift in investment vehicles rather than a divestment from Ethereum itself. Why Are Major Institutions and Investors Embracing Spot Ethereum ETFs ? The consistent influx of capital into spot Ethereum ETFs is not merely a fleeting trend; it’s a reflection of several compelling advantages these products offer to a diverse range of investors, particularly large institutions. The reasons behind this growing embrace are multifaceted: Regulatory Clarity and Trust: The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by regulatory bodies like the SEC provides a crucial stamp of legitimacy. This official endorsement significantly reduces the perceived risk for traditional financial institutions and cautious investors who have historically shied away from the less regulated direct crypto markets. It builds a bridge of trust between the nascent crypto world and the established financial system. Ease of Access and Familiarity: For many institutional investors, direct engagement with cryptocurrencies involves navigating complex custody solutions, managing private keys, and understanding blockchain technology. Spot Ethereum ETFs eliminate these hurdles. They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum through familiar, regulated brokerage accounts, integrating seamlessly into existing investment frameworks. This simplicity democratizes access to crypto assets for a broader investor base. Enhanced Liquidity and Efficiency: ETFs are designed for liquidity, allowing large blocks of shares to be traded efficiently throughout the day. This is a significant advantage for institutions managing substantial capital, enabling them to enter and exit positions with greater ease and lower transaction costs compared to direct purchases on crypto exchanges. The efficiency offered by ETFs makes them a preferred vehicle for large-scale investment. Professional Management and Oversight: Investing in a spot Ethereum ETF means benefiting from professional management, custody solutions, and regulatory oversight. Fund managers handle the complexities of holding the underlying Ethereum, including security, storage, and compliance. This professional layer of management provides peace of mind and reduces operational burdens for investors. Validation of Ethereum as an Asset Class: The sustained institutional interest and significant inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs serve as a powerful validation of Ethereum’s status as a legitimate and valuable asset class. It signals that Ethereum, beyond being a technological platform, is increasingly recognized as a store of value and an investable asset within mainstream finance. This validation can attract even more capital and foster further innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. Navigating the Landscape: Key Players and Their Impact on Spot Ethereum ETFs The current landscape of spot Ethereum ETFs is characterized by intense competition and strategic positioning among major financial players. BlackRock’s dominant share of inflows, particularly with its ETHA product, is a testament to its market power and investor confidence in its offerings. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock’s foray into the crypto ETF space lends immense credibility and attracts significant capital, often setting the pace for the entire market. Grayscale’s strategy, with its existing ETHE trust and the newer Mini ETH, offers an interesting dynamic. The outflows from ETHE are largely anticipated, as it transitions from a closed-end trust with often volatile premiums/discounts to a more liquid and efficient ETF structure. Investors are likely converting their ETHE shares into Mini ETH or other competing spot Ethereum ETFs to benefit from improved liquidity and potentially lower fees. This internal rotation within Grayscale, alongside competition from new entrants, underscores the evolving maturity of the crypto investment product market. Firms like Bitwise and Fidelity, while not matching BlackRock’s volume on this particular day, are also significant contributors to the overall positive flow. Their participation ensures a diverse and competitive market, which ultimately benefits investors through innovation and potentially lower expense ratios. The collective performance of these firms highlights a broad-based institutional acceptance of Ethereum as a core component of a diversified investment portfolio. Looking Beyond the Horizon: What’s Next for Spot Ethereum ETFs and the Market? The sustained success of spot Ethereum ETFs carries profound implications for the future of both the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. As these investment vehicles continue to attract substantial capital, several key developments are likely to unfold: Continued Price Impact: While ETF inflows don’t directly correlate with immediate price surges, sustained buying pressure from large institutional funds can contribute to a more stable and upward trajectory for Ethereum’s price over the long term. This steady demand helps absorb selling pressure and reduces overall market volatility. Deepening Market Liquidity: The presence of large institutional players through ETFs significantly deepens the liquidity of the Ethereum market. This makes it easier for both large and small investors to trade ETH without causing significant price dislocations, contributing to a healthier and more efficient market. Mainstream Adoption Acceleration: The success of spot Ethereum ETFs will likely accelerate the mainstream adoption of Ethereum. As more traditional investors gain exposure, it increases awareness and understanding of Ethereum’s technological capabilities and its role in the decentralized economy, potentially leading to further integration into various industries. Innovation in Crypto Investment Products: The competitive landscape fostered by these ETFs could spur further innovation in crypto investment products. We might see the emergence of new types of Ethereum-related ETFs, such as those focusing on staking yield, or even more complex derivatives that cater to sophisticated investor strategies. Regulatory Precedent for Other Altcoins: The regulatory approval and subsequent success of spot Ethereum ETFs could set a crucial precedent for other prominent altcoins. This might pave the way for ETFs tracking other major cryptocurrencies, further broadening the accessibility of the digital asset market to traditional finance. The journey of spot Ethereum ETFs is just beginning, but the initial data points towards a future where digital assets are increasingly interwoven with the fabric of global finance. This ongoing integration is a testament to the enduring innovation and value proposition of the blockchain ecosystem. Actionable Insights: How Can Investors Leverage the Rise of Spot Ethereum ETFs ? For both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors looking to enter the digital asset space, the emergence and success of spot Ethereum ETFs present several actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: While ETFs offer convenience, it’s crucial to understand the specifics of each offering. Research the expense ratios, the underlying custody solutions, and the fund’s specific objectives. Not all ETFs are created equal, and understanding these nuances can impact your long-term returns. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Even though ETFs are regulated, the underlying asset, Ethereum, remains a volatile cryptocurrency. Assess your personal risk tolerance before allocating capital to these products. They should be considered part of a diversified portfolio, not its entirety. Stay Informed on Market Dynamics: Keep a close eye on inflow and outflow data, as well as broader market sentiment. While short-term fluctuations are common, sustained trends in ETF flows can provide valuable insights into institutional interest and potential market direction. Consider Long-Term Growth: The approval and success of spot Ethereum ETFs are significant milestones for the long-term maturation of the crypto market. For many, these products offer a way to participate in Ethereum’s growth story without the complexities of direct ownership. Focus on the long-term adoption narrative rather than daily price movements. Consult a Financial Advisor: For complex investment decisions, especially involving emerging asset classes, consulting a qualified financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial goals and risk profile. The consistent positive flows into spot Ethereum ETFs on July 25, marking an impressive 16-day streak, represent a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. This sustained institutional interest, spearheaded by major players like BlackRock, underscores a growing confidence in Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class. It signifies not just a passing trend but a deepening integration of digital assets into the traditional financial system, paving the way for a more accessible and mature crypto investment landscape. The future looks exceptionally bright for Ethereum and its burgeoning ecosystem of investment products. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a spot Ethereum ETF ? A spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product that directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of ETH without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Shares of the ETF can be bought and sold on traditional stock exchanges, much like shares of a company. 2. Why are spot Ethereum ETFs important for the crypto market? Spot Ethereum ETFs are crucial because they bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market. They offer institutional investors and retail investors alike a regulated, accessible, and familiar way to invest in Ethereum. Their approval and success signal increased institutional adoption, enhanced market liquidity, and a greater level of legitimacy for Ethereum as an investable asset, contributing to the overall maturation of the crypto space. 3. Which firms are leading the inflows for spot Ethereum ETFs ? As of July 25, BlackRock’s ETHA product has been the dominant leader, attracting the vast majority of the net inflows. Other significant contributors include Grayscale’s Mini ETH, Bitwise’s ETHW, and Fidelity’s FETH, all of whom are seeing positive capital inflows, indicating broad interest across multiple issuers. 4. What is the significance of 16 consecutive days of positive inflows? A streak of 16 consecutive days of positive inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs is highly significant. It demonstrates sustained, rather than sporadic, institutional demand and confidence in Ethereum. This consistent buying pressure suggests a deeper conviction among investors and indicates that the initial excitement following ETF approvals is translating into long-term capital allocation, reinforcing market stability and growth potential. 5. How do spot Ethereum ETFs differ from futures Ethereum ETFs? The key difference lies in the underlying asset. Spot Ethereum ETFs directly hold actual Ethereum, meaning their performance is directly tied to the current market price of ETH. Futures Ethereum ETFs, on the other hand, hold Ethereum futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell ETH at a predetermined price on a future date. Futures ETFs can be subject to ‘contango’ or ‘backwardation’ effects, which can cause their performance to deviate from the spot price of Ethereum. 6. Will these inflows directly impact Ethereum’s price? While substantial inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs create demand for the underlying asset, their direct and immediate impact on Ethereum’s price can be complex and influenced by many other market factors. However, sustained and significant inflows over time can contribute to increased buying pressure, improved liquidity, and a generally more positive market sentiment, which can support Ethereum’s price trajectory in the long run.

This price jump stands out sharply against the backdrop of many large-cap cryptocurrencies lingering in sideways trading patterns. While giants like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) seem to consolidate without much upward momentum, investors are turning their attention to projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that combine innovative technology with strong tokenomics and community backing. MUTM’s current momentum is just the beginning of what is shaping up to be a breakout journey fueled by unique utility and a robust roadmap. A Deep Dive into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Utility and Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be more than just a token; it will be a comprehensive decentralized platform that revolves around a stablecoin system maintained with precision and transparency. The stablecoin will be minted exclusively by approved issuers who deposit overcollateralized Ethereum (ETH), ensuring the value remains secure and stable. This mechanism will rely on governance-set interest rates and an efficient arbitrage system that will keep the stablecoin firmly pegged to $1. On top of this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce mtTokens, which will act as on-chain deposit receipts. These tokens will automatically accrue interest in real time, giving holders a seamless way to earn passive income simply by holding their deposits. The innovation won’t stop there. The dual lending models in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P), will cater to a wide range of investors and borrowers. For example, a lender depositing 5,000 USDT into the system will receive 5,000mtUSDT, earning a steady 12% APY (depending on pool utilization), translating to $600 annually. These mtTokens will then be stakable in secure smart contracts that will distribute MUTM dividends funded by open market buybacks—creating a powerful feedback loop that will reward long-term participants. On the other side, P2P lending will offer bespoke loan agreements with flexible terms and higher yields, such as a 60-day loan funded in the volatile PEPE token at an impressive 34% APR, all while isolating risk away from the core platform. Presale Momentum and a Clear Path Forward Currently, Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is underway, priced at $0.035 per token. With only 5% of this phase sold, approximately $13.60 million has been raised out of the 4 billion total token supply. The community has rapidly grown to over 14,400 holders, signaling strong and expanding buy pressure. The upcoming Phase 7 will see the price increase by 15% to $0.040, encouraging early investors to seize the remaining allocation before this jump. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s commitment to security and transparency is further solidified by its rigorous CertiK audit, which has awarded the project a high Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 78.00. This institutional-grade evaluation ensures that Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts are robust and that the ecosystem is well-protected. Alongside this, a $50,000 bug bounty incentivizes developers and white hat hackers to maintain the platform’s security, while a $100,000 giveaway spreads excitement and rewards early believers—building a loyal community ready to support Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s growth. A Convincing Investment Opportunity with Real Returns One of the most compelling reasons to consider Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now is the tangible example of early investors’ success. A participant who swapped $3,000 worth of Solana (SOL) at the initial $0.01 price point holds 300,000 MUTM tokens. With the current price at $0.035, this position is already worth $10,500 — a 3.5× return. The token’s listing price is set to double to $0.06, lifting that holding to $18,000. Post-launch growth to $0.30 is forecasted, which would multiply this investment 30X to $90,000. What’s fueling this explosive trajectory? Beyond the powerful use case in P2P and P2C lending, the projected launch of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s beta platform will trigger a surge in user activity — directly accelerating token demand. With Phase 6 already 05% sold out, this is the final window to secure MUTM at $0.035 before a 15% price hike takes effect in Phase 7.

It aims to become the first publicly traded U.S. Healthcare company to hold XRP as part of its financial reserves. Earlier in May, the company had secured a $50 million Equity Line of Credit (ELOC) from LDA Capital to support its XRP adoption plans. Wellgistics plans to issue debt securities or raise capital in other ways to gradually expand its XRP holdings. Beyond Treasury, Is This Real Business Utility? It also plans to integrate blockchain-based payment systems by leveraging the XRPL. A key part of this strategy is using XRP as collateral for loans to improve the company’s financial stability. Attorney Bill Morgan notes that Wellgistics Health’s recent SEC filing is not just about holding XRP as a treasury reserve. The company’s plan reveals a multi-dimensional strategy that puts XRP to serious use in its business operations. It plans to use XRP for real-time payments with pharmacies and vendors via the XRPL, showing true business utility. It will also raise capital to buy more XRP, use it as collateral in deals, and even generate income from its holdings. However, Wellgistics’ plan to use XRP has people asking if it’s a real strategy or just a way to get investor attention. Some are asking why a healthcare company like Wellgistics would use XRP, often called the “bankers coin.” Bill Morgan responded, saying it’s exactly the right question to ask. Flipping the XRP Narrative Marc Fagel, a former SEC official, also joined in and pointed out that Wellgistics has low revenue, net losses, few assets, and even a “going concern” warning from its auditor. That raises doubts that could this be more about attracting investors than a real business plan? While Morgan admits that this is possible, he also sees it as part of a bigger trend. Other firms like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Meitu have already used crypto, mainly Bitcoin, for treasury. One user raised a question if Wellgistics chose XRP expecting it to outperform cash like Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy, or is it about using XRP for liquidity in a new payment system. Morgan said that it may likely be both. It potentially challenges the no utility narrative for XRP if the company carries through the strategy revealed in the form S-1, especially in respect of using XRP for payments in its supply and customer lines and is not just using XRP treasury promises as an enticement to raise… https://t.co/Oo6eMaFdib — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) July 26, 2025 The company’s filing may have just flipped the script on the “XRP has no utility” narrative. Morgan made a solid point that the real value will show if Wellgistics actually uses XRP for payments with suppliers and customers. But if it’s just about using XRP as a buzzword to raise capital, then the utility argument falls flat.ac",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TREASURY|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-26 05:51:56

This isn’t just about a company holding cash; it’s about a pioneering firm embracing the future of finance by integrating substantial Bitcoin holdings into its balance sheet. This announcement isn’t merely a headline; it’s a testament to a growing trend of corporate entities recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and a strategic reserve asset. What does this mean for Volcon, for Bitcoin, and for the broader corporate world? Volcon’s Audacious Bet: Unpacking Their Bitcoin Holdings On July 25, Volcon made headlines with a press release on Business Wire, confirming that the company now holds an impressive 3,183.37 BTC, valued at approximately $375 million at the time of the announcement. This isn’t a speculative, short-term play; it’s a calculated long-term investment. The company revealed that these Bitcoin holdings were acquired at an average purchase price of $117,697 per BTC, showcasing a deep conviction in the digital asset’s future trajectory. This substantial investment signals Volcon’s confidence in Bitcoin as more than just a volatile digital currency. It positions Bitcoin as a foundational element of their treasury strategy, aiming to preserve and potentially grow capital in an ever-evolving economic landscape. Such a move by a manufacturing company, especially one in the emerging electric vehicle sector, highlights a significant shift in corporate financial thinking. A Strategic Treasury: How Volcon is Optimizing its Bitcoin Holdings Volcon’s approach to its Bitcoin holdings goes beyond simple accumulation. The company has implemented a sophisticated strategy that includes selling short-term put options. This isn’t a common move for corporate treasury management, and it speaks volumes about their innovative financial foresight. But what exactly does this entail? Earning Premium Income: By selling put options with strike prices between $115,000 and $117,000, Volcon earns premium income. This provides an immediate financial benefit, adding to their overall treasury reserves. Potential for Lower Acquisition Costs: If the price of Bitcoin drops below these strike prices before the options expire, Volcon is obligated to buy more BTC at those pre-agreed lower prices. This mechanism allows them to potentially increase their Bitcoin holdings at a more favorable cost basis, effectively buying the dip. Active Management: This strategy demonstrates an active, rather than passive, management of their digital assets. It’s a nuanced approach that seeks to maximize returns and acquisition opportunities within the volatile crypto market, while also generating additional revenue. Co-CEO Ryan Lane emphasized the firm’s conviction in BTC as a long-term store of value and a key treasury reserve asset. This statement resonates with a growing number of corporate leaders who view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a superior alternative to traditional fiat currencies, which are subject to devaluation. Why Are Companies Like Volcon Embracing Bitcoin? Volcon isn’t alone in its conviction. The past few years have seen a notable shift, with more and more publicly traded companies, from tech giants to traditional corporations, allocating a portion of their treasury to Bitcoin. But what drives this seemingly unconventional decision? The motivations are multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly seen as a robust hedge against currency debasement. Long-Term Store of Value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and global accessibility make it an ideal long-term store of value, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving purchasing power over time. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets beyond traditional cash, bonds, and equities, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Companies embracing Bitcoin often project an image of being innovative, tech-savvy, and forward-thinking, which can attract a new generation of investors and talent. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term appreciation, offering the potential for substantial capital gains for companies holding it. Volcon’s move adds another significant data point to this emerging trend, signaling that corporate Bitcoin holdings are becoming a more mainstream consideration rather than an outlier strategy. The Broader Impact: What Do Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Mean for the Market? The accumulation of Bitcoin by public companies like Volcon has several profound implications for the cryptocurrency market and the broader financial landscape: Institutional Validation: Each corporate adoption adds a layer of legitimacy and institutional validation to Bitcoin, helping to dispel lingering doubts about its viability as a serious financial asset. Reduced Circulating Supply: As more companies hold Bitcoin in their treasuries, the amount of BTC available on exchanges for trading decreases. This can contribute to a supply shock, potentially driving up prices if demand remains constant or increases. Increased Stability (Long-Term): While Bitcoin remains volatile, a growing base of long-term corporate holders could contribute to greater price stability over time, as these entities are less likely to engage in short-term trading. Precedent for Others: Successful corporate treasury strategies involving Bitcoin can serve as a blueprint and encouragement for other companies considering similar moves, accelerating the pace of adoption. Enhanced Market Infrastructure: The demand from corporations often spurs the development of more robust and secure custody solutions, regulatory frameworks, and financial products tailored to institutional needs. Volcon’s decision, particularly with its sophisticated put option strategy, demonstrates a deeper understanding and commitment to integrating digital assets into traditional finance. It’s not just buying; it’s actively managing a new asset class. Navigating the Future: Considerations for Corporate Crypto Adoption While the benefits of corporate Bitcoin holdings are compelling, companies considering this path must also be mindful of the challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, leading to significant fluctuations in the value of a company’s treasury assets. This requires a strong conviction and a long-term outlook. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential compliance and legal challenges. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require Bitcoin to be treated as an intangible asset, which can lead to impairment charges if its value drops, even if the company doesn’t sell it. Security Risks: Custody and security of large Bitcoin holdings are paramount. Companies must implement robust security measures to protect against hacks or loss. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, some stakeholders might still view crypto investments with skepticism, requiring clear communication from the company. Volcon’s transparency about its acquisition strategy and conviction helps address some of these concerns, providing a model for others. A Lasting Impression: Volcon’s Vision for its Bitcoin Holdings Volcon’s announcement of its substantial Bitcoin holdings is more than just a financial disclosure; it’s a powerful statement about the future of corporate finance and the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. By integrating Bitcoin as a core treasury reserve, Volcon is not only seeking to fortify its balance sheet against economic uncertainties but also positioning itself at the forefront of financial innovation. The strategic use of put options further underscores their sophisticated approach, aiming to both generate income and acquire more Bitcoin opportunistically. This move solidifies the narrative that Bitcoin is evolving beyond a speculative asset to a legitimate, long-term store of value for forward-thinking corporations. As the world continues to digitalize, Volcon’s bold step serves as a compelling case study for how companies can strategically embrace the digital economy’s most revolutionary asset.

On July 25, these innovative investment vehicles collectively recorded a substantial $129.37 million in net inflows, marking the second consecutive trading day of positive flows. This consistent influx of capital underscores a growing confidence among investors, both institutional and retail, in Bitcoin as a legitimate and accessible asset class. What does this sustained positive momentum mean for the broader cryptocurrency market, and what factors are driving this remarkable surge? The Resounding Success: A Detailed Look at July 25th’s U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows The latest figures, as shared by market observer Trader T on X, paint a clear picture of robust investor interest in U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Leading the charge was BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted a remarkable $91.50 million in inflows. This performance highlights IBIT’s dominant position and its appeal to a wide range of investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin. Following BlackRock, ARK Invest’s ARKB demonstrated strong demand with $30.27 million in inflows, further solidifying its presence in the competitive ETF landscape. Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL also saw significant capital injections, with $20.96 million and $18.16 million, respectively. Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s Mini BTC, a newer entrant, contributed positively with $10.19 million and $8.79 million in inflows, showcasing diversified interest across various fund providers. However, the day wasn’t without its contrasts. Grayscale’s GBTC, a converted trust, recorded an outflow of $50.50 million. This outflow is largely anticipated and understood within the market, as some investors opt to move from the higher-fee trust structure to newer, often lower-fee, spot ETFs. The remaining U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating a stable, albeit not actively trading, segment of the market. Daily Net Inflows/Outflows for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs (July 25) ETF Ticker Provider Net Inflows/Outflows (Millions USD) IBIT BlackRock +91.50 ARKB ARK Invest +30.27 BITB Bitwise +20.96 HODL VanEck +18.16 FBTC Fidelity +10.19 Mini BTC Grayscale +8.79 GBTC Grayscale -50.50 Others Various 0.00 Total Net Inflows +129.37 Why Do These U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Matter So Much? The consistent positive net inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are far more than just daily financial statistics; they represent a pivotal shift in how Bitcoin is perceived and accessed by mainstream finance. Here’s why these inflows are so significant: Institutional Validation: The participation of major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity lends immense credibility to Bitcoin. Their ability to attract significant capital indicates that large institutions are increasingly comfortable allocating funds to the cryptocurrency space, viewing it as a viable long-term investment. Increased Accessibility: ETFs provide a regulated, familiar, and easy-to-access investment vehicle for traditional investors. They eliminate the complexities of direct Bitcoin ownership, such as setting up digital wallets or managing private keys, thereby broadening the investor base. Market Liquidity and Stability: Consistent inflows contribute to greater liquidity in the Bitcoin market. As more capital flows in, it can potentially reduce price volatility and create a more stable trading environment, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for risk-averse investors. Supply Shock Dynamics: When ETFs accumulate Bitcoin, they effectively remove a portion of the circulating supply from the open market. If demand from ETFs continues to outpace new supply (especially after halving events), it could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Positive Sentiment Indicator: Two consecutive days of net inflows, especially after periods of mixed performance, serve as a strong positive sentiment indicator. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the underlying belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition remains robust. Navigating the Landscape: Key Players in the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Arena The competition among providers of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs is intense, with each fund vying for market share. Understanding the dynamics of these key players provides valuable insight into the evolving investment landscape. BlackRock’s IBIT Dominance: BlackRock, with its immense global reach and reputation, has quickly established IBIT as a frontrunner. Its substantial inflows reflect investor trust in the firm’s management capabilities and its ability to seamlessly integrate digital assets into traditional portfolios. IBIT’s performance often sets the tone for the overall market sentiment regarding these ETFs. ARK Invest’s Strategic Position: ARK Invest, known for its focus on disruptive innovation, has also carved out a significant niche with ARKB. Its consistent inflows suggest that investors align with ARK’s forward-thinking investment philosophy and its belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. The Grayscale GBTC Anomaly: Grayscale’s GBTC often stands out due to its outflows. It’s crucial to understand that GBTC was originally a trust, not an ETF, and was converted into a spot ETF. Many early investors were locked into this trust structure with a premium or discount to Bitcoin’s spot price. Now, with the conversion, these investors have the opportunity to redeem their shares or switch to lower-fee alternatives, leading to outflows. These outflows are generally seen as a one-time structural adjustment rather than a negative sentiment towards Bitcoin itself. Grayscale’s introduction of the Mini BTC ETF is a strategic move to recapture some of this market share with a more competitive offering. Fidelity, Bitwise, and VanEck: These providers consistently demonstrate solid performance, attracting a steady stream of capital. Their success indicates a diversified demand across various investment preferences and underscores the broad appeal of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs . The diversity in performance among these ETFs reflects different investor strategies, fee structures, and brand loyalties, all contributing to a dynamic and maturing market for Bitcoin investments. What’s Fueling the Demand for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The sustained demand for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs isn’t a random occurrence; it’s driven by a confluence of powerful factors shaping both the cryptocurrency market and the broader global economy. Understanding these drivers is key to anticipating future trends. Bitcoin Halving Anticipation: The Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering circulation, historically precedes significant price rallies. Investors often front-run this event, accumulating Bitcoin through ETFs in anticipation of future price appreciation due to supply scarcity. Macroeconomic Hedging: In an environment marked by inflation concerns and geopolitical uncertainties, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against traditional financial instability. Its decentralized nature and finite supply appeal to investors looking for alternative stores of value. Regulatory Clarity and Acceptance: The approval of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was a monumental step, signaling a greater level of regulatory acceptance. This clarity reduces perceived risk for institutional investors who operate under strict compliance frameworks. As regulations evolve globally, it further legitimizes crypto assets. Growing Investor Education and Awareness: As Bitcoin gains more media coverage and becomes a topic of mainstream financial discussions, more investors are becoming educated about its fundamentals and potential. This increased awareness naturally translates into higher demand for accessible investment products like ETFs. Portfolio Diversification: Financial advisors and institutions are increasingly recommending Bitcoin as a tool for portfolio diversification. Its low correlation with traditional assets can potentially enhance overall portfolio returns and reduce risk during market downturns in other sectors. Challenges and Opportunities: The Road Ahead for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs While the recent inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs paint an optimistic picture, the path forward is not without its challenges and exciting opportunities. Investors and market participants should remain aware of these dynamics. Potential Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin, despite its growing maturity, remains a volatile asset. ETF prices will directly reflect Bitcoin’s price swings, meaning investors must be prepared for potential drawdowns. Regulatory Shifts: While recent approvals are positive, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Future policy changes, both in the U.S. and globally, could impact the operations and appeal of these ETFs. Competition: The market for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs is becoming increasingly crowded. Intense competition could lead to fee wars, potentially impacting the profitability of providers and the long-term sustainability of some funds. Global Economic Headwinds: Broader macroeconomic factors, such as interest rate hikes, recessions, or geopolitical conflicts, could dampen investor appetite for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Exciting Opportunities: Further Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions become comfortable with Bitcoin, the potential for even larger capital inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs remains significant. Pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds could be the next wave of adopters. Product Innovation: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for other cryptocurrency-backed ETFs, such as Ethereum ETFs, offering investors diversified exposure to the broader digital asset market. Enhanced Market Infrastructure: The growth of ETFs necessitates robust market infrastructure, including custody solutions, trading platforms, and data analytics, which in turn strengthens the overall crypto ecosystem. Price Discovery and Efficiency: As ETFs become more deeply integrated into traditional finance, they can contribute to more efficient price discovery for Bitcoin, potentially reducing arbitrage opportunities and increasing market transparency. For investors, these insights underscore the importance of due diligence and a long-term perspective. While the allure of quick gains is strong, understanding the underlying drivers and potential hurdles is crucial for making informed investment decisions in the realm of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Conclusion The continued positive net inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , highlighted by the impressive $129.37 million surge on July 25, signal a profound and ongoing shift in the financial landscape. These figures are not merely transient data points but rather strong indicators of growing institutional confidence, enhanced market accessibility, and Bitcoin’s increasing legitimization as a mainstream investment asset. As these ETFs mature and attract more capital, they are set to play an even more pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. The journey of Bitcoin’s integration into global investment portfolios is well underway, promising exciting developments for the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF? A U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that holds actual Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin futures ETFs, which track futures contracts, a spot ETF directly holds Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without having to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are net inflows important for Bitcoin ETFs? Net inflows indicate that more money is entering the ETF than leaving it. For U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , sustained net inflows mean that the fund is buying more Bitcoin to back new shares, which can contribute to increased demand for Bitcoin in the market. This positive flow suggests growing investor confidence and potential upward price pressure on Bitcoin. Why did Grayscale’s GBTC experience outflows? Grayscale’s GBTC was originally a trust that traded at a premium or discount to Bitcoin’s net asset value. Upon its conversion to a spot ETF, many investors who were previously locked into the trust, or who paid higher fees, took the opportunity to redeem their shares or transfer their investments to newer, often lower-fee, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs . These outflows are largely a structural adjustment rather than a negative sentiment towards Bitcoin itself. How do U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs impact the price of Bitcoin? U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs can impact Bitcoin’s price by increasing demand. When investors buy shares of a spot ETF, the ETF provider must purchase an equivalent amount of Bitcoin to hold in reserve. This direct buying pressure can contribute to price appreciation, especially if inflows are substantial and sustained. They also make Bitcoin more accessible, potentially bringing in a wider range of investors. What are the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin ETFs? Investing in U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs carries several risks, primarily due to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. The value of the ETF shares will fluctuate directly with Bitcoin’s price, which can be subject to rapid and significant swings. Other risks include regulatory changes, cybersecurity concerns (though managed by the ETF provider), and market liquidity issues, though the latter is mitigated by the ETF structure itself.

With the US Securities and Exchange Commission working on a fast-track approach for ETFs approval, a fresh wave of excitement has hit the markets. Major names like Solana, Aptos, and Chainlink are expected beneficiaries of the fast-track approach. However, the expected regulatory clarity has opened pathways for one community-powered token, MAGACOIN FINANCE, to build momentum. Solana’s high chance of ETF Approval drives performance Solana is at the center stage of the next wave of spot crypto ETF approval as the SEC urges issuers to amend and refile spot ETF applications before the end of July 2025. The move has signaled possible approval well ahead of the official October deadline, with odds soaring to 95% this cycle. With that, the token has seen a surge in price, pushed forward by the new regulatory climate. Although questions remain about the demand for SOL products, the performance of futures-based SOL products already trading suggests investors’ appetite for mainstream access to Solana. Aptos Eyes Institutional Entry Aptos could soon make history with Bitwise, which is already filing the first-ever spot ETF for this Layer-1 network. The filing alone triggered a powerful rally, revealing pent-up investor appetite. While it is still in its early stages, SEC greenlighting Aptos ETF looks inevitable as the regulator seeks clarity in the ETF approval process. SEC regulatory approach a clear path for MAGACOIN FINANCE 21x rally While established tokens such as SOL, APTOS, and LINK are already seeing gains due to the SEC regulatory shift, newcomers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE might be primed for the biggest win. MAGACOIN’s unique positioning as a politically charged, fully decentralized memecoin separates it from the legacy projects now racing for ETF approval. The token is already thriving on grassroots adoption, but the end of the SEC’s red tape could be its biggest catalyst. Chainlink offering Standards Leadership and Regulatory Integration Meanwhile, Chainlink is playing an even more interesting role. With Chainlink Labs collaborating with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force to write the playbook for tokenized asset trading, the project looks set to become an integral part of the real-world assets (RWA) ecosystem. A new SEC guidance issued in May 2025 already recognizes public blockchains for regulated services, with Chainlink’s technology at the core of these changes. LINK’s regulatory alignment has sparked optimism across both retail and institutional spheres. Conclusion The SEC’s fast-track approach for ETFs is great news for the industry, opening doors for major altcoins such as Solana, Aptos, and Chainlink to get mainstream adoption finally. However, emerging projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE look set to fly on the momentum, giving investors seeking the next major breakout a shot at triple or even quadruple-digit returns.

This is evidenced by the large buys that have dominated ETH as Ethereum treasury companies become a major player in the space. Amid this, billionaire and CEO of Galaxy Digital Investments, Mike Novogratz, has revealed the important level for Ethereum to beat to enter price discovery. Ethereum Price Needs To Cross $4,000 În an interview with SquawkBox, Novogratz points to the recent strength of Ethereum amid rapid accumulation as a reason for it being a better bet than Bitcoin. The major reason outlined for why ETH was a better bet than BTC at this point is the fact that Ethereum treasury companies are now becoming a staple, with two ETH treasury companies, such as SharpLink and GameSquare Holdings, among others, already established and more on the way. Related Reading: XRP Price Showing Quiet Strength As Next Breakout Level Lies At $4.65 As these companies continue to accumulate ETH, the billionaire explains that with not much supply, the Ethereum price is likely to rise. He also brings up the fact that Ethereum has a very powerful narrative, and the market reaching record short levels has also aided its bullishness. Given these, Novogratz explained that the Ethereum price is at least destined to knock on the $4,000 level a few times. Also, once the altcoin is able to take out $4,000, then the billionaire believes that the ETH price will enter into price discovery, which could drive it higher. As Ethereum continues to look like the better bet, he also believes that the altcoin could end up outperforming the Bitcoin price over the next 3-6 months. This gives a short timeframe, especially as Bitcoin has already hit multiple new all-time highs over the past year, and Ethereum is yet to beat its highs from 2021. ETH Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin So far, in the month of July, the Ethereum price has greatly outperformed that of Bitcoin in terms of gains, lending credence to Novogratz’s expectations that the altcoin will outperform the pioneer cryptocurrency. According to data from CryptoRank, ETH is up more than 45% this month already compared to the less than 8% on record for Bitcoin. Related Reading: This Ethereum Descending Broadening Wedge Pattern Looks Similar To 2019-2020, Here’s What Happened Last Time Over the last 90 days, as well, the Ethereum price has doubled to put in more than 100% in gains.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin continues to dominate the market, with BTC dominance sitting above 61% and holding altcoin season at bay.

Sapien, an innovative AI data collection startup, has officially pulled back the curtain on the intricate details of its native token, SAPIEN. This highly anticipated announcement regarding Sapien tokenomics offers a clear roadmap for how the token will power a decentralized future for AI data. If you’re keen on understanding the mechanics behind promising new crypto projects, you’re in the right place. Understanding Sapien: Powering the Future of AI Data Collection Before diving into the specifics of Sapien tokenomics , it’s crucial to grasp what Sapien aims to achieve. Sapien is not just another tech startup; it’s building a foundational layer for the next generation of AI development. In today’s world, high-quality, diverse data is the lifeblood of effective AI. However, current data collection methods often suffer from centralization, bias, and privacy concerns. Sapien steps in to address these challenges by creating a decentralized platform where individuals can contribute valuable data, ensuring transparency, fair compensation, and data sovereignty. Think of it as a community-driven engine for AI innovation, where every participant has a stake. The SAPIEN token is the fuel for this engine, designed to incentivize participation, govern the network, and facilitate transactions within the ecosystem. Deep Dive into Sapien Tokenomics: The Numbers and Their Meaning The core of Sapien’s long-term vision lies within its meticulously crafted Sapien tokenomics . The company has laid out a clear structure for the SAPIEN token, designed to foster growth, incentivize participation, and ensure the project’s sustainability. Let’s break down the key figures and their strategic implications: Total Supply and Initial Circulation: Setting the Foundation Total Supply: The SAPIEN token will have a fixed total supply of 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens . This finite supply is a common characteristic of many cryptocurrencies, aiming to create scarcity and potential value appreciation over time, assuming demand grows. Initial Circulating Supply: Upon launch, the initial circulating supply will be 250 million tokens (25% of the total supply) . This controlled initial release is crucial for managing market dynamics, preventing immediate dilution, and allowing for gradual distribution as the ecosystem matures. This balanced approach ensures that while there’s enough liquidity to kickstart the ecosystem, a significant portion of tokens is reserved for future incentives and long-term development, aligning with the principles of sustainable Sapien tokenomics . SAPIEN Token Distribution: A Strategic Allocation The distribution model is perhaps the most critical aspect of any tokenomics structure, as it dictates how value flows within the ecosystem and who benefits. Sapien has outlined a comprehensive distribution plan: Allocation Category Percentage of Total Supply Purpose and Impact Seasonal Airdrops, Staking Incentives & Liquidity Incentives 25% Designed to attract and retain community members, reward long-term holders, ensure network security through staking, and provide healthy liquidity for trading. This is vital for ecosystem health and growth, a cornerstone of effective Sapien tokenomics . Supporters & Investors 26.82% Allocated to early backers and investors who provided crucial capital for development. These allocations typically come with vesting schedules to ensure their long-term commitment and prevent sudden market dumps. Team & Advisors 20.18% Rewards for the core team and strategic advisors who are building and guiding the project. These tokens are usually subject to strict vesting periods (e.g., 3-4 years with a cliff) to align their interests with the project’s long-term success. Contributor Rewards 15% Dedicated to individuals who actively contribute data, curate information, and participate in the Sapien ecosystem. This is a direct incentive for the community to provide the high-quality data that AI models need, embodying the decentralized spirit of Sapien tokenomics . Community Treasury 13% A reserve controlled by the community (via decentralized autonomous organization – DAO governance) for future ecosystem development, grants, partnerships, and strategic initiatives. This empowers the community to shape Sapien’s future. The Strategic Implications of Sapien Tokenomics: What Does This Mean for You? The structure of Sapien tokenomics isn’t just about numbers; it’s about creating a robust, self-sustaining ecosystem. Each allocation serves a specific purpose, contributing to the overall health and growth of the Sapien network. For the Community and Data Contributors: Earning and Engaging The significant allocation for Contributor Rewards (15%) and Airdrops/Incentives (25%) highlights Sapien’s commitment to its community. This means: Fair Compensation: Individuals who provide valuable data to train AI models will be directly rewarded with SAPIEN tokens, moving away from models where their data is exploited without proper remuneration. Active Participation: Staking SAPIEN tokens will likely offer rewards, encouraging users to hold and secure the network. Liquidity incentives will ensure a healthy trading environment for the token. Governance Power: The Community Treasury, controlled by token holders, empowers participants to vote on key decisions, ensuring the project evolves in a decentralized and community-driven manner. For Investors and Supporters: Long-Term Vision The allocation for supporters and investors, coupled with standard vesting schedules (though not explicitly detailed in the snippet, they are common practice for team and investor tokens), signals a focus on long-term commitment. This structure aims to: Align Interests: By having a vested interest in the project’s success over time, early investors and the core team are incentivized to build a sustainable and valuable ecosystem. Mitigate Volatility: Controlled release of tokens prevents large, sudden sell-offs that could destabilize the market, promoting more gradual and organic price discovery. Navigating the Future: Potential Challenges and Opportunities for SAPIEN Tokenomics While the Sapien tokenomics present a compelling vision, it’s important to consider both the opportunities and potential challenges ahead. Opportunities: Riding the AI and Web3 Wave Booming AI Market: The demand for high-quality, unbiased data for AI training is skyrocketing. Sapien is positioned to become a crucial provider in this space. Decentralization Trend: As the world moves towards Web3, decentralized data solutions like Sapien offer a compelling alternative to centralized data silos, appealing to privacy-conscious users and developers. Community-Driven Growth: A strong incentive structure for contributors and a community-controlled treasury can foster a highly engaged and rapidly growing ecosystem. Challenges: The Road Ahead Market Volatility: Like all cryptocurrencies, SAPIEN will be subject to market fluctuations, which can impact user incentives and investor confidence. Adoption Hurdles: Educating users about decentralized data collection and attracting a critical mass of contributors will be key to Sapien’s success. Competition: While innovative, Sapien operates in a competitive landscape with other data-focused blockchain projects and traditional data providers. The success of Sapien tokenomics will ultimately depend on the team’s execution, the community’s engagement, and the broader adoption of decentralized AI data solutions. Actionable Insights: How to Engage with SAPIEN Tokenomics For those intrigued by Sapien’s vision and its carefully planned Sapien tokenomics , there are several ways to get involved: Explore the Official Website: The first step is always to visit Sapien’s official website for the most up-to-date information, whitepapers, and roadmaps. Join the Community: Engage with Sapien’s community channels (e.g., Discord, Telegram, Twitter) to stay informed, ask questions, and connect with other enthusiasts. Consider Contributing Data: If you’re interested in being a data provider, understand the mechanisms for contributing and earning SAPIEN tokens. Research Staking Opportunities: As the network matures, explore opportunities to stake SAPIEN tokens to earn rewards and contribute to network security.

The spike comes after its listing on Robinhood, which gives it access to over 20 million U.S. retail users. Backed by a robust 58% jump in 24-hour trading volume, now at $1.03 billion, HBAR is regaining strong bullish momentum. Its pace is further supported by growing ETF speculation and recent network upgrades. With market cap swelling to $11.3 billion, HBAR has clearly entered a high-energy phase. Curious about where the Hedera price is heading next? This short-term HBAR price analysis is all you need. HBAR Price Analysis On the daily chart I’ve shared, HBAR has broken above its previous resistance at $0.26, which very well aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. This came into play after forming a “higher low” at $0.233 on July 24. That being said, traders need to watch out for the immediate support zone, seen between $0.2480–$0.2520, with a more critical stop-loss threshold at $0.2390. Talking about indicators, the 14-day RSI stands at 66.34, running closely with overbought territory but still suggesting room for upside. Meanwhile, the MACD remains slightly bearish with a negative histogram (-0.00022), though the price has consistently held above its 7-day simple moving average at $0.2611. If the bullish momentum continues, HBAR price could next target its July 25 high of $0.2976 , followed by a potential breakout toward $0.3274. A successful close above $0.2993 would validate this bullish trajectory, with long-term resistance at $0.3735. FAQs Why is the HBAR price up today? The price surged after HBAR was listed on Robinhood, increasing accessibility and triggering a 58% rise in trading volume. What is the next price target for HBAR? The immediate resistance is at $0.29930, followed by $0.3274 and a longer-term cap near $0.3735. Is the trend bullish for HBAR now? Yes, the trend is bullish.

48966867,https://timestabloid.com/?p=75586,1753510916,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: We’re At Final Phase of XRP 2025 Bull Market,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-were-at-final-phase-of-xrp-2025-bull-market/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has released a chart-based analysis asserting that XRP may currently be in the final phase of its bull market cycle. Drawing parallels between XRP’s historical price behavior in 2017 and its current trajectory in 2025, the analyst presented a side-by-side comparison of two-month candlesticks that visually align the price action from both periods. The post emphasizes a repeating structure, with XRP’s present chart behavior resembling the price formation seen just before the major rally in late 2017. In the 2017 segment of the chart, XRP is shown to have experienced a prolonged accumulation phase before initiating a rapid and steep price increase. This upward movement was characterized by multiple large green candlesticks in succession. The chart then shifts to the current market cycle, where a similar accumulation period appears to have given way to a series of upward price candles. The placement of the 2025 segment within a shaded rectangle mimics the pattern seen in 2017, visually suggesting an analogous end-stage rally. The two periods are further aligned through annotations on the chart, with “2017” and “2025” labeled beneath each cluster of candlesticks. This indicates that the analyst views the ongoing price action not as a new beginning, but rather as a final leg within the broader bullish cycle. We’re at the end stage of the #XRP bull market. Don’t get fooled! pic.twitter.com/iXIeM0acQb — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 24, 2025 Technical Indicators Signal Overbought Conditions Below the price chart, Steph Is Crypto includes the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stoch RSI) indicator to strengthen the case that XRP is nearing the top of its bull cycle. The Stoch RSI is currently at its maximum level of 100, with both the blue and orange lines crossing into the overbought zone. This level is nearly identical to where it stood at the peak of XRP’s rally in 2017. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst highlights this by circling both peaks in red and drawing attention to the matching overbought readings. The inference is that XRP may soon face similar conditions to those observed in 2017, where the elevated Stoch RSI level coincided with a market top. The chart also notes that XRP has reached this upper bound of the Stoch RSI only a few times in the past, adding weight to the suggestion that the market may be approaching a climactic point. Comment Emphasizes Caution to Market Participants Accompanying the chart, Steph Is Crypto warns, “We’re at the end stage of the XRP bull market. Don’t get fooled!” This message serves as a cautionary statement to traders and investors who may interpret the ongoing rally as the beginning of an extended uptrend. The analyst implies that while price appreciation may continue briefly, the structural and technical signals suggest that the top may not be far off. The statement advises vigilance, possibly hinting at the need for profit-taking or risk management strategies. Although no explicit prediction is made about when or at what price level the market will reverse, the combination of technical patterns and the language used indicates that the analyst sees limited upside potential remaining in the current cycle.

48966981,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=182947,1753511111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48966981.jpeg,Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: Canadian Firm Bolsters Holdings to 166 BTC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-acquisition-capital-growth/,"BitcoinWorld Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: Canadian Firm Bolsters Holdings to 166 BTC In the dynamic world of digital assets, every significant move by a publicly traded company sends ripples across the market. The recent announcement from Canada-listed Bitcoin Treasury Capital, confirming an additional Bitcoin acquisition of 10 BTC, is one such event that captures the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This latest purchase elevates their total holdings to a remarkable 166 BTC, underscoring a deepening commitment to the premier cryptocurrency. But what does this strategic maneuver truly signify for the company, its shareholders, and the broader crypto landscape? What Does This Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Signify? Bitcoin Treasury Capital’s consistent accumulation of Bitcoin is more than just a balance sheet entry; it’s a powerful statement of conviction. In an era where traditional financial assets grapple with inflation and geopolitical uncertainties, companies are increasingly looking towards alternative stores of value. For Bitcoin Treasury Capital, a company whose very name signals its core strategy, each Bitcoin acquisition reinforces its long-term vision. This isn’t merely speculative trading; it’s a deliberate treasury management strategy aimed at preserving and potentially growing capital in a deflationary asset. Consider the implications: Institutional Confidence: It demonstrates that corporate entities are moving beyond mere exploration of Bitcoin to active integration into their financial reserves. Market Maturation: Such consistent purchases contribute to Bitcoin’s stability and legitimacy as an institutional-grade asset. Shareholder Value: For shareholders, it signals a management team confident in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation and its role as a hedge against macroeconomic instability. This incremental yet significant Bitcoin acquisition by Bitcoin Treasury Capital aligns with a broader trend of public and private companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. It’s a testament to the evolving perception of Bitcoin from a niche digital currency to a global reserve asset. Why Are Companies Pursuing Bitcoin Acquisition? The decision for a company to undertake a substantial Bitcoin acquisition is multifaceted, driven by a blend of economic foresight, technological belief, and strategic positioning. It’s not a decision taken lightly, often involving extensive due diligence and board approval. So, what are the compelling reasons behind this growing trend? 1. Inflation Hedge and Store of Value With global quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, traditional fiat currencies are experiencing devaluing effects. Bitcoin, with its capped supply of 21 million coins, presents itself as a digital gold – a scarce asset designed to appreciate over time as demand outstrips supply. Companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital see it as a superior alternative to holding depreciating cash reserves. 2. Balance Sheet Diversification Just as investors diversify their portfolios, corporations are seeking to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional bonds and cash. Bitcoin offers a non-correlated asset that can potentially enhance overall portfolio returns and reduce risk exposure to conventional market downturns. 3. Future Growth and Innovation Investing in Bitcoin is also an investment in the future of finance and technology. Companies that embrace Bitcoin are positioning themselves at the forefront of the digital economy, signaling innovation and adaptability. This can attract tech-savvy investors and employees. 4. Shareholder Alignment For some companies, a Bitcoin acquisition strategy resonates deeply with their investor base, particularly those with a strong belief in the future of decentralized finance. It can be a way to align corporate strategy with shareholder expectations and even attract new investors interested in exposure to digital assets. Here’s a simplified comparison of traditional treasury assets vs. Bitcoin: Feature Traditional Cash/Bonds Bitcoin (BTC) Inflation Exposure High (value erodes over time) Low (deflationary by design) Volatility Low (generally stable) High (significant price swings) Accessibility High (easy to acquire/spend) Moderate (requires digital infrastructure) Growth Potential Low (yields often below inflation) High (potential for substantial appreciation) Decentralization Centralized (controlled by governments/banks) Decentralized (no single entity control) The Broader Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition Every time a publicly traded company announces a significant Bitcoin acquisition , it contributes to a larger narrative: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency. These corporate endorsements are crucial for Bitcoin’s journey towards wider adoption and acceptance. They provide a stamp of legitimacy that can influence institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, and even other corporations to consider similar moves. Beyond the direct impact on Bitcoin’s price, corporate adoption: Enhances Liquidity: More entities holding Bitcoin can increase market depth and reduce price volatility over the long term. Spurs Infrastructure Development: The need for secure custody solutions, reporting standards, and regulatory clarity for corporate Bitcoin holdings drives innovation in the crypto ecosystem. Influences Regulatory Frameworks: As more traditional businesses engage with crypto, governments and financial regulators are pressured to develop clearer, more comprehensive guidelines. Bitcoin Treasury Capital’s latest move, while modest in absolute terms compared to giants like MicroStrategy, is significant because it reinforces the growing conviction among a diverse range of companies that Bitcoin is a viable and valuable asset for their balance sheets. It’s a snowball effect, where each new corporate entrant makes it easier for the next. What Are the Risks and Rewards of Bitcoin Acquisition for Companies? While the allure of Bitcoin as a treasury asset is strong, a strategic Bitcoin acquisition is not without its challenges. Companies must carefully weigh the potential rewards against inherent risks. Potential Rewards: Significant Capital Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically outperformed most traditional assets, offering substantial returns for early adopters. Inflation Protection: A hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies, preserving purchasing power. Competitive Advantage: Positioning the company as forward-thinking and innovative in the digital age. New Investor Base: Attracting a segment of investors keen on crypto exposure through traditional equity markets. Inherent Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, leading to potential mark-to-market losses on financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential compliance challenges and risks of adverse policy changes. Security Concerns: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks or theft, which can be costly and complex. Accounting and Reporting Challenges: Current accounting standards are not always well-suited for digital assets, leading to complexities in financial reporting. For Bitcoin Treasury Capital, these risks are likely well-understood and managed, given their stated focus. Their continued Bitcoin acquisition suggests they believe the rewards significantly outweigh the risks for their specific business model. How Can Investors Interpret This Bitcoin Acquisition Trend? For individual investors, corporate Bitcoin acquisition provides valuable insights into the evolving institutional view of digital assets. It’s a signal that Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a legitimate, long-term asset rather than just a speculative gamble. Here’s how you might interpret these developments: Look for Conviction: Companies making repeated or significant purchases, like Bitcoin Treasury Capital, show strong conviction. This can be a positive indicator for Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Understand the ‘Why’: Is the company acquiring Bitcoin as a primary business strategy (like BTC Treasury Capital) or as a treasury diversification play? This distinction can influence how you view the implications. Consider Risk Appetite: Companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets are typically comfortable with higher levels of volatility. This can be a proxy for the growing acceptance of Bitcoin’s risk profile within corporate finance. Broader Market Sentiment: A rise in corporate Bitcoin holdings generally reflects a bullish sentiment from a powerful segment of the market – institutional players. While corporate actions shouldn’t be the sole basis for your investment decisions, they provide a strong external validation of Bitcoin’s growing importance in the global financial system. The ongoing narrative of institutional adoption, driven by companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital, paints a compelling picture for the future of digital assets. Conclusion: A Growing Tide of Confidence Bitcoin Treasury Capital’s latest Bitcoin acquisition of 10 BTC, bringing their total to 166 BTC, is more than just a headline; it’s a tangible demonstration of growing institutional confidence in the digital asset space. This strategic move by a Canada-listed firm highlights Bitcoin’s increasing role as a viable treasury asset, a hedge against inflation, and a beacon for future growth. As more companies follow suit, the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin solidifies, paving the way for a more robust and mature cryptocurrency market. This trend signals a fundamental shift in how corporations view and utilize their capital, embracing the decentralized future that Bitcoin promises. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin acquisition by a company? A Bitcoin acquisition by a company refers to a corporate entity purchasing and holding Bitcoin (BTC) as part of its treasury reserves or investment strategy, rather than just for transactional purposes. This is often done to hedge against inflation, diversify assets, or capitalize on potential future price appreciation. Q2: Why is Bitcoin Treasury Capital buying more Bitcoin? Bitcoin Treasury Capital is buying more Bitcoin as part of its core business strategy to hold and accumulate BTC. This reflects their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value as a digital store of value and a strategic asset for capital preservation and growth, aligning with their company’s name and mission. Q3: How does a company’s Bitcoin acquisition affect the market? A company’s Bitcoin acquisition can positively affect the market by signaling increased institutional confidence, contributing to market liquidity, and potentially driving up demand. It also helps legitimize Bitcoin as a mainstream asset, which can attract more traditional investors and spur further infrastructure development. Q4: What are the risks for companies holding Bitcoin? Companies holding Bitcoin face risks such as high price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect their digital assets. Accounting and reporting for cryptocurrency holdings can also present complexities due to evolving standards. Q5: Are more companies expected to make Bitcoin acquisitions? Yes, the trend suggests that more companies are exploring or actively making Bitcoin acquisitions. As Bitcoin gains further acceptance, regulatory clarity improves, and its role as an inflation hedge becomes more apparent, it is anticipated that a growing number of corporations will consider adding BTC to their balance sheets.

These bipartisan bills mark a turning point in crypto policy, giving digital assets like XRP and Dogecoin a clearer regulatory pathway. Investors are piling into these assets, but another altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is emerging with a powerful mix of meme energy, ideological appeal, and real tokenomics. XRP Enters Price Discovery with Legal and Legislative Tailwinds XRP has finally shattered its 2018 all-time high, touching $3.65 and entering price discovery. Trading at around $3.49, XRP has gained over 6% in the last 24 hours as whale wallets added 2.2 billion tokens, worth over $7.1 billion, fueled by both legal clarity and bullish legislation. With no overhead resistance left, analysts are eyeing $4.00 as the next psychological barrier, with projections as high as $10 in the long term if Ripple secures U.S. banking integration and spot ETF approvals follow. Corporate adoption is also rising: VivoPower and Webus have allocated a combined $421 million into XRP, validating its role as a compliant, scalable payments token. With this momentum, XRP is being positioned as a foundational layer in future global finance infrastructure. Dogecoin Reclaims Momentum as Meme Coin Revival Gains Speed Dogecoin (DOGE) has bounced back with force, surging nearly 14% to $0.24, with 30-day gains exceeding 40%. The meme coin sector as a whole has risen 41% in the same period, but DOGE remains the tone-setter. Analysts like MMBTtrader forecast a move to $0.4 and beyond, citing strong technical formations, including a Cup-and-Handle breakout and bullish RSI patterns. Market observers note that if DOGE clears resistance at $0.28–$0.30, a rally to $0.75 or even $1 may come into view. Fundamentally, DOGE is benefiting from the same legislative momentum as XRP. Bloomberg analysts now place a 90% probability on DOGE ETF approval this year, which could accelerate institutional inflows and cement Dogecoin’s status as a serious asset despite its meme roots. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Politically Charged Meme Coin Takeover Market XRP and DOGE are surging on macro news, but MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically charged meme coin, is quickly rising. Similar to early DOGE and Shiba Inu, it offers stronger fundamentals and greater decentralization. Now in its final presale stage, it has thousands of holders and limited discounted tokens. MAGACOIN has real infrastructure, with CertiK and HashEx audits and support for MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. Analysts see up to 500x potential post-launch, based on presale data and social buzz. Scarcity is key: 60% of tokens go to presale buyers, with prices increasing at each stage. Conclusion As institutional money flows into Bitcoin ETFs, savvy investors are eyeing high-upside altcoins with strong fundamentals and cultural traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE, still in its final presale stage, stands out as this cycle’s dark horse, offering a compelling narrative. With presale pricing ending soon, this may be the last opportunity before broader market recognition.

This has allowed large investors to buy the dip, while Dogecoin’s surge today has pushed it back to a key accumulation zone. Whales bought the dip, scooping up over 130 million $XRP in the past 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/JQJVc757UZ — Ali (@ali_charts) July 25, 2025 Recall that the third-largest cryptocurrency posted a new all-time high at the end of last week when it finally broke above the 2018 peak of $3.4 and surged beyond $3.6. However, it started to retrace in the following days, which culminated on Friday with a slip below $3. This came amid worrying moves by Upbit, longs getting crushed on Binance, and a reported sell-off of $140 million worth of XRP from one of Ripple’s co-founders. Nevertheless, the cross-border payments token managed to remain above the crucial $3 resistance and has recovered some ground to $3.17 as of press time. This dip didn’t go unnoticed by large investors, as they have accumulated over 130 million tokens in just 24 hours. From a USD perspective, this stash is worth roughly $400 million. Meanwhile, the crowd became a lot less greedy in regard to XRP (and BTC), which could be considered a bullish signal. When it comes to DOGE, the popular analyst Ali Martinez said it has returned in a “range that has historically served as a buying zone, triggering major bull runs.” He further noted that DOGE has to reclaim the $0.25 resistance, which would be a “huge win.” If it does, then the path toward $0.36 will be cleared with “almost zero resistance.” Dogecoin $DOGE reclaiming $0.25 is a huge win because above that, there’s almost zero resistance all the way up to $0.36. pic.twitter.com/UEKXNtq5jb — Ali (@ali_charts) July 25, 2025 The post Whales Bought the XRP Dip While DOGE Hits Key Accumulation Zone: Details appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Dogecoin|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,DOGE|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-26 06:35:51

In the latest installment of Ripple’s “Crypto In A Minute” series, Garlinghouse focused on the emerging role of prime brokers in expanding access to digital assets, highlighting how these firms are reshaping traditional finance infrastructure. Garlinghouse described prime brokerage as a “one-stop shop” for major financial entities, including hedge funds, trading desks, and market makers. These firms traditionally rely on large commercial banks, such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, to facilitate trades across asset classes, including derivatives and swaps. However, he pointed out that this model is shifting as newer firms enter the space and begin to serve these same institutional clients, offering a broader mix of assets that now includes digital tokens. Prime brokerage services, once dominated by big banks, are evolving to bring institutions into DeFi with regulated clearing for derivatives, swaps, and crypto while unlocking trillions in trades. @bgarlinghouse returns for another round of Crypto In One Minute and breaks down… pic.twitter.com/6ZIobJThRm — Ripple (@Ripple) July 25, 2025 Ripple’s Move Into Prime Brokerage Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road , a fast-growing prime brokerage firm, was central to Garlinghouse’s message. He noted that asset managers are doing trillions of dollars in trades and now have access to digital assets through firms like Hidden Road. “Having a well-capitalized and a super strong balance sheet player like Hidden Road is allowing more institutions to come into these asset classes against a well-capitalized counterparty,” Garlinghouse explained, underlining the importance of trust and financial security in institutional engagement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging Traditional and Digital Markets The CEO also emphasized how the inclusion of digital assets within the services offered by prime brokers represents a critical step toward broader adoption. By offering seamless trading and clearing of traditional and digital assets through a single platform, firms like Hidden Road are addressing long-standing barriers that have prevented many institutional investors from entering the crypto space. In this context, prime brokers are not just intermediaries but enablers of market expansion. For many in the XRP community, the video reinforced Ripple’s strategy to position itself at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) . While XRP is often viewed through the lens of Ripple’s payment-focused use cases, the acquisition of Hidden Road proves that Ripple is bringing institutional-grade infrastructure to crypto markets. Garlinghouse noted that traditional banks are being replaced by specialized firms, such as Hidden Road, which offer access to new asset classes. Ripple has already integrated XRP into Hidden Road’s infrastructure , and this institutional focus could pave the way for increased liquidity and adoption of the digital asset within institutional portfolios.

You know, in this digital era, the crypto market is maturing, and investors now have good judgment. But do you know that between all these, a new class of digital assets is emerging that prioritizes sustainability, scalability, and, of course, your security. Bitcoin.ℏ is a sustainable cryptocurrency built on Hedera Hashgraph and offering a compelling answer to the growing demand for crypto alternatives. And the best part is that it has zero mining, low fees with capped supply, and quantum resistance. That is why BTC.ℏ is positioning itself as a serious contender among bitcoin alternatives. Now we find out if it is eco-conscious or future-ready, ESG-focused. A Sustainable Cryptocurrency in a High-Energy Market As you know, the traditional Bitcoin has long faced criticism for its energy-intensive mining process, and according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Bitcoin mining consumes more energy annually than entire countries like Argentina. That’s why the retail and institutional investors are concerned about increasing ESG standards. BTC.ℏ operates on Hedera Hashgraph, which is a next-gen distributed ledger, and it does not require mining, which means it lowers energy use drastically by several orders of magnitude, and it makes BTC.ℏ a true green crypto. And not only that, Hedera is carbon negative and purchases offsets beyond its minimal footprint. That is why investors focused on sustainability and BTC.ℏ offers a unique advantage and value of Bitcoin’s limited supply without a large harmful impact on the environment. Built On Hedera-Quantum Resistant and Fast The other best thing is BTC.ℏ, which benefits from the advanced security and speed of Hedera Hashgraph, and it is distinct from blockchain. And its asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) ensures fairness and low-latency transaction finality, ideal for modern use cases. You know the world is rapidly advancing in quantum computing, and that is why today, security matters more than ever. Don’t worry, BTC.ℏ is being developed with quantum resistance in mind, and its coin is evolving against cryptographic threats, and Bitcoin itself may struggle to address this without significant upgrades. Capped Supply and Low fees are the Real Investment Fundamentals. Just like Bitcoin BTC.ℏ, it also follows a capped supply model and reinforces the principle of digital scarcity that drives long-term value. But unlike Bitcoin, it has low transaction fees that make it more practical for everyday use and high-frequency transactions. These characteristics are critical for investors who are looking beyond hype and towards investment fundamentals with a finite supply, scalable infrastructure, and low friction for both the users and business. Traction and Exchange Listings BTC.ℏ is not just a concept, but it is gaining real-world momentum. And it is already listed on CoinEx and Biconomy because BTC.ℏ is providing its legitimacy and accessibility in the broader crypto market. Exchange listings are more than mere milestones, and they serve as external validation that a coin is trade-ready and gaining demand. Macro Trends That Support BTC.ℏ’s Rise The rise of BTC.ℏ is becoming a broader crypto investment trend because of the following things. Growing demand for sustainable cryptocurrency options. Due to a shift from high legacy coins towards efficient systems. The rising awareness of quantum security in digital assets is also one reason. Governments are making more rules to cut down pollution and save energy. BTC.ℏ sits at the crossroads of all these trends and combines green technology, robust security, and sound monetary policy. Is BTC.ℏ the Smart Bitcoin Alternative? If you are an investor and looking for the next evolution of Bitcoin that aligns with modern values of sustainability and security, then Bitcoin.ℏ may be the answer because it is a thoughtfully engineered, eco-friendly, quantum-resistant digital asset that is designed for the future. Why Eco-Friendly Crypto Matters to the Market Now, due to awareness and knowledge, investors and institutions are paying close attention to the effect made by cryptocurrencies on the environment, and if you are one of them, then Bitcoin.ℏ is for you. Why? Because it is running on Hedera Hashgraph, which is a network known for its energy-efficient design, this coin offers a clean alternative to traditional mining-based tokens. As the world starts caring more about climate and environment, coins like Bitcoin.ℏ are better aligned with long-term financial and ethical goals. This gives it an edge as a green crypto option for investors like you who want to perform without any guilt. A Long-Term Contender You have seen that many altcoins are driven by internet trends and speculation, but BTC.ℏ is focused on long-term value and real utility. And with a cap supply like Bitcoin and the scalability of Hedera, it is built for the future, not just for short-term gains. Final words The BTC.ℏ, with its carbon-conscious foundation, limited supply, and advanced cryptographic protection, is positioning itself as the Green Bitcoin for the next generation of investors, and it is evolving because of its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in its portfolio strategies.

The lawmakers are demanding JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan produce documents related to the Hong Kong listing of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), which supplies batteries to Tesla and other electric-vehicle makers, reports the Wall Street Journal. The politicians making the demands of the two US banks serve on the House of Representatives’ Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which focuses on the national security threat posed by China. In April, the congressional committee urged JPMorgan and Bank of America to cease their involvement in CATL’s listing since the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) added CATL to its list of “Chinese military companies,” and the committee warned of “serious regulatory, financial, and reputational risks” if they did not. Despite the warning, JPMorgan and Bank of America helped underwrite CATL’s IPO. Says Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Michigan), the committee chair, in the subpoena, “CATL’s industry-leading role in battery manufacturing – a sector explicitly targeted by China’s state-driven military-civil fusion policy – poses significant US investor and national security risks.” The committee says in its subpoenas that the banks failed to produce previously requested information on the IPO matter. Meanwhile, Dimon defended underwriting CATL’s IPO in a May interview on Bloomberg TV. “We and other investment banks did a lot of due diligence around all the issues that people raised. If we thought it was wrong, we wouldn’t do it.” Meanwhile, a Bank of America spokesman says the bank will continue to work with the committee. Contemporary Amperex Technology says in its public documents that it believes the DOD incorrectly added it to the list and is “engaging with DOD to address the false designation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The country’s National Data Association developed it and will be operated by the Ministry of Public Security’s Data Innovation and Exploitation Centre to evolve the digital ecosystem. Why did the Vietnamese Government Launch NDAChain? The Vietnamese government launched NDAChain to address the growing demand for security in the digital ecosystem. The NDAChain will challenge the limitations of centralized data modes, such as cybersecurity risks, difficulty in scaling, and global integration. NDAChain will integrate blockchain technology to simplify critical national systems like— e-government, finance, healthcare, logistics, and education. Mr. Nguyen Huy, Head of Technology at National Data Association, said, “Vietnam has chosen a hybrid data architecture that blends centralized and decentralized components. NDAChain acts as a protective layer for the nation’s live data, critical to our digital society and economy.” NDAChain Architecture of Decentralized Trust Layer The NDAChain is not completely decentralized but uses a hybrid architecture to provide a decentralized trust layer, a blockchain technology. This permission layer 1 blockchain, consisting of 49 validating nodes, is operated by the state agencies and large enterprises like Zalo, Masan, and SunGroup. The network operates on a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism combined with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for enhanced security. Additionally, the NDAChain integrates with NDA DID, a decentralized identity solution to verify counterparty identity in transactions. Vietnam Expanding Security Measures in Digital Space With integration of enhanced technology, NDAChain is capable of processing up to 3,600 transactions per second, while the NDAKey application prevents scams and impersonation. The government plans to fully integrate the NDAChain into the National Data Center, local government, and universities by the end of 2025. Furthermore, it also plans to launch phase 2, focusing on international collaboration and building a layer 2 application customized for various sectors. Final Thought Vietnam is evolving its digital assets environment with NDAChain technology. A representative from the Data Innovation and Exploitation Center affirmed that the blockchain development reflects the country’s aspiration for sustainable growth with innovation. This also shows Vietnam’s target for long-term vision in data infrastructure and digital economic development.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-26 07:08:44

While Chainlink’s technology has gained recognition for its role in connecting smart contracts to real-world data, Morgan pushed back against claims positioning Chainlink as the superior asset of the two. His critique challenges the criteria used to assess XRP’s value and relevance in the current crypto landscape. Morgan took issue with what he saw as a narrow and incomplete evaluation of the asset. He argued that many critics place excessive emphasis on Ripple’s control over the digital asset and its payment-related use cases, without considering the full technical and market context of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This includes overlooking XRP’s evolving utility , market liquidity, and the growing ecosystem of decentralized financial applications supported by the XRPL. Very well argued comparing XRP to Chainlink which I enjoyed but I think your perspective on XRP is too focused on Ripple’s payment use and % ownership of XRP and not on the capabilities of the XRPL or XRP’s liquidity. You may also have inadvertently imbued some of the anti-… https://t.co/hM20Ts59J7 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) July 24, 2025 Emphasis on Technology and Liquidity One of Morgan’s central points was that XRP’s value cannot be solely defined by Ripple’s involvement or XRP’s early branding as a tool for cross-border payments . He emphasized that the XRPL has developed significantly in recent years, now offering advanced features such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs) integrated into its native decentralized exchange. Additionally, he highlighted the implementation of an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible sidechain , which opens the ledger to a wider range of developers and smart contract functionalities. Morgan also noted XRP’s liquidity advantages, which are often underestimated. It remains one of the most traded digital assets globally and has maintained its place in the top ten by market capitalization for over a decade. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He contrasted this with Chainlink’s market position, pointing out that despite Chainlink’s strong technology, it has struggled to regain the top 10 position in the cryptocurrency market. XRP’s Expanding Market Use Bill Morgan further argued that the demand for XRP is growing beyond its traditional use cases. In particular, he pointed to the growing interest in XRP for Futures and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , as well as its potential role in institutional treasury management. These developments suggest that XRP’s utility and demand are expanding, creating opportunities for holders to earn yield through new financial products and DeFi applications. By focusing only on Ripple’s share of XRP and dismissing these recent advancements, critics fail to capture the full picture of XRP’s role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Morgan contended that such views unintentionally echo outdated criticisms that label XRP as a “banker’s coin,” a term that oversimplifies the asset’s function and ignores its decentralized infrastructure and community-driven innovations.

However, industry experts now note that these patterns have been fading and new forces are starting to shape the market. Is the 4-Year Cycle Breaking Down? Bitcoin recently broke above its new all-time highs and surged past $123,000. Bitcoin cycles typically last around 1,070 days from the market bottom to the next peak. If history repeats, this bull run could continue until October 20, 2025, which suggests that the cycle isn’t over yet. BITCOIN CYCLE ISN'T OVER Each Bitcoin cycle has lasted approximately 1,070 days from the bottom of the bear market to the bull market peak. If this trend continues, the bull market is expected to last until October 20, 2025. pic.twitter.com/6tLHf8wGwz — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 26, 2025 Long-Term Forces Will Outpower the 4-Year Cycle Bitwise CIO, Matt Hougan , is one of those who think that the classic four-year crypto cycle is breaking down. He notes that Bitcoin halvings matter less each time. Interest rates that were once a headwind are now helping crypto. With clear regulations in place and more institutional players, major blowups are now less likely. ETF adoption has just begun, and he believes that it is a 5-10 year trend. Institutional money is slowly entering, with pensions, endowments, and national platforms now considering crypto. Wall Street is finally investing seriously in crypto, and he expects that it will invest billions in the quarters and years to come. Big names like JP Morgan and Standard Chartered are already exploring crypto products. “All this suggests to me that the long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic “four-year cycle” forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year,” he said. The Biggest Risk? However, he notes that “the biggest emergent cyclical-style risk” is the rise of Treasury companies. In the last month alone, 22 public companies added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pushing the total to 160. #Bitcoin cycle theory is dead. My predictions were based on it—buy when whales accumulate, sell when retail joins. But that pattern no longer holds. Last cycle, whales sold to retail. This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 24, 2025 CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju had also said that the old Bitcoin cycle is over. He says the pattern of predicting markets by tracking whale buys and retail FOMO no longer fits. This time, old whales are selling to new long-term holders, not retail. BTC Still On Track But some have stuck by the 4-year cycle. Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer believes Bitcoin is still closely tracking its four-year cycle, pointing to its recent all-time highs. ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that the cycle still exists but is weaker. With more stable money flowing in, the wild crashes may turn into smaller dips. Bitcoin is around 975 days into its current cycle, and past cycles peaked just after 1,060 days. This shows that a possible top may occur by mid-October. On-chain signs also support the idea of a final parabolic run, potentially pushing BTC toward $250,000. Pi Cycle Top Is Speeding Up While there are claims that this cycle is different, similar optimism was seen in the past cycles, and the classic four-year pattern held each time. History still points to a Bitcoin peak in late 2025.

ENA price was among the top gainers in the last 24 hours amid heavy crypto liquidations. Ethena partnered with Anchorage to develop a product with a clear path to compliance. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange, has been on a buying spree for Ethena (ENA) tokens from various cryptocurrency exchanges in recent times. According to on-chain data analysis, Hayes purchased 2.16 million ENA tokens, worth around $1 million. Consequently, Hayes increased his ENA token holdings to 7.76 million, which are worth about $3.73 million.

Market analyst Joa believes that after dipping to $2.97, XRP staged a strong V-shaped rebound , signaling bullish momentum. Therefore, holding above $3.17 could ignite a breakout past $3.30. Joa believes that this swift bounce signals renewed bullish momentum that could propel XRP higher provided it holds the key support level of $3.17. XRP had briefly plunged to $2.97 earlier this week amid broad crypto market volatility, shaking out weak hands. However, buyers quickly stepped in, reversing losses with aggressive bids that lifted XRP back above $3.20 within hours. This V-shaped pattern, a formation typically associated with strong reversals, has strengthened bullish sentiment around XRP’s short-term trajectory. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $3.16, representing a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. Therefore, if XRP can maintain support above $3.17, this confirms the V-shaped recovery and sets the stage for a breakout above $3.30. Furthermore, a decisive move past $3.30 could expose higher resistance levels around $3.50 and potentially retest the all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 recorded earlier this month. On-chain data supports this bullish outlook with Coinglass reporting that XRP’s open interest remains elevated, showing a 142% increase over the past month. This suggests that traders are still actively positioning for further price movements, with long positions gaining traction post-rebound. Will XRP Soar to the $10-$15 Zone? According to technical analyst XRPunkie, “XRP went from $1.95 to $3.65, up 92% in 30 days. We just had a 16% pullback. It's a healthy correction. Nothing out of the ordinary in crypto. Sit back, chill and relax. Let it bottom out and we should be on our way to much higher prices real soon. $10-$15 is still in play.” While the $10 to $15 zone is a stretch from current levels, the confluence of bullish technicals, renewed market interest, and macro tailwinds makes that target realistic over the medium to long term, especially in a strong crypto bull cycle. Conclusion With momentum building and sentiment turning bullish, XRP’s price action in the coming days could determine whether the asset breaks through $3.30 or slips back into consolidation. For traders and investors alike, all eyes remain on the $3.17 pivot with the $10-$15 range still in play in the long run.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-26 07:19:50

The world of cryptocurrency is a whirlwind of innovation, opportunity, and, often, intense emotional swings. Lately, all eyes have been on the remarkable surge in Ethereum price , as ETH has soared to impressive new heights. This rally has certainly sparked widespread excitement, yet seasoned observers and on-chain analytics platforms like Santiment are beginning to raise a cautious flag. Could this period of intense bullishness, described as ‘extreme euphoria,’ actually be signaling an impending short-term correction for Ethereum price ? Understanding the ‘Extreme Euphoria’ in Ethereum Price When we talk about ‘extreme euphoria’ in the context of Ethereum price , we’re primarily referring to a significant surge in social media mentions and overall public sentiment. Cointelegraph, citing Santiment, highlighted that social dominance for ETH has reached levels often associated with market tops. But what exactly does ‘social dominance’ mean, and why is it a warning sign? Social Dominance Explained: This metric tracks the percentage of cryptocurrency-related discussions on social media platforms (like X, Reddit, Telegram) that are focused on a particular asset, in this case, Ethereum. A high social dominance indicates that ETH is a hot topic, capturing a large share of the crypto conversation. The Contrarian Indicator: Historically, periods of overwhelming social euphoria often precede price corrections. When everyone is talking about an asset, and sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, it can suggest that most potential buyers have already entered the market. This leaves fewer new buyers to push the price higher, making the asset vulnerable to profit-taking. A Crowded Trade: High social dominance can also point to a ‘crowded trade,’ meaning a large number of investors are positioned on the same side (long). While this can fuel a rally in the short term, it creates significant downside risk if sentiment shifts, as many investors might rush to exit simultaneously. The recent spike in Ethereum price discussions on social platforms, reaching these ‘euphoric’ levels, serves as a crucial reminder for investors to approach the market with caution, despite the compelling narrative of growth. The ETH/BTC Ratio Surge: A Deeper Dive into Ethereum Price Dynamics Another significant factor contributing to the current market narrative around Ethereum price is its performance relative to Bitcoin. Since early May, the ETH/BTC price ratio has jumped an astounding 70%. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of shifting market dynamics and investor preference. Relative Strength: The ETH/BTC ratio is a key metric for understanding Ethereum’s relative strength against Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency. When this ratio rises, it means Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, often signaling a period where capital is flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins, particularly Ethereum. Altcoin Season Bellwether: A strong ETH/BTC ratio is frequently seen as a precursor or an active sign of an ‘altcoin season,’ where alternative cryptocurrencies experience significant gains. Ethereum, being the second-largest crypto and the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, often leads this charge. Implications for Portfolios: For investors, a rising ETH/BTC ratio suggests that holding Ethereum might be more profitable than holding Bitcoin during certain market phases. However, a sharp, rapid increase can also indicate an overheated market, where speculative fervor drives assets higher unsustainably. While the 70% jump in the ETH/BTC ratio undeniably showcases Ethereum’s recent dominance, it also amplifies the concern about a potentially overextended rally, adding another layer of complexity to the Ethereum price outlook. Are Broader Market Indicators Signaling Caution for Ethereum Price? Despite the warning signs from social sentiment and the ETH/BTC ratio, Santiment also noted a nuanced point: broader market indicators do not yet reflect ‘peak frothiness.’ This suggests that while individual asset sentiment might be high, the overall crypto market might not be at its absolute top, implying that the rally for Ethereum price could still have room to run. But what are these ‘broader market indicators,’ and how do they differ from social sentiment? On-Chain Metrics: These include data points like active addresses, transaction volumes, exchange inflows/outflows, and miner behavior. For instance, if a large amount of ETH is being moved off exchanges into self-custody, it can signal long-term holding intentions, reducing immediate selling pressure. Derivatives Market Data: Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts, open interest, and options market data can provide insights into leverage in the system. Extremely high positive funding rates, for example, often indicate an overheated market with excessive bullish leverage. Institutional Flows: Tracking inflows into institutional products like Ethereum ETFs (where available) or Grayscale Ethereum Trust can indicate sustained institutional demand, which typically suggests a more robust and less ‘frothy’ market structure. Market Cap Dominance: Looking at Bitcoin’s dominance (BTC.D) can provide a macro view. If Bitcoin dominance is still relatively high, it might suggest that the overall market isn’t yet in full ‘altcoin frenzy’ mode, which typically characterizes the absolute peak of a bull run. The distinction between asset-specific euphoria and broader market ‘frothiness’ is critical. It implies that while Ethereum price might be facing short-term headwinds due to its own intense hype, the larger crypto ecosystem might still be absorbing capital, potentially offering a buffer against a severe, prolonged downturn for ETH. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Ethereum Price Investors In a market characterized by such intense swings and mixed signals, how can investors best position themselves regarding the future of Ethereum price ? The key lies in informed decision-making, risk management, and a clear understanding of your investment goals. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Before making any moves, honestly evaluate how much volatility you can stomach. Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, are inherently volatile. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification is Key: While Ethereum is a strong asset, putting all your eggs in one basket is rarely advisable. Consider diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount at regular intervals. This strategy, known as DCA, helps average out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term price fluctuations on your overall Ethereum price acquisition cost. Stay Informed, But Avoid FOMO: Keep up-to-date with market news and on-chain analytics, but be wary of succumbing to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) during euphoric periods or Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) during pullbacks. Base your decisions on data and your long-term strategy, not just emotion. Consider Profit-Taking Strategies: If you’ve experienced significant gains in your Ethereum price holdings, it might be prudent to consider taking some profits off the table. This could involve selling a portion of your holdings to secure gains or rebalancing your portfolio. Ultimately, navigating the current landscape of Ethereum price requires a balanced approach, combining an understanding of market psychology with sound investment principles. Historical Precedents: What Past Cycles Tell Us About Ethereum Price History, while not a guarantee of future performance, often rhymes. Looking back at previous crypto market cycles, we can observe patterns that shed light on the current situation for Ethereum price . Periods of ‘extreme euphoria’ are not new; they have consistently marked phases where market sentiment becomes detached from fundamental value, leading to unsustainable rallies. 2017 Bull Run: The ICO boom saw unprecedented levels of public excitement and social media frenzy. Many projects with little substance soared, only to crash dramatically during the subsequent bear market. Ethereum itself experienced massive gains but also significant pullbacks. 2021 Bull Run: The DeFi and NFT explosions brought a new wave of euphoria. While Ethereum’s fundamentals strengthened considerably, the rapid price appreciation, especially in memecoins and speculative NFTs, eventually led to a broad market correction. The Role of Corrections: Corrections are a natural and often healthy part of market cycles. They purge excessive leverage, wash out weak hands, and allow for a reset, paving the way for more sustainable growth in the long term. For Ethereum price , a short-term pullback could provide a healthier foundation for future rallies. These historical patterns underscore the importance of recognizing the signs of overheating, even for fundamentally strong assets like Ethereum. While the underlying technology and ecosystem of Ethereum continue to grow, market sentiment can temporarily override fundamentals, leading to periods of overvaluation. The current buzz around Ethereum price is undeniable, driven by significant rallies and widespread enthusiasm. However, the surge in social dominance to ‘extreme euphoria’ levels, as highlighted by Santiment, serves as a potent reminder of potential short-term volatility. While broader market indicators may not yet signal a complete top, the specific exuberance around ETH warrants caution. Investors are encouraged to remain vigilant, manage their risks, and base their decisions on a comprehensive understanding of both sentiment and fundamental data. The crypto market is a marathon, not a sprint, and navigating its peaks and valleys requires a strategic and disciplined approach to secure long-term success in your Ethereum price investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Ethereum Price Q1: What does ‘extreme euphoria’ mean for Ethereum price? A: ‘Extreme euphoria’ for Ethereum price typically refers to a period where social media mentions and public sentiment about ETH reach exceptionally high and overwhelmingly positive levels. Historically, such periods often act as a contrarian indicator, suggesting that the asset might be overvalued in the short term and prone to a price correction as most potential buyers have already entered the market. Q2: Why is the ETH/BTC ratio important for Ethereum price analysis? A: The ETH/BTC ratio measures Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin. A rising ratio indicates that Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, often signaling a shift of capital into altcoins. While a strong ETH/BTC ratio is positive, a rapid surge, like the recent 70% jump, can suggest an overheated market for Ethereum price , indicating speculative fervor that might not be sustainable. Q3: What are ‘broader market indicators’ and how do they relate to Ethereum price? A: Broader market indicators encompass a wider range of data points beyond just social sentiment, such as on-chain metrics (e.g., exchange flows, active addresses), derivatives market data (e.g., funding rates, open interest), and institutional investment flows. While Ethereum price might show signs of euphoria, if these broader indicators don’t reflect ‘peak frothiness,’ it suggests the overall crypto market might still have room to grow, potentially cushioning a sharp ETH-specific downturn. Q4: What actionable steps can investors take given the current Ethereum price outlook? A: Given the mixed signals for Ethereum price , investors should consider several actionable steps: assess personal risk tolerance, diversify portfolios, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate volatility, stay informed but avoid emotional decisions (FOMO/FUD), and contemplate profit-taking strategies if significant gains have been realized. Prudent risk management is key. Q5: Have we seen ‘extreme euphoria’ for Ethereum price before? A: Yes, periods of ‘extreme euphoria’ are a recurring theme in cryptocurrency market cycles, including for Ethereum price . Past bull runs (e.g., 2017, 2021) saw similar surges in social excitement and speculative activity, which were often followed by significant market corrections. These historical precedents highlight the importance of recognizing and understanding market psychology. Did you find this analysis of Ethereum price insightful?

Stating that these BTCs were moved after remaining dormant for 14 years, Ju claimed that the funds first originated from the MyBitcoin wallet service, which collapsed in 2011. Ju made the following statement on social media: The latest transfer of 80,000 BTC, which had lain dormant for 14 years, originally came from wallets hosted by MyBitcoin. These wallets had been inactive since April 2011, before MyBitcoin was hacked and collapsed in July 2011. It is highly likely that these BTC belong to either the hacker or the anonymous founder, Tom Williams.

Galaxy Digital, meanwhile, announced that it had completed one of the largest nominal Bitcoin transactions in history. The company completed the sale of over 80,000 Bitcoins on behalf of a client. According to Galaxy, the transaction, currently valued at over $9 billion, was made as part of a legacy planning strategy for a Satoshi-era user who was one of Bitcoin's early investors. *This is not investment advice.

As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop, as it has entered a price discovery mode. This optimism has been directly fueled by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , skyrocketing institutional adoption , much clearer regulations, and unwavering political support from figures like President Trump.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 (H1 2025) Bitcoin’s performance during the first half of 2025 was mixed, reflecting a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In Q1, the price action remained subdued, primarily due to lingering concerns around U.S. tariff implementations and heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. These global issues weighed heavily on market sentiment, keeping BTC in a consolidation phase. However, Q2 brought a notable turnaround. By April and May, easing geopolitical tensions and improved macro signals helped Bitcoin stage a strong rally. By the third week of May, BTC surged to $112,000, marking a significant recovery from earlier lows. Then the price retraced from its May peak, even positive factors like a positive U.S. jobs report on June 6 and resumed U.S.-China trade talks back in June were overshadowed when rising geopolitical concerns between Israel and Iran tensions worsened, triggering renewed selling pressure. On June 17, the situation escalated even sharply when U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s Supreme Leader. Iran’s defiant response and subsequent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June sent BTC sliding to $98,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price performance in July 2025 has been nothing short of extraordinary. Since breaking out of its consolidation phase in the last week of June, Bitcoin price has been propelled by whale accumulation, a surge in spot trading volume, and a confirmed technical breakout from a bullish flag pattern. On July 14th, this momentum led Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high of $123,231. However, the excitement was tempered as traders began to take profits, causing the market to pause and recover from its exhaustion. Currently, the RSI has dropped from 75 to 52, nearing the neutral line, indicating a fierce battle between bulls and bears. This suggests that Bitcoin may cool off further and retest the 50-day EMA band, where renewed buying pressure could spark another rally. In the short term, Bitcoin has flipped the $116 level and is now retesting the 20-day EMA band at around $115,000. If it dips below this mark, it could retrace to the $110,000 swing low support zone, with the final line of defense resting at approximately $101,000. On the flip side, if the Bitcoin reverses from $115K then by surpassing the ATH it could eye the psychological milestone of $125,000. If the upward momentum persists, this level could be tested before the month concludes.

Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

At the heart of this discussion lies the critical need for robust crypto regulation that protects consumers and maintains financial stability. Recently, this debate intensified as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent voice for consumer protection, delivered a scathing critique of the newly enacted GENIUS Act, warning that its industry-driven nature could leave the American public vulnerable. Her concerns underscore a fundamental tension: how to foster innovation while safeguarding against systemic risks in the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency ecosystem. What’s the Fuss About the GENIUS Act and Crypto Regulation? Senator Warren’s strong words, shared in an interview with Vanity Fair and reported by Decrypt, highlight a deep-seated apprehension regarding the GENIUS Act. While she acknowledges the undeniable necessity for comprehensive crypto regulation , her core contention is that this particular piece of legislation was heavily influenced by intense lobbying from the cryptocurrency industry itself. In her view, this effectively allowed the very sector that needs oversight to dictate the terms of its own governance. Think of it this way: imagine a scenario where the companies being regulated get to write the rulebook. Senator Warren suggests that this is precisely what has transpired with the GENIUS Act, raising serious questions about its impartiality and effectiveness in truly protecting the public interest. This isn’t just a theoretical concern; it draws on historical precedents that have had profound and painful consequences for the American economy. Echoes of the Past: Is History Repeating Itself in Crypto Regulation? One of Senator Warren’s most striking comparisons links the GENIUS Act to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA). For those unfamiliar, the CFMA was a landmark piece of legislation that largely deregulated over-the-counter derivatives, including credit default swaps. Warren contends that this deregulation played a significant role in setting the stage for the devastating 2008 global financial crisis. Her argument is clear: by allowing a financial sector to operate with minimal oversight, especially one as complex and interconnected as derivatives or, in this case, cryptocurrencies, you invite systemic risk. The fear is that the GENIUS Act, by granting the crypto industry too much autonomy in shaping its own crypto regulation framework, could lead to similar vulnerabilities, potentially leaving taxpayers and the broader economy to “pay the price” for future market instability or collapse. The Perilous Promise of Stablecoins: A Misleading Presumption of Safety? A specific area of concern for Senator Warren is how the GENIUS Act treats stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or to a commodity like gold. They are often seen as a less volatile bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, facilitating transactions and providing liquidity. However, Warren worries that the GENIUS Act bestows a “misleading presumption of safety” upon stablecoins. This implies that the bill might not sufficiently scrutinize the reserves backing these stablecoins, or the mechanisms by which they maintain their peg. If these reserves are insufficient, illiquid, or poorly managed, a stablecoin could “break the peg,” leading to significant losses for holders and potentially triggering wider market panic. Such an event could: Erode Consumer Trust: If a stablecoin collapses, it could shatter public confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market, hindering legitimate innovation. Trigger Bank Runs: Warren specifically warns that inadequate stablecoin regulation could increase the risk of future bank runs. If stablecoin issuers hold traditional assets in banks, and a large redemption event occurs, it could put immense pressure on those banking institutions, potentially leading to liquidity crises. Create Systemic Risk: As stablecoins become more integrated into the financial system, their failure could have ripple effects, impacting traditional markets and financial institutions. This concern is not new; the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) in May 2022, an algorithmic stablecoin that lost its dollar peg and wiped out billions in value, served as a stark reminder of the inherent risks when crypto regulation is absent or insufficient. Navigating the Complex Landscape of Crypto Regulation: What’s at Stake? The debate surrounding the GENIUS Act and Senator Warren’s criticism underscores the immense challenges in crafting effective crypto regulation . On one hand, proponents of a lighter regulatory touch argue that excessive rules could stifle innovation, push crypto activities offshore, and prevent the U.S. from maintaining its leadership in this emerging technology. They often emphasize the decentralized nature of crypto and the potential for new financial paradigms. On the other hand, regulators like Senator Warren emphasize the paramount importance of consumer protection, financial stability, and preventing illicit activities. They argue that without robust oversight, the crypto market remains a Wild West, ripe for fraud, manipulation, and systemic risks that could eventually spill over into the traditional economy. The goal, from this perspective, is not to halt innovation but to channel it responsibly within a secure framework. Key Considerations for Effective Crypto Regulation: Crafting balanced crypto regulation requires careful consideration of several factors: Defining Crypto Assets: Are they securities, commodities, or something else entirely? Clear definitions are crucial for determining which regulatory bodies have jurisdiction. Consumer Protection: How can investors be shielded from scams, hacks, and market manipulation? This includes disclosure requirements, anti-fraud measures, and mechanisms for recourse. Financial Stability: How can systemic risks posed by large crypto firms, stablecoins, or interconnected markets be mitigated? This involves capital requirements, stress tests, and clear resolution authorities. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Ensuring that crypto is not used for illicit purposes is a global priority, requiring robust identity verification and transaction monitoring. Cross-Border Harmonization: Given crypto’s global nature, international cooperation on regulatory standards is vital to prevent regulatory arbitrage. The Path Forward: Can We Achieve Balanced Crypto Regulation? Senator Warren’s critique serves as a potent reminder that the legislative process for crypto regulation is far from over. Her concerns, particularly about industry influence and the potential for systemic risk, resonate with many who advocate for a more cautious and consumer-centric approach. While the GENIUS Act has passed, the conversation around its implications and the broader need for sound digital asset policy will undoubtedly continue. For the public, investors, and policymakers alike, the challenge lies in finding a delicate balance. How can we harness the transformative potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies while simultaneously building robust safeguards against the very real dangers of financial instability and consumer harm? This will require ongoing dialogue, thorough analysis, and a willingness to learn from past mistakes. The ultimate goal should be a regulatory framework that fosters innovation responsibly, ensuring that the benefits of this new financial era are widely shared, and the risks are effectively managed. Senator Warren’s intervention is a critical moment, pushing back against what she perceives as an overly lenient approach to a sector that demands stringent oversight. Her call to action is clear: the public must remain vigilant, and lawmakers must prioritize robust safeguards over industry demands to prevent a repeat of past financial crises. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Crypto Regulation and the GENIUS Act Q1: What is the GENIUS Act? A: The GENIUS Act is a recently passed U.S. legislation intended to provide a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies. While its full scope is still being interpreted, Senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized it for being overly influenced by the crypto industry. Q2: Why is Senator Elizabeth Warren concerned about the GENIUS Act? A: Senator Warren is concerned that the GENIUS Act is industry-driven, potentially allowing the crypto sector to write its own rules. She fears it could lead to financial instability, similar to the 2008 crisis, and gives a misleading presumption of safety to stablecoins, increasing the risk of bank runs. Q3: How does Senator Warren compare the GENIUS Act to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000? A: She compares them by highlighting that both pieces of legislation, in her view, represent significant deregulation pushed by industry. She argues that the CFMA contributed to the 2008 financial crisis by deregulating derivatives, and fears the GENIUS Act could have similar negative consequences for crypto regulation . Q4: What are the risks associated with stablecoins, according to Senator Warren? A: Senator Warren believes the GENIUS Act gives stablecoins a “misleading presumption of safety.” Her concern is that if stablecoins are not adequately regulated or backed, they could de-peg, cause significant losses, and potentially trigger bank runs by putting pressure on the traditional banking system. Q5: Why is robust crypto regulation important for the public? A: Robust crypto regulation is crucial for protecting consumers from fraud and scams, ensuring financial stability by mitigating systemic risks, preventing illicit activities like money laundering, and fostering a trustworthy environment for legitimate innovation in the digital asset space. Q6: What are the main challenges in establishing effective crypto regulation? A: Key challenges include defining crypto assets, balancing innovation with consumer protection, addressing cross-border complexities, ensuring financial stability without stifling growth, and combating illicit finance.

The altcoins are also well in the green today, with ETH jumping back above $3,700 and SUI marking a notable double-digit surge. BTC Reclaims $117K The primary cryptocurrency was in a consolidation phase since July 14, when it hit a new all-time high of over $123,000. In the following ten days or so, it remained sideways around $118,000, with a few brief attempts for a breakout in each direction. The buyers and sellers managed to maintain equilibrium for a while, but the bears took control on Thursday evening as Galaxy Digital began disposing of massive portions of BTC. In a matter of hours, bitcoin’s price tumbled from over $119,000 to a two-week low at $114,500. After dumping by more than four grand, the bulls finally reemerged and didn’t allow a further breakdown. Just the opposite, BTC bounced off and jumped past $117,000, where it stands as of press time as well. Crypto analysts believe this could be a pivotal moment if it manages to maintain above this level, as it could open the doors for fresh ATHs next week. It’s very clear; if #Bitcoin can hold above $116.8K, then we’ll start to see new highs in the coming week. pic.twitter.com/jC0Gpg9db7 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 26, 2025 Alts in Green The altcoins experienced substantial losses at the end of the business week but have reacted well today, with notable gains. Ethereum is above $3,700 once again after a 3.5% daily jump. XRP defended the $3 resistance and is now at $3.15. Solana, HYPE, XLM, LINK, and BCH have charted even more impressive gains, while SUI and HBAR are up by double-digits. The former has tapped $4, while the latter is above $0.26. The top performers from the largest 100 alts include ENA (17%), SPX (14%), and SKY (13%). The total crypto market cap has gained roughly $70 billion since yesterday’s bottom and is up to $3.940 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets, is gaining renewed traction as institutional adoption expands and its prolonged legal standoff nears resolution. Since President Trump returned to office, XRP has seen a surge in on-chain activity, bullish investor sentiment, and increasing chatter around a possible XRP ETF approval. In July 2025, XRP marked a new all-time high of $3.66 , coinciding with the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF , which is a milestone that further fueled optimism. With more asset managers eyeing approval and institutional capital flowing in, investors are now closely watching where XRP could head next in this evolving market landscape. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 3.15744080 2.65% Market cap $ 187,045,677,295.50 Circulating Supply 59,239,646,627.00 Trading Volume $ 6,727,417,006.9144 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In the first half of 2025, the XRP price movement transitioned from a period of decline into a phase of consolidation. In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half’s last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94 triggered by a ceasefire news between the US, Israel, and Iran. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple’s CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case . Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has also officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Nate Geraci , president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into XRP also increased. The ongoing July is filled with positive sentiment that continues to strengthen the XRP price. The investors have been engaged in a “buy-the-dip” mindset, and investor panic appeared to subside. In July, several more factors joined, like Grayscale added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund , and Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. More developments that are supporting the ongoing bullish sentiment are due to the third week of July’s events, for instance, Ripple partners with Ctrl Alt and Dubai Land Department for tokenized real estate on XRP Ledger, which has boosted its utility. The top two major highlights of July is that ProShares launched the first XRP futures ETF on July 18; as a result, the XRP price spiked massively, and other one is that the key crypto bills are passed in the US House of Representatives, including the long-awaited GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act. The recent developments surrounding XRP have sparked optimism, particularly with the potential for increased legal clarity for digital assets. The debut of a spot ETF has raised hopes that other asset managers’ applications for spot XRP ETFs could be approved by the end of the year. On the charts, XRP’s rally resembles a breakout from the upper resistance of a falling wedge pattern. Since the third week of June, XRP has gained nearly 85%, and from the second week of July, it surged over 60%. However, the momentum faced a setback when a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen dumped $200 million worth of XRP in the past ten days, coinciding with XRP nearing local highs. This move led to accusations that Larsen was cashing out at the expense of retail investors, with some claiming that those buying the dip were merely providing exit liquidity. This turmoil triggered a significant profit-taking wave, causing XRP’s price to plummet 19% from its all-time high to $2.95 in just a few days during the fourth week of July. Yet, the price quickly rebounded from $2.95 to $3.08, with many on social media suggesting this was a strategic dip to attract larger investors. Experts are now encouraging buyers to seize this opportunity, believing a more substantial rise is on the horizon. The community sentiment is clear: “The strong will remain, while the weak will fall.” From a technical standpoint, the golden cross between XRP’s 20-day and 50-day EMAs has expanded, indicating bullish potential. If XRP continues to rise, it could soon retest the $3.40 and $3.66 levels by the end of July or into August. Conversely, if the price fails to hold the $3.00 support, a retest of the $2.60 and $2.40 levels may be on the table. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $1.95 $3.00 $4.00 XRP AI Price Prediction For August 2025 Platform Low Price Average Price High Price Claude $3.00 – $3.15 $3.50 – $4.00 $7.50 – $8.20 Blackbox $2.50 $3.50 $5.00 Gemini $3.00 – $4.00 $4.50 – $6.00 $6.50 – $8.00+ XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A recent insight from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has captured significant attention, suggesting a fascinating new trend: ETH unstaking is increasingly driven by a strategic redirection of assets towards Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies. This isn’t just a technical move; it represents a significant evolution in how investors approach yield generation and capital appreciation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. What’s Driving the Surge in ETH Unstaking? Cathie Wood, a respected voice in the investment world, recently highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) several catalysts accelerating this shift. It’s a confluence of factors creating a powerful gravitational pull for staked Ethereum (ETH) towards these innovative new structures. Let’s break down the key drivers: Robinhood’s Crypto Transfer Bonus: The popular trading platform Robinhood has introduced a compelling 2% crypto transfer bonus. For many investors holding staked ETH, this bonus acts as a direct incentive to unstake their assets and move them to platforms or structures that can leverage such offers, including DAT companies. It’s a tangible financial benefit that makes the transition more attractive. Increasing Venture Capitalist (VC) Interest: VCs are always on the lookout for the next big thing, and their growing focus on the digital asset space, particularly around infrastructure and yield-generating solutions, is undeniable. Their investments provide crucial capital and validation for emerging models like DATs, signaling confidence in their long-term viability and potential for growth. Institutional Investor Adoption: Beyond VCs, traditional institutional investors are also deepening their involvement in crypto. As they seek regulated and efficient ways to gain exposure to digital assets, solutions offered by DAT companies that combine staking rewards with potential for price appreciation become highly appealing. These institutions often require more structured and compliant pathways than individual investors, and DATs are emerging as a viable answer. These forces collectively create a powerful incentive for investors to reconsider their long-term ETH holding strategies, particularly concerning ETH unstaking from traditional staking pools and reallocating it to more dynamic solutions. Understanding Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) Companies: A Game Changer for Staked Ethereum? So, what exactly are Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies, and why are they becoming so central to the conversation around ETH unstaking ? Essentially, DATs are innovative financial structures designed to optimize the utility and returns from digital assets like ETH. They offer a sophisticated approach that goes beyond simple staking. Here’s how they typically operate and why they’re gaining traction: Feature Traditional Staking Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) Primary Goal Earn staking rewards for network validation. Optimize yield through staking, combined with capital appreciation strategies. Liquidity Often locked for periods; less liquid. Aims for greater flexibility and potential for liquidity post-unlock. Exposure Yield from staking; direct price exposure. Yield from staking plus strategic exposure to price appreciation once unlocked. Management Often self-managed or through simple pools. Professionally managed strategies, potentially involving various DeFi protocols. The core appeal of DATs lies in their ability to provide investors with the best of both worlds: consistent staking rewards from their ETH holdings, combined with the strategic advantage of benefiting from ETH price appreciation once their tokens are unlocked. This dual benefit proposition is a powerful draw for those looking to maximize their returns in the crypto space, especially after the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade enabled ETH unstaking . The Benefits of Shifting to Digital Asset Treasuries: Why Investors are Excited The move towards DAT companies isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s rooted in several tangible benefits that resonate with both retail and institutional investors. The opportunity to optimize returns while managing risk more effectively is a significant draw, especially for those who have engaged in ETH unstaking and are looking for the next strategic step. Enhanced Yield Potential: DATs aim to generate superior returns by combining traditional staking yields with other DeFi strategies, such as lending, liquidity provision, or even structured products, once the ETH is unstaked. This multi-layered approach can lead to higher overall APYs compared to staking alone. Improved Liquidity and Flexibility: A common concern with traditional staking is the lock-up period, which limits liquidity. While ETH unstaking still involves a processing time, DATs are designed to offer more flexible solutions post-unlock, allowing investors to redeploy their assets more quickly into new opportunities or access their capital when needed. Strategic Price Appreciation Exposure: Unlike simply holding staked ETH, DATs can employ strategies to capitalize on ETH’s price movements once the tokens are liquid. This could involve re-investing rewards, dynamically allocating assets, or participating in short-term market opportunities, giving investors a more active role in benefiting from market upswings. Professional Management and Diversification: Many DATs offer professionally managed solutions, which can be particularly appealing to institutional investors or individuals who prefer not to navigate the complexities of DeFi themselves. These entities can also diversify across various protocols and strategies, potentially mitigating risks associated with single-protocol exposure. Tax Efficiency Considerations: While tax regulations vary by jurisdiction, some DAT structures might offer advantages in how staking rewards or capital gains are managed, though investors should always consult with a tax professional. These benefits paint a clear picture of why a significant portion of the ETH unstaking volume is finding its way into these sophisticated treasury models. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of ETH Unstaking and DATs While the opportunities presented by Digital Asset Treasury companies are compelling, it’s crucial for investors to approach this trend with a clear understanding of the inherent challenges and risks. No investment in the crypto space is without its perils, and DATs are no exception, especially when considering the process of ETH unstaking . Smart Contract Risk: DATs, like many DeFi protocols, rely heavily on smart contracts. A bug, exploit, or vulnerability in these contracts could lead to significant financial losses. While audits can mitigate some risks, they don’t eliminate them entirely. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets, particularly complex financial instruments like DATs, is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the legality, operational efficiency, or profitability of these structures. Market Volatility: Ethereum, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to high price volatility. While DATs aim to benefit from price appreciation, a significant market downturn could still impact the overall value of the treasury, even with staking rewards. Operational Complexity: Managing a Digital Asset Treasury requires sophisticated knowledge of DeFi protocols, market dynamics, and risk management. While some DATs are professionally managed, understanding the underlying strategies is vital for investors. Unstaking Queue and Gas Fees: The process of ETH unstaking itself involves a queue, which can vary in length depending on network congestion and the number of validators exiting. Additionally, gas fees for transactions on the Ethereum network can sometimes be high, impacting profitability, especially for smaller amounts. Thorough due diligence and a comprehensive understanding of these risks are paramount before committing assets to any DAT structure. Actionable Insights for Investors: Capitalizing on the ETH Unstaking Trend For investors intrigued by Cathie Wood’s insights and the potential of Digital Asset Treasury companies, here are some actionable steps and considerations to navigate this evolving landscape, especially concerning your ETH unstaking strategy: Research Thoroughly: Before committing any capital, conduct extensive research on specific DAT companies or protocols. Look for transparency in their operations, audit reports for their smart contracts, and a clear understanding of their underlying strategies. Understand the Risk Profile: Assess your own risk tolerance. While DATs offer potential for higher returns, they also come with elevated risks compared to traditional staking. Ensure the risk profile of the DAT aligns with yours. Evaluate Liquidity and Unstaking Periods: Understand the typical unstaking queue times for Ethereum and how the DAT manages liquidity post-unlock. Does it offer instant liquidity solutions, or are there still waiting periods? Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your ETH into a single DAT. Diversifying across different protocols or strategies can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed on Regulations: Keep an eye on regulatory developments in your jurisdiction that might impact digital asset treasuries and their operations. Consult a Professional: For significant investments, consider consulting with a financial advisor specializing in digital assets or a tax professional to understand the implications of participating in DATs. By taking a measured and informed approach, investors can strategically position themselves to potentially benefit from this fascinating new direction in the world of ETH unstaking and digital asset management. In conclusion, Cathie Wood’s observation regarding the shift of ETH unstaking into Digital Asset Treasury companies highlights a significant evolution in the crypto investment landscape. Fueled by incentives like Robinhood’s bonus and increasing institutional interest, DATs offer a compelling blend of staking rewards and capital appreciation potential. While promising, navigating this space requires careful consideration of smart contract risks, regulatory uncertainties, and market volatility. For savvy investors, however, these innovative structures present a powerful opportunity to optimize their Ethereum holdings and participate more actively in the burgeoning digital economy. As the crypto market matures, the ability to adapt to such strategic shifts will be key to unlocking new levels of financial potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ETH unstaking, and why is it happening now? A1: ETH unstaking refers to the process of withdrawing staked Ethereum (ETH) from the Beacon Chain. This became possible after the Ethereum Shanghai (Shapella) upgrade in April 2023. It’s happening now as investors gain the ability to access their previously locked ETH, leading to a reallocation of assets based on new opportunities and incentives. Q2: How do Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies differ from traditional staking pools? A2: Traditional staking pools primarily focus on earning staking rewards by validating transactions. DAT companies, on the other hand, take a more active management approach. They aim to optimize returns by combining staking rewards with strategies to benefit from ETH price appreciation once the tokens are unstaked and liquid, potentially utilizing other DeFi protocols for enhanced yield and flexibility. Q3: What role do Robinhood, VCs, and institutional investors play in this shift? A3: Robinhood’s crypto transfer bonus directly incentivizes users to move their ETH, potentially to DATs. Venture capitalists provide crucial funding and validation, signaling confidence in the DAT model. Institutional investors, seeking structured and compliant avenues for crypto exposure, find DATs appealing as they offer a blend of yield and capital appreciation, driving demand for these solutions. Q4: What are the main benefits of using a DAT for my ETH? A4: The primary benefits include enhanced yield potential (combining staking rewards with other strategies), improved liquidity and flexibility for your ETH post-unstaking, strategic exposure to ETH price appreciation, and often professional management and diversification across various DeFi protocols, which can help mitigate individual risks. Q5: Are there significant risks associated with Digital Asset Treasury companies? A5: Yes, like all crypto investments, DATs carry risks. These include smart contract vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory uncertainties, the inherent volatility of the crypto market, and the operational complexity of managing diverse DeFi strategies. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence and understand these risks before participating. Q6: How can I find reputable Digital Asset Treasury companies? A6: Finding reputable DATs requires diligent research. Look for companies with transparent operations, publicly available audit reports of their smart contracts, a clear track record, and positive community reviews. Understand their fee structures, the specific strategies they employ, and their risk management frameworks. Always prioritize security and regulatory compliance. Did you find this article insightful?

This could be possible if the project seeks assistance from developments and collaborations. In contrast, factors like a prolonged bear run could spiral the price down to $0.42. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.42 $0.73 $1.05 MANA Price Analysis (H1) The Decentraland price has faced a challenging journey, hitting a low of $0.1903 on April 6, 2025. Despite this setback, the cryptocurrency made a notable recovery, doubling to $0.3935 by mid-May. However, the optimism was short-lived, as MANA price experienced a significant decline throughout the rest of May and into June, dropping nearly 38% from its mid-May peak of $0.40. MANA Price Targets July 2025 The H1 ended mutedly but H2’s July month brought a glimmer of hope as MANA began to show signs of life, riding a short-term upward trendline throughout the month. Even, It successfully flipped the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands and even retested the $0.3701 resistance level. but, this short-term excitement remained brief, as top altcoins fell, causing MANA to retreat back to the short-term upward trendline support in the fourth week of July. The trendline still holding indicates that momentum has not faded completely, and bulls are still interested in pushing higher in the upcoming sessions. Price Prediction Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) Decentraland (MANA) Price Forecast July 2025 0.19 0.37 0.56 MANA Price Forecast 2025 As market participants ponder the future of MANA, it’s essential to look at its multi-year chart. Since the FTX crash in 2021, MANA has plummeted from a staggering high of over $5.91. This long-term perspective reveals current price action as just a consolidation phase, especially when compared to its peak in 2021. In 2025, MANA finds itself at a critical juncture, down 95% from its all-time high. Therefore, if in 2025 it manages to cross $0.82, it would be the consolidation’s range upward border, which risks getting deflected again. But if it manages to break the range, then $0.82 would act as the long-term “Change of Character” level, and $1.10 could be the best target before the year concludes. If MANA can break through the $1.10 barrier by year-end, it could signal the dawn of a new bullish era for this cryptocurrency. Also, the exchange reserve data from CryptoQuant adds to the bullish sentiment surrounding Decentraland (MANA). In 2022, MANA crypto’s exchange reserves were approximately 543 million tokens, but this figure gradually declined to 449 million by 2024. This trend indicates that investors have shown sustained interest in the project and have been accumulating over the years. However, in the last quarter of 2024, exchange reserves spiked from 449 million to 477 million MANA. This increase coincided with a period of offloading as MANA began to fall. Despite this, throughout the first half of 2025, the price continued to decline, while investors took advantage of the lower prices to accumulate more tokens. As a result, exchange reserves plummeted from 477 million to an unprecedented 360.9 million MANA.

That’s usually a bullish sign of long-term confidence.” Between July 5 and July 15, whale wallets accumulated approximately 280 million XRP, representing about 0.56 % of its circulating supply. This remarkable burst of activity occurred right amid a sharp price decline, sparking a swirl of speculation about institutional conviction versus possible sell‑side manipulation. Nevertheless, the tide is changing because bulls continue to defend the psychological price of $3.10 with XRP presently standing at $3.16. Institutional Confidence Amid Chaos Whales moved aggressively while retail traders suffered over $594 million in liquidations, highlighting a divergence between long‑term holders and the “panic sellers.” Analysts interpret this behavior as strategic bottom‑fishing—accumulating at dips while anticipating future upside driven by fundamentals like ETF approvals and regulatory clarity. Several sources highlight that these purchases coincided with key technical retests around $3.00‑3.10, which had transformed from resistance into critical support zones. Whales appear to be defending this floor aggressively. Disequilibrium: Growing Sentiment vs. Weak On‑Chain Metrics Despite heavy accumulation, XRP’s on‑chain activity weakened sharply by July 24, new user growth fell to 1,899, and daily transactions dropped to 286,000, well below mid‑July levels. The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio now sits at around 699, signaling what many analysts view as overvaluation relative to utility. Wellgistics Health Integrates XRPL Wellgistics Health, a pioneering healthcare technology firm, has officially integrated the XRP Ledger (XRPL) into its operational framework. This strategic move is part of the company’s broader initiative to modernize the healthcare supply chain and improve data integrity, transparency, and efficiency in an industry often hampered by slow processes and fragmented systems. This development was revealed by Ripple attorney Bill Morgan on X, formerly Twitter. According to a recent S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Wellgistics Health detailed its intention to use XRPL as the backbone for its upcoming blockchain-powered platform. This decision reflects growing confidence among enterprise-level firms in XRPL’s capabilities particularly its scalability, speed, and low transaction costs. XRPL is a decentralized, open-source blockchain known for its energy efficiency and near-instant settlement speeds. For Wellgistics Health, this translates into real-time transaction processing across a network of pharmaceutical suppliers, distributors, and healthcare providers. Conclusion The accumulation of 280 million XRP within 10 days reflects strategic institutional conviction undercutting broader uncertainty. Although on‑chain metrics are cooling and technical indicators are mixed, whale behavior reveals confidence in XRP’s medium‑term trajectory. Additionally, Wellgistics Health’s decision to leverage XRPL positions it at the forefront of technological evolution.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-26 08:08:22

Consequently, we decided to ask four of the most utilized AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity, and Gemini) which one will stand out the most this year. ChatGPT’s List Let’s begin with ChatGPT’s answer since it’s arguably the most widely known and used of the bunch. OpenAI’s solution outlined five altcoins: Solana’s SOL, Toncoin’s TON, Ethereum’s ETH, SUI, and APT. Its case for Solana was due to the “blazing-fast” layer-1 capabilities with strong DeFi, NFT, and meme coin activity, the low fees, as well as the robust dev ecosystem. The risks associated with it were the occasional network outages and some concerns about centralization. Toncoin was next as it’s backed by Telegram – an app with over 800 million users, and it has been integrated into its wallet. It has garnered significant momentum this year in certain areas, including meme coins, games, and staking. ChatGPT believes the duo is becoming a “super app chain” in emerging markets. The AI solution listed the world’s largest altcoin as well, as the network behind it is still the “king of smart contracts, staking, DeFi, and L2s.” ETH is “institutional-friendly,” it has ETFs tracking its performance, while the risks are related to high gas fees on L1 and slow-paced scaling. Lastly, ChatGPT outlined SUI and Aptos as both operate as “high-performance chains with strong VC backing.” They are focused on gaming, speed, and UX. However, they have limited organic demand, and their tokens might fall victim to high inflation. When it came to determining its winner, ChatGPT picked Toncoin (TON): Why TON might outperform in 2025: Mass adoption angle via Telegram (already integrated natively) Viral meme coin success (e.g. NOT, MEW, DED) Gaming, staking, bots, and payments all thriving on-chain Fast, low-fee chain that’s mobile-native — a huge edge in developing markets If crypto goes mainstream in Q4 2025, TON has the best blend of hype, access, and utility to moon. Interestingly, OpenAI’s solution completely missed XRP, which is currently the second-biggest altcoin and has marked significant gains over the past several months, including marking a new all-time high. It also failed to mention another larger-cap altcoin that recorded a fresh peak recently – BNB. What Do Grok, Perplexity, and Gemini Have to Say? While all AIs agreed that ETH and SOL should be in their respective lists, they had mixed feelings about ChatGPT’s top choice, as the other three didn’t even acknowledge Toncoin. Instead of TON, SUI, and APT, Gemini indicated that XRP, BNB, and DOT have more potential this year. “Reasoning: XRP is highly focused on cross-border payments and gaining adoption among financial institutions. Regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions has provided a significant boost to investor optimism. Speculation around an XRP futures ETF further fuels its potential. “Whale” accumulation (large investors buying in) is also a positive sign.” It placed XRP in second position, right after the current altcoin leader – ETH. SOL, BNB, and DOT completed its top 5 list. Perplexity went a bit overboard. After mentioning ETH and SOL (picking the latter as its 2025 performance winner), it outlined some lesser-known alts, such as PENGU, TAO, and ONDO: “Pudgy Penguin (PENGU), a project gaining mainstream visibility through viral content and partnerships, ranks second with a 12% chance of leading gains. Other altcoins noted for strong performance potential include Bittensor (TAO), an AI-focused blockchain, and Ondo (ONDO), specializing in real-world asset tokenization, each with around 8–10% probability of top returns.” Grok’s list was the closest to ChatGPT – SOL, ETH, and SUI were the similarities, but said Chainlink and iDEGEN could complete the top five top-performers. The latter is the most surprising out of all altcoins mentioned by the AIs, and here is Grok’s reasoning: “iDEGEN: A newer AI-driven meme coin, iDEGEN is gaining traction for its low market cap and viral potential on platforms like X. Its presale success and positioning at the intersection of AI and meme culture could drive speculative pumps, with some sources suggesting it as a high-risk, high-reward pick. However, its lack of proven fundamentals makes it riskier than established coins.” Conclusion and Disclaimer It’s worth noting that all AIs said making these predictions is a speculative game, as no one can truly know which altcoin will perform better than the other. The forecasts are educated guesses given what is known at the moment, not what can happen in the future. Nevertheless, all four seemed confident that SOL will be among the best-performing assets by the end of the year. Three out of the four placed Solana’s token in first place.

Here's Why These 3 Cryptocurrencies May Skyrocket Over Next Two Days,https://bitzo.com/2025/07/weekend-surge-expected-heres-why-these-3-cryptocurrencies-may-skyrocket-over-next-two-days,"Excitement is building as three cryptocurrencies show signs of strong upward movement this weekend. Analysts and traders are keeping a close watch on these coins, anticipating significant price jumps based on recent trends and market signals. Stay tuned to discover which digital assets are poised for impressive growth in the next 48 hours. Ethereum Shows Strong Gains: Key Price Levels to Watch In the past month, Ethereum has seen a significant price increase of 47.60%, contrasting with a more modest 8.88% growth over the last six months. The one-week performance also highlights a 3.92% rise, showcasing a burst of activity driven by investor optimism. This sharp monthly rally follows periods of consolidation, suggesting renewed demand as market participation grows. Overall, the recent upward movement indicates a robust interest in Ethereum among traders. Currently, the price is positioned between $2110.94 and $2870.47, with key resistance at $3254.35 acting as a potential barrier for bullish activity. Support is identified around $1735.29, where traders watch for signs of a floor. Higher resistance comes at $4013.88, and deeper support is noted at $975.77. Indicators like the RSI at 71.57 suggest overbought conditions, while a Momentum Indicator of 476.10 and an Awesome Oscillator of 793.61 reflect underlying market strength. Trading strategies should focus on these key levels, considering breakouts above resistances or dips below supports for potential opportunities. Solana's Recent Surge Amid Long-Term Volatility In the past month, Solana recorded a notable rise of 22.33%, demonstrating strong short-term recovery despite a challenging backdrop. Over the last six months, the coin fell by 30.37%, reflecting longer-term weakness that has gradually set the stage for renewed buying interest. The mixed performance over these time frames shows that while Solana has rebounded recently, it still faces hurdles from prior downturns and sustained selling pressure in the broader market. Currently, Solana trades between a defined range of $131 and $173.35, with its nearest support line at $107.89 and immediate resistance around $191.79. The next key levels to monitor are a secondary support near $65.94 and a further resistance at approximately $233.74. Technical indicators suggest limited extremes and balanced contest between bulls and bears. There is no clear directional trend, and recent movements contrast with persistent long-term pressure. Trading ideas include waiting for a move above $191.79 for a bullish entry while eyeing potential dips toward $107.89 to target a bounce, engaging within these established critical levels. SUI Price Trends: Analyzing Recent Movement and Current Levels SUI surged by about 30% over the past month, though the six-month trend shows a decline of nearly 12%. This behavior highlights increased volatility and shifting investor sentiment. The recent price increase contrasts with an overall downtrend, indicating a dynamic market environment. While the short-term rally has pushed the coin into a higher trading range, the longer-term performance raises caution. Price corrections have led to rapid movements and mixed signals from momentum indicators, suggesting that buyers have made recent gains, but market pressures remain evident over the longer period. SUI is currently trading between $2.19 and $3.48, with solid support at $1.59 and resistance at $4.19. Additional boundaries range from $0.30 on the downside to $5.49 on the upside, creating clear trading zones. Momentum oscillators present mixed signals, with a slightly positive output from the Awesome Oscillator opposed by a negative reading from the momentum indicator. The RSI stands around 54, indicating neutrality. The market is defined by a struggle between bulls and bears, with opportunities to buy above $1.59 or sell if the price breaks below support. Traders should manage stop-loss orders carefully while watching these levels for clearer direction. Conclusion ETH , SOL , and SUI show strong potential for a rapid uptick. Market trends point to increased interest and trading activity. These coins are set to benefit from favorable conditions and recent developments. Investors are eyeing them for quick gains as the weekend approaches. The anticipation around these assets suggests an upward trajectory in the near term.

This was confirmed by Galaxy in a statement released today. The anonymous client behind the sale is one of the earliest holders of bitcoin, with the transaction forming part of what the firm described as a long-term estate planning strategy. The sale happened on Thursday, when Mike Novogratz’s firm began sending billions in BTC to exchanges. The total amount moved was around $4 billion, with wallet activity traced by Arkham Analytics. The act of moving coins to exchanges doesn’t automatically mean a liquidation, but in this case, Galaxy later withdrew about $1.15 billion in stablecoins, meaning that a significant portion of the assets had in fact already been sold. Sale pulls early coins into circulation and shakes up price movement Galaxy didn’t identify the seller but described the move as a carefully planned financial step by the investor, who had sat on this stash since the early 2010s or earlier. Bitcoin’s price, which had dropped to under $115,000 overnight, bounced back slightly on Friday to $117,200, though it still remained 1.2% down over the previous 24 hours. That rebound came despite large volumes moving into active markets. The crypto had been trading within a narrow range for the past four days. While the sale didn’t crash the market, it did raise new concerns about liquidity and sell-side pressure. As trading volume picked up, debates over valuation resurfaced. Bitcoin’s worth, like always, hinged on what the next buyer is willing to pay. Citigroup report breaks down new valuation models and trends On the same day the sale became public, Citigroup analysts Alex Saunders and Nathaniel Rupert released a detailed report on how to assess bitcoin’s price. “The price of bitcoin ultimately depends on how many people want to hold it,” the report said. The updated framework introduced by Citi combined previous approaches and incorporated recent macro changes. The analysis built on earlier work from 2022, which had included electricity cost as a price floor, a stock-to-flow ratio for gauging scarcity, adoption levels to evaluate the network, and macroeconomic trends, specifically, how the coin correlates with equities and the dollar. The latest update didn’t just rehash those points. It introduced a more urgent tone, claiming that crypto is now too significant to be ignored. “Back in 2022, the question was whether crypto had any impact on the real economy. Today, the question is how much exposure investors already have—whether they realize it or not,” Saunders said. The report said that crypto assets have grown to the point where their market caps rival major public companies, and they’re now embedded in top financial indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell. One figure stood out. Crypto-related holdings now account for 7.6% by weight in Bloomberg’s U.S. Convertible Liquid Bond Index. Much of that exposure ties back to MicroStrategy, which has long been a major institutional holder of bitcoin . That number alone is why, as Citi put it, “even crypto-agnostic clients must now track these markets.” The purpose of the new model was to help clients understand their crypto exposure without guessing or relying on rough price estimates. And while adoption remains one of the core inputs, Citi warned that increased involvement from traditional finance, especially if regulatory clarity continues, will blur the lines between crypto and the traditional market even more. “Traditional institutions are already in it, whether they like it or not,” Rupert added. “The regulatory signals are clearer, and the stakes are higher.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Bitcoin|BTC|Galaxy Digital,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|ARKM,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 08:41:02

A 'whale' investor, inactive for years, has dramatically re-entered the Bitcoin scene by shifting a staggering 80,000 BTC. This article dives into the nuances of this major market event, its implications for Bitcoin's price stability, and the broader financial landscape influenced by such transactions. Understanding the Scale of the Transaction Between July 15 and July 18, the crypto community was abuzz with news that an ancient whale wallet had been reactivated, transferring bitcoins worth approximately $9.54 billion at an average price of $118,950 per BTC. This significant move was captured by cryptocurrency analysis firm, SpotOnChain , marking it as one of the most monumental transactions in recent history. Bitcoin's Reaction to the Whale's Move Upon the announcement, Bitcoin's trading price experienced fluctuations, oscillating between $115K and $121K. This range lay just below a critical resistance level at $125K. A breach of this resistance could potentially propel Bitcoin's price towards the $131K mark, representing a near 9% increase from its current position.

An ancient whale has shifted 80,000 BTC, sparking questions about market impact. The move raises concerns about Bitcoin's ability to handle the selling pressure. Over the past few days, Bitcoin markets have witnessed seismic movements stemming from the reactivation of a legendary whale wallet. According to analytics by Spotonchain, over 80,000 BTC—worth approximately $9.54 billion—were moved between July 15 and 18. These coins, reportedly dormant for years, were transferred at an average price of $118,950, signaling a rare and momentous shift in supply dynamics.

The price is pressing against a nearby resistance at about $125K. If Bitcoin breaks this level, we might see it aim for around $131K. This move represents a potential growth of nearly 9% from its recent position. Even though the trend shows a slight drop over the last week, Bitcoin has climbed about 9% in the past month and 10% over six months. Indicators like the RSI and Stochastic show it has more room to grow. Bitcoin’s journey remains promising as it eyes the higher resistance levels.

Its dynamic structure and higher yield (over 40%) make it intriguing but prone to NAV erosion. This is why it’s better to treat it as a tactical tool for spot trades. It has high costs but is still fairly liquid despite its low AUM. Despite remaining high‑NAV‑erosion‑risk solutions, among the high‑income Bitcoin options, BTCI seems to offer more NAV protection. “But did you know that Bitcoin can become a yield‑generating asset?” That was the opening remark from a colleague of mine, someone “purely” from the banking world, just back from a road show of his network. He then told me about YieldMax™ Bitcoin Option Income ETF ( YBIT ) : first, it made me reflect on how here on Seeking Alpha we stay one step ahead when it comes to “financial engineering”; then, on how option income strategy ETFs are becoming an increasingly popular component, even in institutional circuits; and finally, on how little people actually understand what we’re talking about. My opinion? Yes, the strategic approach proposed by YBIT is interesting, but it’s not suitable for every type of portfolio, and, above all, it’s a step behind other solutions: in my view, BTCI positions itself better. But before explaining why, you need to know that … The Vision Of … YieldMax is always very clear : the primary goal is to create a current monthly income. Tracking Bitcoin , we could say, is a sort of side question for the management. Data by YCharts And I have to say, the way they achieve this goal is more articulated than what has been done with other ETFs: simply because it’s “dynamic.” That is, they don’t use a single strategy; instead, they have a book of alternatives, and in this it reminds me a bit of LFGY , a YieldMax ETF that I honestly appreciate. According to the prospectus , YBIT can make use of synthetic covered calls: buying calls + selling puts to replicate the underlying ETP without physically owning it. But also the classic standard covered call writing, selling out‑of‑the‑money calls (0%–15% above the current price), as well as opportunistic credit call spreads, meaning in certain cases they sell calls and buy higher calls to capture part of the additional upside. All this with intensive use of FLEX options (customized options) and collateral in U.S. Treasury securities with maturities from 6 months to 2 years. synthetic covered calls classic standard covered call opportunistic credit call spreads Let me say it: a book of strategies that almost seems to tell the investor, “trust our management, we will manage to profit through various market phases.” That semi‑active management that often, however, is an illusion of security . But let’s get straight to the point… is it really so? Partly Yes, But… First of all, this “multi‑strategy option” approach has a cost: 4.76% when adding up the various items. A factor that certainly cannot be ignored. YBIT - Fund Profile (Seeking Alpha) And it has a low AUM of $147M, which shifts my concern to liquidity. A concern that is unfounded, because the bid/ask spread is 0.09%, therefore quite tight, and surprisingly, the average daily volume is over 930% higher than the average: so the slippage risk is reduced compared to other ETFs with that level of AUM. YBIT - Liquidity Grade (Seeking Alpha) But costs are secondary, and what we care about is performance: a variable element by definition, even though the yield since inception has been pleasantly steady, especially in distributions. As of now we are talking about a TTM yield of around 78%, paid monthly. A distribution that, judging from the 19a filings , is 97% ROC and only 2.59% income. YBIT - Dividend Grade (Seeking Alpha) Considering that the SEC yield is 1.54%, it means the income naturally comes from option premiums. So, in my view, to really understand whether the multi‑strategy approach is or isn’t an “illusion of security,” I look at the holding distribution. Today’s Composition Is Not The Same As Yesterday’s (Or Tomorrow’s) But this is exactly its strength. The strategy changes, theoretically adapting to market conditions: in other words, it addresses one of the main criticisms, the statistical limits of buy‑write (covered call strategy). It’s therefore impossible not to mention the constant rolling of options and the high turnover (28% in the first half) along with high implicit costs. Today, its composition is this: YBIT - Holding distribution (Seeking Alpha) ~50% options on IBIT ~45% Treasury Bills and Notes~1.7% Money Market FundCash & Other negative (–0.55%) Peer Analysis: The Illusion Of Security Quick thought: this dynamism gives YBIT a hedge. In the end, why not? Theoretically, it makes sense. The problem is that there is a chasm between theory and practice. Let me explain: Let’s suppose an investor is interested in adding an ETF of this type to a portfolio, presumably to optimize cash flows and indirectly track, through total return, at least the performance of BTC, because they are a strong supporter of the decentralized market. Is YBIT the most suitable solution? In this sense, it may help to know that, beyond YBIT, there are two other solutions worth considering: YBTC and BTCI. YBIT - YBTC - BTCI : Fund profile (Seeking Alpha) Peer YBTC: For the strategy, it uses ETFs on Bitcoin. It has a less dynamic structure , but in my opinion, it is similar to YBIT. With a medium‑aggressive distribution of about 42% annually (naturally variable), and a weekly distribution. YBTC - Fund Profile (Seeking Alpha) BTCI: it uses a Cayman subsidiary to hold Spot Bitcoin ETPs up to 25% of assets. It has a more conservative capital distribution compared to the first two, with a declared target of 25–30% annually in the prospectus, deliberately contained to preserve NAV (still actively managed, but there seems to be less flexibility in the strategies). It uses index options with Section 1256 treatment. BTCI - Fund Profile (Seeking Alpha) Risk And My Opinion What to choose? A superficial answer: excluding YBTC, because it is very similar to YBIT, the most obvious answer is YBIT, given that it has a yield of more than three times BTCI’s target. Yet, in my view, over the long term it would be a less balanced solution. My choice? With the same total return, I believe choosing the more conservative capital approach also optimizes cash flows over time (simply put, the yield leverages a larger principal). And since BTCI’s yield is still high (over 25%), I prefer BTCI. YBIT, YBTC, BTCI : Price return (Seeking Alpha) But Beware The multi‑strategy approach changes the picture; I told myself: the management might actually succeed in setting up a truly conservative multi‑strategy approach during periods of strong BTC swings, both negative and positive. This could lead YBIT’s performance to distance itself from BTCI’s. YBIT - YBTC - BTCI: Total return (Seeking Alpha) Conclusion But concretely, I prefer a solution that, regardless, manages better to preserve NAV, even though, clearly, this is not easy with BTCI either, especially over the long term and especially with option‑income‑oriented ETFs. In the end, these ETFs are like a scale: if you add too much weight to distributions, in my view these ETFs stop being core or long‑term satellite components of a portfolio and become tactical and strategic allocations for certain market phases. And YBIT, in my opinion, fully represents this setup, which is why, if I had to think of a yield‑generating alternative to Bitcoin to optimize income distribution, I would rather opt for solutions with more conservative NAV management and lower costs: in this sense, BTCI.",YBTC|BTCI|YBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-26 08:54:37

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.263, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.339. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.213, resulting in a correction to $0.168. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.23. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.21. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.25, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter), describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction July 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In July, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.29. The average price is expected to be around $0.2.

The analyst's estimated potential price level is striking: $395,000. Related News: Analytics Firm Issues Warning: Unusual Data Coming in Bitcoin Options - Here's What It Signals Referring to the past success of this indicator, Moss said that the new forecast should be taken seriously, adding, “Is the indicator still working accurately, or has it become obsolete? Only time will tell.” Moss also noted that the market is increasingly racing to accumulate more Bitcoin, with borrowing and BTC purchases through publicly traded companies increasing. In this context, he posed the following question, referring to the founders of XRP: “While the world is racing to acquire as much BTC as possible, why are XRP founders selling their holdings?” *This is not investment advice.

48974228,https://coinpedia.org/?p=486727,1753520709,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"BNB Price Analysis: Will Binance Coin Break Past $1,000 Next?",https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bnb-price-analysis-will-binance-coin-break-past-1000-next/,"The post BNB Price Analysis: Will Binance Coin Break Past $1,000 Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BNB continues to attract attention after surging to a new all-time high (ATH) of $809 on July 23. While short-term profit-taking caused a minor pullback, bullish momentum remains intact — and investors are now asking: Can BNB hit $1,000 next? BNB Price Action – July 2025 Overview BNB started the month at $646.31. In the first week of July, it consolidated between $643.58 and $664.64 — a narrow band suggesting accumulation. But on July 9, BNB broke above resistance with a 1.24% gain, kicking off a sharp uptrend. Between July 9 and 22, the token climbed by over 19%, forming a strong pattern of bullish daily candles. On July 23, BNB momentarily touched $809, setting a new record. It later pulled back slightly, closing the day at $786.73. Since then, the token has dipped just 0.74%, and is now trading around $781.61 — still within striking distance of its ATH. Can BNB Reach $1,000? From a technical perspective, BNB continues to trade within a rising price channel on the daily chart. This structure suggests a bullish long-term trend is still in play. Key Resistance: $809 — the current ATH Key Target: $1,000 — a psychological milestone and potential breakout zone However, momentum indicators like RSI and MACD suggest slightly cooling buyer enthusiasm, which may delay further upside unless new catalysts emerge. Analyst Note: According to crypto market analyst Daniel Weller, “BNB’s climb past $800 marks institutional conviction. A clean break above $809, on high volume, could open the path to $1,000.” Key Support Levels & Risk Assessment Despite bullish sentiment, BNB faces short-term risks if support levels break. 50-Day SMA: $678.96 50-Day EMA: $694.07 Short-Term Support: $743 (July 24 daily low) Currently, BNB trades ~12.42% above its 50-day EMA, a sign of extended momentum. However, if price slips below the $743 support or the 50-day SMA, seller confidence could grow, especially amid broader market pullbacks. Risk Note: February’s BNB correction — triggered by sudden whale selling — remains fresh in traders’ minds. While sellers are active again, current pressure appears muted in comparison. Institutional Demand is Fueling the Rally Recent on-chain data from ChainLens.io and WhaleTrack shows aggressive accumulation by institutional players. Windtree Capital: Invested $ 520 million, with 99% allocation to BNB Nano Labs: Acquired $90 million worth of BNB in a single week These moves highlight growing confidence in BNB’s long-term value proposition, especially as Binance expands its BNB Chain ecosystem into AI, DeFi, and real-world asset tokenization. “Institutional buying adds both price stability and upside pressure,” says blockchain strategist Maya Chen. “These investors aren’t flipping tokens—they’re positioning for the future.” Bottom Line: What to Watch Next BNB’s price trajectory remains bullish — but a breakout above $809 is essential to unlock further upside. Key Factors to Monitor: Institutional wallet activity on-chain Trading volume near resistance zones Broader crypto market sentiment Regulatory updates impacting BNB Chain projects If BNB successfully clears $809 with strong volume, the $1,000 target becomes plausible — and may even lead to speculative discussions of $1,200 or more. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Earlier this week, more than $1.29 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated, closing over 277,000 traders’ positions – and the price of Bitcoin briefly dipped by almost 5% to lows around $115,000. Two of the most heavily impacted crypto assets are XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), which both saw their valuations drop by billions of dollars. While this volatility may shake short-term holders, the shrewdest investors are turning to early-stage crypto presales as a way to manage risk and diversify their holdings. To help investors navigate the current wave of volatility, we’ll highlight three emerging altcoins that are currently in presale. Available at discount prices that will quickly increase as the sales continue, these tokens offer a way to diversify into high-upside opportunities with low entry points. XRP and Dogecoin Tank, Crypto Market Falls 5% in 24 Hours While the crypto markets have been on a record growth spree since early July, jumping from a total valuation of $3.3 trillion to more than $4 trillion, the last few days have come with a lot of volatility. The global crypto market cap now stands at $3.93 trillion, down 5% in the last 24 hours. The meme coin sector has also been hit, dropping by 4% over the last day. Leading altcoins such as XRP (XRP), and blue-chip meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), have been severely affected by the market’s latest dip. XRP, the third-largest crypto token in the world, is down by almost 10% in the past week. This decline could be tied to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly Donald Trump’s latest proposed tariff hikes , which have unsettled global markets. According to TradingView’s automated technical analysis , XRP currently sits in a mix of neutral and “Buy” zones for the 1-day timeframe, suggesting that traders approach this coin with caution when attempting to buy the dip. DOGE, which saw a massive rally of up to 100% between June 22 and July 21, has now pulled back to a key support level around $0.22, marking a 22% drop in five days. Although DOGE is still up 85% over the last 12 months, its recent fall underscores the volatility that often follows rapid gains. With large-cap assets under pressure, investors are increasingly seeking presale-stage tokens that may offer more upside with reduced short-term risk. Here are three of the best crypto presales that could help investors ride out the recent market dip. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) One of the standout crypto presales this year has been Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), which has already raised over $4.8 million. The token is part of a larger mission to create the first-ever Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution built specifically for the Bitcoin network. By introducing faster speeds, lower fees, and DeFi functionality to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper aims to significantly enhance the network’s utility. At the core of this innovation is the high-throughput Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which powers Bitcoin Hyper’s L2 environment. NEW Crypto – First Ever Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain! The system bridges native BTC from the Bitcoin Layer 1 onto Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2 network, using zero-knowledge proofs and a secure bridge. Once on the L2, users can enjoy near-instant wrapped BTC transfers, staking rewards, and access to decentralized apps – using the HYPER token to pay for L2 transactions. For added incentives, token holders can stake HYPER (priced at $0.0124 per token) to generate an APY (annual percentage yield) of up to 204%, with over 257 million tokens already staked. This combination of clear utility and staking appeal is a major reason why analysts like Austin Hilton see huge growth potential in Bitcoin Hyper. With its focus on scalability and innovation, Bitcoin Hyper is clearly planning to become a long-term player in the crypto space. Visit Bitcoin Hyper Presale TOKEN6900 (T6900) TOKEN6900 (T6900) has burst onto the scene with bold branding and an unapologetically absurd concept. Marketed as “the new global benchmark for brain rot finance,” the token has raised over $1.1 million in its presale by embracing humor, chaos, and community culture over traditional fundamentals. Inspired by the success of SPX6900 (SPX), which soared over 6,900% in the last year, TOKEN6900 hopes to replicate the same viral trajectory. Along with a similarly chaotic energy, the project has even minted exactly one token more than SPX’s total supply as a tongue-in-cheek nod to its roots. NEW PROFITABLE PRESALE? (TOKEN6900 Presale Review) T6900 may have no roadmap in the traditional sense, but it does have a clear mission to build a large community of loyal followers. To achieve this target, TOKEN6900 is set to allocate 40% of the total T6900 supply for marketing purposes. Notably, while the project does not promise fundamentals, it still offers a staking mechanism, with a live APY of up to 55%. Apart from retail investors, who will find T6900’s presale price of $0.0067 appealing, TOKEN6900 has also become popular among analysts such as Cilinix Crypto – who claims this could be a high-risk but potentially rewarding investment. For those bullish on the meme coin space, T6900 could be one of the year’s biggest underdog contenders. Visit TOKEN6900 Presale Snorter (SNORT) The recent market dip has affected the Solana meme coin space as well, with this sector dropping by 5% in a single day. Despite this challenge, Snorter Token (SNORT) – a new Solana-based presale – is continuing to raise between $50,000 and $100,000 daily. Combining meme coin culture with real utility, The Snorter project is preparing to launch a Telegram bot that helps users optimize their Solana meme coin trades. One of Snorter Bot’s most attractive features is its low transaction fee range. Most trading bots on Solana, such as Bonk Bot and Trojan, charge 1% per trade – but Snorter lowers this to 0.85% for users holding a minimum balance of SNORT tokens. The bot also offers automated sniping, allowing users to input a token or pool address and auto-buy as soon as liquidity appears. Snorter Token Price Prediction Show This Solana Trading Bot Could Quickly 6x! Snorter Bot uses a custom RPC cluster with MEV-resistant relayers, making trades faster and more secure. The team is also working on adding limit orders, portfolio dashboards, honeypot detection, and copy-trading functions. SNORT holders can already stake their tokens and earn up to 174% APY, with governance rights and special holder rewards also planned for the future. Due to the token’s clearly defined utility, analysts such as ClayBro believe SNORT could soar by 6x quickly. With over $2.3 million already raised, Snorter has proven itself as a top meme coin presale token to watch right now.

Key Takeaways: El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption has slowed due to IMF loan restrictions and lack of public education. The government agreed to halt new Bitcoin purchases despite publicly showcasing its holdings. The Chivo wallet will be privatized, raising doubts about the long-term role of Bitcoin in public services. Quentin Ehrenmann, the organization’s general manager, said government-backed education and adoption efforts have stalled since the IMF deal, leaving ordinary citizens behind. “Since the government entered into this contract with the IMF, Bitcoin is no longer legal tender, and we haven’t seen any other effort to educate people,” Ehrenmann told Reuters . Bukele Talks Bitcoin, But IMF Deal Blocks New Purchases While President Nayib Bukele’s administration has continued to showcase its BTC holdings, the IMF revealed that El Salvador agreed not to purchase additional Bitcoin as part of the deal. This is a direct contradiction to claims by the country’s Bitcoin Office, which stated that daily purchases were ongoing. “The government, apparently, continues to accumulate Bitcoin, which is beneficial for the government — it’s not directly good for the people,” Ehrenmann said. For more than two years in a small district in the eastern part of El Salvador, Bitcoin enthusiasts have created a learning center and provided technical support to owners of about 200 businesses and entrepreneurs on using the cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/S2bJ4YOYCf — Reuters (@Reuters) July 25, 2025 In January, the country’s legislature moved to roll back public sector involvement in Bitcoin to stay within IMF loan requirements. The shift has raised questions about the long-term viability of El Salvador’s crypto policy and whether the original vision has quietly been shelved. The Chivo wallet, once promoted as a centerpiece of the country’s Bitcoin adoption, will be shut down from public control, and the IMF clarified that while the wallet will remain operational, it must be fully privatized and no longer run on government funds. According to the El Salvador Bitcoin Office , El Salvador currently holds about 6,244 BTC, worth roughly $742 million. Some blockchain analysts, including firms like Arkham, have observed steady 1 BTC per day transfers from exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex to addresses reportedly linked to the Salvadoran government. However, whether these are official purchases or private transactions remains unclear. Governments and Institutions Continue Bitcoin Buys Other governments and companies continue to expand their Bitcoin treasuries. Japan’s Metaplanet recently acquired 797 Bitcoin for $93.6 million . Meanwhile, The Blockchain Group in France and the UK’s Smarter Web Company added over 340 BTC combined . Strategy, the first Bitcoin treasury company, posted $14 billion in unrealized gains in Q2 2025 . As reported, crypto analyst Ran Neuner claimed that crypto treasury firms are acting less like buyers and more like exit vehicles for crypto insiders . Instead of purchasing assets directly from exchanges, these companies often receive crypto contributions from existing holders, in exchange for shares that later trade at massive premiums on public markets. Skepticism around the sustainability of the crypto treasury trend is also growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures.

In a new announcement, the largest bank stock in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio says its board of directors has approved a $40 billion common stock repurchase program that goes into effect on August 1st. A stock buyback is when a company buys shares of its own stock, reducing the total number of outstanding shares, according to Bankrate. Buybacks are seen as a way to increase value for investors. Says Bank of America, “[Wednesday’s] authorization will continue providing additional capital return flexibility, reflecting the company’s commitment to return to shareholders excess capital that is not needed to support economic growth, deliver for customers and communities, invest in the future and sustain strength and stability through the economic cycle.” The new program replaces the existing program, which had $9.1 billion in common stock repurchases remaining. Bank of America also announced a dividend increase of $0.02 from the prior quarter, for a total of $0.28 per share. The dividend is payable on September 26th to shareholders of record as of September 5th. Bank of America has a market cap of $360.3 billion and is trading for $48.45 per share at time of writing. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 631.57 million shares of Bank of America, its fourth most valuable holding, behind Apple, American Express and Coca Cola.

Key Takeaways: Ripple CTO David Schwartz admitted to faking a live fan Q&A with Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath. Schwartz used pre-written questions and censored Osbourne’s profanity due to technical issues. Following Osbourne’s death, meme coins like The Mad Man (OZZY) surged over 16,800% in value. “I cheated,” Schwartz said in a post on X Thursday , explaining how he fabricated portions of a supposedly live fan interaction during his time at a company called WebMaster. Schwartz recounted being tasked with moderating the event using the firm’s old ConferenceRoom software. Ozzy Osbourne or Nothing: Fans Ignored Black Sabbath in Supposed Live Q&A The plan was to relay questions from fans to the band over the phone and transcribe their answers in real time. However, fans weren’t interested in Black Sabbath as a group — they only wanted Ozzy. “I specifically asked the moderators to give me questions that weren’t for Ozzy. There just weren’t any,” he wrote. To avoid sidelining the rest of the band, Schwartz resorted to prepared material. “I passed a canned question to each of the other band members in rotation. And I mixed what I could make out of what they said with the canned answer from their manager,” he said. The experience left Schwartz disillusioned. “At the time, I felt really bad about the whole thing. It wasn’t the authentic interaction with celebrities that I wanted it to be and that I tried to make it,” he added, noting that only “two or three” genuine fan questions ever reached the band. Schwartz also recalled having to sanitize Osbourne’s responses due to heavy profanity. I typed up Ozzy's answer as closely as I could, probably getting it way off due to the poor connection quality. I censored the C-words. And then I cheated. I passed a canned question to each of the other band members in rotation. And I mixed what I could make out of what they… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 24, 2025 “Ozzy’s answer featured the C-word a lot. The bad C-word. The one that Americans really don’t like to say. It was pretty close to the only word I could hear clearly,” he said. “I typed up Ozzy’s answer as closely as I could, probably getting it way off due to the poor connection quality. I censored the C-words.” The post comes days after the news of Osbourne’s passing at age 76. As tributes poured in, meme coins inspired by the rock legend surged in value. One token, The Mad Man (OZZY) , jumped more than 16,800% to trade at $0.003851, reaching a $3.85 million market cap. Ripple, SEC Settle Lawsuit Last month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed the company plans to withdraw its cross-appeal against the SEC, adding that the regulator is also expected to drop its own appeal. The announcement followed a US district court decision rejecting a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to reduce Ripple’s $125 million civil penalty and overturn the ruling that classified Ripple’s institutional XRP sales as securities transactions. Meanwhile, XRP saw a spike in notional open interest for its perpetual futures contracts last week. Notional open interest, the total value of leveraged positions held by traders, climbed to an all-time high of $8.8 billion , according to CoinGlass. The figure corresponds to nearly 2.9 billion XRP in open contracts. The previous record for XRP notional open interest stood at $8.3 billion, which was hit in late January before the start of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term.

48974846,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=774047,1753521570,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48974846.jpeg,Shareholders press Tesla over xAI funding,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/shareholders-tesla-proposals-xai-funding/,"Tesla told investors on Friday it has received a series of shareholder proposals focused on the company’s interest in funding Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm, xAI. This comes after Elon confirmed earlier this month that Tesla will not merge with xAI but may still invest in it, leaving the final decision up to a shareholder vote. The proposals come as concern grows over Tesla’s corporate direction, especially with xAI now tangled in government contracts, public controversies, and internal politics. According to Reuters, xAI has been pulling in major funding this year, $5 billion in debt and another $5 billion in equity, both reported by Morgan Stanley. Elon has also kept xAI closely tied to his other companies. In March, he folded the social media company X into xAI in a $33 billion deal, saying it would improve chatbot training. Since then, Tesla cars have started shipping with xAI’s chatbot Grok installed. This level of crossover between Elon’s businesses has left shareholders questioning whether Tesla’s cash should be involved. The company said it will hold its annual meeting on November 6, and that only one proposal per topic will be included in its proxy materials, in line with SEC guidelines. The cutoff date for submission is July 31. While speaking on Tesla’s most recent earnings call, Elon addressed the submissions: “Shareholders are welcome to put forward any shareholder proposals they’d like.” Tesla’s stock is already down 22% this year, and analysts point to Elon’s political visibility as one of the reasons behind it. That pressure is now amplified by the questions surrounding xAI’s reputation and government connections. Just last week, the Pentagon confirmed new contracts with four AI companies. The names included OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and, unexpectedly, xAI. The Pentagon said these multimillion-dollar deals are part of an effort to address “critical national security challenges.” But some AI experts questioned the decision to include xAI, especially given the company’s limited track record. Glenn Parham, who served as technical lead for generative AI at the Pentagon’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, told NBC News he was directly involved in planning the contracts and said xAI was not even part of the discussions when he left in March. “There had not been a single discussion with anyone from X or xAI , up until the time I left,” Glenn said. “It kind of came out of nowhere.” Grok incident and xAI’s government role raise red flags Right before the Pentagon made its announcement, xAI’s chatbot Grok had gone off on an antisemitic rant, calling itself “MechaHitler.” The company struggled to manage the fallout, even as it was launching animated AI “companions” with behavior described as sexually suggestive and violent. Despite these incidents, the Department of Defense did not disqualify xAI from the contract awards. Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader, criticized the Pentagon on the Senate floor. He called the contract with xAI “wrong” and “dangerous,” citing the Grok incident and demanding the Trump administration explain how xAI made it through the selection process. “They must explain how this happened, the parameters of the deal and why they think our national security isn’t worth meeting a higher standard,” Chuck said. Glenn, who helped build the framework for the Pentagon’s AI program, said the plan was always centered around established players like OpenAI and Anthropic, both of which have existing contracts and partnerships with major cloud providers and the military. In contrast, xAI had no known ties to the Department of Defense before March. Each of the Pentagon’s contracts has a minimum of $2 million and a ceiling of $200 million, with the actual payment based on how well each firm performs during the prototype phase.

Founder Davis Calls LIBRA a “Memecoin,” Not an Investment",https://coinpedia.org/news/libra-memecoin-scandal-founder-davis-calls-libra-a-memecoin-not-an-investment/,"The post LIBRA Memecoin Scandal? Founder Davis Calls LIBRA a “Memecoin,” Not an Investment appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new court filing in the U.S. has revealed a surprising twist in the LIBRA token case. Crypto entrepreneur Hayden Davis now says the token was just a memecoin, not a serious project. But this comes after it was heavily promoted online and even discussed with Argentina’s President. At the same time, large money transfers were made during Davis’s meeting with top officials. With $280 million frozen , a court hearing is set for August 19. Davis Calls LIBRA a “Memecoin,” Not an Investment Davis made this statement in a recent filing with a U.S. federal court in New York, where he’s facing a legal case tied to $280 million in frozen assets. Meanwhile, Davis’s legal team claimed that LIBRA was never meant to be a real investment. He said it had no business plan, no roadmap, and no clear goals. Instead, Davis described LIBRA as a memecoin—a type of token known for being unpredictable, risky, and mostly driven by social media hype. This statement is very different from how the project was originally presented. When LIBRA first launched, it was shared widely on social media and supported by President Milei. In a now-deleted post from February, Milei said LIBRA would help support small businesses in Argentina. Davis is now clearly stepping back from those early promises. No Real Plan Behind the Token Davis’s team also said in court that memecoins are not real investments. They are risky and have no fixed value. This new statement is part of Davis’s strategy to defend himself against a lawsuit from investor Omar Hurlock. Hurlock says he lost money in the LIBRA project. But Davis argues that Hurlock can’t prove he even bought the token. He also said Hurlock’s lawyer is only chasing failed crypto projects for money. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: Founder Hints at Support for More Cryptocurrencies , Suspicious Money Transfers Raise Eyebrows While all this was happening, money was moving. On January 30, when Davis met President Milei, one of his wallets sent $499,000 in crypto to the Kraken exchange. Just 42 minutes after their meeting photo was posted, another wallet sent $507,000 using Bitget. These wallets are also linked to another token Davis launched, MELANIA, based on U.S. First Lady Melania Trump. Court Hearing Set for August 19 The court hearing on August 19 could reveal more about the LIBRA token, the money trails, and its links to top political figures. However, Davis now wants the case to be moved out of New York, possibly to Argentina or Texas. But until then, $280 million in crypto remains frozen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

48974989,https://timestabloid.com/?p=75599,1753521839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CTO Warns XRP Holders. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-warns-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, has publicly denied any association with Instagram after a user on X named Anisa referenced his alleged activity on the platform. Anisa, who described herself as focused on technical setups rather than hype, posted that Schwartz’s “recent IG posts have been solid” and encouraged others to follow his “verified Instagram profile” while emphasizing technical content. In direct response to her claim, Schwartz wrote, “I do not post to Instagram. Any profile you see there that claims to be me is a scam.” His brief but clear statement immediately dismissed any notion of his involvement on the Meta-owned platform and reiterated the long-standing issue of impersonation attempts involving Ripple executives. Schwartz, widely known in the crypto community by his handle @JoelKatz, used his verified X account to issue the denial. I do not post to instagram. Any profile you see there that claims to be me is a scam. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 24, 2025 Impersonation Concerns Across Platforms This latest interaction underscores the broader concern Ripple has consistently voiced regarding digital impersonation and scam-related activity. Schwartz’s warning aligns with Ripple’s previous alerts regarding fraudulent representations of the company and its executives on major social media platforms. In a related development covered by Times Tabloid, Ripple issued a formal alert about a series of impersonation scams targeting its followers on YouTube. According to the Times Tabloid report, scammers were hijacking existing YouTube channels and modifying them to resemble Ripple’s verified profile. These unauthorized channels were then being used to disseminate misleading content, seemingly with the intent to deceive XRP holders into participating in fraudulent schemes. Ripple clarified that these bad actors often change the usernames of compromised YouTube accounts to mirror Ripple’s official handle, “@Ripple,” which creates the appearance of legitimacy. The firm reiterated that neither Ripple nor any of its executives will ever request users to send XRP or any digital asset to unknown wallets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ongoing Security Emphasis from Ripple Ripple’s leadership has consistently emphasized the importance of verifying official communication channels. With Schwartz’s latest rebuttal regarding Instagram, the company is continuing its stance on ensuring that the community is protected from misinformation and potential scams. By directly addressing the misinformation, Schwartz reaffirmed Ripple’s position that any impersonations, whether on Instagram, YouTube, or elsewhere, should be regarded as fraudulent. The CTO’s denial also reinforces Ripple’s broader message on cybersecurity awareness and safe engagement practices within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Users are encouraged to rely only on Ripple’s official website and verified social media accounts for updates and communication, particularly regarding executives such as Schwartz. Verification and Responsible Engagement This exchange between Schwartz and Anisa highlights the challenges public figures in the digital asset space face when it comes to impersonation. Despite good-faith comments by users like Anisa, who may be unaware that the Instagram account is illegitimate, the potential for confusion remains high. As misinformation continues to circulate, Ripple executives have taken it upon themselves to clarify such issues promptly. Schwartz’s statement serves as a reminder for followers and investors to critically assess information, verify social media identities, and avoid engaging with unverified accounts that falsely claim affiliation with Ripple or its leadership.

WeWake rises as a top presale crypto, offering walletless, gasless Web3 access through smart wallets and social logins. With a clear roadmap and utility-driven tokenomics, WeWake is drawing attention from developers and early-stage crypto investors. XRP and Solana are experiencing pullbacks as the crypto market cools and Bitcoin remains flat near $120,000. Investors are now focusing on WeWake, a top presale crypto offering walletless and gasless access to Web3. With simple social logins and developer-friendly tools, WeWake is positioned to simplify crypto adoption and attract mainstream users. Altcoin Momentum Slows as XRP and Solana Retreat After a strong rally across major altcoins in July, XRP and Solana are now facing signs of short-term fatigue. While Bitcoin remains in a tight range near $120,000, traders are rotating capital away from top altcoins. XRP is down 6% from its recent local high, and Solana has retraced nearly 7%, according to CoinGecko. Analysts believe this correction is driven by over-leveraged long positions and the buildup of sell orders. “We are seeing heavy liquidation potential in Solana due to record-high open interest,” said Ryan McMillin, CIO at Merkle Tree Capital. This behavior has historically triggered fast but temporary declines across altcoin markets. Ethereum, which led the altcoin rally, is also pausing. Sell pressure on ETH has increased, with 500,000 ETH queued to unstake. Analysts expect this to affect Ethereum ETF inflows and short-term price movement. The weakening momentum in Ethereum has contributed to XRP and Solana’s recent price cooling. Bitcoin Holds Steady While Short-Term Pressure Builds Bitcoin has stayed between $117,000 and $120,000 since mid-July. This consolidation period has offered a temporary boost to altcoins, but analysts now warn of a correction. According to CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno, Ethereum’s recent strength might reverse, and that could put added pressure on Solana and XRP. CoinGlass reports a rise in ETH sell orders within 10% of its current price, showing short-term caution. Meanwhile, Solana’s open interest suggests increased leverage, which may lead to liquidations if prices drop further. These signs point to a market that is pausing rather than reversing direction. Despite short-term weakness, some analysts are still focused on the broader outlook. McMillin added, “Rate cut expectations and global liquidity trends remain supportive, and we expect continued institutional demand for digital assets.” WeWake Gains Momentum as a Top Presale Crypto While altcoins are pulling back, WeWake is drawing interest as a top presale crypto. The project introduces a walletless and gasless Layer 2 blockchain built for simple Web3 access. WeWake removes the need for traditional wallets, seed phrases, or gas fees, allowing users to sign in with Google or Telegram. This simplified onboarding process is powered by ERC-4337 smart wallets and a zk-rollup Layer 2 framework. “Onboarding into crypto should be as easy as logging into an app,” reads a statement on the WeWake site. The platform’s infrastructure enables this by using built-in Paymaster APIs to sponsor gas for all transactions. Developers can also integrate WeWake’s SDK to onboard users in seconds without downloads or wallet installations. These features make WeWake a top presale crypto as the ecosystem prepares to scale toward mainstream adoption. WeWake Roadmap and Tokenomics Draw Developer Attention The WeWake roadmap outlines four major development phases. In Q4 2025, the platform will focus on core development and integrations. These include its smart wallet architecture, Paymaster logic, and SDK release. A public testnet is scheduled for Q1 2026, followed by a mainnet launch in Q2 2026. During Mainnet, WeWake plans to activate its Paymaster API and launch on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The platform also aims to roll out Telegram-based wallet tools and open ecosystem grants for GameFi and DeFi dApps. WeWake’s WAKE token has a total supply of 308,726,951. Of this, 32% is allocated to the presale, 14% for ecosystem incentives, and 12% for governance and treasury. The rest is distributed among liquidity, staking rewards, marketing, and reserves. This structured allocation supports sustainable growth and early adoption, making WeWake a top presale crypto of interest to retail users and developers.

The president rolled out new rates, 20% for Vietnam, 19% for Indonesia and the Philippines, aimed at most of Southeast Asia’s exports, which total about $352 billion annually to the United States. But the real pain could come from a 40% tariff that Trump said would apply to any product labeled as transshipped, goods he believes are just Chinese imports rerouted through other countries. The White House has made it clear the intent is to block Chinese supply chains from bypassing earlier tariffs. But what Trump hasn’t said is how the U.S. will decide what qualifies as transshipped. That’s where things are falling apart. Companies don’t know what ingredients are going to get them hit. Is it just raw materials? What about parts, labor, or capital? Nobody’s answering, and according to Bloomberg, everyone from economists to investors is stuck guessing. Trump offers no clear standard Trump’s administration struck a deal with Indonesia last week, saying both countries would now negotiate “rules of origin” to keep third countries from sneaking goods through. But there’s still no threshold on what counts as local. A deal with Vietnam earlier this month added the same 40% tariff threat but offered no clarity. Meanwhile, officials in Thailand, which hasn’t signed anything yet, say they’ve been told they’ll have to boost local content significantly if they want to avoid the same penalties. A person familiar with the matter allegedly told Bloomberg that U.S. trade officials are still working out how to apply value-based local content requirements, with the goal of stopping goods that are just assembled with imported parts. But even a senior Trump official only said that final rules on transshipment are expected by August 1, which is when the new penalties kick in. That’s left manufacturers scrambling. Some firms aren’t waiting around for Washington to decide. Vietnam’s rules include a cap where only 30% of raw material volume can come from China . Plus, the final product value must be at least 40% higher than the cost of the imported materials. Meeting that bar means adjusting everything; suppliers, labor, and even pricing. Southeast Asia faces huge supply chain overhaul Changing suppliers is easier said than done. Eurasia Group estimates that 60% to 70% of what Southeast Asia ships out depends on Chinese-made parts, mostly industrial components. Ripping those out of the system is like trying to perform surgery on a machine while it’s still running. Right now, about 15% of Southeast Asia’s exports go to the U.S., up from 11% in 2018, but that growth is now at risk. Thai leaders are bracing for more disruption. Deputy Prime Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said they’ve heard the U.S. may demand 60% to 80% local content to avoid being flagged as Chinese. “Emerging countries or new production bases are clearly at a disadvantage,” Pichai said, pointing out that most of their industries still depend on foreign raw goods to function. Countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand have already responded to Trump’s pressure this year. They’ve introduced new rules-of-origin policies, started centralizing their customs processes, and put harsher penalties in place for goods suspected of being rerouted from China. But even with all that, enforcing these rules might not be realistic. For now, the only certainty is that Trump’s plan has dropped a massive cloud of uncertainty over Asia’s biggest manufacturing hubs. Companies are waiting for answers, countries are trying to stay compliant, and everyone is still trying to figure out what “too much China” really means.

Operated by the Ministry of Public Security’s Data Innovation and Exploitation Centre, the initiative marks a major shift in Vietnam’s digital strategy. Developed by the country’s National Data Association, NDAChain aims to act as a protective layer for critical national data systems, laying the groundwork for an integrated, blockchain-based digital ecosystem. The government plans full implementation by the end of 2025, signalling an aggressive move to overhaul data infrastructure with scalable, secure solutions. NDAChain adopts hybrid model to address cybersecurity and scalability NDAChain uses a hybrid blockchain architecture that combines centralised and decentralised components to overcome limitations of conventional systems. By introducing a decentralised trust layer, the government seeks to strengthen national cybersecurity and increase interoperability between platforms. The infrastructure is powered by a permissioned Layer 1 blockchain that includes 49 validating nodes run by both state institutions and large private enterprises. These include well-known Vietnamese firms such as Zalo, Masan, and SunGroup. The platform operates on a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus model, reinforced by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to ensure transactional privacy and data integrity. This setup helps scale the system while maintaining control and trustworthiness, making it suitable for critical sectors such as finance, healthcare, education, and logistics. NDA DID and NDAKey support digital identity and anti-fraud efforts To support secure identity verification, NDAChain integrates with NDA DID, a decentralised identity solution. This allows both public and private entities to confirm counterparties in sensitive transactions, reinforcing trust in digital operations. NDAKey, another component of the platform, is designed to detect scams and impersonation, addressing widespread concerns over fraud in Vietnam’s fast-growing digital economy. The blockchain network has demonstrated the ability to process up to 3,600 transactions per second, enabling it to support national-scale data operations. By combining performance with regulatory oversight, NDAChain aims to serve as the backbone for e-government services and private-sector applications alike. Government eyes full rollout and global partnerships by end-2025 The Vietnamese government has laid out a phased rollout for NDAChain. In the first phase, the platform will be integrated into key national systems, including the National Data Centre, local governments, and major universities. This is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2025. A second phase, currently under planning, will focus on international collaboration and the development of Layer 2 applications tailored to specific industries. These may include sector-specific blockchain services for logistics tracking, educational credential verification, or public health management. Vietnam’s adoption of blockchain infrastructure signals a broader push towards digitisation and long-term economic modernisation. With NDAChain, the country is aligning its data systems with global standards while retaining sovereign control over critical digital assets.

According to the bank’s valuation framework, the flagship digital currency could reach $135,000 while a more optimistic outlook sees Bitcoin surging to $199,000. The updated forecast is guided by Citi’s refined model, which emphasizes three main price drivers, including user adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs . To this end, Citi analysts Alex Saunders and Nathaniel Rupert noted that the core valuation begins with a 20% increase in user growth under a linear network model, supporting a price near $75,000. Macroeconomic headwinds, such as weak equity markets and underperforming gold , are expected to shave off about $3,200. Impact of ETFs on Bitcoin’s price However, Citi anticipates around $15 billion in net ETF inflows, which could add approximately $63,000 to the model, bringing the base-case forecast to $135,000. In its most conservative scenario, Citi expects Bitcoin to drop to $64,000 by year-end if equity markets remain under pressure and ETF inflows fall short. Citi’s analysis also indicated that ETF flows now account for over 40% of BTC’s price movements, making them a central component of the bank’s valuation model. Weekly Bitcoin returns and ETF flows. Source: Citi The analysts highlighted a strong correlation between ETF net flows and BTC returns, estimating that every $1 billion in weekly inflows adds about 3.6% to Bitcoin’s price. “Since launch, 41% of Bitcoin return variation can be explained by flows alone (the relationship is just as strong even accounting for equity returns). So far this year, we have seen just over $19 billion of flows, including $5.5 billion month-to-date. We expect flows to continue for the rest of the year,” Citi noted. The outlook also emphasized crypto’s growing role in traditional finance. In this case, Bitcoin is now included in major indices, such as the S&P 500 and Russell, with rising institutional exposure bolstering its influence across broader markets. Bitcoin price analysis Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to hold above the $115,000 support zone after a retracement from its record high of $123,000. At press time, BTC was trading at $117,594, up over 2% in the past 24 hours, though down 0.6% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Don’t Miss MUTM at $0.035, Price Predicted to 20× by 2026",https://timestabloid.com/missed-ethereum-eth-at-100-dont-miss-mutm-at-0-035/,"Ethereum (ETH)’s incredible journey from $100 to thousands of dollars remains one of the most talked-about success stories in crypto history. Early believers who jumped in at those humble prices saw life-changing returns. Today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to offer an opportunity that rivals Ethereum (ETH)’s early promise, but with an even clearer edge—robust DeFi yield mechanics that generate value daily. At just $0.035 during its Phase 6 presale, MUTM is capturing the attention of savvy investors eager to secure their position before a 20% price increase sets in at Phase 7. Innovative Stablecoin and mtToken Mechanics Driving Value Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s core innovation will lie in its decentralized stablecoin system. This stablecoin will be minted on demand by approved issuers who lock Ethereum (ETH) as collateral using a strictly overcollateralized approach. Once loans are repaid, the stablecoins will be burned, maintaining a tight peg to $1. Smart contracts will govern this mechanism, dynamically adjusting rates and parameters to preserve long-term stability. Complementing this system will be the introduction of mtTokens—ERC-20 receipts issued to depositors that represent both their principal and the interest earned. These mtTokens will not be static; their value will increase automatically over time and remain freely transferable. By staking mtTokens, users will unlock additional rewards paid in MUTM tokens, which the protocol will repurchase from the open market using its revenue. This creates a reinforcing cycle of expanding returns and growing token demand, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ahead of conventional DeFi lending platforms. Currently, Phase 6 of the presale is underway at $0.035 per MUTM, with 5% of this phase already sold, raising $13.60 million from a total supply of 4 billion tokens. With over 14,400 holders engaged, the community is steadily growing. The next phase, Phase 7, will release 170 million tokens at $0.040—a 20% jump that makes buying now a compelling proposition. The investment case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is compelling. Consider a Phase 2 investor who swapped $4,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) at $0.015 to acquire 266,666 MUTM tokens. With the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, this holding is valued at $9,333—a solid 2.33× gain. The listing price will rise to $0.06, almost doubling the position to $16,000. Looking forward, a 20× increase to $0.70 by 2026 would skyrocket that investment to an astonishing $186,666. Security and Transparency Security and transparency are key pillars for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). A thorough CertiK manual review and static analysis awarded it a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78, reflecting high trust in the platform’s smart contracts. Adding to investor confidence is a $50,000 bug bounty incentivizing white hat hackers to uncover vulnerabilities. To further reward early backers and generate buzz, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set aside $100,000 for giveaways to ten lucky participants. The roadmap ahead is well-defined and ambitious. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured into 4 phases, each unlocking new features and expanding the platform’s capabilities. The Beta launch, scheduled to debut the mint and burn stablecoin mechanism, an automatic rate engine to optimize lending rates, and smart contracts designed to protect user funds. Further phases will introduce Layer 2 integration, drastically cutting gas fees to under a cent and enabling sub-second stablecoin minting and burning—an upgrade that will accelerate user experience and scalability. Lending Models That Cater to Diverse Investor Needs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to uniquely blend two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C track will be built for stability and steady returns. For example, a user who deposits $20,000 ADA will mint 20,000 mtADA, which will grow in value to approximately $22,000 after 12 months thanks to a 10% APY. These deposits will become interest-accruing assets that can be staked to earn MUTM rewards, reinforcing the token’s value and user engagement. P2P lending, on the other hand, will serve the high-risk, high-reward niche of DeFi. Each loan will be isolated to prevent systemic risk, offering lenders attractive yields without endangering the core platform. This dual approach will broaden Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal and position it to capture both conservative and aggressive crypto investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out not just for its upcoming innovative stablecoin and mtToken system but also for its rigorous security measures, phased rollout of powerful features, and dual lending models that meet a wide array of investor needs. As Ethereum (ETH) soared from $100 to prominence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to become the next landmark opportunity in DeFi—one that savvy investors won’t want to miss.

The closure, confirmed on Friday, July 25, came without any enforcement action, according to Reuters. The probe was launched in May 2024 after the agency received 22 complaints linked to Waymo’s self-driving robotaxis. These included reports of the vehicles breaking traffic rules and acting unpredictably, with 17 of those reports involving crashes. NHTSA’s primary concern was that some of the incidents involved collisions with visible objects, barriers and poles that should’ve been avoided by a driver with basic awareness. Waymo responds with software fixes and recalls In reviewing the case, NHTSA said its decision was based on Waymo’s two voluntary recalls and the agency’s own technical evaluation. The first recall came earlier in 2024 after one of the company’s cars hit a utility pole. The second, in May, involved over 1,200 vehicles. This round of fixes updated Waymo’s software to better detect and avoid obstacles like chained barriers and road gates, which the company admitted had caused confusion for its system. The regulator said the investigation also covered how Waymo cars behaved around construction zones and traffic control devices, areas where the vehicles reportedly made erratic or delayed decisions. In a written statement, NHTSA added that multiple incidents involved “collisions with clearly visible objects that a competent driver would be expected to avoid.” Katherine Barna, Waymo’s spokesperson, responded on Friday, saying: “At Waymo we are committed to prioritizing safety and we’re pleased that NHTSA has concluded their investigation and closed our case.” Waymo keeps expanding, but not everyone’s on board At the moment, Waymo is running more than 1,500 autonomous vehicles in the country across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin. These cars now complete over 250,000 fully driverless paid rides each week. The company has already expanded its service to Atlanta through a partnership with Uber , and is targeting New York, Miami, and Washington, D.C. for future rollouts. But it’s not all green lights. In 2023, a Cruise vehicle, owned by General Motors, was involved in a serious pedestrian accident, pushing federal regulators to apply more pressure on all self-driving programs. As a result, GM pulled back funding and folded Cruise into its broader operations. In Greater Boston, Waymo sent out manned mapping vehicles earlier this year, signaling plans for possible expansion. Still, many officials are pushing back. On Thursday, the Boston City Council held a hearing to evaluate whether self-driving cars should even be allowed in the city. Local lawmakers made it clear: public trust isn’t there yet. Waymo has said there’s no confirmed date for a launch in Boston, as Katherine also explained the company wants to “have a robust conversation with local leaders and stakeholders” before moving forward. But the road is far from smooth. Lawmakers on Beacon Hill are reviewing multiple bills that could set rules for autonomous vehicles across Massachusetts. And even if any of those bills pass, city officials have already hinted they’ll take things slow. Get seen where it counts.

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that Ethereum could soon hit $4,000, especially if Bitcoin continues climbing toward $120,000. So, is Ethereum getting ready for its next big rally, for the first time in over a year? Strong Resistance, But No Real Drop Yet Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe expected Ethereum to drop before a big move, but that didn’t happen. Instead, ETH kept climbing and has now tested the $3,750–$3,800 zone four times, a sign that buyers are getting stronger. Van de Poppe’s chart hints that ETH might dip toward $3,250 if it shakes out some long positions first. But even if that happens, the overall trend still looks bullish. I expected to see some sort of deeper correction on $ETH , didn't come. Given that there has been four tests of the resistance already, I would assume that when #Bitcoin goes to $120K+, $ETH goes to $4K and we'll see #Altcoins provide double digit returns. pic.twitter.com/id7jpDuZem — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 26, 2025 However, Ethereum is already up 138% from its yearly low and is showing strong patterns like an inverse head-and-shoulders and a bullish pennant. These often appear before big price rallies. If ETH breaks above $3,800 with good volume, it could quickly shoot toward $4,000, much sooner than many expect. Bitcoin’s Role in the Bigger Picture Further, Michael believes Ethereum’s next big move is closely tied to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin can successfully rally toward $120,000, a target that’s gaining popularity, it could act like a spark that lights the altcoin market. In that case, Ethereum could easily shoot past $4,000, and many altcoins might follow with double-digit gains. ETF Inflows Fuel the Bullish Sentiment On top of it, Ethereum’s growing interest from institutional investors has given a push to its price. According to SoSoValue , Ethereum ETFs saw over $1.39 billion in inflows this week. While that’s lower than last week’s $2.18 billion, it’s still the 11th week in a row that institutions have been buying in. This steady demand shows that big money still believes Ethereum has more room to run.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-26 10:05:58

It suggests moving capital out of direct crypto exposure and into a new class of corporate shells that act as synthetic crypto proxies. While Wood mentions Ethereum and Robinhood, Ark has aggressively trimmed its holdings in Coinbase, HOOD, and Block. This comes in when Ethereum has gained more than 50% in the last 30 days. ETH price went to breach $3,800. Data shows that Ethereum’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) jumped by more than 37% over the last month to stand at $82.88 billion. It has finally outperformed Solana. This depicts an uptrend for staking on the Ether chain. Is this Crypto’s new leverage cycle? In an X post, Cathie Wood mentioned that Robinhood is offering a 2% match for crypto transfers. Looking at this chance, “VCs and other investors shifting staked ETH into Treasury companies (DATs) to double their money when lockups expire,” she added. This essentially incentivizes users to treat its platform like a yield-enhanced crypto vault. Behind the scenes, staked ETH is quietly being shifted into corporate entities like Bitmine (BMNR). Here, they can command outsized premiums due to legacy market inefficiencies. Wood added that advisors can give clients exposure to BTC and ETH via this. Source: Cathie Wood’s X . Brett Winton, ARK’s Chief Futurist, flagged a deeper concern over the sudden spike in Ethereum unstaking. “What’s the most economical explanation for the surge in ETH unstaking demand?” he asked in a post. “Does the staked supply chart already factor in queued withdrawals or are we headed for more downward pressure?” Winton describes the broader game at play as a classic leverage cycle. For a time, you can wrap $0.50 worth of crypto in a corporate shell and sell it to the market for $1. That arbitrage attracts more capital, and eventually the underlying assets lose liquidity or appeal. Suddenly, that $0.50 is only worth $0.25, sparking a cascade of forced selling and distressed debt workouts. Source: DeFiLlama Data. It’s a phenomenon that has echoes of 2008 financial engineering, and now it’s playing out on the rails of crypto. He highlighted that as long as these treasury stocks trade at a premium to net asset value (NAV), issuers can mint new shares. However, users can take on debt and buy more crypto. Cathi Wood’s Ark bets big on Ethereum’s shadow stocks Wood’s and the top executive’s words suggest that Ark isn’t abandoning crypto, it’s just evolving with the market. There’s no shortage of bullish catalysts, and thanks to legislative wins like the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts. According to the recent trading disclosure, Ark acquired roughly 4.4 million shares of BMNR across its ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF ETFs. At BMNR’s closing price of $39.8, this investment is approaching $175 million. However, Wood’s team also shed 218,986 shares of Coinbase (approx. worth $90.6 million), along with major cuts to Robinhood (approx. worth $11.46 million). The digital assets market went into a correction phase as the much hyped “Crypto Week” ended. However, the cumulative crypto market cap rose by over 2.5% on Saturday morning. It stands at $3.87 trillion with a trading volume of $166 billion. Bitcoin price recovered marginally after the recent fall to trade around $117,500. Ethereum turned out to be the winner lately, as it outshone several top cryptos. ETH price is running up by 107% over the last 90 days. Ether is trading at an average price $3,755 at press time.

A viral social media post claims, “Breaking: Sydney Sweeney hired by Ripple to promote $XRP in their next marketing campaign. $XRP is going to teleport to $568.” The post quickly got traction, with some investors celebrating the idea and others calling it out as fake news. BREAKING: SYDNEY SWEENEY HIRED BY RIPPLE TO PROMOTE $XRP IN THEIR NEXT MARKETING CAMPAIGN $XRP IS GOIN TO TELEPORT TO $568 pic.twitter.com/VpZeJgfdQw — Shibo (@GodsBurnt) July 25, 2025 So, is there any truth to this claim? As of now, there has been no official confirmation from Ripple or anyone associated with the company. There’s been no press release, no verified statement, and no sign that Sweeney is involved with Ripple in any capacity. So, Where Did this Rumor Come From? The origin of the rumor might allegedly tie back to Sweeney’s recent collaboration with American Eagle Outfitters. On July 23, the fashion brand launched a bold denim campaign titled “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans.” The campaign, which featured AI-generated try-ons and massive billboards across Times Square and Las Vegas, quickly went viral. American Eagle’s stock price jumped over 20 percent in a day, adding around $400 million to its market value. This success story quickly became a trending topic on social media and Reddit forums. Retail traders praised Sweeney’s influence and speculated that more brands might want to ride the wave of her popularity. That’s possibly how the idea of Ripple hiring her emerged, despite no actual link between the two. The American Eagle campaign was clearly designed to appeal to Gen Z audiences, and it worked. But in Ripple’s case, there is no indication that a celebrity-driven marketing push is on the way, at least not with Sweeney. Rumors like this tend to pop up often in the crypto space, where price movements and hype can be influenced by even the smallest bits of speculation. For now, the Sydney Sweeney-Ripple connection remains nothing more than a rumor.

That’s the philosophy many early Bitcoin believers followed back in 2011. Now, seasoned crypto traders are looking to repeat history as BTC pushes past $130,000, attention shifts from chasing highs to finding the next big breakout coin. Analysts believe the real gains lie in the undervalued tokens still trading under a cent, with enough traction and upside to flip 0.1 BTC into 10 BTC by the next bull peak. Here’s why these tokens could be the best to do precisely that. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Chain With Layer-2 Power A trader who rode Bitcoin from the 2022 bottom to this year’s peak is now rotating gains into Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — a low-cap Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Layer-2 token currently in Stage 7 of its presale. At $0.0017, it has already climbed over 50% from its early-stage pricing, with $8.9 million raised and 6.7 billion tokens sold. Analysts believe that a jump to around $0.20 seems possible once the token lists. Stage 6 of the presale was gone in a flash, and Stage 7 is moving just as fast, showing that every second may count for new buyers. Instead of loading up on Bitcoin again, this move suggests a larger plan: using steady wins from top coins to free up cash for riskier, high-reward projects. And Little Pepe fits that mold — not just for its fast Layer-2 network, but for its emphasis on community-first culture, sniper bot protection, and an innovative meme launchpad (Pump Pad). Its $777,000 giveaway, open to anyone contributing $100+ in the presale, has pulled in over 40,000 entries. The project’s visibility on CoinMarketCap and a strong Freshcoin.io audit score of 81.55 further validate its appeal. Most notably, its confirmed listing price of $0.003 means early buyers are looking at a guaranteed 2.14x return, even before price discovery. Floki Inu (FLOKI): The Viking Doge That’s Building Beyond Memes FLOKI might not be under-the-radar anymore — but it’s far from done. What began as a meme homage to Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu has matured into a serious Web3 ecosystem. Its developers have rolled out DeFi tools, NFT integrations, and a metaverse platform. Recent traction in meme coin trading and broader crypto recovery helped FLOKI regain attention, but the mix of utility and culture keeps it in play. FLOKI’s partnerships across multiple chains — from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain — and its aggressive marketing campaign make it one to watch for both short-term spikes and long-term protocol adoption. While it’s no longer in the sub-million-dollar range like LILPEPE, the team’s push toward real features — combined with meme loyalty — could help it outperform many larger-cap coins in the next cycle. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): The NFT Mascot That Just Might Become a Meme Coin Giant PENGU trades around $0.021 with a $1.3 billion market cap, and while that puts it above early-stage tokens, its unique crossover position gives it enormous speculative power. Launched alongside its successful NFT series, Pudgy Penguins is tapping into mainstream adoption. It recently secured a decentralized ETF (Canary PENGU ETF), with listings on Revolut and Bitstamp, that pushed it into headlines. But what truly powers PENGU is its cultural relevance. From branded toys to community-driven storytelling, it’s become a household meme brand with global NFT traction. During one week alone, PENGU rallied over 80%, and with fresh exchange listings and ETF visibility, it’s becoming a case study for how memes, NFTs, and finance can collide. Conclusion: Timing Beats Talent in the Crypto Game The difference between a trader who 10x’d 0.1 BTC and one who didn’t isn’t always technical skill; most times it’s timing, conviction, and being early. While Bitcoin’s path to $140K might offer steady returns, exponential growth often lies with new narratives. Little Pepe’s explosive presale, Floki’s blend of meme and DeFi, and Pudgy Penguin’s brand power offer three roads to significant upside. For those looking to turn small bets into headline-worthy wins, these aren’t just coins, they’re chances. Now might be the time to act — before the rest of the market catches up.

On Friday night, Fitch Ratings downgraded the country’s long-term foreign-currency issuer rating from “AA+” to “AA,” citing rising debt and weak efforts to control it. The decision ends nearly a decade of rating stability and keeps the outlook at Stable. According to Fitch, government debt is still rising, with no solid signs that the current administration can stop it. They expect the debt-to-GDP ratio to hit 86.3% in 2025, up from 82.1% in 2024, and project it to go over 90% by 2029. That number stands in sharp contrast to the 49.4% median for countries in the same rating tier. The agency said the increase is being driven by budget shortfalls, low economic growth, rising interest costs, and stock-flow mismatches. Fitch says consolidation efforts aren’t enough The downgrade followed Finland’s €9 billion fiscal package rolled out in 2023 and 2024, worth about 3.3% of GDP, which was supposed to steady public finances by 2027. But Fitch said it won’t get the job done, especially with total government spending stuck at 57.7% of GDP for 2024. The agency warned that this spending is unlikely to fall anytime soon due to age-related costs, increased defense budgets, and growing social payments. Despite the rising costs, the government plans to introduce tax cuts in 2026 and 2027 for both income and corporate taxes, moves that may help growth but will worsen the deficit. Fitch forecasts the general government deficit to drop only slightly from 4.4% of GDP in 2024 to 4% in 2025, and remain above 3% until at least 2027. That’s much higher than the 2.1% average among peer nations. The gap is being pushed by slow revenue increases, growing pension obligations, and a significant rise in defense spending , which is set to reach 3% of GDP by 2029, with a surge in outlays planned for 2028 and 2029. Weak growth, higher unemployment, and credit stagnation Finland’s economy hasn’t kept pace with the rest of Europe . Fitch highlighted that GDP remains close to 2019 levels, while the EU average saw 5% growth over the same period. Growth for 2025 is expected to be just 0.9%, up from 0.4% in 2024, helped by lower inflation and slightly better household incomes. But high unemployment and low consumer confidence are still dragging things down. Investment is expected to rebound slightly thanks to clean energy, new technologies, and defense-related infrastructure, but confidence in the private sector is too low to push strong momentum. Growth may rise to 1.4% in 2026 and 1.5% in 2027, but still trails the expected 2.5% and 2.1% averages for countries with similar credit ratings. Fitch linked that weakness to aging demographics, low productivity, and ongoing trade uncertainties. The central bank pegs potential growth at around 1%. Still, Finland’s rating wasn’t cut further because of some remaining strengths. Fitch said its pension system has assets equal to 98% of GDP, and about a third of those are in public pension funds. Even with an aging population, those reserves are expected to stay near 75% of GDP by 2050. The government is also planning a €1 billion drawdown from the state pension fund in 2027 to cover spending. But job conditions are deteriorating. The unemployment rate climbed to 9.2% in the first quarter of 2025, up from 7.9% a year ago, making it one of the highest in the eurozone . That’s despite the employment rate staying historically high, supported by strong immigration and more older workers staying in the labor force. Fitch expects the unemployment rate to average 9% this year, before easing to 8.3% by 2027. Inflation is also picking up. Fitch predicts the annual rate, based on HICP, will move up to 1.9% in 2025 from 1% in 2024, then settle around 2% in 2026 and 2027. Meanwhile, credit activity is still weak. Even after recent rate cuts, demand hasn’t improved. Household borrowing is flat and corporate loans are declining. Over 90% of mortgages are on floating rates, so debt servicing costs are rising. Still, banks remain solid. The non-performing loan rate is stable at 1.2%, although it’s higher in construction, and core capital ratios are strong at around 18%.

With Layer-2 scalability already in the works and a detailed multi-phase roadmap guiding its development, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a solid foundation that far exceeds the fleeting excitement of meme tokens. Works for lenders and borrowers alike Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s approach centers around real-world lending and borrowing. Users deposit blue-chip cryptocurrencies and receive mtTokens representing their share of the pool, which not only hold value but also accrue interest. These mtTokens can be staked within smart contracts to earn passive MUTM rewards, funded by the platform’s protocol revenue. This means investors gain from both asset appreciation and steady dividend-like returns. Meanwhile, borrowers leverage overcollateralized blue-chip assets to access stablecoins without selling their holdings, preserving their investment exposure. This balance of risk and reward creates an ecosystem built on transparency, utility, and user empowerment — a clear differentiator from speculative meme coins. Presale status and security assurance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently progressing through its presale with remarkable momentum. In Phase 5 alone, the project has raised $13.5 million with the MUTM token priced at just $0.03. Impressively, over 14,300 holders have already joined the platform, showing widespread trust and community interest. Now, only 1% of the tokens in this phase remain available for purchase. Once this final portion is sold, the price will rise by 20% to $0.035, marking a critical turning point for potential investors. This means that today represents the last chance to acquire MUTM tokens at this discounted rate before the inevitable price increase. Security and transparency remain at the forefront of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s priorities. The platform has passed a rigorous CertiK audit, achieving a Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet Score of 78. These scores reflect the strength of the codebase and overall system reliability, giving investors confidence that their funds and the platform itself are well protected. To further foster community involvement and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivizing ethical hackers to identify any vulnerabilities. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway campaign will reward ten lucky winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, enhancing community engagement and awareness. Stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a unique stablecoin ecosystem powered by its overcollateralized lending protocol. Users can deposit blue-chip assets like ETH, BTC, AVAX, or stablecoins such as USDT and USDC into smart contract pools, receiving 1:1 mtTokens in return, such as mtUSDT or mtETH. These mtTokens accrue yield based on pool utilization and can be staked to earn MUTM rewards, which are funded through open market buybacks using protocol revenue. Borrowers can access liquidity by using their deposited assets as collateral, receiving loans in stablecoins without needing to sell their holdings. This design ensures stability, preserves asset exposure, and incentivizes lending through interest rewards. All loans are overcollateralized, secured by a proprietary Stability Factor that minimizes liquidation risk. This system enables a sustainable, interest-generating stablecoin model, reinforcing Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s commitment to transparency, utility, and capital efficiency in decentralized finance. A strategic investment with clear growth potential Consider an investor who committed $25,000 to MUTM during Phase 2, when the token was priced at $0.015. Alongside holding popular cryptocurrencies like SOL and AVAX, this individual has already seen their MUTM holdings double in value as the presale has progressed to Phase 5 pricing of $0.03. Looking ahead, the MUTM token is slated to list at $0.06, offering this investor a fourfold return from their original purchase price. Given the platform’s strong fundamentals, layered growth strategy, and active community support, these gains are just the beginning, with further upside expected as the platform launches its beta version and expands its offerings. With only 1% of Phase 5 tokens left before the price jumps by 20%, there is an undeniable urgency for investors who want to secure MUTM at this advantageous entry point. The combination of a nearly sold-out phase, robust security through CertiK’s audit, and a growing, engaged community makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a rare opportunity in today’s crowded DeFi market. This presale is not just about buying a token; it is about joining a forward-looking ecosystem that blends innovation, stability, and rewards. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to leave the meme coin noise behind and carve out its place as a sustainable DeFi leader. Don’t miss the last 1% before the 20% price increase changes the game forever.

Davis told the U.S. court that the project was a memecoin , made for fun and not a serious business investment. This statement completely changed the earlier sentiment of LIBRA. Is Hayden Davis Trying to Escape Judicial Investment? According to recent reports , Davis told the US court LIBRA project is a memecoin, meaning it was made for fun. He claims that the project was not meant for serious investment, denying the claims of the private investor, Omar Hurlock. Hurlock’s lawyer requested a proper investigation to scrutinize the involvement of Davis and Benjamin Chow in the LIBRA scam. However, the Federal Judge Jennifer L. Rochon of the Southern District of New York refused the request. According to Argentine media Clarín, crypto entrepreneur Hayden Davis has admitted in a U.S. court filing that the LIBRA project is a memecoin, denying it was an investment with a business plan. On January 30, during a meeting with President Javier Milei, Davis-linked wallets… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 26, 2025 Davis’s Defence Acknowledges LIBRA As Memecoin Davis argued that they never presented a business plan that would have a strong infrastructure for users to invest in. He emphasized that the opposite party failed to provide any evidence in their defence. His defence reiterated that memecoins are not investments and nor do they have intrinsic value. Davis stated, “Defendants provided no plans, details, or infrastructure to potential purchasers of the memecoin, nor did they provide detailed disclosures or tokenomic distribution information regarding how the raised funds would be allocated to fulfill the [allegedly] promised economic initiatives.” Why Does it Matter? Davis’s statement that LIBRA is just a memcoin comes at a time when thousands of people are awaiting their assets. Amid the dispute between the two parties, authorities froze $280 million connected to LIBRA because they suspected that the money was not handled properly. The fate of these funds will be decided at a hearing scheduled for August 19, 2025, in the New York Court. Both parties, with their defendants, must be present.

The announcement came Friday after Ursula posted on X, saying the two had agreed to meet “to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong.” Trump confirmed the meeting the same day after landing in Scotland, telling reporters, “We’ll see if we can make a deal. I think we have a good 50/50 chance. That’s a lot.” The stakes are high. Trump’s warning about steep tariffs has pushed the EU to rush into a potential framework deal. Talks are leaning toward a 15% tariff baseline on EU goods coming into the U.S., matching the deal the Trump administration recently signed with Japan. That Japan agreement, which Trump described on social media as “perhaps the largest Deal ever made,” is now being used as a reference point for Europe. The EU is trying to avoid a trade war, but they’re also preparing for one if Sunday’s meeting fails. Trump’s tariff threat puts pressure on Brussels If the meeting falls apart, Brussels is ready to hit back. A list of retaliatory tariffs worth €93 billion (roughly $109.4 billion) is already on standby. These duties could be activated just days after the U.S. move. The list merges multiple previous versions into a single plan targeting U.S. products. On top of that, the EU is discussing the use of its Anti-Coercion Instrument, a trade weapon that would restrict American access to the European market. That means U.S. companies could be blocked from bidding on public projects across the bloc. There could also be limits on U.S. exports, imports, and foreign direct investment. The tool has been called the “nuclear option” inside Brussels, and while it hasn’t been activated yet, conversations about using it have picked up. France is currently the only country demanding immediate action if the talks fail. But officials told CNBC that “there seems to be a broad qualified majority voting for establishing coercion.” That signals political backing for serious retaliation if Trump follows through on the 30% tariffs. UK, Japan already locked in trade deals with Trump Trump is in Scotland for a four-day visit that includes golf and politics. Besides his Sunday meeting with Ursula, he’s also expected to hold an informal session with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Britain isn’t caught up in the tariff drama. It already signed a trade deal with the Trump administration earlier this year, agreeing to a 10% baseline tariff on goods sent to the U.S. That puts the EU at a disadvantage. Both Japan and the UK have deals in place. The EU doesn’t. Economists say a bad deal may be the only way out. Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics, said Friday: “Reports this week suggest that the EU and US are on the brink of agreeing a trade deal with a 15% baseline tariff on US imports from the bloc. It’s hard to spin it as a good deal, but it would at least avoid much higher US tariffs and retaliation from the EU.” The Trump administration hasn’t made any final decisions yet. But with just days left before the new tariffs hit, both sides are under pressure to come up with something. The U.S. and EU together account for 43% of global GDP and nearly 30% of all global trade, according to the European Commission. The meeting on Sunday could determine what happens next. Either they land on a 15% deal and avoid escalation, or tariffs spike and both sides start firing back. No one expects a perfect solution, but neither side wants to be blamed for blowing up the largest trade partnership in the world. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

MUTM’s roadmap looks more bullish than SHIB’s,https://invezz.com/news/2025/07/26/from-0-035-to-1-mutms-roadmap-looks-more-bullish-than-shibs/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) roadmap Mutuum Finance (MUTM) follows a clear, phased roadmap aimed at delivering a robust and future-ready DeFi ecosystem. In Phase 1, the team has already accomplished key goals such as launching the presale, kicking off major marketing campaigns, conducting an external smart contract audit, activating an AI-powered helpdesk, and getting listed on tracking platforms. Two elements—educational content and forming a legal team—remain pending. Phase 2 focuses on building the core product, including the development of smart contracts, frontend and backend infrastructure, implementation of risk controls, and analytics tools, all supported by continuous audits. Phase 3 will finalize the platform with beta testing, a bug reporting system, full development completion, exchange listing prep, and regulatory compliance, alongside ending the presale. Finally, Phase 4 will bring the live platform launch, MUTM token listings, claim process activation, cross-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and advanced features. This roadmap positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to grow sustainably and serve a wide DeFi user base. P2C vs P2P lending Where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will truly separate itself from the token-only trend is in its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending model. Users will be able to deposit top-tier blue-chip tokens like BNB or LINK into audited smart contracts and receive 1:1 wrapped mtTokens in return—mtBNB or mtLINK. These mtTokens will be stakeable in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards. Rather than being inflationary, these rewards will be purchased from the open market using protocol revenue, giving real backing to every reward received. For those holding more volatile tokens, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will open direct lending markets for memecoins like FLOKI, SHIB, PEPE, DOGE, and TRUMP. Borrowers and lenders will set their own terms—interest rate, loan duration, and acceptable collateral—without relying on pooled capital. Each P2P loan will remain isolated from core liquidity pools, ensuring that the blue-chip side of the platform stays fully protected even if high-risk assets fluctuate. And the numbers speak louder than any prediction. An investor who entered Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 at $0.01 with a $2,000 stake locked in 200,000 tokens. At today’s $0.03 price, that holding is already valued at $6,000. Once the token hits $0.06 in Phase 11, it becomes $12,000. When trading begins and the token reaches $1, that original $2,000 snowballs into $200,000—an eye-watering 100× return. And that’s before even factoring in staking rewards or platform dividends. This exponential growth projection is grounded in real fundamentals: an in-demand token model, dual lending architecture, and the anticipated demand shock at launch due to limited supply and growing hype. As more users lock tokens for yield, the circulating supply shrinks, creating the perfect conditions for long-term price appreciation. Presale and giveaway Now in its fifth presale phase, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $13.5 million, gathered over 14,300 token holders, and undergone a full security audit by CertiK—earning an impressive 95.00 Token Scan score and a 78.00 Skynet rating. The platform is fortified by a $50,000 bug bounty, covering all severity tiers and designed to crowdsource continued security improvement. At the same time, a $100,000 giveaway is rewarding 10 community members with $10,000 worth of MUTM each, intensifying interest just as Phase 5 nears its close. What’s coming next for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is what’s setting investor expectations on fire. The Beta release will go live with the token launch, running entirely on fast, low-cost Layer-2 infrastructure. This means staking, lending, borrowing, and trading will happen with minimal gas fees and lightning-fast confirmations—a massive upgrade over many current DeFi systems running on congested Layer-1 chains. This window is closing quickly. The remaining Phase 5 tokens at $0.03 are nearly exhausted. Once gone, the Phase 6 price of $0.035 kicks in, and the next 170 million MUTM tokens move fast. The roadmap ahead is stacked with real development milestones, live features, and Layer-2 deployment—all of which go far beyond speculative tokenomics.

By 2028, ADA/USD could reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.8236 Market Cap $29.19B Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.06B Circulating Supply 35.4B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.8287 24-hour Low $0.7777 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 17.01% 50-day SMA $0.6698 14-Day RSI 62.84 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 20/30 (67%) 200-day SMA $0.6115 Cardano (ADA) price analysis ADA is consolidating between $0.80-$0.83 with weakening momentum signals. Volume decline and bearish MACD divergence suggest sellers are gaining control. Cardano’s critical support lies at $0.77. Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: ADA faces rejection at critical resistance Cardano’s daily chart on July 26, 2025, displays a rejection pattern after testing the upper Bollinger Band around $0.94, with the price currently consolidating near $0.8256. The strong red candle following the rally indicates selling pressure at this critical resistance level. The MACD also shows a bearish divergence with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, suggesting weakening momentum. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano sees sideways consolidation with declining volume The 4-hour chart supports the price consolidation on the broader timeframe, showing Cardano trapped in a tight range between $0.80 and $0.83 with notably declining volume as indicated by the OBV. The recent candles show indecision with mixed red and green sessions. The horizontal resistance at $0.8362 continues to cap upside attempts, and the declining volume pattern suggests market participants are waiting for a clear directional catalyst. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7394 BUY SMA 5 $0.8141 BUY SMA 10 $0.8290 SELL SMA 21 $0.7522 BUY SMA 50 $0.6698 BUY SMA 100 $0.6967 BUY SMA 200 $0.6115 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7335 BUY EMA 5 $0.7055 BUY EMA 10 $0.6860 BUY EMA 21 $0.6827 BUY EMA 50 $0.7125 BUY EMA 100 $0.7472 BUY EMA 200 $0.7229 BUY What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? Cardano is likely to continue consolidating with a bearish undertone following the rejection at key resistance and deteriorating momentum signals. The critical test lies at the $0.77 support level, where a decisive break could accelerate selling pressure toward $0.58. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely unlikely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. Cardano (ADA) started 2025 trading between $1.02-$1.09 in January but declined to $0.9 by month-end, then continued falling through February and March, reaching lows around $0.60. In April, ADA dropped below $0.55 before surging back to $0.7030, then skyrocketed to $0.8 in early May before settling at $0.7599 by month-end. Throughout June 2025, ADA traded between $0.513-$0.705. In July, the coin is trading between $0.7777 and $0.8287.",Crypto Price Predictions|ADA,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 11:27:30

This Token Entered Phase 6 and Might Overtake DOGE in ROI,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/next-crypto-to-hit-1-this-token-entered-phase-6-and-might-overtake-doge-in-roi/,"The post Next Crypto to Hit $1? This Token Entered Phase 6 and Might Overtake DOGE in ROI appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) continue their steady climbs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto crowd with a unique blend of innovation and growth potential. Now entering Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as the next moonshot candidate, with the ambition to outpace DOGE’s historical returns on investment. The limited availability in this phase combined with a thoughtfully engineered ecosystem is creating a perfect storm for a breakout run. Investors ready to seize this opportunity will find MUTM’s structure and roadmap hard to ignore. Stablecoin Depth and mtToken Staking: The Heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized stablecoin system will be built on a strict, controlled mint-and-burn model. Only authorized issuers will be able to mint stablecoins against blue-chip collateral such as ETH, and these stablecoins will be burned when borrowers repay their loans, ensuring the peg to $1 remains robust. Governance protocols will actively manage interest rates to maintain equilibrium, while automatic liquidations will protect the system from undercollateralization risks. This setup will foster a stable, reliable environment for both lenders and borrowers. What will truly set Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its innovative mtToken mechanism. When users deposit assets like USDC or ETH into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts, they will receive corresponding mtTokens 1:1. These mtTokens will grow in value over time as interest accumulates. Moreover, staking mtTokens will unlock an additional layer of rewards: stakers will earn MUTM tokens purchased through open market buybacks funded by protocol revenue. This design will effectively tie token utility to the platform’s success, creating a continuous incentive for participation while boosting MUTM’s demand and value. Presale Snapshot and a Roadmap Set for Growth Phase 6’s launch at $0.035 has already generated $13.60 million, though only 5% of tokens have been claimed so far. Phase 7 is expected to mint 170 million tokens at $0.040, marking a 15% price increase that adds urgency for investors eyeing early entry. The total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens, now held by over 14,400 wallets, reflecting a strong and growing community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s security credentials are impressive. The project earned a CertiK audit with a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 78.00, confirming a solid technical foundation. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty program actively invites ethical hackers to safeguard the platform, while a $100,000 giveaway across ten backers creates additional community excitement. The project roadmap is equally compelling. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 6 Beta will launch concurrently with the token listing, unveiling the mint/burn stablecoin system alongside an automated rate engine that adjusts borrowing costs dynamically. Further phases promise cross-chain support, facilitating asset transfers beyond Ethereum’s network. Crucially, Layer 2 integration will slash transaction costs to near zero and speed execution to under a second, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s platform both efficient and scalable. Lending Mechanics that Appeal to Both Cautious and Risk-Tolerant Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will expertly balance low-risk and higher-risk lending through its dual models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model will invite depositors to lend blue-chip tokens at competitive rates. For example, lending 2 BTC at a 9% APY will mint 240,000mtBTC tokens that will grow by 0.18 BTC annually. These mtBTC will be stakeable to collect additional MUTM rewards generated from protocol buybacks. Borrowers using P2C will be able to leverage their BTC collateral to draw 70% loan-to-value in stablecoins like USDT, allowing liquidity without selling assets. In contrast, the P2P model will cater to higher-risk appetite by facilitating direct loan agreements involving memecoins such as SHIB. Investors will be able to negotiate loans—say, a 45-day SHIB loan at 32% APR—isolating these volatile assets from core pools and rewarding lenders with premium interest. Investor Case and Growing FOMO: The Clock Is Ticking History tends to repeat itself in crypto, and a seasoned investor who famously predicted DOGE’s 2020 rally is placing his bets on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). He swapped $5,000 worth of ETH into MUTM at just $0.015, acquiring 333,333 tokens valued at $11,666 today. This amount will jump to $20,000 at the listing price of $0.06. More thrilling is the forecasted surge to $1 per token, a staggering 100× gain, pushing his holdings to a remarkable $333,333. This optimistic price prediction is driven by the increasing MUTM demand driven by upcoming beta launch and real testing of platform usage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s thoughtful integration of stablecoin mechanisms, innovative mtToken staking rewards, and Layer 2 scalability coupled with a robust security framework and a clear growth roadmap positions it uniquely in today’s market. Investors seeking the next breakout token that blends safety, utility, and explosive upside will find MUTM’s Phase 6 offering impossible to overlook.

The study is meant to explore how brain-computer interfaces can help blind patients see again using artificial intelligence. The trial hasn’t started using Neuralink patients yet. The listing says the research will involve Neuralink participants “once available,” and enrollment is currently by invitation only. The experimental tech is being designed to help users recognize faces, walk outdoors, and read; all through a digital system wired into the brain. There are no human test subjects confirmed yet, but the plan is to eventually implant the device into real people once it’s ready for that stage. Neuralink targets 2030 for launch of Blindsight vision chip The clinical study is part of a bigger roadmap that includes Blindsight, the name of Neuralink’s chip designed specifically to restore vision. Blindsight has only been tested in monkeys so far. Musk’s company is aiming to get the chip into patients by 2030, with expectations to reach $1 billion in yearly revenue by 2031, alongside other implant projects. There are two other devices in the company’s pipeline. One is called Telepathy, a brain chip that lets users control external devices with their mind. The second, named Deep, is being built to treat tremors and Parkinson’s disease. The company presented these plans to investors recently, with projections showing five large clinics opening in the coming years to support 20,000 surgeries annually by 2031. The numbers are based on a $50,000 reimbursement estimate per surgery. Musk is banking on regulatory approval for Telepathy in the U.S. by 2029, which would let the company perform around 2,000 surgeries a year and pull in $100 million annually from that single product. By the following year, once Blindsight is live, those figures jump to 10,000 surgeries per year and an expected $500 million in revenue. Less than 10 human patients have Neuralink implants so far Despite all the projections, fewer than ten people have received Neuralink implants to date. And none of them are using the device to treat blindness or Parkinson’s. The only confirmed use cases have been with paralyzed patients who’ve used the chip to browse the internet, play games, and edit videos using only their minds. These are part of earlier clinical trials, and the patients haven’t been tied to the new bionic eye study. The project is one of several steps Neuralink is taking to push brain-chip tech forward. The company has already pulled in $1.3 billion from investors and now holds a $9 billion valuation, based on data from PitchBook. But even with the money and hype, none of these devices (from Neuralink or any of its competitors ) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for permanent use in humans. Other brain-implant companies are also in the race, trying to prove their devices can safely stimulate or record brain signals. But as of now, no brain-computer interface has been cleared for permanent, everyday human use. The FDA is still reviewing safety and effectiveness data for most of these technologies. Musk has a long history of pushing deadlines. He said in 2015 that Tesla would have fully self-driving cars within three years. That didn’t happen. He delayed the launch multiple times. It was only last month that Tesla’s Robotaxi finally started road testing, nearly a decade later. The trial involving California and Spain doesn’t have a public timeline yet for results or next phases. What’s clear is that Neuralink is now directly involved in the bionic eye project and that it’s connected to the eventual deployment of Blindsight. As of now, there’s no word from Elon Musk or his team on when exactly human patients will start receiving these implants.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, in a newly published research paper, described XRP as an “international payment medium or wholesale settlement coin.” This acknowledgment signals growing institutional awareness of XRP’s potential role in global finance, particularly in the evolving landscape of Web3. A Landmark Reference in Central Bank Research The reference to XRP appears in a May 2023 publication from the Atlanta Fed’s Policy Hub, titled “An Introduction to Web3 with Implications for Financial Services.” Authored by Christine A. Parlour, a professor at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, the report explores how blockchain technologies, particularly those driving Web3, could transform financial infrastructure. XRP MENTIONED BY ATLANTA FED! The Atlanta Fed’s new report on Web3 calls $XRP an “international payment medium or wholesale settlement coin.” pic.twitter.com/ZXT1jycr6P — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) July 25, 2025 Within this context, XRP is listed alongside Stellar as a token envisioned for use in cross-border transactions and institutional settlements. While the Fed does not endorse any specific asset, the report notes that XRP was “roughly envisioned as an international payment medium or wholesale settlement coin.” This places XRP within a shortlist of tokens being studied seriously for high-level financial use cases. Exploring Web3 and Global Settlement Frameworks The report explores how Web3 can enhance traditional financial systems by facilitating faster and more cost-efficient clearing and settlement. A key example is Project Mariana, a joint initiative by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) , the Bank of France, and other central banks. The project investigated using public blockchains and DeFi tools, such as automated market makers (AMMs), to streamline CBDC transactions. In this experimental environment, blockchains like the XRP Ledger and Stellar were examined for their technical suitability in facilitating global liquidity and settlement. These findings suggest that XRP’s design is well-aligned with future models for cross-border monetary flows. Why XRP Stands Out Technically XRP is designed for speed, scalability, and cost efficiency. Transactions settle in 3–5 seconds, with fees as low as $0.0002, and the network can handle up to 1,500 transactions per second. These features make XRP attractive for large-scale payment systems and enterprise-grade settlement use.

Community Reaction and Future Outlook Coin Bureau’s post quickly drew attention from the crypto community, with many praising the mention as a sign of XRP’s growing institutional relevance. While some emphasized that the Fed’s statement was academic rather than operational, others viewed it as a strong signal that XRP is firmly on the radar of policymakers and financial researchers. It’s important to note that the Fed has not announced any intention to integrate XRP into its systems, nor does the mention imply endorsement. Still, XRP’s inclusion in such a serious policy discussion affirms its strategic positioning in the broader conversation about the future of digital payments. With increasing institutional focus on Web3 technologies, XRP appears well-positioned to play a central role in shaping the next generation of global finance.

The stock sales started around his wedding in Venice at the end of June and ended on Thursday, with a final unload of 4.2 million shares for $954 million. All of it was done under a 10b5-1 plan he filed earlier this year. According to Bloomberg, the full plan allowed him to sell up to 25 million shares, and he sold every single one. Amazon’s stock has surged 38% since its April low, giving Jeff the perfect window to execute his plan. The $5.7 billion windfall adds to his long history of selling Amazon shares, bringing his total cashouts since 2002 to more than $50 billion. None of this is new for Jeff. Last year, he sold 75 million shares and took home $13.6 billion. The only time he ever bought stock on record was two years ago—one share at $114.77. Earnings loom as AI spending ramps up Amazon reports earnings on July 31. Analysts expect $1.32 per share on $162 billion in revenue, up 4% and 9% respectively from last year’s Q2. That’s still behind the average for the so-called Magnificent Seven, which is clocking in at 15% growth on earnings and 12% on revenue. Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia are leading the S&P 500 for 2025, while Apple’s falling behind, mostly over doubts around its AI strategy. The pressure is heavy on Amazon to prove that its AI spending spree is worth it. Brian Recht, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said, “The stock isn’t getting much credit for AI. Investors want to see whether Amazon can actually deliver on using it for improved profitability, but we think evidence of AI benefits will become more clear by the quarter.” Amazon plans to drop $104 billion on capital expenditures this year, the most in the S&P 500. That money covers everything from new data centers to warehouses. Just last month, Amazon committed $30 billion to data center builds in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The company also announced layoffs in its cloud computing division, blaming the need to “optimize resources.” CEO Andy Jassy says more cuts are likely over the next few years as AI takes on more work. Retail, robotics, and more inside the AI play Most of the AI buzz centers on Amazon Web Services, which is expected to benefit from surging demand. But Jeff’s company isn’t just looking at AI in the cloud. It’s also trying to use it to boost the retail and logistics side. Amazon’s e-commerce business still brings in the most cash, but it’s getting squeezed by rising tariffs. AI is being used to personalize ads, recommend products, and speed up warehouse and delivery work. Amazon has even been pushing its new Rufus chatbot, which helps customers sift through products and reviews. On the warehouse floor, the company is training humanoid robots to handle logistics using an indoor obstacle course, as reported by The Information. The plan is to eventually automate large parts of the delivery process. If it works, it could be big. Bank of America thinks this could save more than $7 billion a year by 2032. Morgan Stanley analysts say Amazon’s retail unit could become “the most under-appreciated GenAI beneficiary in the tech space.” Irene Tunkel, chief U.S. equities strategist at BCA Research, added, “Retail margins are narrow, so Amazon needs all the productivity boosts it can get, and there are huge use cases for AI and robotics within warehouses. This is something that will play out over five or 10 years, but Amazon is at the forefront of it, and that definitely gives them an edge.” Jeff still owns about 884 million Amazon shares, more than 8% of the company. That stake makes up most of his $252.3 billion net worth and keeps him ranked third-richest in the world. He also gave away about $190 million in stock to nonprofits this year.

In a surprise move, Wellgistics Health , a Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm, has revealed its plans to deeply integrate XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) into its core business operations. This could become one of the most bullish developments for Ripple in 2025. Healthcare Meets Crypto: SEC Filing Reveals XRP Plans Wellgistics Health filed a detailed S-1 form with the SEC outlining its vision to use XRP not just for payments but also as a strategic financial asset. The company aims to use XRP for B2B transactions, treasury reserves, collateral, and even capital-raising activities. The filing also highlights a $50 million fund from LDA Capital that will support the development of XRP infrastructure within the firm. XRP’s Utility in Doubt? Analysts Share Mixed Opinion While Ripple continues to battle regulatory challenges with the SEC , this move strengthens XRP’s image in the market. It provides real-world proof that XRP isn’t just a speculative token; it’s being positioned as a financial tool by a legitimate company. Analysts believe this undermines the old narrative that XRP lacks utility. What I have gathered from reading the S-1 form filed with the SEC today by Wellgistics Health is incredibly revealing. It is more than just a company using XRP in its treasury reserve. This is a summary of what the filing revealed: 1. WH is not only planning to hold XRP as a… — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) July 25, 2025 Crypto experts like Bill Morgan explained that Wellgistics Health isn’t just holding XRP like savings, it plans to actively use it in its business. The company aims to send fast, low-cost payments using the XRP Ledger, raise funds by selling shares to buy more XRP, use XRP as backup for loans, and even earn income from it. This shows XRP being used in real-world ways, not just sitting idle, proving it has real utility. However, on the flip side, Former SEC official Marc Fagel cast doubt on Wellgistics Health’s credibility, highlighting its poor financials, minimal assets, and a “going concern” auditor warning. He compared the move to crypto pump-and-dump tactics and questioned the legitimacy of a healthcare startup needing a crypto stockpile. Fagel suggested that the XRP strategy might simply be a ploy to raise capital by riding the crypto and AI wave. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Fact Check: Has Ripple Really Hired Hollywood Star Sydney Sweeney to Promote XRP? , Still, Morgan responded that using crypto for treasury and payments is becoming a broader trend, and Wellgistics’ filing does suggest genuine plans to integrate XRPL into real business use. Utility Over Hype? XRP Price Reacts The market took note, with XRP climbing over 12.6% recently, outpacing other altcoins. Some investors like Xaif have pointed to the price action as utility-driven rather than hype-based. The rally follows broader optimism around Ripple’s positioning in the fintech space, especially as new products like RLUSD emerge. The Wellgistics filing could mark a new chapter for XRP. Instead of being seen as a speculative asset, the token is now entering boardrooms and corporate strategy. That could be a game changer not only for Ripple but for crypto’s role in traditional industries. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Goldman’s survey indicates investors are expressing increased bullishness on US stocks, particularly on Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, the large tech firms that make up the “Magnificent Seven.” Conversely, the same institutional investors are demonstrating a surge in bearishness on the dollar amid US fiscal issues. Oscar Östlund, a managing director at Goldman, notes that dollar bears now outnumber bulls by a ratio of more than 7:1. “One of the most important paradigm shifts over the last couple of months has been the decoupling of the dollar and US equities.” Source: Goldman Sachs Goldman’s investor survey has only clocked bearish dollar sentiment next to a bullish view on US stocks three times in the past 9.5 years. In terms of stocks, 51% of Goldman’s respondents were bullish on the S&P 500, while 32% were bearish. Östlund says that equity bullishness could suggest market vulnerability to a reversal. “A very one-sided position is a sign of a stretched market. In itself, a very strong consensus is not a reason for the market to turn, but it makes for a market that’s susceptible to relatively sudden changes based on even minor catalysts.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to reports, the surveillance operator’s account was using the tech company’s servers to host and operate the monitoring software. The move to shut down the operation comes after several alerts to the firm. A report by TechCrunch mentioned that the platform alerted the technology firm about the spyware operation. It was being hosted on Firebase, one of Google’s developer platforms. Catwatchful was using Firebase to host and store huge amounts of data stolen from thousands of phones compromised by the spyware. “We’ve investigated these reported Firebase operations and suspended them for violating our terms of service,” Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez said. Google says it has shut down Catwatchful According to reports, Google did not explicitly state why it took about a month to investigate and suspend the Firebase account of the operation. In the company’s terms of use , Google prohibits its customers from hosting malicious software or spyware on its platforms. Since the company is for-profit, it has a commercial interest, retaining users who are interested in paying for its services. Catwatchful was an Android-specific child monitoring application, but was built to also act as spyware to the user. Like other spyware applications, users need to physically install it on their phones by entering their passcode. These devices are also called stalkerware, as they can be used for non-consensual surveillance on romantic partners and spouses, which is illegal. After the application is installed, it is designed to stay hidden from the home screen of the victim. In the background, it uploads several private files of the victims, including private messages, photos, location data, and other details to a web dashboard that can be viewed by the person who planted the application. As of yesterday, Catwatchful is no longer functioning, and it does not appear to transmit or receive data, according to the spyware analysis carried out by TechCrunch. Spyware operations involved in leaked data on the rise Catwatchful first came into the limelight in the middle of June after security researcher Eric Daigle identified a security bug that exposed the spyware operations’ back-end database. The bug allows unauthenticated access to the database, meaning that users who want to access it do not need passwords or credentials. The database also contained more than 62,000 Catwatchful user email addresses, plaintext passwords, and records on about 26,000 victim devices compromised by the spyware. The data also revealed the administrator behind the operation, showing that a Uruguay-based developer called Omar Soca Charcov is running the show. There is no clear indication that Charcov is aware of the security lapse or his plans for notifying affected individuals in the breach. However, a copy of the Catwatchful database has been provided to the data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned. Catwatchful is the latest in a long list of surveillance platforms that have suffered breaches in the last few years. Most of these operations and platforms suffer from these breaches due to coding or poor cybersecurity practices. According to reports, Catwatchful is the fifth spyware operation, since the beginning of the year, to have spilled user data and the most recent in about 24 known spyware operations since 2017. Users who feel they may run the risk of being exposed as a result of using the Catwatchful spyware app need to do something about it. Android users can also identify if the spyware app is installed on any of their devices, even if the app is hidden, by dialing 543210 into their Android phone and pressing the call button. Users are also advised to have a safety plan in place before removing spyware from their phones.

Over the last 30 days, the DOT price has surged by 21.8%, and in the past 24 hours alone, it climbed 3.3% to hit $4.09. According to popular crypto trader Friedrich , Polkadot is on track for a major transformation in 2025, one that could potentially mirror Ethereum’s early growth. Let’s break down the latest trends and what’s driving this momentum. Why DOT Could Be Major Growth in 2025? 1. Polkadot 2.0 and the JAM Upgrade One of the most anticipated updates, Polkadot 2.0 introduces the JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) protocol. Friedrich highlights this upgrade as a game-changer, offering: Up to 1 million transactions per second 857 MB/s data throughput These improvements make Polkadot more scalable and capable of handling advanced dApps. The JAM Tour also includes a massive 10M DOT / 100K KSM prize pool to attract developers. 2. Native Smart Contracts Support Polkadot is integrating smart contracts natively, simplifying dApp creation. This development makes the network more accessible to developers, much like Fantom’s recent upgrades. 3. Agile Coretime and vDOT Incentives Polkadot’s Agile Coretime enhances data availability with 233 MB/s speed, boosting the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions like vDOT. Friedrich notes the 795K DOT reward pool for vDOT as a major incentive, suggesting strong utility and user engagement ahead. 4. Community-Driven Governance Programs like Decentralised Voices Cohort 5 are giving more power to the community. Around 3,438 DOT have already been burned from Coretime sales — reducing circulating supply, which could positively impact the DOT price over time. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoins Set for Double-Digit Returns with Ethereum Price Heading to $4K , 5. Real-World Use Cases Gaining Traction Polkadot is expanding into real-world sectors. Key partnerships include: Beatport for music MLS-Messi deal in sports Mythical Games for Web3 gaming Mubert for AI music Energy Web and AgroToken for tokenising real-world assets in energy and agriculture. These integrations show Polkadot’s increasing relevance beyond just the crypto world. What’s Ahead for Polkadot? Friedrich believes Polkadot is aligned with high-growth themes: AI integration for smarter decentralized apps Privacy with zero-knowledge proofs, backed by a 10M DOT commitment Machine economy support via the peaq network These focus areas position Polkadot as a strong contender for leading the next phase of Web3 innovation. Final Thoughts The DOT price may still be far from its all-time high, but with ongoing development, real-world adoption, and strong community governance, Polkadot is building a solid foundation for long-term growth. If Friedrich’s prediction plays out, 2025 could be a breakout year for the Polkadot price — much like Ethereum’s early trajectory. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analyst Aaron Arnold hints a bullish stance on XRP, citing Ripple’s regulatory progress. Arnold predicts the worth of 1,000 XRP at $5K and $9K if BTC hits $150K and $250K respectively. XRP is gaining renewed investor interest as bullish predictions for 2026 emerge, fueled by rising institutional interest and real-world utility.

Related Reading: Crypto’s Golden Rule Just Got Broken, According To Analyst Based on reports from Citi, the bank has laid out three scenarios for where the price might land by year‑end 2025. These range from a low of $64,000 in a weak market to a bull case of $199,000 if everything goes right. ETF Flows Take Center Stage In Bitcoin Uptrend According to Citi analysts, spot Bitcoin ETFs now explain over 40% of the recent price swings. Since their debut, US ETFs have snapped up about $54.66 billion worth of Bitcoin. That buying power helped drive BTC from roughly $45,000 to $123,000 in just a few months. The bank’s base case assumes another $15 billion in ETF inflows this year. At the ratio they’ve modeled—about $4 of price per $1 of flow—that would add around $63,000 to Bitcoin’s value. 🚨 Bitcoin Could Surge to $199K by Year-End, Says Citi Citigroup has released a new forecast projecting Bitcoin to reach $135,000 by the end of 2025 in its base-case scenario. The bullish case estimates a potential rise to $199,000, while the bearish outlook places the… pic.twitter.com/3Kp1o8OGsn — The Tradesman (@The_Tradesman1) July 26, 2025 User Growth Fuels Network Effects Based on figures from trading desks and on‑chain metrics, Citi expects a 20% rise in active Bitcoin users over the next year. That jump in adoption would support roughly $75,000 of price strength on its own. The idea is simple. More users mean more hands holding and trading Bitcoin. That activity tends to make prices less prone to sudden drops. Still, forecasts like this rest on the assumption that new users stick around rather than flipping coins for quick gains. Macroeconomic Factors Cut Forecast Slightly Citi’s model also factors in weaker performance in equities and gold, trimming the price by about $3,200. That adjustment reflects a view that if stock and metal markets struggle, Bitcoin won’t fully decouple from broader risk assets. At the same time, growing regulatory approval and deeper links between crypto and traditional finance should offer some support. ETF Demand Could Lift Bitcoin By $63,000 In the base‑case scenario, Citi adds the $63,000 from ETF flows to the $75,000 from user growth, then subtracts $3,200 for macro headwinds. That math lands the price at about $135,000 in 2025. That figure is only $12,000 above the recent peak of $123,000. It suggests Citi sees more upside but not a runaway rally—at least not in the base case.

Conversely, a drop to $64,000 is possible if macro conditions sour sharply. Globally, ETFs now hold around 1.48 million BTC, worth over $170 billion—about 7% of the total supply. That level of institutional backing is unprecedented. It shifts Bitcoin’s fate more toward big‑money flows than pure retail hype.

He has stepped up his fight with JPMorgan, saying the bank is blocking Gemini from key banking services because he spoke out against them. This comes after a Bloomberg report revealed that JP Morgan plans to charge fintechs for access to customer data. He claims that this move could bankrupt crypto-friendly fintechs that rely on that data to help users buy crypto. Kraken’s co-CEO, Arjun Sethi had also criticized the move, saying JPMorgan is treating user data like a product to sell. “Once data becomes a revenue stream,” he said, “the goal is to lock it in and profit from it.” Right now, apps like Plaid let you connect your bank to crypto platforms like Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken, for free. But banks want to start charging high fees, which could crush the fintechs that make those connections possible. He explains that a rule called the Open Banking Rule gives people the right to access their bank data through third-party apps. But now, JPMorgan and others are suing to get that rule thrown out, which could shut down easy access to crypto. He calls this a clear case of big banks trying to protect their interests by blocking innovation. He also said that this goes against President Trump’s push to make America a global leader in crypto. My tweet from last week struck a nerve.

After he criticized the bank last week, JPMorgan told them it’s pausing plans to re-onboard Gemini as a customer. Tyler claims the bank wants them to stay quiet while it works to end free access to banking data through fintechs like Plaid, cutting off an important bridge to crypto. “We will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies. We will never stop fighting for what is right,” he said, in a recent X post. The post triggered a wave of comments among users. “Big banks are scared you might actually control your own money.” Some users are calling out the real issue—banks don’t want to give up control. They’d rather keep people locked into their systems than allow true financial freedom. Another user noted that Open Banking isn’t just a crypto issue, it’s global. Most countries are moving toward it, and the U.S. falling behind would hurt innovation and competition. One of them went even further and said that Ripple needs to secure a banking license fast if this is the kind of roadblock the industry will keep facing.

The presidential office in Seoul said on Saturday that officials are preparing a deal they hope both countries can agree on ahead of minister-level meetings next week. This effort comes as the Trump administration wraps up trade talks with Japan and the Philippines, and sets its sights on China and the EU next . According to Reuters, the new trade package will include shipbuilding cooperation, which has become a key talking point between U.S. and South Korean officials. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick raised the issue on Friday during talks with Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan. Their meeting followed one held on Thursday, where both Lutnick and Kim agreed to reach a trade deal by the deadline. A larger joint meeting with finance and trade chiefs had been scheduled for Friday but was postponed without a new date. Talks intensify as South Korea tries to avoid steep U.S. tariffs South Korea’s delegation is under pressure. Officials want a deal that isn’t worse than what Japan got earlier this week. Tokyo secured a 15% tariff cap, and Seoul is aiming for something at least as good. National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac recently flew to the U.S. for direct talks, and Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo is also on the ground. The urgency is clear. If talks collapse, South Korea’s exports to the U.S. will face the full 25% tariff starting next Thursday. Negotiations so far have covered non-tariff barriers , especially in agriculture and digital services, though officials say foreign exchange hasn’t been seriously included in the talks. While Trump’s team juggles multiple negotiations, South Korea is still trying to get its deal over the finish line. Two more key meetings are lined up for next week: Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol will meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Foreign Minister Cho Hyun will speak with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Back home, South Korea’s economic performance is giving negotiators a little breathing room—but not much. Preliminary data shows the economy grew 0.6% in the last quarter, beating the 0.5% estimate from Reuters. That’s also a rebound from the 0.2% drop recorded in the first quarter. Over the year, the GDP rose 0.5%, better than the 0.4% many expected. South Korean exports carry growth as AI, semiconductors keep moving Growth came from exports. The Bank of Korea reported that exports of both goods and services rose 4.2% quarter over quarter, helped by semiconductors, petroleum, and chemical products. “Net exports were the principal driver of growth,” said Louise Loo, who leads Asia economics at Oxford Economics. She said companies had been pushing out shipments ahead of expected changes to U.S. trade rules, including tariffs. But it’s not all smooth. Shivaan Tandon, a markets economist at Capital Economics, said that while demand for chips and AI tech might help, South Korea’s other exports could struggle if global trade slows further. He warned that sectors not tied to AI might soon feel the squeeze if tariffs go back into effect. Trade matters for South Korea’s economy, since as of December 2024, exports made up 44% of GDP, with the U.S. ranked as the second-largest export destination, based on World Bank data. But there are limits to what Seoul is willing to offer. On Thursday, Reuters reported that the finance ministry canceled a planned meeting with Bessent due to scheduling issues. Still, both sides said they’d try to meet “as soon as possible.” In the meantime, Yonhap News said South Korean officials have ruled out any changes to beef and rice imports as part of the negotiation. Those topics are seen as politically sensitive, and Seoul isn’t using them as trade-offs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

In a recent thread titled “The XRP Bank of England Conspiracy: Was Ripple Always Crown-Approved?”, Satoshi Scope contrasts Ripple’s legal challenges in the U.S. with what he describes as strategic integration into the UK’s central banking initiatives. The thread opens with a direct juxtaposition: while the United States pursued a lawsuit against Ripple, the United Kingdom gave it what he described as “a seat at the table.” Scope revisits a lesser-known event from 2017, when the Bank of England conducted a technical trial of Ripple’s payment solution, RippleNet, as part of its research into modernizing the real-time gross settlement (RTGS). This was a period before central bank digital currencies (CBDCs ) were widely discussed, and according to Scope, the UK’s early interest in Ripple was motivated by its ambition to build a financial system beyond the SWIFT messaging network.

Open Thread pic.twitter.com/2fELLgDO1I — Satoshi Scope (@scopesatoshi) July 24, 2025 RippleNet and the UK’s RTGS Trials Satoshi Scope argues that the Bank of England’s engagement with Ripple was not a generic pilot but a deliberate evaluation of RippleNet’s ability to facilitate high-speed, transparent, and liquid settlement systems. He points out that while U.S. regulators began treating Ripple with suspicion and launched enforcement actions via the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Bank of England was moving in the opposite direction, reportedly building its future system on similar principles enabled by Ripple’s technology.

He notes that the Foundation includes influential members such as the CGI Group, Accenture, Quant, and Avalanche—firms with key roles in designing or deploying digital financial infrastructure in the UK. Timeline and Theory Proposed by Satoshi Scope Satoshi Scope lays out a timeline of events he believes support his position. In 2017, the Bank of England conducted RTGS tests with RippleNet. By 2021, Ripple had joined the advisory group working on the digital pound . And by 2023, Ripple was involved in CBDC pilots with several sovereign nations, including Palau, Bhutan, and Montenegro. Despite these developments, XRP remains under regulatory pressure in the United States. According to Scope, this contradiction is not a matter of policy uncertainty, but one of geopolitical strategy. He concludes that what is being presented as regulatory oversight is, in his view, territorial financial control. He claims that while U.S. institutions sidelined XRP, UK institutions began embedding it in their future financial architecture. He adds that Ripple’s work may have played a foundational role in Britain’s post-SWIFT planning and the architecture of a central bank-backed digital currency.

In this upcoming wave, four standout tokens—Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , and Pepe Coin (PEPE)- are shaping up to be the rocket fuel many investors have been waiting for. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme-Driven With Realistic Targets Shiba Inu may have once ridden the wave of its meme-coin origins, but these days, its narrative is evolving. Analysts at CoinPedia anticipate that SHIB will rise to $0.0000639 by the end of 2025. For holders, that represents a 4–5x move. While it won’t multiply tenfold overnight, it’s a solid play for those looking for asymmetric returns with a layer of credibility, especially if its burn mechanisms and DeFi integrations gain traction. At a current price under $0.000015, a $500 stake could approach $2,500 by the end of next year. That’s sounding a lot more like $20,000 if SHIB enters a broader altcoin surge. Cardano (ADA): Blue-Chip, Emerging Breakout Cardano built its reputation through conviction and consistency. With its peer-reviewed approach and decentralized applications slowly coming together, ADA is shaking off stagnation. According to InvestingHaven, ADA could reach $1.88 in 2025 and even stretch to $2.36 in bullish trend lines. Benzinga sees an average 2025 price near $0.945. Though ADA might not offer 10x in isolation, its low entry point below $1 means allocating $500 could yield a respectable return while adding balance to your portfolio. If the broader surge extends into 2026 and beyond, hitting $20,000 off a small stake isn’t outside the realm of possibility, especially with ADA quietly playing catch-up. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Token With Layers Little Pepe has graduated from meme status to a next-generation, Layer-2 project, and its metrics show it. The token has already covered six presale stages and is now heading into stage seven at $0.0016 per token, having raised over $8.7 million in just under two months. What distinguishes LILPEPE isn’t just timing. It combines viral meme culture with vital technical substance: speedy, low-fee Ethereum-based transactions, anti-snipe safeguards, and a zero-tax policy for seamless trading. Almost $9 million has been raised in ongoing presales, reflecting growing community confidence. If LILPEPE launches and gains traction—thanks to planned CEX listings or its memes launchpad—it could realistically attain 100x in a strong bull cycle. $200 buys 125,000 tokens at $0.0016; if the token value hits $0.16, that becomes $20,000 in weeks. That’s not fantasy—it’s the kind of breakout narrative driving meme cycles today. Pepe Coin (PEPE): OG Frog With Altcoin Momentum Almost every trader has had at least a passing love affair with Pepe Coin. Launched during the early meme coin craze, PEPE holds strong community backing and potential for a surprise run. After clearing key resistance levels, analysts now have their eyes on the $0.000020, which offers up to 9% upside in the short term. While 10x here might require broader market participation, traders preparing for a genuine alt-season might find PEPE’s current $0.000013 price point offers room for serious upside. A $200 investment could grow to $2,000 easily, setting a platform for bigger swings once meme mania returns. Why Now Feels Different This isn’t about chasing a generic meme rally—it’s about behavior, ecosystem response, and timing alignment. LILPEPE is already in motion, presales are filling fast, and the community is energized. SHIB has matured meme engines; ADA is quietly gearing up; PEPE remains a cautionary yet potent player. The coming weeks could see a domino effect: LILPEPE gains more steam, meme markets warm, and larger holders start moving capital across major and minor altcoins. If Bitcoin or Ethereum coils into a breakout, the entire cycle gets pulled up—and that’s where the first $2,000 could morph into $20,000. Conclusion Beyond sheer luck, enjoying crypto gains depends on conviction and execution. This combination of tokens offers a balanced, high-upside spread grounded in reality, yet primed for explosive moves. If the market maintains a risk-on bullish outlook, the next few weeks could rewrite the stories of many portfolios. In crypto, opportunity barrels in fast. But being ready, diversified, and strategic is what sets visionaries apart. Here’s to the next 10x.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently highlighted how the firm is transforming access to both traditional finance and crypto markets, and it’s moving fast. Hidden Road Opens DeFi to Wall Street Hidden Road, now under Ripple’s wing, is not just any prime broker. It acts as a “one-stop shop” for institutional players, from hedge funds to market makers, offering seamless access to digital assets, derivatives, and swaps. Garlinghouse emphasized that such firms historically relied on traditional banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. But now, Hidden Road is bridging the old world of finance with the new decentralized economy. Backed by strong capital and a solid balance sheet, Hidden Road is becoming a key player in helping financial institutions enter the crypto space. Garlinghouse believes this is just the beginning, with more prime brokers likely to follow suit as DeFi becomes an institutional norm. Big XRP Transfers Spark Buzz Alongside the Hidden Road update, Ripple has moved over $108 million in XRP, 35 million tokens in a single transaction. According to XRPwallets , this was an internal Ripple-to-Ripple movement, likely tied to products like ETPS, trusts, or other investments. Earlier this week, Ripple had also moved over 600 million XRP in similar large transactions, initially triggering whale rumors but later clarified as strategic movements within Ripple’s ecosystem. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News: Nasdaq Firm Files $50M Plan to Integrate XRP into Core Operations , The Bigger Picture Moreover, Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road is proving to be a game-changer for its push toward global adoption. With this, XRP can be positioned as a core settlement asset, and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin can be used as collateral, strengthening liquidity and real-world utility on the XRP Ledger. This move not only enhances Ripple’s credibility in the financial world but also accelerates real institutional use of its blockchain technology . With XRP trading near $3 despite recent volatility, and Ripple positioning itself at the center of institutional crypto adoption, the stage is being set for Ripple’s ecosystem to play a major role in the next wave of DeFi growth. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While Trump stated that he was in favor of a strong dollar, saying, “I would never support a weak dollar,” he also talked about the economic advantages that a low exchange rate provides to the US manufacturing industry. “I would never say I like low exchange rates. I'm someone who likes a strong dollar. But a weak dollar can make you more money,” Trump said. These statements came at a time when markets were speculating that he was actively supporting his administration's weak dollar policy.

Trump said, “A strong dollar has its consequences. It looks good from the outside, but no one comes to travel. You can't sell factories, trucks, or anything. A strong dollar is only good for controlling inflation, that's all. We don't have inflation anyway; we've completely eliminated it.” *This is not investment advice.

According to OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Bitcoin, currently around $117,000, is hovering near critical support at $116,000. A breakdown below this level could send it to $105,000 and $108,000, with sub-$100,000 levels possible by August or early September 2025 if support fails. The AI model highlighted key risks that could accelerate a Bitcoin sell-off, including a slowdown in spot ETF inflows and a broader U.S. market correction. Notably, Bitcoin ETF inflows have been a key factor in the asset’s momentum, contributing to the record high of over $123,000. At the close of trading on June 25, the spot Bitcoin ETFs saw an inflow of $130.8 million. At the same time, as reported by Finbold, Citi analysts predict a base case of $135,000 for Bitcoin by the end of 2025 if inflows persist; however, the bank also warned that the asset could crash to as low as $64,000. ChatGPT also noted that both scenarios could put additional pressure on Bitcoin prices, especially as the cryptocurrency’s correlation with the S&P 500 has increased in recent months. Further downside could also stem from unpredictable events such as exchange hacks or sudden regulatory crackdowns, which have historically triggered panic sell-offs. The AI model emphasized that, although the exact timing remains uncertain, investors should be aware of a 30% to 40% probability that Bitcoin could fall below $100,000 between August and September 2025.

Source: ChatGPT Bitcoin’s key price level to watch Meanwhile, cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe also highlighted the significance of Bitcoin holding above $116,000. In an X post on July 26, Poppe stated that the $116,800 level is the key battleground for bulls. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView According to his analysis, maintaining support above this threshold could set the stage for a push toward new all-time highs in the coming week. Notably, there is strong liquidity below the $116,000 level, which has been tested multiple times, suggesting buyers are actively defending the zone. Therefore, if Bitcoin can establish a stable base above $116,800, the market may target the $119,900 resistance zone. However, if BTC dips, the $110,000 to $112,000 range is highlighted as a prime accumulation zone, offering a potentially strong risk-reward opportunity for long-term investors.

Therefore, as long as the $115,000 support holds, there is room for the leading cryptocurrency to target higher prices.

Terry Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan, passed away after a heart attack, while Ozzy Osbourne passed away at the age of 76. Hulk Hogan, Ozzy Osbourne Meme Coins Soar Memecoins inspired by and paying tribute to wrestling legend Hulk Hogan and Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne skyrocketed as tributes over their deaths flooded the internet. Hogan was pronounced dead in a hospital on Thursday after medics arrived at his home to answer for a possible cardiac arrest. Hogan’s death comes only days after Ozzy Osbourne, the frontman of legendary metal band Black Sabbath, passed away at home at the age of 76. Hulk Hogan was easily the most famous wrestler in the WWF, now WWE, during the 80s and 90s. Hogan’s career spanned decades as he wowed audiences in the ring and across television and film. On the other hand, Ozzy Osbourne, often called the Prince of Darkness, was one of the most legendary figures in the rock and metal world. Osbourne and Black Sabbath are estimated to have sold 75 million albums globally. The crypto industry paid tribute to the two legends in its own unique way. A Wrapped Ethereum (wETH) token called Hulkamania (HULK) rose a staggering 122,000%, trading around $0.001335 at its peak. According to data from DEXTools, the memecoin was created only hours ago. Meanwhile, other memecoins using Ozzy Osbourne’s name have also popped up. One token, called The Mad Man (OZZY), pumped over 16,800% to trade around $0.003851, reaching a market cap of nearly $4 million. Ozzy’s passing also created a furore in the NFT market as fans rushed to get their hands on one of his official CryptoBatz collections. Another Hogan Token Hulk Hogan-inspired memecoins are nothing new. A Solana-based memecoin, HULKAMANIA (HULK), launched in June last year. The token has surged over 2,000% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.0006146, reaching a market capitalization of $500,000. Despite the recent spike, the memecoin is far from its peak market cap of $18.8 million. The rally happened after Hogan promoted the token on his X account. However, the posts were later deleted, and Hogan claimed he didn’t make the posts. Fans Driven By Emotion And FOMO Most individuals bought the memecoins due to the fear of missing out (FOMO) and strong emotions. One crypto analyst stated, “It’s sad how quickly people turn grief into a trading opportunity.” This is not the first time the crypto market has exploded with memecoins following the death of a famous personality. Memecoins using the name of O.J. Simpson appeared in the market soon after he passed away. Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s death in November 2023 also spawned memecoins, several of them in bad taste. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The company said in an SEC filing on Friday that it’s calling a shareholder meeting this September to approve the decision. If passed, Bit Digital’s authorized ordinary shares would jump from 340 million to 1 billion, and total authorized capital would rise from $3.5 million to $10.1 million. The number of preference shares, capped at 10 million, won’t change. This expansion is meant to support its long-term Ethereum acquisition plans and overall growth. Bit Digital said the current share structure no longer fits its goals. “Our management believes that our current authorized share capital is not sufficient for our needs,” the filing said. The company’s board is pushing for the proposal, with every member voting in favor and recommending shareholders do the same. The decision will need a majority vote from both ordinary and preference shareholders. Bit Digital buys 19,683 ETH with direct offering proceeds Bit Digital has already shown what it plans to do with more capital. On July 18, the company confirmed it had bought 19,683 Ethereum using money raised from a $67.3 million direct offering to institutional investors. That purchase raised its total Ethereum holdings to 120,306 ETH, which is currently worth around $450 million, based on prices tracked by CoinGecko. This places Bit Digital among the top publicly listed companies holding Ethereum. The only two with bigger ETH treasuries are Bitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming . Bit Digital isn’t new to crypto, but it used to focus on Bitcoin mining. That’s no longer the case. The firm has turned its attention entirely to Ethereum, building what it sees as a treasury model for a new financial era. Chief Executive Officer Sam Tabar explained the company’s position in a statement. “With approximately 120,000 ETH, Bit Digital is positioned among the largest institutional Ethereum treasuries in the public markets,” Sam said. “We view Ethereum as foundational to the next phase of digital financial infrastructure. We believe Ethereum’s programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets, and we remain committed to scaling our ETH holdings as part of that long-term strategy.” Bit Digital isn’t just holding Ethereum in cold storage; it’s using it. The company operates validators on the Ethereum network and stakes the majority of its ETH. That means it earns yield directly from the network while helping secure it. Ethereum has evolved from just another coin to a full-blown settlement layer used in stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized applications. Bit Digital sees that and is locking in a position in it. The company sees Ethereum as the infrastructure layer for what it calls the “onchain economy.” ETH’s staking yield, programmability, and adoption rate are key factors in why Bit Digital has chosen to treat it as a strategic treasury asset. The network supports real activity, not just speculation. The firm believes this is how value will move and settle across markets in the coming years.

The flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $114,770 on Friday as bearish sentiment peaked. However, it rebounded to reclaim $117,000, and currently trades around $117,307. Satoshi-Era Investor Cashes Out Via Galaxy Digital An early Bitcoin (BTC) investor has cashed out 80,000 BTC worth $9 billion at current prices through Galaxy Digital, completing what is being described as one of the largest notional transactions in crypto history. However, the details regarding the transaction have not been disclosed. The sale disclosure appeared in an announcement late on Friday, followed by a post on Galaxy Digital’s official blog. Galaxy Digital has not revealed the client’s identity, but stated that it was “part of the investor’s broader real estate planning strategy.” The announcement came after a day of heightened volatility for Bitcoin , with the asset’s price briefly dropping below $115,000 on Friday. Lookonchain data revealed several large transactions from Galaxy Digital throughout Friday, with most of the funds sent directly to exchanges. All the transactions were tied to the investor who moved over 80,000 BTC from a wallet that was dormant for 14 years. BTC rebounded after Friday’s drop below $115,000, with analysts noting that the market has already absorbed the entire sale. Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at Theya, stated, “80,000 BTC , over $9 billion, was sold into open market order books, and bitcoin barely moved.” Bitcoin (BTC) Could Reach $135,000 By Year-End Citigroup has predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $135,000 by the end of the year in its best-case scenario. According to Citigroup analysts, strong demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs, favorable macroeconomic trends, and growing user adoption could fuel the flagship cryptocurrency’s rally. Bitcoin is trading between $115,000 and $120,000 over the past week, showing resilience despite mixed economic data. The prediction has sparked optimism among investors and highlights Wall Street’s growing confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered from Friday’s low as it reclaimed $117,000 and moved to $117,565. Despite the recovery, it remains in the red during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has recovered over the past 24 hours, up nearly 2%. Analysts believe the price will pull back towards the $115,000 mark if current market trends continue, marking a 6% decline from recent all-time highs. However, they pointed out that the correction remains well within the normal volatility range observed in previous bull phases. This indicates the decline is part of a healthy market reset rather than a deeper correction. BTC registered a sharp drop last Tuesday (July 15), dropping to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. It recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 1% to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $118,641. The price faced volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $119,101. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.03% to $117,877. Sellers retained control over the weekend, with the price dropping marginally on Saturday and 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $117,240. Source: TradingView BTC recovered on Monday and reached an intraday high of $119,603. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $117,397, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% and settling at $119,980. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as the price fell 0.99% to an intraday low of $117,303 before settling at $118,794. Sellers retained control on Thursday as BTC fell 0.35% and settled at $118,381. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $114,770 on Friday.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1? Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR Price Forecast 2027 Hedera Price Forecast 2028 HBAR Price Target 2029 Hedera Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s Hedera Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency. Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.27358750 10.07% Market Cap. $ 11,598,104,511.9714 Trading Volume. $ 935,033,793.6034 Circulating Supply. 42,392,669,987.5326 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 Hedera experienced a volatile first half of 2025. After peaking at $0.40 in mid-January, the HBAR price began a steady decline. External factors and waning investor engagement were evident in the TVL, which contributed to this downturn. Ultimately, HBAR was pushed into a converging falling wedge pattern, hitting a low of $0.125 in early April. However, the tide began to turn in the second week of April. A broader crypto rally provided a much-needed lift for HBAR, breaking free from the wedge and bouncing off a robust support zone that had previously fueled a rally in Q4 2024. This zone, validated by the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, indicated strong buying interest and set the stage for a sharp rebound. In a remarkable surge, HBAR climbed nearly 80%, rising from $0.125 to $0.228 between April and mid-May. Unfortunately, this momentum was short-lived, as geopolitical tensions escalated in mid-May, causing HBAR’s price to retreat back to its April lows, forming another parallel declining wedge on the chart. By the end of June, HBAR remained within that channel but started to see bears losing grip to bulls, when entering July, momentum blasted, breaking the upper border of the parallel channel. Hedera Price Targets July 2025 Precisely in July, from the declining parallel channel, Hedera saw strong demand starting from $0.125 in late June to July 18th, where HBAR spiked 135% to $0.30, piercing through all short-term and long-term EMA bands. This movement followed a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June and was further bolstered by Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $123,231. But, the crypto sector saw short-term profit booking, not even HBAR was spared by the bears. But this profit booking seems healthy, as it has not broken the 20-day EMA’s dynamic support, indicating the strength is intact in the overall trend and marking it as a cooldown phase before another potential rally. If the bulls regain strength, then in the rest of July, it may aim for $0.30 level’s retest again and flipping it with a daily close could potentially open doors next month for a retest of the $0.34 and $0.40 resistance. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HBAR Price Prediction July 2025 $0.125 $0.27 $0.40 Hedera Price Prediction 2025 (H2) Looking ahead, if the momentum persists, HBAR price might even reach $0.75 by year-end. However, on the downside, failing to maintain the $0.190 support zone could pull it down towards multi-month support at $0.125. Below this level, the price could even drop toward $0.072. Also, while TVL was previously down, it has witnessed a resurgence, with investor trust reflected in TVL increasing from $75 million to $114 million within the last 30 days. Hedera’s internal developments also tell a promising story. The ecosystem continues to expand, with the launch of its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool called the Hedera Agent Kit , which simplifies token creation. Another significant project, HashSphere, is set to launch in Q3 2025, aiming to provide a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. Moreover, Hedera underwent a rebranding on May 15, with the HBAR Foundation now known as the Hedera Foundation and the Governing Council rebranded as the Hedera Council. This restructuring positions Hedera for a stronger future, signaling maturity within its ecosystem.

From massive bitcoin buys to major scams, upgrades, and unexpected exits, the stories came from every corner – exchanges, regulators, and even celebrities! If you’ve missed anything, don’t worry. Here’s a complete crypto roundup for you to get caught up on it all. Let’s dive in. #1 Trump Media Buys $2B in Bitcoin to Build Crypto Reserve Trump Media has officially joined the crypto treasury club. The company behind Truth Social confirmed a $2 billion investment in bitcoin and bitcoin-related assets. CEO Devin Nunes says the move is part of a long-term strategy to “help ensure our Company’s financial freedom” and support a future utility token for the platform. Another $300 million has been set aside for options tied to Bitcoin. The company also plans to explore crypto ETFs . #2 Ozzy Osbourne’s Death Triggers Scam Token Rush on Solana Just hours after Ozzy Osbourne passed away, Solana saw a flood of new memecoins using his name. At least 15 “OZZY” or “RIP Ozzy” tokens were launched – many of them scams. On-chain data shows 10 were confirmed rug pulls, draining around 1,625 SOL, or over $325,000, from investors. In most cases, liquidity was pulled within minutes. The trend mirrors other high-profile crypto scams tied to real-world events. As one report claims , “up to 98% of tokens on Pump.fun” are pump-and-dump schemes, though the platform strongly denies it. #3 New ‘Stretch’ Stock Gives Michael Saylor More Room to Buy BTC Michael Saylor isn’t slowing down! Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has raised $2.8 billion through its new “Stretch” preferred stock offering, up from the original $500 million plan. The money will go straight into more Bitcoin, part of the company’s long-term “42/42” goal to raise $84 billion by 2027. This new stock comes with a flexible 9% monthly dividend, giving Strategy more control as crypto markets shift. With over 607,000 BTC already on its books, the company is doubling down even as critics warn that its debt-heavy strategy could carry major risk. #4 FTX Will Start Next Payout to Creditors on Sept. 30 FTX will begin its next round of creditor repayments on September 30, the bankrupt exchange said on Wednesday. The funds will be distributed through BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer. So far, FTX has already returned $6.2 billion after getting court approval for its repayment plan. The company also got permission to reduce its disputed claim reserve from $6.5B to $4.3B. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year sentence for fraud, but for creditors, the slow road to recovery continues. #5 Ripple CEO Warns of New YouTube Scam Ripple is once again warning its community as YouTube scams targeting XRP holders are on the rise. CEO Brad Garlinghouse posted on X this week, urging users to watch out for fake Ripple channels offering high-return airdrops. Like clockwork, with success and market rallies, scammers ramp up their attacks on the crypto community — PLEASE BEWARE of the latest scam targeting the XRP family on @YouTube and impersonating @Ripple ’s official account! We will keep reporting these – please do the same. As… https://t.co/WodO4ZUyW9 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 23, 2025 The warning comes just days after XRP’s price dropped 10% from its recent high – a moment scammers appear to be using to their advantage. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also flagged a deepfake video promoting a fake 100M XRP giveaway. Investors are advised to avoid unknown links and double-check official accounts. #6 Justin Sun’s Tron Inc. Lists on Nasdaq Justin Sun’s Tron Inc. is now a public company. The firm joined the Nasdaq this week, not through a standard IPO, but by merging with SRM Entertainment – a U.S. toy maker that supplies Disney and Universal. Sun called the listing “a very big moment for the whole industry.” Tron Inc. now holds over $115 million worth of TRX tokens, and trading volume surged 36% after the news. #7 FBI Closes Case Against Kraken’s Jesse Powell Jesse Powell, co-founder of Kraken, is officially in the clear. The FBI has dropped its investigation into him, confirming no criminal charges will be filed. A declination letter from the Department of Justice also states that all seized laptops, phones, and crypto have been returned. The case was tied to a nonprofit dispute, not to Kraken or crypto. This clears the path for Powell to focus fully on Kraken again and it sends a strong signal that facts still matter in high-profile investigations. #8 Ethereum’s Next Big Upgrade May Arrive in November Ethereum developers are targeting a November launch for the Fusaka hard fork ,, which includes 11 proposals focused on security and scalability. One key update, EIP-7825, aims to make the network stronger against attacks. A devnet rolled out this week, with two public testnets to follow. “We need our timeline TIGHT,” warned protocol support member Nixo. To speed things up, EIP-7907 has been dropped, and the EVM Object Format won’t be included. Fusaka could ship just before Devconnect, while work on the next upgrade , Glamsterdam, is already underway. #9 CoinDCX Hit by $44M Hack, Customer Funds Safe CoinDCX , India’s largest crypto exchange, confirmed it lost $44 million after one of its internal accounts was compromised. The account was used for liquidity on a partner exchange and had no connection to user wallets. CEO Sumit Gupta said the breach was contained quickly and the loss will be covered by CoinDCX’s own reserves. The stolen crypto – 4,443 ETH and 155,830 SOL – was moved using Solana-Ethereum bridges and now sits dormant. Investigations are ongoing. A 25% recovery bounty has been announced for anyone who helps trace the funds. #10 80,000 Vintage Bitcoins Sold by Galaxy Digital On Friday evening, Galaxy Digital confirmed it sold over 80,000 bitcoins, worth more than $9 billion, for a Satoshi-era investor. These vintage coins, created in 2011, had been pooled and quietly transferred before the sale. “The transaction was part of the investor’s broader estate planning strategy,” Galaxy said. What’s surprising is how the market reacted: it didn’t. Despite the size of the sale, prices held steady. With similar moves expected, like the UK’s 61,245 BTC sale, this could signal a new phase of market maturity. Bitcoin is headed up! In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! First U.S.-Regulated Stablecoin Launches Under GENIUS Act: Ethena and Anchorage rolled out USDtb with full federal oversight , backed by cash and Treasuries. It’s the first onshore stablecoin under the new law and ENA jumped 5% on launch. Citadel Pushes Back on Tokenization Loopholes: The firm warned the SEC that exempting major players from standard rules could distort equity markets and hurt investor protections, calling instead for formal rulemaking to prevent unfair regulatory advantages. SEC Hits Pause on Bitwise ETF After Green Light: Just hours after approving the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund conversion, the SEC moved to halt progress for a formal review, which was what it did against Grayscale’s GDLC and drew fresh legal heat. Pudgy Penguins CEO Eyes NFTs 2.0 and a Gaming Breakout: Luca Netz says crypto’s next big wave will come from gaming, not just NFTs. With $50M in projected revenue and toys as brand touchpoints , Igloo Inc. is betting big on long-term consumer IP. Goldman, BNY Bring Tokenized Funds to Wall Street: Backed by Treasuries and supported by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, the funds offer yield with real-time settlement, pushing blockchain infrastructure deeper into capital markets right as new stablecoin laws kick in. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead Bitcoin’s role as a corporate reserve is back in focus. With Trump Media and Strategy pouring billions into BTC, treasury strategies are evolving fast. Expect more firms to follow. Stablecoins are entering a new phase – fully regulated! The launch of USDtb shows what compliance-driven stablecoins could look like. Ethereum’s next upgrade is moving fast. Fusaka is on track for a November release with key changes focused on security. Celebrity-linked scams are becoming a bigger threat. The Ozzy token rush highlights how quickly scammers exploit real-world events. This kind of memecoin trend could put more pressure on platforms to respond faster. Large BTC sales no longer shock the market. Galaxy sold $9B in vintage bitcoin without shaking prices. With more big holders expected to sell this year, the market seems better prepared than before. That’s it for now – until the next twist, the next shift, the next headline.

48983888,https://timestabloid.com/?p=75614,1753533686,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Suggests XRP Wave 3 Rally About to Start,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-suggests-xrp-wave-3-rally-about-to-start/,"XRP is currently holding firm just above the critical $3.00 level, trading around $3.19 at the time of writing. After failing to sustain momentum above the $3.21 resistance, the price retraced to retest the major $3.00 support, a level now closely watched by analysts for signs of a renewed breakout. Among them, respected market analyst Casitrades believes XRP may be gearing up for a powerful Wave 3 rally in its ongoing Elliott Wave structure. XRP Holds Strong at Support as Wave Structure Develops In a recent analysis shared via X, Casitrades emphasized that XRP appears to have completed a deep Wave 2 correction, reaching an 85.4% Fibonacci retracement from the previous swing high. XRP Tests Critical $3 Support: Is Wave 3 About to Begin? Unfortunately, $XRP could not hold the $3.21 resistance, and ultimately has come back down to backtest the $3.00 major support. What's promising is that we have not made a new low. Instead, it appears to have… pic.twitter.com/bVD3HAwRBN — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) July 25, 2025 Importantly, the asset has not made a lower low, a positive signal suggesting the corrective phase may be over. If the $3.00 support continues to hold, this could mark the beginning of a Wave 3 impulse, traditionally the strongest and most explosive move in Elliott Wave theory. Casitrades is now watching for a reclaim of the $3.21 resistance level. A break above this zone, especially on rising volume, would add strong confirmation that Wave 3 is underway. His analysis suggests a Wave 3 target of around $3.82, which aligns with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension and notably coincides with the all-time high (ATH) reported by multiple data sources. Technical and Market Signals Support the Outlook XRP’s price structure remains constructive despite recent volatility. After touching an intraday low of $3.02, the price quickly rebounded, reflecting underlying buying strength. Analysts from Binance and CoinDesk also noted the growing institutional interest and strong dip-buying behavior around the $3.00 level. Market participants are closely monitoring volume trends as a potential catalyst. Historically, strong volume accompanying a break above a key resistance, such as $3.21, can quickly escalate into aggressive upward moves. A successful breakout could open the door for a retest of historical highs and potentially a run toward the $4.00–$6.00 range in the medium term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macro Tailwinds Reinforce Bullish Sentiment Beyond technicals, XRP continues to benefit from improving fundamentals. Regulatory pressure has eased since Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC began to wind down. Institutional interest in XRP is rising, with multiple spot ETF applications under review , and futures-based XRP products already trading. Ripple’s broader ecosystem growth is also noteworthy. Its stablecoin, RLUSD, is gaining traction across international markets, and XRP continues to be integrated into cross-border payment networks. These developments increase XRP’s utility and token burn rate, further supporting price appreciation. Moreover, ongoing discussions about XRP’s inclusion in a U.S. national digital asset reserve, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, are reinforcing investor confidence. While not yet official policy, such considerations add a significant layer of legitimacy and long-term potential to XRP’s narrative. Casitrades’ analysis suggests that XRP may be entering a pivotal phase. If the $3.00 support holds and price climbs back above $3.21 with conviction, a Wave 3 impulse toward $3.82 and beyond could be imminent. With favorable technicals, surging institutional interest, and strong fundamental backing, XRP’s outlook appears increasingly bullish. With the weekend approaching, market unpredictability could set the stage for a surprise breakout. All eyes now remain on the $3.21 resistance, the trigger point that could unlock XRP’s next explosive move. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The token is showing resilience, sitting above key technical averages, but recent large token activity is drawing renewed scrutiny. Larsen Sells $200M XRP Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has offloaded over 100 million XRP tokens, worth around $200 million, during the recent price dip , adding pressure to the already shaky market. XRP fell by nearly 20%, touching $3.18 as of July 23. While some see this as a routine move, analysts warn that such large-scale selling, especially during market pullbacks, can worsen price drops. Chris Larsen (Ripple co-founder) still holds 2.58B $XRP — that’s $8.83B. If $200M was just the warm-up… what’s next? Don’t get dumped on. Don’t be the exit liquidity. Protect yourself. https://t.co/k152FXlm8N pic.twitter.com/T5CpTQjdDa — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) July 25, 2025 Larsen still holds a massive 2.58 billion XRP (about $7.9 billion), and experts like CryptoQuant’s J.A. Maartun believe more sales could be coming. This has raised concerns about how much influence major holders like Larsen have on XRP’s price action . Analysts tracked about $140 million of that going through centralized platforms, often a signal of forthcoming sales. XRP fell from its $3.66 high to below $3.16 in the same week. What Makes This Sell-Off Different? This isn’t Larsen’s first liquidation spree; he’s sold over 107 million XRP (valued at about $3.3 billion) since November. His fellow co-founder, Jed McCaleb, completed his orderly exit in 2022, but Larsen’s continued activity keeps pressure on market sentiment. Some observers see this pattern as strategic profit-taking built into the token’s early structure. Major seller activity near all-time highs, but not coordinated dumping, is historically normal for founder-held coins. Still, the scale raises concerns around micro-market influence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Explains Why Hidden Road Is Key to DeFi Growth , XRP Price Crash Ahead? While critics cite the founder’s selling as a trigger for recent weakness, others point to broader market trends driving the pullback. Legal expert Bill Morgan dismissed the idea that one person is tanking the market, citing macro forces and regulatory anxiety instead. Even after large withdrawals, technical indicators show support near $2.25 to $3.00, and XRP is consolidating around $3.10-$3.16, a balance point where both bulls and bears are active. Bitcoin dominance has slipped to around 59–61%, a sign that money is rotating into tokens like XRP, SOL, and Dogecoin, which have recovered strong gains. Technical setups show room to move upward from current support levels, with a break above $3.66 potentially triggering renewed buying up toward resistance near $3.81. Institutional demand remains steady, with open interest in XRP futures climbing steadily. Will Chris Larsen Sell More XRP in the Coming Days? With founder sales still possible, investors are watching how markets absorb liquidity. If XRP can reclaim $3.31 and bounce off support, traders may view recent declines as short-term noise. If not, deeper correction toward $2.25 or below could follow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the crypto analytics platform notes that tens of thousands of tokens have sprung to life during the month of July, meaning that early investors could be looking to take profits. “[Thursday] saw another wave of ancient coins move on-chain, with 3,900 BTC aged over 10 years becoming active. This follows the 80,000 BTC that moved on July 4, 2025. Such activity from long-dormant supply often reflects internal reallocation, custodial shifts, or in some cases sell-side pressure.” Source: Glassnode/X According to Glassnode, the top crypto asset by market cap could still form a “bottom formation zone” if it fails to hold support. “The sharp rally from $110,000 to $117,000 created an on-chain air gap or a low-density accumulation zone. Since the $122,000 ATH (all-time high), price has held above it. If support fails, history shows such gaps can still evolve into bottom formation zones.” Source: Glassnode/X In its weekly on-chain analytics report, Glassnode details how BTC reaching a $1 trillion realized market cap is a monumental step for the flagship cryptocurrency. “Recent capital inflow has pushed Bitcoin’s realized cap above the $1 trillion mark for the first time. This is truly a monumental milestone for Bitcoin, highlighting its deep liquidity profile, and growing relevance on the macro stage. The larger Bitcoin becomes, the more capital can be stored within it, and the larger size can be settled via transactions.” Bitcoin’s realized market cap calculates the value of each coin at the price it was last transacted (on-chain), rather than the current market price. The metric aims to represent the “true” capital inflow into the BTC network. Bitcoin is trading for $116,671 at time of writing, a 2.1% decrease during the last 24 hours.

This happened as institutional interest in Ethereum crypto has hit a significant milestone this July. The major push is received with rapidly gaining ETF inflows and whale accumulation, this is fueling optimism for a broader breakout in the Ethereum price ahead. ETF Inflows Trigger Surge in Ethereum Price Sentiment The Ethereum price saw renewed upward momentum on July 25th, and gained 6%. This gains are closely tied to a record-breaking surge in spot ETF inflows over the month and on 25th too. According to on-chain analyst Ted Pillows , Ethereum ETFs registered a net inflow of $452.8 million on a single day, out of which BlackRock’s ETHA accounted for $440.1 million, with the remainder attributed to Fidelity’s FETH. These figures are displaying a very extraordinary difference from the early July numbers, where daily inflows remained under $100 million. However, since July 9th, this trend reversed dramatically, revealing a multifold jump in institutional buys. Whale Activity Spikes as Institutional Momentum Builds Supporting this ongoing ETH bullish wave, the analyst Ali Martinez also highlighted a rise in large Ethereum holders, based on Glassnode’s data tracking “mega whale addresses” holding more than 10,000 ETH. 170 new whales holding over 10,000 Ethereum $ETH have joined the network in the past month. This is a strong sign of growing institutional interest! pic.twitter.com/q06HrHx9iE — Ali (@ali_charts) July 26, 2025 He mentioned on X that, since July 9th, over 170 new whale addresses have been added to the network. This is firmly suggesting that much of the ETF inflow is translating directly into long-term accumulation and large entities are positioning themselves for a long-term move. Moreover, Ted Pillows further remarked that on-chain volume has surged by 288% over the past three weeks, reaching a staggering $10.38 billion. According to him, the Ethereum price rally has only just begun, he bets that the real breakout still lies ahead and will be visibly louder once it manifests. Ethereum Price Chart Faces Multi-Year Trendline Test Zooming out to the Ethereum price chart on a weekly timeframe, a critical technical development is underway. As noted by another analyst, he revealed that the Ethereum price is attempting to break a 3.7-year long descending trendline. If Ethereum manages to give a weekly close, it would likely shoot a sustained upward trajectory. $ETH /W1 #Ethereum is attempting to break a 3.7-year trendline. pic.twitter.com/EcscYzdXFf — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) July 26, 2025 This optimism aligns with the broader Ethereum price analysis today, where market optimism is backed not just by inflows, but also by strong technical setups and a supportive macro environment. Therefore, with the Ethereum price currently holding near the key breakout areas, several traders are starting to make bold forecasts.

According to the details of the arrest, there were about 105 Indians and 81 Pakistanis. The international crackdown uncovered a vast trafficking and online fraud syndicate, with several victims being freed by authorities. According to the report, the arrest in Cambodia prompted Indian authorities to launch an investigation, led by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), into the cross-border digital crime network. In the documents released by ED, several fraud cases that have been tackled in the country have origins in scam centers throughout Southeast Asia , with Cambodia and Laos fingered as potential locations. These activities are always linked to the Golden Triangle, a notorious hub for illegal trafficking. Cambodia arrests individuals linked to a cybercrime network Investigations have revealed that numerous Indian citizens have been victims of this trafficking, with the perpetrators enticing them with the prospect of securing high-paying jobs for them abroad, especially in Singapore and Dubai. At the end of the day, most of them are trafficked to the locations where the groups carry out their digital scam . One victim, Manish Tomar from Uttar Pradesh, alleged that he was lured by Instagram influencer Bobby Kataria with a job offer in Singapore. Tomar said he ended up in Laos, and his passport was confiscated by Chinese nationals. He added that he was then taken to the Golden Triangle, where he was forced to take part in several investment scams and impersonation frauds. “He described a compound of 20–30 buildings guarded by armed private security, with translators to mediate between Chinese bosses and trafficked workers from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh,” the ED said in their note. Another victim, known as Paul, said he thought he was heading to Dubai for a job interview but found himself in a “digital arrest scam” center in Poim Phet in Cambodia. “There were guards trained in Muay Thai, armed with rifles. I was trained for seven days to impersonate a CBI officer. My job was to threaten victims in India, claiming they were involved in illegal activity,” Paul said. Paul admitted to scamming a person in Maharashtra of Rs. 75,000 ($900). In his detailed account, Paul mentioned that the scam centers operated in different units, but they were structured. “Line 1” would pretend to be from TRAI, while “Line 2” would impersonate police officers. “Line 3” acted as DCP-rank officers, offering fake help to their victims. Paul said he worked in Line 2, impersonating a police officer on WhatsApp video calls. The uniformed individual would lip-sync while he delivered the threats in multiple Indian languages. Furthermore, Paul said the syndicate used iPhones instead of computers to avoid IP tracking, and VOIP calls were routed through an app called Brian, with lines purchased from Thailand. He said the group specifically trained Pakistani nationals to impersonate Indian law enforcement, making it harder for Indian agencies to trace the fraud. Meanwhile, the ED said it is investigating a fraud network worth at least Rs. 159 crore (approximately $19.5 million). While most of the funds have been moved abroad via digital assets, the agency has been able to seize Rs. 3 crore ($360,000) from several Indian bank accounts. The ED also said it has secured the arrest of eight individuals for aiding in the creation of shell companies and laundering crime proceeds. Indian officials say the operation is a “ pig-butchering ” scam model where victims are being manipulated through various social platforms to invest in several digital assets and stock markets.

It’s not all about the meme coin, though. As talk of altcoin robustness gains momentum, attention is also being directed at true-utility initiatives like Remittix (RTX), which is under the radar and picking up steam along with big guns like ETH and DOGE. Dogecoin takes over socials, but what’s next? The Dogecoin value is presently sitting at $0.2272, having fallen 6.86% in the last 24 hours. For all the decline, Dogecoin remains a market cap behemoth of $34.13 billion, trading over $4.23 billion in the last day alone. Most traders are still surfing the wave of meme coins based on faith from the community and occasional whale-influenced price bounces. By one CoinMarketCap post earlier this week, large traders are reportedly preparing for a breakout. This is in line with growing speculation that Dogecoin could play a larger role in decentralized payments of the future. As traders put their money on it, the search for other high-potential altcoins is on fire. Dogecoin traders eye high-utility altcoins While Dogecoin remains one of the most talked-about cryptos, investors are flocking more to early-stage projects with real real-world use. Investors now look beyond hype to tokens with stronger fundamentals specifically in cross-border payments, staking crypto and low gas fee crypto. This has helped bring projects like Remittix, a DeFi project that is steadily making waves with its real-world application and increasing presale numbers. Being a cross-chain payment system, Remittix (RTX) will aim to simplify crypto-to-fiat exchange across the globe. Remittix beta wallet launch attracts buzz Remittix is preparing to launch its second-generation beta wallet in Q3 2025 a speed, security and ease app that will handle Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. The wallet enables individuals to send crypto straight into bank accounts in over 30 nations. This news has been a driving force in accelerating the presale, already generating more than $17 million in sales with more than 560 million RTX tokens sold. Remittix is now priced at just $0.0842, a definite contender among the best of the top crypto under $1 and one of the most hotly anticipated future crypto projects. Global Transfers: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Real Use: Built for fast, low-fee remittances with broad utility Wallet Incoming: Beta wallet release coming in Q3 2025 $250,000 Giveaway: Ongoing promotion to attract new customers 50% Bonus Live: Early birds get substantial presale bonuses Why Remittix is attractive to utility-oriented traders With the presale approaching its $18 million soft cap, Remittix is gaining momentum as a payments solution to the real world. It’s designed to help users in high-fee remittance corridors with fast, low-cost crypto payments without using centralized exchanges. This unique approach puts Remittix ahead in the midst of hype that occupies the gap. More investors are seeking crypto with real utility, and RTX is becoming a top DeFi project 2025 candidate, especially for early stage crypto investors in search of low cap crypto gems. Remittix also supports over 40 cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies with transparent FX conversion and seamless UX. It is attractive not just for individuals, but also for freelancers, companies and cross-border teams. Conclusion: Dogecoin to Remittix — a change of heart? When Dogecoin whales make large transactions, the overall community is keeping an eye on utility-focused initiatives like Remittix.

CryptoQuant CEO Raises Big Questions,https://coinpedia.org/news/did-galaxy-digital-just-sell-stolen-bitcoin-cryptoquant-ceo-raises-big-questions/,"The post Did Galaxy Digital Just Sell Stolen Bitcoin? CryptoQuant CEO Raises Big Questions appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A quiet $9 billion Bitcoin sale has now turned into a major controversy and it could be tied to one of the earliest crypto exchange hacks on record. This week, Galaxy Digital confirmed it sold 80,000 Bitcoin (worth over $9.4 billion) through over-the-counter (OTC) deals. But CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says these coins may not belong to a long-term investor at all. Instead, they could be linked to the 2011 MyBitcoin exchange hack – a breach that, until now, had faded into crypto history. From a Dormant Wallet to a $9 Billion Payout “The recent transfer of 80,000 BTC, dormant for 14 years, came from wallets originally hosted by MyBitcoin,” Ju posted on X. These wallets had been inactive since April 2011, two months before MyBitcoin went offline following a hack. At the time, the exchange’s owner, Tom Williams, admitted the breach and said he was working on a resolution. The attack reportedly caused $72,000 in losses – a small figure by today’s standards, but if those coins were kept, they’re now worth billions. Ju believes the Bitcoins either belong to the hacker or to Williams himself, who disappeared from the public eye after the exchange collapsed. Did Galaxy Check Where the BTC Came From? Here’s where things get murky. Ju added, “It seems Galaxy Digital bought (handled) the #Bitcoin from them, but I’m not sure if they did any forensics.” Galaxy didn’t reveal the seller’s identity. Instead, the company described them as a “Satoshi-era investor”, someone from Bitcoin’s early days, and said the sale was part of estate planning. That explanation hasn’t convinced everyone. The lack of transparency is now raising concerns over whether Galaxy skipped proper checks before handling a historic pile of possibly hacked funds. *Galaxy handled the 80K BTC sale for them. pic.twitter.com/QE4hDbHUXt — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 26, 2025 Also Read: Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 26 July, 2025 Bitcoin Price Holds Steady Despite the Drama What’s surprising is how calm the market stayed. Despite such a large sale, Bitcoin barely moved, trading now around $117,983 . Since the deal was done OTC, it didn’t directly affect order books or exchanges. Still, it raises a bigger question: if stolen coins can quietly re-enter the system, how secure is the broader market really? A Sign of How the Bitcoin Market Is Changing There’s a larger shift happening too. Ju, who once used whale activity to predict Bitcoin cycles , now says that approach no longer works. Old whales aren’t selling to retail anymore – they’re passing coins to new long-term holders. This shift could explain how 14-year-old coins tied to a failed exchange can move billions without shaking the system.

Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031.

Support level is strong around $0.4400, preventing further downside movement in the current session. Resistance is at $0.4453, restricting upward momentum on price movement. On July 26 2025 the Pi Network’s daily chart shows a slow dropping pattern with narrow-bodied candles gathering around $0.4418. The price action saw a minimal drop of 0.23%, closing at $0.4418 after reaching a high of $0.4453 and a low of $0.4400. The chart shows a persistent downtrend from July 21’s failed breakout, with follow-through selling pressure dragging price lower into tight consolidation. Pi 1-day price chart shows a bearish trend with RSI at 40 On the 24-hour chart, Pi is trading at $0.4413, reflecting a period of consolidation with minimal volatility. MACD line at -0.0201 sits below the signal line at -0.0239. This setup highlights ongoing negative momentum, although the histogram is flattening. RSI reading stands at 40.19, Pi/USDT is in a neutral-to-weak zone. Despite ecosystem activity and past price fluctuations, the market is offering little volatility in the current phase. PI/USDT Chart on TradingView Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network (Pi/USDT) is trading at $0.4414 on the 4-hour chart, showing signs of consolidation after recent downward movement. The MACD line is at 0.0044, below the signal line at 0.0046, indicating slight bearish momentum. This suggests weak buying pressure as sellers continue to dominate in the short term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 42.68. These values place Pi in a neutral-to-bearish territory, hinting at fading bullish momentum. If RSI dips below 40, it may suggest further downside pressure unless buying activity increases near support. PI/USDT Chart on TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Looking ahead, support holds around $0.4400, with a possible drop toward $0.42 if selling pressure increases. On the upside, resistance near $0.450 must be cleared to trigger any short-term bullish momentum Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event. Pi Network has announced two major features during the Pi2Day 2025 celebration: AI-powered Pi App Studio and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system. The App Studio allows users to build Pi apps using natural language without coding, while the staking feature helps boost app visibility on the main net, marking a big step in expanding Pi’s real-world utility. Creating apps through Pi App Studio means anyone, regardless of technical knowledge, is able to own and run an online product and business built around their expertise and ideas. https://t.co/Vv88Jsqv8v This is made possible through the use of AI and supported by the blockchain… — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) July 3, 2025 PI has recently announced that over 2.6 million users joined Pi Network’s Pi2Day 2025 Ecosystem Challenge, with more than 761,000 completing all steps to unlock exclusive rewards and test new tools.

If that passphrase is stolen or leaked, anyone can access the wallet and drain the funds Some pioneers are raising concerns about compromised wallets and stolen passphrases.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network’s price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. As start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.48–$0.52, range. As of July 19, 2025 PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. As of July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continues to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remains subdued",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 13:00:38

The cryptocurrency has successfully penetrated the major resistance zone between $175.96 and $185.56, positioning itself for a potential breakout toward 2021 highs near $260. Technical analysis across multiple timeframes reveals compelling evidence suggesting SOLmmay be entering a significant upward acceleration phase. The daily chart analysis, with a 2-day timeframe and monthly momentum showing 14.64% gains, indicates that Solana appears well-positioned for its next major growth phase, heading toward new all-time highs. Ascending Triangle Breakout Targets $260 Resistance Solana’s daily chart reveals a methodical progression through a well-defined ascending triangle pattern, with the price successfully breaking above the critical $185 – $190 resistance zone. Source: TradingView The technical structure indicates that SOL is holding above the ascending trendline while maintaining key support at $160. EMA positioning provides dynamic support for the continuing bullish trend. The penetration of major resistance between $175.96 and $185.56 opens the path toward 2021 highs near $260, representing approximately 38% upside from current levels. Ascending triangle patterns typically resolve with breakouts equaling the height of the pattern’s base, projecting toward the $260 target zone. Volume analysis shows substantial institutional participation supporting the breakout rather than retail-driven speculation. RSI at 67.07 suggests room for further advancement before reaching overbought conditions. Solana Price Prediction: Rounded Bottom Completion Projects $340-350 Targets The 2-day chart presents the most bullish perspective through SOL’s completion of a massive rounded bottom pattern that has developed over several months. Source: Crypto Tigers on X Solana is currently at $186.78 and has successfully retested the breakout level, confirming the pattern’s validity following the curved formation that delineates the reversal structure. The pattern shows SOL declining from highs around $270, finding support at $105-110, then gradually building a base through higher lows. The recent breakout above $180 resistance represents the completion of the pattern’s right shoulder. Rounded bottom patterns typically project targets equal to the pattern’s depth, added to breakout levels. Given the approximately $160 depth from $270 to $110, this suggests potential targets in the $340-350 range once the measured move phase completes.

(@defidevcorp) July 25, 2025 Best Wallet: Final Weeks to Secure $BEST Token Allocation Solana’s technical breakout toward a potential new ATH levels creates an urgent opportunity for early-stage exposure to the Solana ecosystem infrastructure. Best Wallet’s $BEST token presale is entering its final weeks with limited allocation remaining before the window closes permanently. Early investors are securing positions in the comprehensive, multi-chain platform, which is well-positioned for SOL’s explosive growth phase. The $BEST token unlocks exclusive presale launchpad access and staking rewards essential for navigating Solana’s technical acceleration. Early investors have priority access to early-stage Solana projects through Best Wallet’s launchpad, which becomes increasingly valuable for portfolio diversification beyond direct SOL exposure. Best Wallet’s version 2.5.1 offers a secure, non-custodial architecture with Fireblocks MPC integration, alongside support for over 60 blockchains, including comprehensive Solana functionality. The built-in DEX enables optimal SOL swap pricing during volatile breakout conditions, while upcoming Best Card integration allows spending gains with up to 8% cashback. With SOL potentially facing 38-80% upside moves toward $260-350 targets, the limited remaining $BEST token allocation , and approaching presale completion, creates a final opportunity window for investors looking to capitalize on the rally with a promising project.

Now in 2025, the market is once again on the hunt for the next big thing. While the Shiba Inu coin is trying to recover from its recent dip, two tokens; Bonk and Remittix , are catching analysts’ attention with real traction and upside potential. Shiba Inu coin struggles to regain momentum The Shiba Inu coin has dropped 2% today to $0.000013 and continues to trend downward, with 24-hour volume falling to $550 million. It has now lost over 15% from its monthly high, dragging sentiment with it. That said, whales are still accumulating. Holdings rose 2% in the past week and burn rates are climbing again, with 5.57 million SHIB removed in the last 24 hours. SHIB’s technical setup shows a cup-and-handle forming, and its 100-day EMA is holding, for now. But even if a rebound takes SHIB to $0.000025, many investors are asking a different question: Is SHIB still the best horse to bet on in 2025? Why BONK might not have the staying power Bonk has surged 10% in the past 24 hours and 158% in the last 30 days. This momentum is largely tied to the rise of Bonk.fun, a Solana-based meme coin minting platform that recently overtook Pump.fun in market share. In July alone, Bonk.fun generated over $30 million in fees, half of which was used to burn BONK tokens, thereby reducing supply and increasing price potential. Analysts suggest this deflationary mechanism could send BONK past its November 2024 all-time high of $0.00005916. But despite the flashy numbers, BONK still lacks the kind of global use case and product roadmap that Remittix offers. BONK may pump short-term, but long-term investors are increasingly gravitating toward real utility. Remittix is quietly becoming the breakout presale of 2025 Remittix (RTX) isn’t just another altcoin. It’s solving a real problem: cross-border payments. With over $17 million raised and more than 570 million tokens sold, RTX is becoming the most talked-about financial utility token of the year. Set to launch its full-featured crypto wallet beta on September 15, 2025, Remittix already has early adopters, like global freelancers and small exporters, using the token for smooth, low-fee payments across borders. Here’s why Remittix is positioned to outshine the Shiba Inu coin and BONK: 50% Token Bonus still available for early participants Real Product Launch in September with wallet and DeFi staking Massive Fundraising Momentum : $17M+ raised already Global Utility : Used for payments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America Q3 Hype Cycle : Wallet beta, new integrations, and exchange listings ahead RTX is what many believe SHIB could have been: a token with community hype and product-market fit. The Shiba Inu coin of 2025 is built on real utility The Shiba Inu coin helped create crypto millionaires in 2021. But in 2025, smart money is moving to tokens that combine hype with actual financial use. Remittix is doing just that and early supporters are already being rewarded.

In his address, he described AI as a powerful driver of economic expansion, but noted that regulatory approaches vary widely and urged nations to harmonize their policies. On Saturday, he cautioned that rapid advancements in AI should not outpace safeguards, calling for an international consensus on risk management. Li’s remarks followed closely on the heels of President Donald Trump’s recent directive to relax AI regulations in the United States, including measures aimed at curbing what administration officials called “ woke” AI systems . He underscored the dual importance of policy frameworks and open‑source initiatives. “The risks and challenges brought by artificial intelligence have drawn widespread attention … How to find a balance between development and security urgently requires further consensus from the entire society,” he said. He affirmed that Beijing intends to step up contributions to open‑source AI projects and disseminate its findings to nations in the developing world. China warns of AI monopoly and global talent barriers Over the course of three days, the conference convened top executives and government officials against the backdrop of intensifying US–China tensions in technology. The US capital has curtailed exports of specialized chips and related hardware out of concern that they may be repurposed for military use. Without singling out any nation, Li cautioned that AI development risks being monopolized by just a few players and pointed to the lack of top‑tier semiconductors and restrictions on expert mobility as significant hurdles. The rapid integration of AI across diverse sectors has sparked debate over moral implications, from misinformation campaigns to workforce disruption and potential loss of technological oversight. A study released this week cautioned that automated article summaries might slash reader engagement by as much as 80%. Organized with official support, the annual gathering returns to Shanghai, featuring speakers such as France’s AI envoy Anne Bouverot, academic Geoffrey Hinton, and ex‑Google chief Eric Schmidt. Notably absent from the roster was Elon Musk. The expo’s showcase spanned established domestic firms like Huawei and Alibaba, emerging ventures such as Unitree, and several international participants including Tesla, Alphabet, and Amazon. Shenzhen firms quietly repair banned Nvidia AI chips Repair workshops in China have seen a sharp uptick in requests to service Nvidia AI processors that are subject to US export bans. According to two industry insiders, roughly twelve independent outfits in Shenzhen are now refurbishing Nvidia’s H100 and A100 GPU models. This includes various other advanced processors that have arrived in China by unofficial routes, reported by Reuters . US authorities prohibited the H100’s import into China in September 2022, months prior to its public release, in an effort to curb Beijing’s technological growth. The A100 faced similar restrictions, imposed roughly two years after its debut. One co‑owner, whose company had specialized in Nvidia’s gaming GPUs for the past 15 years, commented that the uptick in repair work since late 2024 has been substantial. The surge in demand prompted them to launch a dedicated AI repair venture, now servicing as many as 500 Nvidia processors monthly in a facility equipped with a 256‑server testing rack. Such expansion supports reports of large‑scale smuggling, and government and military purchase records indicate acquisitions by state and defense sectors. Because of export controls, Nvidia is barred from servicing these blacklisted units in China, whereas customers in regions covered by a standard three‑year warranty typically receive outright replacements. An Nvidia spokesperson said only the company and authorized partners “are able to provide the service and support that customers need. Using restricted products without approved hardware, software, and technical support is a nonstarter, both technically and economically.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Tech|CNY|Huawei|Nvidia|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 13:10:04

The CloudMatrix 384 made its first public appearance at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC), where companies from across China brought out their newest AI hardware. According to Reuters , Huawei’s latest system is being positioned as a direct threat to Nvidia’s top-level server product, the GB200 NVL72, at a time when U.S. export controls are still blocking China’s access to advanced foreign chips. The system features 384 of the new 910C chips. By comparison, Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 only includes 72 of its B200 processors. Huawei’s design stacks more of its chips to compensate for each chip’s lower performance, combining them using what it calls a “supernode” architecture. This setup allows ultra-high-speed communication between the chips, improving processing power on a system level. The goal is simple: replace the foreign gear Chinese firms can’t legally buy with something homegrown that can compete. Huawei uses scale to go after banned chips Zhang Pingan, CEO of Huawei Cloud, said in June that the CloudMatrix 384 system is already up and running inside Huawei’s cloud platform. Its rollout follows the system’s low-profile announcement in April, which drew early attention from analysts. One of the most vocal was Dylan Patel, who runs the semiconductor research firm SemiAnalysis. In an article that same month, Dylan wrote that Huawei “now has AI system capabilities that could beat Nvidia”. The CloudMatrix 384 didn’t generate excitement because of its chip count alone. What caught industry attention was how Huawei designed the system to scale. The chips themselves are not as powerful as Nvidia’s individually, but the way they are networked allows the system to handle demanding AI workloads. Dylan’s firm also said Huawei’s setup performs better on certain metrics than Nvidia’s flagship rack. Despite facing U.S. sanctions, Huawei has become the most viable local option for AI chip systems inside China. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, acknowledged as much in a May interview with Bloomberg, saying Huawei had been “moving quite fast” and explicitly pointed to the CloudMatrix as an example. With Nvidia legally blocked from selling its strongest hardware to China, firms like Huawei have started to fill the vacuum left behind. Nvidia fights smuggling claims as Huawei gains ground While Huawei was putting its new system on display, Nvidia was responding to reports of unauthorized chip sales into China. On Thursday, the company told CNBC that data centers built with smuggled gear are a “losing proposition,” both technically and financially. The statement was triggered by a Financial Times investigation that claimed over $1 billion worth of Nvidia AI chips had entered China through unofficial channels. The report detailed how Nvidia’s B200 chips, which are banned from export to China, had been bought on the black market. These sales reportedly began in May, with Chinese distributors supplying data center builders whose clients include major Chinese AI groups. The chips had been in high demand ever since President Donald Trump tightened export controls on the country’s chip imports. Nvidia’s attempt to meet compliance rules came in the form of the H20 chip , a custom product designed to skirt older U.S. sanctions. But in April, Washington told the company it would need a license to ship even that. This effectively froze all shipments of the chip to China. Nvidia’s CEO said last week that the company is now preparing to resume H20 sales, following a breakthrough in talks with Trump’s administration. Jensen also confirmed that he wants to sell more powerful chips than the H20 to China, despite the restrictions. For now, the company remains limited to what Washington allows. But while Nvidia deals with red tape and black-market issues, Huawei is openly rolling out systems like the CloudMatrix 384, fully built with local technology and already running inside its cloud network.

As AI adoption accelerates across sectors—from finance and healthcare to content creation and automation—AI-powered cryptocurrencies are emerging as high-growth opportunities for investors. Among the rising stars is Ozak AI, a fast-growing AI crypto project currently in its 4th presale stage, priced at just $0.005. With over $1.44 million raised so far, it has become one of the most talked-about early-stage tokens in the AI + blockchain narrative. Many early investors believe that Ozak AI could surge toward $1 within months of listing—offering a rare window of opportunity for 100x returns. Ozak AI: Early Entry Into the Next 100x Trend While many AI coins are already trading at high valuations, Ozak AI is still at its presale stage—offering early access to a low-cap token with exponential growth potential. The token is priced at just $0.005 in Stage 4, but each subsequent stage is set to increase in price, allowing only the earliest backers to lock in maximum gains. Importantly, the presale has already raised over $1.44 million, indicating strong investor confidence and momentum. That kind of traction suggests the Ozak AI launch is likely to see heavy demand—something that often triggers a post-listing price explosion. If Ozak AI follows a similar path to SHIB, PEPE, or other viral tokens, it’s entirely possible for it to hit $1—or more—especially as broader interest in AI continues to rise. Community and Buzz Building Fast Presale tokens often live by their ability to build community, generate hype, and maintain consistent growth. Ozak AI seems to be checking all these boxes. The token is gaining traction across major platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and other social platforms. Influencers are starting to take notice, and presale updates are being shared across AI and crypto discussion boards. This kind of organic growth is a strong indicator of future viral momentum. And once a token builds a passionate community that believes in the mission and holds long-term, skyrocketing price action becomes far more likely. A Presale Opportunity That Won’t Last Long With the Ozak AI presale in its 4th stage, the token is expected to enter additional rounds with gradually increasing prices before its eventual exchange listings. That means the $0.005 price point could be the lowest it ever sees. Crypto investors know how quickly presales can sell out—especially when the project fits a high-demand niche like AI. This could be the last chance to get in before a massive surge, particularly if Ozak AI announces big partnerships, exchange listings, or tech rollouts post-launch. A jump from $0.005 to $1 might seem ambitious, but it’s not unprecedented in crypto. Meme coins with no real utility have done it—purely on hype and community alone. What gives Ozak AI an even stronger chance is that it sits at the center of two megatrends: artificial intelligence and decentralized finance. As the AI narrative deepens, and investors look for the next underdog success story, Ozak AI stands out as one of the most promising tokens of the cycle. With low entry price, surging presale numbers, and increasing buzz, it has all the ingredients to become a breakout hit in 2025. If the user missed PEPE, SHIB, or the early AI coin pumps, this may be your final shot to get in before a potential $1 launch.

However, popular crypto trader EGRAG Crypto has spotted a rare chart pattern that doesn’t appear often, but when it does, it usually leads to huge price jumps. In the past, this signal has led to gains of at least 40,000%. Now, EGRAG believes that if history repeats, XRP could be on its way to a price between $9 and $24. History Repeats? Here’s Why It Matters After last week’s pullback, XRP dropped to around the $3.00 mark, a price level that acted like a safety net. But it didn’t stay there for long. The token bounced back and is now slowly climbing, trading close to $3.20 , giving early signs that buyers are stepping in again. Looking back, XRP saw its first major crossover in March 2017, followed by an eye-watering 40,000% rally before the cycle peak. The next crossover came in August 2020, pushing XRP up nearly 750% at the time. Now, EGRAG highlights that in October 2024, the 21 EMA has again crossed above the 55 SMA, and since then, XRP has already pumped 560%. While this surge may seem big, history suggests it might just be the beginning. #XRP – Insights on 21 EMA and 55 SMA #Bulli Cross ( $9 or $24): Let’s examine what has happened in the past with the 21 EMA and 55 SMA on the weekly timeframe. In March 2017, we witnessed a #bullish crossover, leading to an astonishing 40,000% pump until the cycle top! … pic.twitter.com/Yi5NNFumlS — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 26, 2025 How High Could XRP Go? EGRAG didn’t just spot a pattern, he also looked at how XRP reacted in the past when this same setup appeared. In 2017, XRP saw a huge rally after this crossover. Now, EGRAG says that even if XRP repeats just 10% of that old rally, the price could still jump by 4,000%, pushing it above the $9 mark. But that’s not the only possibility. If XRP performs just twice as well as it did in 2020, which saw a 750% gain then we could still see a 1,500% move, taking the price close to $24. The charts EGRAG shared also match this idea. XRP is currently moving within a rising channel, very similar to its past breakout setups. XRP Price Analysis As of now, XRP is trading around $3.19, showing a small bounce after last week’s dip. Based on the 4-hour price chart ,XRP may climb backto the 21 EMA (Exponential Moving Average), which often acts like a short-term support zone. This move hints that buyers might be stepping in again after a brief sell-off.

By November that year, it had rocketed to nearly $260—a jaw-dropping 17,233% return. Investors who took a modest $1,000 punt on SOL saw their holdings swell to over $170,000 in less than 12 months. It was one of the most legendary rallies in crypto history. But history has a way of repeating itself—just not where you’re always looking. Today, another project is quietly making waves, and seasoned crypto veterans are already eyeing it as “the next Solana moment”—except this time, the entry ticket is even cheaper. Enter Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) —a presale-stage memecoin priced at just $0.0016 as of writing. And according to early projections and its explosive growth trajectory, even a $100 investment at current prices could eclipse the ROI Solana delivered in 2021. From Meme to Machine: Why $LILPEPE Isn’t Just Another Frog Coin On the surface, $LILPEPE is another memecoin born in the Telegram hype and Twitter memes echo chamber. But dive beneath the swampy surface, and you’ll find a serious Layer-2 blockchain project masquerading in meme form. Little Pepe isn’t just aiming to become a viral token—it’s built to rival the scalability of Ethereum Layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism. It’s EVM-compatible, gas-efficient, and has near-instant finality. Its utility token, $LILPEPE, powers this entire ecosystem—and with zero buy or sell taxes, it’s designed for real adoption, not speculative pump-and-dumps. As of writing, Little Pepe has successfully sold out Stage 6 of its presale, raising over $8.8 million and distributing more than 6.75 billion tokens. Stage 7 is now live, and tokens are priced at $0.0016. With the listing price set at $0.003, early investors are already looking at a near 88% gain before launch day. But that’s just the beginning. The Road to a 20,000% ROI: Is It Possible? Let’s put the math in perspective. A 20,000% return on a $100 investment would turn it into $20,000. Is that even realistic? Well, consider this: Initial Circulating Supply: Only 20 billion tokens will be circulating at launch, which is just 20% of the total supply. CoinMarketCap Listing: As of writing, $LILPEPE is already live on CoinMarketCap, giving it massive early visibility. Massive Giveaway Hype: A $777,000 giveaway is underway, with ten lucky winners set to receive $77,000 each in tokens. Over 121,000 entries have already been recorded, indicating rapidly growing retail interest. Presale Vesting: With a 3-month cliff and only 5% of presale tokens unlocking every 30 days post-cliff, dumping risk is heavily mitigated—a critical factor for early price stability. Layer 2 Narrative: The 2025 bull run narrative is expected to be driven by utility-heavy memecoins and scalable Layer 2 solutions. $LILPEPE is both. If Little Pepe reaches a modest market cap of $2 billion—a fraction of what Solana achieved at its peak—the price per token would surge well above $0.03, turning early $100 entries into $1,875+. But should it replicate Solana’s breakout ROI of ~17,000%, we’re potentially talking about $17,000+ returns from a mere $100 investment. That’s why some analysts even speculate that a 20,000% gain is within reach, especially given the combined meme virality, strong tokenomics, and blockchain-level fundamentals backing the project. Why $LILPEPE Is One of 2025’s Most Watched Tokens Hybrid Appeal: Combines meme culture with real utility. It’s a blockchain wrapped in humor, which appeals to retail and technical audiences. Zero-Tax Model: With 0% buy/sell tax, $LILPEPE is optimized for high-frequency trading and DeFi use cases. Staking Incentives: 13.5% of the token supply is allocated for staking rewards, encouraging long-term holders and reducing short-term sell pressure. Marketing Muscle: With 10% of supply reserved for marketing, including influencer campaigns and viral content, Little Pepe isn’t just building tech—it’s building culture. Layer 2 Differentiator: Unlike most meme coins, $LILPEPE isn’t just launching on Ethereum—it’s building a Layer 2 of its own. That’s not just ambitious. It’s game-changing. Final Thoughts: Missed Solana? Don’t Miss This If you missed Solana at $1.50, you probably thought you’d never see another 100x, let alone a 200x opportunity. But crypto moves fast. And Little Pepe is moving faster. The presale is progressing rapidly, with Stage 7 live now at $0.0016, and listing just around the corner. With momentum accelerating, a CoinMarketCap listing secured, and a vibrant community of supporters, $LILPEPE is shaping up to be one of the most compelling high-upside opportunities of 2025. You don’t need $1,000. You don’t even need $500. Even a $100 bet at this stage, for the well-positioned and risk-tolerant investor, could be the best-performing decision of the next crypto cycle.

(Nasdaq: TRON), the publicly listed company with the largest holdings of the TRON (TRX) token, marked a major milestone on Thursday with a ceremonial visit to the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square. Tron Founder and the company’s Global Advisor, Justin Sun, rang the opening bell, signaling a new chapter for the blockchain firm. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Accumulate Over $4.1B In ETH In Two Weeks – Details Coinciding with the event, TRON released its Q2 2025 earnings report, revealing robust growth across key metrics. TRON’s market capitalization surged 17% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to $26.5 billion, while revenue jumped 20.5% QoQ to reach $915.9 million—both standing as multi-quarter highs. The report signals rising institutional interest and growing adoption of the TRON ecosystem at a time when broader crypto markets face mixed sentiment. As the blockchain sector matures, TRON’s blend of aggressive expansion and strong fundamentals appears to position the company favorably in the eyes of both retail and institutional investors. With this dual milestone—market debut and strong Q2 performance—TRON is sending a clear message: it’s here to lead. TRON Reports Deflationary TRX Supply, Record Stablecoin Growth In Q2 TRON’s Q2 report highlights a deflationary shift in TRX supply alongside strong network growth and stablecoin dominance. The circulating supply of TRX declined from 95.0 billion to 94.8 billion tokens, reflecting an annualized inflation rate of approximately -1.8%. While this marks a slightly higher inflation rate than Q1’s -1.6%, it still points to deflationary pressure on TRX, reinforcing its value proposition amid broader market uncertainty. Network activity also showed solid growth during the quarter. Daily average transactions rose 12.6% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), increasing from 7.7 million to 8.6 million, while daily active addresses climbed 5.9% QoQ from 2.4 million to 2.5 million. These metrics suggest rising user engagement and expanding utility across the TRON ecosystem. Stablecoin activity remains a cornerstone of the network’s success. TRON’s stablecoin market cap surged 22.2% QoQ, rising from $66.2 billion to an all-time high of $80.9 billion. Tether (USDT) continues to dominate, accounting for 99.2% of the stablecoin supply on TRON. By the end of Q2, the USDT market cap on TRON reached $80.3 billion, a 22.2% increase from the previous quarter. Notably, TRON now hosts 50.6% of all USDT in circulation, underscoring its role as the leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pullback Remains Within Normal Volatility Range: Drawdown Analysis Shows No Signs Of Panic TRX Price Holds Above Key Support TRON (TRX) is showing resilience following its strong Q2 performance, holding steady above key support levels despite recent market volatility. As of the latest 8-hour chart, TRX is trading at $0.3163, up 0.48% on the day. After reaching a local high near $0.34 earlier this month, TRX experienced a mild pullback but has since stabilized and is now consolidating in a tight range. Price action remains bullish, with TRX trading above the 50-day ($0.3084), 100-day ($0.2935), and 200-day ($0.2840) moving averages—an indication of strong medium- and long-term momentum. The recent bounce from the 50-day MA suggests buyers are actively defending short-term support zones, reinforcing the overall uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTHs Start Distributing: CDD Ratio Hits Historic Levels A breakout above the $0.32–$0.325 zone could signal a push toward retesting the $0.34 high. A failure to hold above the 50-day MA could open the door to a retest of the $0.30 psychological level. For now, the bias remains cautiously bullish.

The ranking system ranges from Plankton for those with just over 1 XRP to Mega Whale for those holding over 1,000,000 XRP. The intention was to give holders a clearer picture of where they stand in the broader XRP ecosystem. The $XRP Ocean Ranking System Mega Whale = 1,000,000+ XRP Whale = 100,000+ XRP Shark = 50,000+ XRP Dolphin = 10,000+ XRP Fish = 5,000+ XRP Crab = 1,000+ XRP Shrimp = 100+ XRP Plankton = 1+ XRP Where do you rank in the $XRP ocean? Drop it below — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 24, 2025 XRP Army Responds Responses from community members revealed a wide range of holdings. One community member expressed confidence about his future, stating that he was on the path to future millions and potentially higher ranks. Others humorously acknowledged their current position in the lower tiers but remained optimistic about upward movement. A few indicated that their holdings had declined, with one noting a drop in rank. Another mentioned rebuilding after diverting funds toward personal obligations, but indicated plans to regain a stronger position. The variety of replies showed a broad range of holdings across the community. While experts have advocated for accumulating and holding XRP, especially during price dips , some suggest that holding even small amounts can be life-changing . The wide range of holders suggests different approaches to crypto investment. Valuations at XRP’s Current Price At XRP’s current market price of $3.14, the dollar value associated with each ranking tier varies significantly. A Mega Whale, holding over 1,000,000 XRP, would possess XRP valued at more than $3.14 million. Whales, with at least 100,000 XRP, would hold a minimum of $314,000 worth of the token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These whales often impact the market’s trajectory with major token movements, and XRP has seen notable whale activity recently . Going down a tier, Shark-level holders would command over $157,000 in XRP, while Dolphins would own at least $31,400. Further down the ranking, Fish with 5,000 XRP would hold approximately $15,700 worth of XRP. Crabs, identified as holders of 1,000 XRP, would possess $3,140 in value. Shrimp-level holders, with 100 XRP, hold $314, and Plankton, with at least 1 XRP, hold $3.14 or more. A common theme among responses was aspiration. Several users acknowledged modest holdings but expressed hope for growth. Even those currently in lower tiers described themselves as future high-tier holders. While a few refrained from disclosing their exact positions, the overall tone remained positive. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While it is thought that this fund may have been newly minted, it is estimated that the company raised funds through share sales in order to increase its Ethereum (ETH) accumulation.

SharpLink Gaming purchased 74,656 Ethereum between July 7th and 13th, bringing its total holdings to 280,706 ETH. This figure was worth over $1 billion as of July 21st.

The legislative changes make it harder for ordinary Russians to pay with or trade crypto, as operations like these can lead to account freezing, asset seizure and even criminal prosecution. Payment system law to hit peer-to-peer crypto trades in Russia The federal law “On the National Payment System” now empowers banks to restrict access to a client’s bank account if it’s involved in any kind of suspicious transactions, leading Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media raised the alarm this week. Accounts can be blocked if money linked to illegal activities has been credited to them, the portal pointed out, warning that users of crypto exchange services and participants in peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions can easily find themselves in a situation like this. The legislation allows financial institutions to take action in a number of scenarios. These include receiving complaints from third parties, signals alleging illegal actions, including fraud-related flows, and any transfers triggering risk detection systems. Restrictions can be partial or full. In the first case, an affected person is unable to use the payment cards and banking app of a particular institution, and in the latter, the individual loses access to cards issued by all banks and to their platforms. The law’s provisions can be used to target cryptocurrency traders whose bank accounts can be blacklisted by the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ). The most common instances involve the exchange of digital coins for rubles or P2P swaps. No one is safe from receiving “dirty” cash from fraud and money laundering schemes, online gambling, or other illegal activities, when selling their cryptos for fiat through an online exchanger or a P2P platform, the report noted. Moscow can use money laundering legislation to curb crypto usage Russian banks can also freeze accounts under the law “On combating the legalization of proceeds from crime and the financing of terrorism,” also known as the “money laundering law.” It allows banks to flag as “high-risk” and block any sale of cryptocurrency through P2P platforms and digital asset exchanges. Some of its texts were originally intended to deal with a phenomenon known as “dropping.” In Russian slang, a “dropper” is someone who lends their bank account, wallet or card to fraudsters who use them to launder their criminal proceeds. However, critics say the same provisions can be employed against ordinary users of crypto exchanges and P2P trading platforms who could end up with their bank accounts blocked by financial authorities and institutions as well. In May, legal commentators involved in the crypto space warned that recent amendments to the Criminal Code, again aimed at “droppers,” or “money mules,” as they are called in the West, can also be used to threaten crypto traders with account blocking and even prison time. In June, the Bank of Russia urged commercial banks to exert tighter control on crypto-related transfers. The regulator insisted on the swift identification of such transactions. The updated code authorizes banks to impose monthly limits on wires and prevent cash deposits. Russia clears ground for upcoming digital ruble launch The latest Russian offensive against decentralized digital money comes as Moscow prepares for the full implementation of its digital ruble. The CBR recently set the dates for the gradual launch of the central bank digital currency, which should start on September 1, 2026, after Putin’s recent call for “wide adoption.” Along with the state-issued coin, Russia plans to introduce a universal QR code for payments. Its monetary authority has been vehemently opposed to allowing the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to pay for goods and services in the country. Crypto payments are only possible within a special “experimental legal regime” designed to help Russian companies circumvent financial restrictions in foreign trade. Using cryptocurrency as a means of payment was banned with the law “On Digital Financial Assets” which went into force in 2021. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In a recent post, Levi stated, “XRP holders, you are not going to want to mess this up,” emphasizing that former President Donald Trump is preparing to trigger a massive wave of momentum in the crypto market, unlike anything seen before. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Agenda Signals Opportunity Since returning to the office in January 2025, President Trump has taken a firm pro-crypto stance. One of his first acts was signing Executive Order 14178, which dismantled previous CBDC initiatives and formally banned any U.S. central bank digital currency. This positioned private cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Bitcoin, and Solana for a regulatory tailwind. Further solidifying his administration’s crypto-friendly direction, Trump has repeatedly praised private innovation and even named XRP among a select group of digital assets the U.S. aims to build strategic reserves around. He emphasized support for Elon Musk and American businesses, stating clearly, “I want Elon and all businesses in our country to thrive, like never before.” #XRP HOLDERS LISTEN UP CLOSELY! pic.twitter.com/7oO5QZe0UJ — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 25, 2025 XRP Price Action: Correction Amid Momentum XRP has been riding this wave of optimism. Earlier in July, it broke through to a new all-time high of $3.52, propelled by political developments and favorable legislation such as the passage of the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act in the House. Institutional confidence soared, with corporate investors adding over $421 million in XRP, while on-chain data showed large wallets accumulating over $7.1 billion in tokens. However, in recent days, XRP has experienced a mild pullback. As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.19, down from recent highs but still well above its previous range. Analysts point to a healthy market cooldown, with realized volatility dropping to 44%, its lowest since Trump’s re-election victory. This quiet period may be a setup for the next explosive move. Levi’s Warning: The Setup is Critical Levi’s message isn’t just hype; it’s a strategic alert. He highlights not only Trump’s stance but also critical moves happening behind the scenes. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has suggested Trump may be eyeing a leadership change at the Federal Reserve, possibly replacing Jerome Powell . Any such shift, particularly if it leads to lower interest rates or looser monetary policy, could ignite a fresh wave of demand for digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For XRP, which has already reclaimed key support at $3.00 and rebounded, this could mean a breakout toward $4–$5 in the short term. Analysts believe that if legislative momentum continues and market confidence strengthens, XRP could ultimately rally toward $10 or more. Final Thoughts The stars appear to be aligning for XRP. Political will, regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and strong technical foundations are converging. But as Levi warned, this is not the moment to sit idle. The conditions are forming for a historic bull run, and XRP holders must stay alert and engaged. With XRP still holding above $3.00 and pro-crypto sentiment sweeping Washington, the next major move could be just around the corner.

XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ripple Token XRP Price $3.19 Market cap $189.03B Trading volume (24-hour) $6.1B Circulating supply 59.23B All-time high $3.84 on Jan 4, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 on Jul 7, 2014 24-hour high $3.21 24-hour low $3.01 XRP price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 18.67% 50-day SMA $2.51 200-day SMA $1.85 Sentiment Bullish Fear and greed index 72 (Greed) Green days 20/30 (67%) XRP price analysis: Koreans accumulate more XRP On July 26, XRP rose by 2.47% in 24 hours, reflecting a retail buying extending a 47% rally in the last 30 days. The event was accompanied by a 35% drop in trading volumes to $6.13B showing waning interest from traders. At the same time, Upbit’s XRP/KRW pair saw $3.19B volum,e showing strategic investment by Koreans. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe XRPUSD chart by TradingView XRP’s 14-day relative strength index crossed into overbought territory earlier this month, maintaining the stance for weeks, until recently, after facing resistance at $3.66. The William Alligator trendlines show that XRP’s volatility rose over the same period. Notably, the MACD histograms now show negative momentum. The 1-day technical indicators show a market correction following an overextension and rising pressure for a price reversal. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart XRPUSD chart by TradingView Zoomed in, the 4-hour chart shows XRP is consolidating at the top. The short candles are suggestive of an indecisive market. The MACD histograms, however, indicate little market momentum, suggesting that it could move sideways over the short term.

Ripple price analysis shows a highly bullish coin that is defining a top after breaking its previous all-time high last week. The wider crypto market remains bullish. The analysis shows that traders, particularly Koreans, chose to chase profits in the last 24 hours as its price rose. Looking ahead, a break above $3.66 will be critical in determining whether XRP will remain bullish; otherwise, it remains volatile. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple and the rising adoption might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC development make XRP a good investment option in the long term. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, bringing the price down to $3.08 during the day. The RSI decreased to 57.89 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.38 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $17.59 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Dune Analytics data shows that almost 60% of transactions on XRPL are payments. Weekly payments on the network increased by more than 430% in less than two years. Dune Analytics also indicates that weekly payment transactions on the network moved from around 1.5 million in 2023 to over 8 million in 2025. Read more about it here . Lawyer Fred Rispoli states that the SEC and Ripple could settle how XRP sales to institutions will be conducted in a way the SEC finds acceptable. Meanwhile, Ripple plans to further integrate XRP into institutional finance by acquiring Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Read more about it here .

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57; however, near the start of July, it is trending around the $2.26 range, as the market sentiment tilts towards the positive side.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 14:00:00

Siton Mining launches new XRP cloud mining contracts,https://timestabloid.com/use-xrp-to-start-btc-miners-and-earn-daily-passive-income/,"XRP has risen 36% in the past week, hitting a record high of $3.68, pushing the market’s daily trading volume to over $23 billion. The rise is closely related to the GENIUS Act and the Digital Financial Transparency Act passed by the U.S. Congress. The legislation has brought unprecedented compliance protection and growth space for blockchain technology and digital asset investment. In this positive market context, Siton Mining, the world’s leading cloud mining platform, officially launched a new “double income” mining contract designed specifically for XRP users. This solution not only provides stable daily US dollar income, but also supports the use of mainstream cryptocurrencies such as XRP for recharge, settlement and withdrawal, allowing users to enjoy stable income while also benefiting from the value growth brought by the rise in currency prices. Double income model, opening a new era of XRP passive income Siton Mining ‘s innovative mining model allows users to: Invest in XRP (or other crypto assets) to activate mining contracts Get a fixed dollar income every day (settled at the real-time exchange rate) After the contract ends, if XRP appreciates, the withdrawal value will be further improved Example: If a user invests $5,000 worth of XRP to activate a 3-day contract, the daily income is $220 and the total income is $660. If XRP rises by 10% during this period, the user will also enjoy the price appreciation income of the equivalent value of XRP.

After a brief cooldown, bulls have defended key levels and analysts are spotting bullish patterns on multiple timeframes. With institutional interest growing and chart setups aligning, DOGE crypto may be preparing for a notable upside breakout. Dogecoin Price Today: Trendline Break Sparks Bullish Setup The Dogecoin price today is hovering around $0.2379 with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.29 billion and a market capitalization of $35.71 billion. After dipping from $0.28 to $0.22 on July 21 due to profit-booking, the DOGE price saw a much needed rebound on chart. According to technical analysts , this bounce resulted in a breakout from a descending trendline on the hourly chart. $Doge /H4 #Dogecoin has held strong at the Fibonacci 0.618 level and shown a solid rebound. pic.twitter.com/JCcdWEfCmY — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) July 26, 2025 Furthermore, the same analyst highlighted that this bounce on hourly chart is reliable because the 0.618 Fibonacci level on the 4-hour chart, aligns with the horizontal support. This alignment of technical indicators, across both 1H and 4H charts, clearly strengthens the bullish views that DOGE crypto might be preparing for another leg up in the near future. Dogecoin Price Forecast: Double Bottom Pattern Hints at Larger Rally Looking at the broader Dogecoin price forecast, another bullish formation is catching attention. On the daily chart, DOGE is testing the neckline of a tilted double bottom pattern, a classic bullish reversal setup. If this neckline breaks convincingly, it could open a path toward the $0.52 level. This would mark a significant upside from current levels and further validate the positive sentiment around Dogecoin crypto. $Doge /D1 A nice Double Bottom setup on #Dogecoin pic.twitter.com/PsDycAhtt6 — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) July 25, 2025 Adding weight to this outlook, the DOGE price has also been observed respecting an ascending trendline resistance since Q2. As a result, traders are eyeing this trendline as a high-probability breakout zone, assuming bullish volume continues to build. Institutional Buzz Grows as DOGE ETF Interest Surges Beyond technical charts, the growing optimism around Dogecoin price is also being fueled by institutional developments. Major asset managers including Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares, have reportedly filed for Dogecoin ETFs. Notably, Bloomberg analysts assign a 90% chance of approval for such applications, underscoring DOGE’s credibility within the memecoin space.

If a Dogecoin ETF is approved, it could introduce a new wave of capital into the asset, significantly impacting DOGE crypto’s long-term price dynamics. Dogecoin Price Outlook: Bullish Channel May Target Higher Levels Lastly, on the weekly timeframe, another major bullish structure has been pointed out. Analysts note that DOGE crypto continues to respect an ascending parallel channel, and it’s currently testing support at the lower boundary. Historically, this zone has triggered substantial rallies, making the current price action particularly significant.

Bitcoin recently crossed $120,000, while spot bitcoin ETFs saw approximately $8 billion in net inflows over the past month. Ether has rebounded sharply, rising around 60% in the past month. The past week was a significant moment for the crypto landscape, both in terms of legislation and market momentum. While not all the regulatory developments directly impact crypto ETFs, the effect of increased regulatory clarity and institutional adoption benefits the space broadly. Here’s a closer look at the evolving regulatory backdrop, fund flows, and new product developments across the crypto ETF ecosystem. More regulatory support… Last week was dubbed “Crypto Week.” Three major bills made headlines: the GENIUS Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Clarity Act. Each of these represents a step toward building a more defined framework for digital assets. That is something that has been a persistent hurdle for the industry. Several of these bills are loosely related to crypto ETFs. Regardless, regulatory progress is contributing to overall optimistic sentiment in this space. The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) addresses the issuance and oversight of stablecoins. This act has officially been signed into law. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) plays a major role in stablecoin operations and has reacted positively to this news. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) directly to consumers due to surveillance and privacy concerns. The CLARITY Act is particularly relevant to the ETF space, since it addresses the ongoing ambiguity over whether certain tokens fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC or CFTC — essentially the longstanding “security vs. commodity” debate. Additionally, the SEC made a statement in early July addressing some of the disclosure requirements for crypto asset exchange traded products. The CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate approval. But overall, these regulations have already contributed to improving investor sentiment. I expect to see an influx of approvals later this year — including spot ETFs, multi-token ETFs (discussed in more detail below), staking, and in-kind redemptions — after a period of internal alignment. …leads to stronger institutional adoption… Optimism around regulatory support discussed above has led to renewed enthusiasm in the cryptomarkets, particularly stronger institutional interest. Bitcoin recently crossed $120,000, while spot bitcoin ETFs saw approximately $8 billion in net inflows over the past month. That brings the year-to-date total to over $19 billion. Most of this activity has been concentrated in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) which saw around $6 billion in net inflows this past month. Similarly, ether has rebounded sharply, rising around 60% in the past month. While ether ETFs have seen a total of just under $6 billion in net inflows this year, over half of that — $3 billion — came in just the last month after a previously slow year. …and product innovation including altcoin ETFs… Along with more institutional adoption, investor interest is widening to include altcoins and multi-asset crypto exposure. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF ( SSK ), which was launched earlier this month, is both the first spot Solana ( SOL-USD ) and the first to offer staking. The nine other proposed spot Solana ETFs were filed by the usual players like Fidelity, VanEck, and 21Shares under the ’33 Act — the same structure as both spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. SSK, however, is a ’40 Act fund. This requires it to invest through a diversified portfolio of other securities. Currently, it includes the 21Shares Solana ETP, at around 40% of the fund’s weight. While this means it’s not a “traditional spot product,” SSK gained early traction due to its first-mover advantage, with assets growing to around $100 million within less than a month. In addition to SSK, leveraged and derivatives-based Solana and XRP products have entered the market, including products from ProShares, Volatility Shares, and Teucrium. While these haven’t taken off significantly, they are still gathering a fair amount of attention, especially given the already crowded market. The Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF ( XXRP ) recently saw over $160 million in net inflows over the past month. …and multi-token ETFs. The next step for crypto ETFs will likely be multitoken products. Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), which includes approximately 75% bitcoin, 15% ether, and smaller allocations to Solana, XRP, and Cardano, received initial approval but was placed on hold by the SEC. A similar approval-then-hold process happened to Bitwise’s application to convert its Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( BITW ) into an ETF. Like GDLC, BITW also holds a large weight in bitcoin and ether (90%) with the remaining 10% in Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, Uniswap, and Polkadot. These pauses aren’t denials. They more likely reflect the need to align with updated SEC regulations, including the guidance issued in early July, which outlined disclosure standards for crypto products. The uniqueness of these multitoken funds stems from their structure since they include tokens that don’t yet have spot ETFs (XRP, Cardano, etc.). That creates two possibilities: 1) SEC approval of multitoken funds could signal green lights for several of these spot ETFs; or 2) alternatively, the small allocations may allow for approval without broader spot fund precedents. Either way, GDLC and BITW present a test for how the SEC will treat diversified crypto exposure under the evolving framework. A filing for a similar product (Crypto Blue Chip ETF) tied to Trump Media in partnership with Yorkville and Crypto.com also recently made headlines. This product looks similar to GDLC but substitutes Cardano for Cronos ((CRO)). Bottom Line: As more regulatory clarity emerges, I expect to see increasing product innovation and broader institutional adoption. Both of those could further solidify crypto’s role in the ETF ecosystem and traditional finance. Disclosure: © VettaFi LLC 2025. All rights reserved.

48990201,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=774309,1753542212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48990201.jpeg,Wall Street is betting against Trump’s trade deals as lawsuits advance to the Supreme Court,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-trump-trade-deals-illegal-scotus/,"Wall Street analysts are betting hard against Trump’s trade agenda surviving in court. The lawsuits stacking up across the country are gunning straight for the legal base of his tariff powers. And they’re not just hoping to overturn a few decisions; they’re trying to wipe out nearly all of Trump’s recent trade deals by arguing he had no authority to make them in the first place. At the center of the fight is the V.O.S. Selections v. Trump case, which is about to hit the Federal Circuit this Thursday. That case, along with several others, argues that the POTUS’ use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs is flat-out illegal. The lower trade court already agreed, saying Trump went too far by using a law that doesn’t even mention tariffs. The Court of Appeals paused that decision, but the battle is far from over, since it’s moving toward the Supreme Court. Federal judges already ruled Trump went too far The lawsuits didn’t come out of nowhere. For months, small businesses and state attorneys have been pushing back against Trump’s trade moves. His administration used IEEPA as the legal shield for a long list of tariffs , including the 10% minimum tariff, the fentanyl-related duties on China, Canada, and Mexico, and the reciprocal tariffs he announced in early April. In late May, the U.S. Court of International Trade struck down those tariffs, saying Trump exceeded what the law allows. The IEEPA does give the president emergency powers, but only to deal with “unusual and extraordinary threats” from outside the U.S. And lawyers for the plaintiffs say that has nothing to do with what Trump is doing. “IEEPA nowhere mentions tariffs, duties, imports, or taxes, and no other President in the statute’s nearly 50-year history has claimed that it authorizes tariffs,” they wrote in court. The Trump team argues otherwise. They say Congress has always let presidents use tariffs to protect U.S. interests. Their case rests on one line in the law that allows regulation of “importation,” which they claim gives the president the power to set tariffs however he wants. That argument didn’t fly in the V.O.S. case. The court found multiple instances where Trump had imposed tariffs outside the scope of IEEPA. Another blow came just one day later from a federal court in Washington, D.C. In Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled even more aggressively, saying IEEPA doesn’t allow any kind of unilateral tariff action at all. His ruling got appealed, and arguments are scheduled for September 30. Supreme Court likely to step in as pressure builds Even though the appeals court hasn’t ruled yet, everyone watching expects this case to end up at the Supreme Court. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices whom Trump appointed himself. But despite that, analysts from Piper Sandler say the odds still aren’t in his favor. “Trump will probably continue to lose in the lower courts, and we believe the Supreme Court is highly unlikely to rule in his favor,” they wrote in a note on Friday. And if the Supreme Court does strike the tariffs down, it won’t just be a policy setback. It would take out almost every trade deal announced in the past six months. Piper Sandler said: “If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, all of the trade deals Trump has reached in recent weeks, and those he will reach in the coming days, are illegal.” That includes 25 letters recently sent to world leaders, outlining the new tariffs that will hit their countries’ U.S. exports starting August 1 . Those letters didn’t mention IEEPA by name, but the arguments inside them, about trade deficits, unfair practices, and national security, matched everything Trump said when he first invoked the law in April. He also signed an executive order in June that officially tied IEEPA to a trade deal with the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, he’s been tossing out deal outlines with Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, though none of those have been finalized. The legal mess keeps growing. Two more lawsuits are heading to the Ninth Circuit on September 17. One was filed by California, the other by members of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana. On top of that, at least three other cases at the Court of International Trade are on hold until V.O.S. is resolved. All of this means one thing: if the Supreme Court rules that Trump misused emergency powers, the whole structure collapses. Every deal. Every tariff. Every letter. Every percentage point. Gone.

The whale opened leveraged long positions with these assets, particularly in XRP and Solana (SOL) pairs. However, let us also remind you that leveraged trading, which is already high-risk, can lead to major losses when combined with high-risk cryptocurrencies.

This means the whale's position could be liquidated if the price drops significantly. The trade was executed with 2x isolated leverage. The position opened for SOL is $10.68 million. This position opened at $188.2 for approximately 56,869 SOL. However, the price retreated slightly during the transaction, falling to $187.87.

After rebounding from the $0.00001337 support cluster, bulls are attempting to reclaim lost ground, but overhead pressure from the Supertrend band and key EMAs is capping upside momentum. Price structure suggests that a volatility expansion is imminent. What’s Happening With Shiba Inu’s Price? SHIB price dynamics (Source: TradingView) SHIB has formed a short-term base above the $0.00001335–$0.00001350 demand zone, supported by multiple CHoCH formations and a bullish candle structure on the 4-hour chart. The recent reclaim of the 100 and 200 EMA zones ($0.00001392 and $0.00001337) is encouraging for bulls, but the 20/50 EMA ribbon remains flat just above current levels, with resistance near $0.00001424.

Key Takeaways: Dragonfly Capital may face legal scrutiny over its 2020 investment in Tornado Cash developer PepperSec. Managing partner Haseeb Qureshi defended the move, citing legal assurances. Tornado Cash continues to process high volumes. The venture capital firm signaled Friday that it would push back hard if formal charges are filed. In a statement on social media , Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb Qureshi defended the investment, stressing that it was made in good faith after receiving legal assurances of compliance. “We made this investment because we believe in the importance of open-source privacy-preserving technology,” Qureshi wrote. He added that legal counsel at the time found no regulatory red flags. US Crackdown on Tornado Cash Sparks Crypto Privacy Debate The controversy stems from the US government’s crackdown on Tornado Cash, a tool that enables users to obscure the origin and destination of crypto transactions. Though the protocol was pitched as a decentralized privacy enhancer, it became a favorite among hackers and sanctioned entities seeking to hide digital footprints. In 2023, the Department of Justice charged developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov with money laundering and violating U.S. sanctions. Storm’s trial is currently underway in New York and could result in a decades-long prison sentence. On Friday, prosecutors suggested Dragonfly itself could be next. Qureshi dismissed the notion as an intimidation tactic. “We believe the government’s statement in court today was primarily to undermine a defense of Tornado Cash,” he said. “Bringing charges now would be outrageous.” Dragonfly invested into PepperSec, Inc., the developers of Tornado Cash, in August of 2020.

Its sanctioning by the U.S. Treasury’s OFAC in 2022 was a landmark moment, with authorities alleging it facilitated billions in illicit transactions , including funds tied to North Korean hackers. Despite the sanctions, Tornado Cash has shown surprising resilience. Flipside Crypto reported $1.9 billion in deposits through the platform in the first half of 2024 , indicating continued demand for anonymity tools in blockchain transactions. No Final Ruling Needed After Tornado Cash Removed from Sanctions List In March, the US Treasury Department argued that no further court ruling is necessary in the legal battle over its sanctioning of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, citing its recent removal of the platform and associated addresses from the sanctions list. As reported, a developer has ported Tornado Cash to the MegaETH blockchain’s public testnet, enabling private transactions on the high-performance network. MegaETH, which recently launched, boasts a throughput capacity of up to 20,000 transactions per second. The developer, known pseudonymously as Gunboats, said the idea was sparked by the U.S. Treasury’s recent removal of Tornado Cash addresses from the OFAC sanctions list, following a court ruling earlier this year.

Now, XYZVerse, a promising new project, could potentially outdo them with a tenfold increase. Could this emerging player surpass established cryptocurrencies with such a dramatic surge? The article explores this possibility, examining what factors might drive XYZVerse to extraordinary growth. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ , the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet . Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays .

Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits ADA: The Eco-Friendly Crypto Shaping the Future of Blockchain In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, Cardano stands out as a beacon of innovation and sustainability. Designed for smart contracts, Cardano is a flexible and scalable blockchain platform that facilitates the development of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH, offering users the ability to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally sustainable approach, utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is far more energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work models. Cardano’s innovative two-layer architecture—the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts—enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially reaching up to a million per second. Since the introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021, the platform has set new standards for blockchain efficiency and scalability, offering secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market cycle, as investors and developers prioritize sustainability and performance, ADA’s emphasis on energy efficiency and scalability has positioned it as a significant player in the competitive crypto landscape. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, ADA’s approach to combining advanced technology with environmental mindfulness aligns with emerging market trends. Avalanche (AVAX): Fast, Green, and Poised for Growth? Avalanche is making a name for itself in the blockchain world with its speed and eco-friendly approach. It’s a Layer-1 blockchain known for low fees and lightning-fast transactions, handling up to 4,500 transactions per second. A standout feature is its customizable Subnets, allowing users to create their own blockchain networks. Avalanche uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto methods, aiming to finalize transactions in less than two seconds. Its platform includes three interoperable chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—to handle various tasks like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX, the native token, is central to the ecosystem, used for transaction fees, staking, and running Subnets. In today’s market, Avalanche’s focus on speed and sustainability sets it apart. As environmental concerns grow, its eco-friendly design could attract more users and developers. Compared to other coins, AVAX offers strong utility in payments and staking, and it empowers users to create custom tokens and blockchains. With the crypto space looking for scalable and efficient solutions, Avalanche’s technology positions it as a project to watch. While the market is always changing, Avalanche’s innovative features could make it an attractive option in the current cycle. Conclusion While ADA and AVAX show impressive gains, XYZVerse’s unique sports memecoin and ambitious growth targets position it for potential 10× growth in the current bull market.

In a recent post on X, renowned chart analyst XRPunkie shared a detailed Elliott Wave chart outlining the potential for XRP to surge between $10 and $15, with $13 as a key extension target. The technical setup, paired with strong market sentiment, suggests that XRP could be on the verge of a powerful rally. Elliott Wave Structure Points to an Explosive Phase XRPunkie’s chart lays out a textbook Elliott Wave formation, showing XRP having completed Waves I through IV, with the current price action initiating the early stages of Wave V. Within that macro structure, Wave 3 appears to be unfolding , often considered the most powerful and extended of all impulsive waves. After a strong recovery from the Wave IV low in May, XRP surged toward $3.60 before pulling back to retest the $3.00 level. This correction aligns with typical subwave 2 behavior, setting the stage for a potentially explosive Wave 3 to follow. Those fib levels above could be some little Take Profits area for the Wave 3? I believe it could over extend to reach $13. Which is my target of $10-$15. We shall see. $XRP pic.twitter.com/EFtiMnwKRl — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 25, 2025 Fibonacci Levels Reveal Strategic Profit Zones The chart highlights multiple Fibonacci extension levels that could serve as potential resistance or take-profit zones as Wave 3 develops. Key targets include the 1.272 level at $4.12, the 1.618 level at $5.31, the 1.786 level at $6.00, and the 2.618 level near $7.55.A key resistance zone between $6.00 and $7.50 (marked in purple) could see price activity converge. Beyond that lies the 3.618 extension, which projects a price of $13.59, aligning perfectly with XRPunkie’s upper target range of $10 to $15. He suggests Wave 3 may extend to this level, supported by the chart structure, if bullish momentum picks up. Technical Indicators Support the Bullish Outlook Despite a brief correction, XRP remains technically strong. The daily chart indicates a healthy uptrend, with the price holding above both the 21-day EMA and 33-day SMA. XRP is currently trading around $3.05, with no lower lows formed, suggesting that the correction is likely a temporary consolidation before the next leg higher. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The broader crypto environment also favors XRP’s rally. Regulatory clarity in the U.S., along with renewed institutional interest in digital assets, is helping boost market sentiment. Political support under President Donald Trump’s administration has also reignited optimism across the crypto sector. XRP’s technicals suggest a historic rally could be on the horizon, with Wave 3 potentially targeting $13.59. XRPunkie’s analysis provides a clear roadmap backed by proven Elliott Wave theory and Fibonacci extensions. With strong technical indicators and favorable macro conditions, XRP appears primed for a significant move, and the $10 to $15 zone may soon come into focus. As momentum builds, XRP traders and long-term holders will be watching closely to see if the asset can fulfill its bullish blueprint.

With a current price of just $0.005, early backers see a massive upside before it even hits exchanges. A $600 investment today could turn into $60,000 if the token reaches just $0.50 post-launch. In a market where big-cap coins like Solana and XRP struggle to offer 2x returns, Ozak AI’s low cap and red-hot AI narrative create the perfect storm for explosive growth. What makes Ozak AI stand out isn’t just the price—it’s the timing. As artificial intelligence continues to dominate headlines, blockchain projects integrating AI are gaining serious traction. Ozak AI aims to become a central player in decentralized AI development, offering real-world utility beyond just hype. With growing investor demand, a strong use case, and limited time before listings go live, it’s no surprise everyone’s rushing in now. Early-Stage Entry: The Only Place to 100x in 2025? For most top altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, or Chainlink, the days of turning a few hundred dollars into life-changing gains are long gone. These tokens are already in the multi-billion dollar club. But micro-cap presales like Ozak AI offer something rare: the chance to buy low and benefit from explosive post-listing growth. At $0.005 per token, a $600 investment gets you 120,000 OZ tokens. If Ozak AI hits just $0.50 post-launch, that investment becomes $60,000. And if the token climbs to $1, that’s a staggering 100x return. These aren’t unrealistic targets either. We’ve seen meme coins and low-utility tokens like SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI do it before—often with little more than hype. Ozak AI, however, is riding the strongest trend of the decade: artificial intelligence. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin $OZ’s Massive Buzz and Presale Momentum One of the strongest signs of a successful crypto launch is the amount of capital raised during presale stages. Ozak AI has already attracted over $1.44 million, indicating that early adopters believe in its potential. The presale is moving fast through its stages. With each phase, the token price increases—making now the cheapest and riskiest, but most rewarding, time to buy in. Once Ozak AI lists on decentralized or centralized exchanges, this $0.005 price point could be history forever. Social media sentiment also tells the story. Telegram groups are growing. Twitter influencers are picking it up. And crypto content creators are starting to highlight Ozak AI as the “one AI altcoin that could explode by 2025.” $OZ Listing Day Could Be a Game-Changer What makes presales especially exciting is the moment they hit the open market. If Ozak AI gets listed on a major crypto exchange, we could see a price surge driven by pent-up demand, early buyer FOMO, and hype-fueled momentum. Listing day is often when the biggest price pumps occur—sometimes 5x, 10x, or even 100x. Investors know this. That’s why Ozak AI’s presale is filling fast—because no one wants to be on the outside when the rocket launches. Crypto doesn’t reward hesitation—it rewards action. The difference between a good investment and a life-changing one often comes down to timing. Ozak AI sits at the intersection of two of the biggest narratives in tech: AI and decentralization. It’s early, it’s cheap, and it’s gaining momentum fast. A modest investment today could become your biggest win of 2025.

Speaking at an AI-focused conference on Wednesday, Trump detailed this approach. He said the U.S. will impose a “straight, simple tariff” ranging from 15% up to 50%, adding that the lowest rate applies only to countries that deliver on their market‑opening commitments to American exporters. If no new agreements are made, many countries could face higher tariffs starting August 1 . China, specifically, has until August 12 to secure a bilateral deal with Washington or risk steeper levies. Companies nationwide have raised concerns, according to CBS News . They warn that elevated import fees would inflate operational expenses and ultimately lead to consumer-facing price hikes . On Thursday, Nestlé, the global food conglomerate, revealed it may increase the price of candy bars and other sweets, citing fears that the new tariffs would cut its profit margins. Also on Thursday, Italian luxury house Moncler said it has already adjusted its apparel prices upward to compensate for extra tariff expenses. General Electric, in turn, estimated that next year’s duties might slice about $500 million from its bottom line in 2025. GE said it plans to manage the extra expense through “cost controls and pricing actions.” Orange-juice distributor Johanna Foods filed a suit this week against the administration, contesting a planned 50% levy on Brazilian shipments . The New Jersey-based company argues such a duty would devastate its operations and compel it to raise shelf prices by up to 25%. The administration maintains that U.S. firms and consumers will not shoulder the increased tariffs. White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch, “The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world’s biggest and best consumer market.” Desai also referenced a study from the Council of Economic Advisers, noting that import costs have decreased year‑to‑date. Economists predict consumer prices will rise Economists, however, warn that consumers may face steeper prices on everyday items later in the year, from leather accessories and apparel to gadgets and vehicles. Capital Economics’ chief North America economist, Paul Ashworth, said, “Up to now, there has been only limited pass-through from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year.” He observed that many partners may be slapped with levies in the 15% to 20% range, while China could face steeper charges. He added, “We suspect retailers will be forced to finally raise the prices paid by consumers.” Inflation at the start of 2025 stayed subdued, partly due to firms and consumers accelerating imports ahead of tougher tariffs. However, that cushion is projected to shrink as time passes. Some sectors will feel tariff impacts more Ernie Tedeschi, economics director at Yale’s Budget Lab, cautioned, “In the short term, sharply higher prices won’t show up evenly across all categories.” He noted that industries importing the largest volumes would see the most pronounced effects. Yale’s research suggests that combining the 15% floor with additional, country-targeted tariffs could lift U.S. consumer prices by roughly 2% over two years. As Tedeschi emphasized, “This isn’t an instantaneous, ‘We wake up the next morning and the world is different.” Once these elevated duties are integrated into global supply chains, certain categories could experience sharp spikes. Yale’s findings indicate that foreign-made leather footwear, bags and clothing might surge by 40% or more, with electronics costs rising over 20%.

Investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, especially with the anticipation surrounding XRP ETF filings and the rising demand for Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. Currently, Larsen has offloaded over 100 million XRP tokens worth around $200 million, but still retains nearly 2.58 billion XRP. His large-scale sales have sparked concerns, yet analysts believe XRP is still well-positioned due to growing institutional interest and utility-focused fundamentals. Altcoin Daily Sees XRP’s Massive Utility Growth In a recent video titled “What 1,000 XRP Coins Will Be Worth in 2026,” Altcoin Daily broke down why they believe XRP is among the top contenders for long-term crypto success. They didn’t provide a hard prediction but emphasized XRP’s unmatched utility in global finance. The analyst highlights how XRP enables near-instant global settlements for less than a penny, giving it a clear edge over other tokens. The sentiment is that XRP is no longer being ignored by institutions, with 11 firms managing over $ 240 billion in assets filing with the SEC for an XRP ETF. RLUSD Stablecoin Strengthens XRP’s Position Another major bullish factor is Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, which has seen explosive growth , rising over 600% in just six months to surpass a $500 million market cap. Though 83% of its usage is currently on Ethereum, its existence benefits XRP directly. That’s because RLUSD trading on the XRPL DEX uses XRP as a bridge asset via auto-bridging. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top XRP Price Prediction For 2025 , Moreover, this process burns XRP with each transaction, reducing the supply and increasing value over time. The more RLUSD grows and transitions to XRPL, the more beneficial it becomes for XRP holders. From Doubters to Believers While the analysts were skeptical about XRP in the past, especially during its legal battle with the SEC, they have changed their tune following Ripple’s legal wins and strategic growth. They now acknowledge XRP’s real-world utility and institutional alignment. Assuming Bitcoin hits $150K, they estimate XRP could climb to $5–$9 by 2026 . That would make 1,000 XRP tokens worth anywhere between $5,000 and $9,000, depending on broader market conditions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $782.1 in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost 0.38 percent of its value today. Technical indicators still give strong bullish signals, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $782.1. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 0.38 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,108.65 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into July, BNB is trading approximately $653.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 15:30:00

Generation Xers, born between 1965 – 1980, will inherit a little over 10% of the $124 trillion that will be handed down over the coming 10 years, says asset and wealth management research firm Cerulli Associates. “Over the next decade, Gen X households are expected to receive nearly $1.4 trillion, on average, annually as part of the ‘Great Wealth Transfer.'” According to a senior analyst at the asset and wealth management research firm, Chayce Horton, the windfall will be particularly appreciated by Generation Xers and their households as the 1965-1980 cohort has faced relatively more financial and career upheavals in their lifetimes, including the global financial crisis. Horton says, “In fact, no generation lost a greater percentage of its net worth between 2007 and 2010 than Gen X households—their median net worth falling 38%, from $63,000 to $39,000. With stunted market growth from 2000–2010, many Gen X households lack a sense of comfort with their future retirement.” Gen Xers are also currently under immense financial pressure, having to meet the financial needs of their children and care for aging parents, according to Cerulli Associates. Per a 2023 survey done by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, Generation Xers had median savings of $82,000, compared to Boomers’ $289,000 and Millennials’ $49,000.

According to onchain data and developer updates, this program will last for at least 30 days and PUMP tokens will be distributed as rewards to participants. Recent updates to PumpFun's official SDK provide important insights into this incentive system. A newly added admin function allows you to set parameters such as the daily amount of PUMP to be distributed. Additionally, methods for tracking user volume and claiming rewards have been integrated into the system. While the program currently offers a 30-day incentive model, it's anticipated that the infrastructure could be repurposed for longer-term campaigns. Furthermore, it's anticipated that the IDL files for Pump's bonding curve system have been updated, so the volume generated from this transaction type will also be included in incentive calculations. Related News: Huge Whale Deposits $12 Million into Decentralized Exchange: Opens Long Positions in Two Altcoins It's not yet clear how many tokens will be distributed in total. However, a more recent test version included a daily distribution of 1 billion PUMP tokens. This amount represents a distribution of 3% of the total supply in just one month and is likely for testing purposes only. PumpFun, which has begun to lag behind rival projects like BONK in trading volume, aims to re-engage users and increase its market share through these incentives. While the program hasn't yet been launched, technical preparations suggest a launch may be imminent. Following this development, there was a 13% increase in the PUMP price.

Still, market analysis by Grok, ChatGPT and Deepseek AI models suggests SHIB’s price recovery could still fall short of previous highs. However, these AI tools tip a newcomer called Remittix ($RTX) to surpass the previous success the Shiba Inu coin has reached. This low-cap crypto gem trading around $0.08 boasts faster burn mechanics and a real-world payment focus. For Grok, ChatGPT and Deepseek AI, these factors could see $RTX beat Shiba Inu coin to the magic dollar price target. How High Can Recent Burn Actions Drive Shiba Inu Coin Price? Source: TradingView Grok, ChatGPT, and Deepseek AI have narrowed recent Shiba Inu coin performance to two major forces . The first factor is how the project’s team and community recorded 135 million SHIB burned in only seven days, shrinking the total supply. Such a burn rate reflects a 200% growth. Also, the AI models acknowledge how Google searches for Shiba Inu have increased to a five‑month high. That’s a sign that more investors are showing interest. Regardless, market investors remain worried. These AI models’ prediction of the Shiba Inu coin leaves cautionary clues, as SHIB’s rise might fade unless it ends the month above $0.000018 . Market analysts also believe a surge will take a while, as SHIB still trades far below that level at press time. Why AI Tools Prediction Tip Remittix to Surpass the Previous Shiba Inu Coin Ascent Remittix has enjoyed a high-flying start to life with funding of over $17 million raised already and price growth to $0.0842 so far. The demand for the RTX token continues to increase, and Grok, ChatGPT and Deepseek AI acknowledge these positives. The ongoing 50% sprint bonus for early investors and a $250,000 giveaway are major factors behind recent rapid community development. But here are more drivers these AI models believe are behind Remittix’s rapid growth: Offering users low and transparent transaction charges thanks to support from other chains like Solana and BSC Real‑world use cases that simplify crypto-to-fiat global remittances for users Approval licenses in the works for Brazil and Kenya On course for domination in a $190 trillion cross-border payment industry Security-focused investors praise its recent CertiK audit certification Imminent Q3 wallet beta launch on September 15 Global access for users with over 40 cryptos and 30 currencies supported.

Which Is A Better Investment In July?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/dogecoin-shiba-inu-or-desoc-which-is-a-better-investment-in-july,"Dogecoin, Shiba Inu or DeSoc? That's the question on every investor, analyst, and expert's mind. For weeks, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have been leading the resurgence in the meme market, posting double-digit percentage gains within a month. However, analysts and savvy investors are now focusing on value-driven utility rather than mere speculation that meme coins hold. One project that has been on everyone's mind is the new DeSoc Ethereum-based social media platform, which is spearheading the decentralized social media concept. So, which is a better investment in July? The usual meme hype with no utility or a promising disruption to a $101 billion social media market? Let's find out. Dogecoin Surges Past $0.25 as Revolutionary Zero-Knowledge Upgrade Ignites Whale Frenzy The meme coin that started as a joke is now making serious moves. Dogecoin has shattered the critical $0.25 resistance barrier with explosive 38% monthly gains, catapulting toward ambitious targets of $0.31 and $0.42 looks imminent. Behind the rally lies a game-changing development: DogeOS has submitted a groundbreaking zero-knowledge proof upgrade proposal that could revolutionize Dogecoin from a simple payment token into a powerhouse DeFi and gaming platform. The OP_CHECKZKP proposal promises to enable thousands of off-chain transactions per second through zk-rollups, while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum. Crypto whales are taking notice in a big way. Large investors holding over 10 million DOGE tokens have accumulated a staggering 122.59 billion tokens. Trading volume has also surged past $20 billion in 24 hours, and the RSI is forming higher highs without bearish divergence. Shiba Inu's 400% Rally Setup Has Analysts Buzzing Technical patterns don't lie, and Shiba Inu is painting a masterpiece that has veteran analysts reaching for their calculators. The formation of a massive Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern on SHIB's chart has market observer Javon Marks projecting a mind-bending 400% rally to $0.000081. The meme coin already delivered a solid 16% gain over the past month, but according to analyst Friedrich , the real fireworks haven't started yet. SHIB needs to punch through $0.000017 resistance to trigger what CW calls ""big upside"" potential. Behind the scenes, SHIB's burning mechanism is working overtime. The burn rate skyrocketed 200% over seven days, with 135 million tokens sent to digital oblivion. While the dollar value may seem modest, consistent token destruction creates scarcity that could amplify any potential demand surge. Retail interest is heating up fast. Google searches for Shiba Inu just hit a five-month high, signaling a growing appetite from everyday investors. Trading volumes recently exploded to 4.33 trillion tokens, far exceeding historical patterns and suggesting institutional money is taking notice. DeSoc Emerges as the Smart Money's July Pick While meme coins chase nostalgic highs, sophisticated investors are quietly accumulating DeSoc, the social media revolution that makes Dogecoin and Shiba Inu look like yesterday's news. The $10 million already flowing into DeSoc represents something neither DOGE nor SHIB can offer: genuine utility that grows stronger with adoption. DeSoc solves real problems that billions face daily. The platform's groundbreaking content syndication technology allows simultaneous publishing across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and DeSoc itself through sophisticated API integration. The tokenomics structure reveals careful planning that meme coins lack. With 45% of the 3 billion token supply allocated across 12 presale stages, DeSoc builds sustainable community growth while the platform develops core functionality. Revenue streams flow through content rewards, creator tipping, exclusive access monetization, and advertising partnerships using $SOCS tokens. Market timing couldn't be better. Social media platforms face mounting regulatory pressure over creator compensation and data privacy, creating massive demand for decentralized alternatives. DeSoc targets the $100 billion social media advertising market, a prize that dwarfs anything meme coins currently address. Smart contracts govern every platform decision through transparent blockchain verification, ensuring community participation in DeSoc's evolution. While DOGE and SHIB depend on retail sentiment and whale manipulation, DeSoc creates authentic demand through platform usage. The choice between speculative meme coin trading and revolutionary social media infrastructure has never been clearer. Why July Favors Real Innovation Over Meme Magic Dogecoin and Shiba Inu offer compelling technical setups with clear price targets; however, they remain at the mercy of market sentiment and whale activity. DOGE's $0.25 breakout and SHIB's 400% rally potential depend entirely on continued speculation and retail FOMO. DeSoc represents a fundamental shift toward utility-driven investing. While meme coins chase previous highs, DeSoc builds the infrastructure for Web3 social media adoption. The $10 million initial funding, transparent tokenomics, and revolutionary content syndication technology create sustainable value that transcends market cycles. Its ongoing presale has seen an astronomical rise in demand, and fortunately, the price is at just $0.01. This remains your best shot at life-changing gains. Seize the moment!

However, the emergence of DeSoc, a platform aiming to revolutionize decentralized social media, presents a new paradigm. Choosing the right investment in July hinges on understanding both the speculative nature of meme coins and the utility-driven potential of newer blockchain technologies like DeSoc . Dogecoin's Impressive Technological Leap This month, Dogecoin has seen significant developments with the introduction of a proposed zero-knowledge proof upgrade. This enhancement would transform Dogecoin from a mere cryptocurrency into a versatile platform for DeFi and gaming applications, compatible with Ethereum. The proposal, titled OP_CHECKZKP, aims to implement zk-rollups to facilitate off-chain transactions, potentially increasing transaction throughput substantially. This technological advance has ignited interest among large-scale investors , with significant accumulations of Dogecoin reported. Shiba Inu's Potential for a Price Surge The technical charts for Shiba Inu are showing formations that experts like Javon Marks believe could lead to a dramatic price increase, possibly by 400%, if it breaks past key resistance points. This optimism is bolstered by Shiba Inu's aggressive token burning strategy which has seen a 200% increase in burn rate, hinting at growing scarcity and potential value increase. Moreover, analyst Friedrich underscores the significant upside potential if SHIB can overcome the $0.000017 level. Diverse Utility Makes DeSoc a July Favorite While meme coins leverage market sentiment, DeSoc introduces a practical utility in the decentralized social media space.

While Solana (SOL) tests a crucial support level at $178, Remittix is riding massive momentum after gaining over 450% since launch, raising more than $17 million with no signs of slowing down. Solana Dips After $205 High As Bears Tighten Grip Solana recently hit $205 before slipping 12% in two days, now clinging to the $178 support zone. According to TD Sequential, a potential reversal might be brewing, with indicators showing buyers stepping in near $182. Daily RSI is holding around 56, suggesting it’s cooling off from overbought territory. Despite these technical signals, on-chain data paints a gloomier picture. Over $57 million in long positions were liquidated in 24 hours, 86.79% of them from traders who bet on rising prices. This was further compounded by a class-action lawsuit against Pump.Fun, involving Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation, triggering even more uncertainty. If bulls defend $178, a bounce toward $194–$200 is possible. But a breakdown could send SOL tumbling to $160. Remittix Surges 450% As Traders Shift Toward Real Utility While Solana’s traders wait for a rebound, Remittix is grabbing all the spotlight. After launching its token at a much lower price, Remittix has now surged by over 450%, drawing attention from both retail and institutional players seeking long-term growth. The team recently revealed that the Remittix Wallet beta will be released on September 15, with full crypto wallet capabilities. This has accelerated demand, with over 565 million tokens sold and $17 million raised so far. What makes Remittix different is its utility in real-world financial payments. From cross-border payroll for remote workers to vendor settlements in developing markets, the token is seeing early adoption beyond hype. Why Remittix Is Quietly Becoming the Breakout Crypto of 2025 Beta Wallet Launching Sept 15 with full crypto functionality $17M+ Raised and 565M+ tokens sold at $0.0842 Up to 50% Token Bonus still live for early buyers Use Cases in Real-World Finance, not just speculation Massive Community Support growing across X and Telegram With Solana lawsuits making headlines, Remittix is emerging as the go-to crypto with real utility for 2025. The Verdict: Momentum Belongs To Remittix While Solana’s roadmap hints at long-term potential, its short-term struggles, including liquidation waves and legal noise, are causing hesitation. Remittix, on the other hand, is delivering product milestones, real-world usage, and community trust. That is why more traders are exiting SOL positions and moving their capital into RTX, a token that is not only holding strong but still rising.

Even though Solana remains a solid player testing vital price levels, Remittix has swiftly gained notoriety with a robust initial growth, raking in over $17 million in funds. Detailed Insights into Solana's Market Movements After peaking at $205, Solana experienced a sharp 12% drop within two days, finding itself at a pivotal $178 support level. Market indicators suggest a potential turnaround might be imminent, with buyer activity increasing near the $182 mark. However, despite positive technical indicators, the on-chain data reveals a stark $57 million in long positions being liquidated within a day, contributing to the market's bearish sentiment. Complications have further escalated due to a class-action lawsuit involving Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation, intensifying the uncertainty in its market projections. Should the $178 level hold, a recovery to between $194 and $200 could occur, but a failure might plunge prices down to $160. Remittix: A Promising Newcomer in the Payment Token Sector While Solana deals with its market challenges, Remittix has become the center of attraction following its impressive 450% growth since its inception. This remarkable ascent has drawn both retail and institutional attention, with the digital currency's practical applications in global financial transactions significantly contributing to its appeal. Positioning as the Future of Payment Infrastructure One of the highlights of the Remittix project is its upcoming wallet beta release scheduled for September 15, touted to enhance its utility by integrating full cryptocurrency functionality. The anticipation has spurred token sales, crossing the 565 million mark and securing over $17 million in fundraising. Its utility spans several real-world financial applications, from international payroll for remote workers to settling transactions with vendors in emerging economies, positioning it well beyond just another speculative asset. Conclusion: Shifting Market Dynamics Favoring Remittix While Solana continues to navigate through its highs and lows, the newcomer, Remittix, is steadily carving out a niche for itself by delivering tangible products and gaining traction among a robust community. This shift is evident as traders begin to migrate from volatile positions in Solana towards the more stable and promising prospects offered by Remittix.

Alongside ADA, the Sui cryptocurrency token also enjoys investor attention after a slight price increase. And while these household names grab investor attention, newer tokens like Remittix (RTX) are picking up serious attention as the crypto sector inches towards practical application and innovation. ADA and SUI on Investors’ Watchlists The recent price decline of the ADA has not changed the overall sentiment towards Cardano. With a market cap of $28.44 billion and a trading volume of $2.09 billion (6.11% increase), ADA continues to be a dominant force in smart contract development and eco-friendly blockchain projects. Meanwhile, Sui crypto is experiencing a subdued rally. At $3.71 — up 0.65% — it has a market capitalization of $12.84 billion. A drop in trading volume by 18.68% to $1.74 billion, however, shows that volatility remains a problem. However, both tokens are seen as fundamentals in the upcoming crypto cycle. With institutional and retail investors flooding back, ADA and SUI must benefit from increasing demand and improved infrastructure adoption. Why Remittix Is Surging Despite Market Jitters While older altcoins like Cardano and Sui crypto still have investor bases, newer altcoins like Remittix (RTX) are gaining momentum. At just $0.0842 per token, RTX has already raised over $17 million in its presale, having sold more than 559 million tokens to date. The hype is essentially due to the application of Remittix in real life — solving high-fee cross-border transactions by enabling crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries. The cross-chain DeFi protocol bridges Ethereum, Solana, and XRP chains, enabling a seamless experience for remitters, freelancers, and businesses to operate without banking interference. A significant update was the official release of the Remittix Wallet Beta, set to launch in Q3 2025. The wallet offers low gas costs, live FX conversions, and support for more than 40 cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. This release has fortified investor confidence, particularly as the project nears its $18 million soft cap threshold.

Until recently, Ethereum (ETH) had been held to be the number one in blockchain technology. However, the second-largest cap is facing scaling issues at the moment. At this very moment, DeSoc , the decentralised social platform on top of DeFi, is making fast waves and garnering genuine interest from within the crypto fraternity. DeSoc ($SOCS): A Brave Mix of Social Media and DeFi DeSoc is a new platform that combines social media with decentralised finance. The $SOCS token is at the heart of it all. It enables people to trade with each other, earn money from their content, and utilize promotional tools. This new approach empowers users by allowing them to control their data and earnings, which platforms like Facebook and TikTok currently restrict. The response has been great. The presale for DeSoc has already brought in $10 million, and a lot of $SOCS tokens have been sold at just $0.01. This early success shows that investors have a lot of faith in the project's future. The value of $SOCS could increase significantly if the platform is widely used and works well at scaling. One of the best things about DeSoc is its innovative contract system. It gives users rewards for being active on the site. Instead of relying on ads, creators can earn a direct profit from their content. This gives users more control over their online presence. DeSoc aims to transform social media by offering users a fairer, decentralized choice that prioritizes their interests. Ethereum (ETH): Strong Basics, But Problems Ahead Even though some say that Ethereum may have peaked, it is still doing well in the short term. ETH is worth $3,626.82 right now. In the last 24 hours, it has gone down by 1.9%, and in the previous month, it has gone up an impressive 49%. This rise is very different from the rest of the crypto market, which dropped 17% in the same period. Ethereum's market cap is now about $439.77 billion, which shows that investors are confident and that institutions are still using it. Ethereum has come a long way in fixing problems brought up in the past. The Merge switched the system from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, which cut energy use by more than 99%. This made it more sustainable and in line with ESG goals. Later updates, like Dencun and Pectra, added features like Proto-Danksharding and better staking, which helped lower transaction costs and speed up processing. Institutional players have noticed these upgrades. More and more, banks, governments, and significant funds are looking into Ethereum-based ETFs and other solutions. Technical indicators point to a positive outlook, with strong support between $3,570 and $3,600 and resistance near $4,000. Analysts say that if ETH goes above that level, it could reach new highs, $10,000 to $15,000 by the end of 2025. But it's not certain that Ethereum will stay in charge for a long time. Despite its updates, it still has trouble growing when the network is busy. Ethereum will still have difficulty keeping low fees and fast transactions as more DeFi and dApp projects launch. Competitors like Solana and Avalanche are getting ahead by providing similar features but with better performance metrics. Conclusion Ethereum is having trouble scaling, and DeSoc is starting to look like a possible disruptor. DeSoc combines DeFi and social networking, two of the most active areas in blockchain. It has a lot of early momentum, a unique way to make money, and a focus on the user, which makes it a serious player to watch. The presale for $SOCS is almost over, and the project's rapid growth suggests that this could be one of the last chances to buy in at a low price of just $0.01. Even though there are still risks, early supporters of DeSoc see it as a chance to get in on the ground floor of a significant change in cryptocurrency and how people interact online. Both Ethereum and DeSoc show how blockchain technology is changing and growing. Investors can choose the established strength of Ethereum or the pioneering spirit of DeSoc.

Ethereum, known for its foundational role in blockchain applications, is now juxtaposed against emerging platforms like DeSoc , which is swiftly gaining attention for its novel integration of social media dynamics with decentralized finance (DeFi). The Advent of DeSoc: Merging Social Media with DeFi Unlike traditional platforms where user data and profits are often controlled by the platform itself, DeSoc introduces a groundbreaking model where users gain financial benefits from their interactions and content, directly influencing the platform's value through the $SOCS token. This early adoption phase has remarkably led to a $10 million presale success, with tokens initially priced at mere $0.01. The platform's user-centric model offers a robust contract system rewarding active participation, which contrasts sharply with the ad-revenue-based models of platforms like Facebook and TikTok, positing DeSoc as a revolution in user empowerment and economic model in social media. Challenges and Progress in Ethereum’s Ecosystem Despite its pioneering status, Ethereum faces criticism over its scalability, with recent values fluctuating at around $3,626.82 per ETH. Market dynamics show a 1.9% decrease in the last 24 hours, yet a 49% increase over the past month, underscoring a volatile yet upward trending trajectory. It holds a substantial market cap of approximately $439.77 billion, reflecting ongoing investor confidence and institutional engagement. The platform’s significant updates like The Merge, transitioning to a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, have drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning with global sustainability goals. Moreover, subsequent advancements aim to decrease transaction fees and increase efficiency, though it still grapples with high traffic periods. Despite these enhancements, Ethereum’s long-term dominance is uncertain, given the rising competition from platforms like Solana and Avalanche, which offer similar functionalities but with potentially more scalable infrastructures. Conclusion: The Blockchain Battleground The contrast between DeSoc’s emerging platform and Ethereum’s established but troubled scalability paints a vivid picture of the current blockchain environment. DeSoc’s fresh approach to integrating social media with DeFi could position it as a notable disruptor in the space. The burgeoning success of DeSoc, emphasized by its successful presale and the potential for significant value increase of the $SOCS token, marks a critical junction in the evolution of decentralized platforms. Investors and crypto enthusiasts are at a crossroads, choosing between the proven but evolving giant Ethereum and the dynamic, user-focused newcomer DeSoc.

The move saw a price rally over 65% in just two weeks, clearing previous liquidity zones and reclaiming a bullish market structure. However, the rally hit a wall just under the $3.80 zone, which aligns with previous equal highs and a Smart Money “Weak High” label. The pullback has now stabilized around the $3.18 mark, which sits just above the weekly 0.786 Fibonacci level at $3.08.

As much as the token remains a top player within the crypto universe, this last-minute sell-off has sparked renewed controversy surrounding long-term faith. And as the quest for utility-first projects intensifies, one upstart platform, Remittix (RTX), is beginning to gain serious interest. XRP Price Witnesses Sentiment Shift Despite the large sale, the XRP price is 0.63% up today, at $3.13 and a market cap of $185.99 billion. Its daily trade volume has dropped by 39.57%, however, to reach $10.1 billion — an indication that traders may be holding back as uncertainty prevails. Although XRP has traditionally been the default for cross-border crypto payments, such choices by celebrity figures are inspiring new worries. Investors are now rethinking their positions, especially those interested in crypto with real utility and transparent development roadmaps. Remittix Announces Beta Wallet Plans One project that is gaining traction within this space is Remittix, a cross-chain DeFi project that recently announced the beta release of its wallet in Q3 2025. Unlike many gamified altcoins, Remittix does have a concrete real-world mission: crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries, no centralized exchange required. The wallet will support 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, with real-time FX conversion, a novelty in crypto today. This not only positions Remittix as a buzzword among DeFi project space, but as a practical solution of mass interest for freelancers, businesses, and remittance users. Low gas costs, multi-chain support, and user-focused model make Remittix stand atop the list of altcoin hopefuls searching for the next breakout altcoin 2025. Presale Tops $17.2 Million The RTX token, currently at $0.0842, has now raised over $17.2 million in funds. Over 567 million tokens have been sold, and the project is quickly nearing its $18 million soft cap. The 50% token bonus is live and drawing even more attention from retail and institutional investors. What distinguishes RTX is not the technology, but the scale of its early adoption. Having a proven use case and a real product in the works, it avoids the pitfall of yet another hype token. The Remittix whitepaper describes a token economy for genuine transaction volume, not hype. Why Remittix Is Gaining Steam Remittix is mowing down space as one of the most slept-on crypto projects of 2025. With a real product imminent and strong project performance, it's being positioned by some as something of a spiritual heir to early Ripple — minus the regulatory baggage. Top Reasons Remittix Is Getting Attention: Global Reach: Direct bank-to-cryptocurrency transfers in over 30 countries 50% Bonus Live: For a limited time during presale Beta Launch near: Q3 2025 wallet release confirmed $17.2M+ Raised: Broader investor and community support Real Utility: Solving real payment problems, not speculation If you're looking for a crypto that's addressing real-world problems, this might be the perfect moment to invest in RTX token before its wallet release in Q3 — and before it reaches the $18M soft cap.

This development has left investors and market watchers speculating about the potential implications for XRP's stability and its position within the cryptocurrency hierarchy. While XRP still commands respect in the market, such a hefty sell-off tends to stir doubts about its longevity and reliability as a long-term investment. Amid these concerns, Remittix (RTX) , a relatively new entrant, is beginning to capture the market's attention with its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). The Ripple Effect: Analyzing XRP's Market Dynamics Despite the unsettling news, XRP's market price has shown resilience, currently up by 0.63%, standing at $3.13 with a market capitalization of $185.99 billion. However, its trading volume has witnessed a significant drop of 39.57%, hinting at a cautious approach from traders amidst the prevailing uncertainties. The reputation of XRP as a preferred medium for cross-border transactions might be facing challenges, not just from internal dynamics but also from emerging competitors who are keen on presenting a clearer and more utility-focused roadmap. Exploring the Potential of Remittix As the crypto community continues to favor projects with real-world applications over mere speculative assets, Remittix is gaining a foothold. This platform extends beyond traditional crypto offerings by facilitating direct crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries, a feature that stands out in the DeFi space. The impending beta launch of their wallet in Q3 2025 promises to support over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, complete with real-time foreign exchange conversion capabilities. This functionality positions Remittix as not only a tool for personal finance management but also as a viable platform for businesses and freelancers who engage in global transactions. Moreover, the ongoing presale of RTX tokens has successfully amassed over $17.2 million, indicating robust investor confidence and nearing its $18 million soft cap. The allure of a 50% token bonus has further spiked interest among both retail and institutional investors. Summing Up: The Shift in Investor Sentiment The crypto market is evidently evolving, with investor sentiments visibly shifting from established giants like XRP to promising new entrants like Remittix. This indicates a broader trend of seeking platforms that not only promise innovation but also offer practical solutions to existing financial challenges. Remittix appears well-positioned to make a significant impact, particularly with its upcoming product launches and strategic market positioning aimed at addressing the needs of a diverse user base.

48992464,https://timestabloid.com/?p=75631,1753545237,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Four Reasons Why XRP Ledger Solution Using RLUSD Is Superior to USDC,https://timestabloid.com/four-reasons-why-xrp-ledger-solution-using-rlusd-is-superior-to-usdc/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE published a post aimed at clarifying a persistent misunderstanding in the digital asset community, namely, the confusion between stablecoins such as USDC and native blockchain assets like XRP. The post, which referenced several supporting documents, addressed claims made by a public figure who misrepresented the technical and institutional advantages of Ripple’s RLUSD over Circle’s USDC. SMQKE presented four detailed comparisons underscoring RLUSD’s integrated blockchain solution and emphasized how the XRP Ledger (XRPL) offers a more comprehensive cross-border payment infrastructure. Dave Portnoy Part 2. Many still confuse a stablecoin like USDC with a native asset like XRP. These four pieces of evidence clearly show why the XRPL solution using RLUSD is superior to USDC’s tech stack: 1. USDC relies entirely on third-party blockchains. The first document… https://t.co/2SZLysZlDg pic.twitter.com/vbgQGav5bp — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 25, 2025 Ripple Offers a Unified Blockchain and Stablecoin Solution The first image cited by SMQKE references the XRPL’s capacity to deliver both the distributed ledger technology and the native stablecoin. According to the analysis, while USDC is available on multiple chains, including its recent launch on the XRPL , its issuer, Circle, does not operate its blockchain. The document noted that RLUSD stands apart by offering a vertically integrated solution. Ripple provides both the token and the underlying ledger, reducing dependency on third parties. This design benefits institutions by eliminating the need for external partnerships to move value, as Ripple controls both the rails (XRPL) and the currency (RLUSD), whereas Circle relies on external blockchain infrastructures for USDC operations. XRP Ledger’s Transaction Efficiency SMQKE’s second point addressed the issue of transaction costs. Referencing a comparative study of cross-border payment assets, the included document contrasted XRPL’s transaction costs and speeds against USDC’s reliance on Ethereum, which is frequently criticized for its higher fees. The report indicated that XRPL processes transactions in three to five seconds at a fraction of a cent, while Ethereum-based transactions may incur higher and more variable costs. XRP’s underlying deflationary tokenomics and built-in interoperability features also provide it with added utility in multi-chain environments, further reinforcing XRPL’s position in institutional financial infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anchorage Digital Endorses RLUSD’s Institutional Structure In the third piece of evidence, SMQKE shared a report from Anchorage Digital that evaluated various stablecoins based on regulatory oversight and reserve composition. The report placed RLUSD alongside other high-compliance assets like PYUSD and USDP, citing its institutional alignment and quality reserve mechanisms. In contrast, it noted that USDC and similar tokens exhibit structural risks related to insufficient buffers against market volatility. This reinforced SMQKE’s assertion that RLUSD is better equipped to meet regulatory expectations and institutional risk management standards. Circle’s Launch of USDC on XRP Ledger Lastly, SMQKE included Circle’s recent announcement that USDC is now natively supported on the XRPL. In the announcement, Circle outlined use cases for enterprise payments, DeFi liquidity provisioning, and financial applications. SMQKE pointed out that this move by Circle itself demonstrates recognition of XRPL’s technical advantages. While Circle brings USDC to XRPL, Ripple does not depend on Circle or similar entities to enable stablecoin functionality, as it has developed RLUSD directly on its infrastructure. By sharing these documents, SMQKE aimed to provide a factual basis for distinguishing Ripple’s native solution from third-party stablecoin offerings. The researcher concluded the post by stating that these materials should prevent retail investors from embracing narratives that ignore the technical, cost, and institutional strengths of XRPL and RLUSD . According to SMQKE, Ripple’s ability to deliver an end-to-end solution positions it more favorably than stablecoins relying on external infrastructures.

SOCS tokens power content monetization, governance votes, and premium access tiers, all outlined in the whitepaper . While BlockDag and Litechain AI jockey for attention in the Web3 space, DeSoc’s combination of cross‑chain syndication and on‑chain incentives may deliver outsized gains by year’s end. DeSoc’s On‑Chain Social Model Sets It Apart SOCS tokens underpin every interaction on DeSoc’s network. Creators can gate premium content behind minimum SOCS holdings, forging tight‑knit communities that share in the platform’s growth. Every token transfer is publicly auditable on Ethereum explorers, reinforcing trust. A fixed 3 billion supply allocates 45% to a multi-phase presale with transparent vesting to prevent immediate sell-offs (whitepaper). Early participants earn rewards for posting, commenting, and sharing—no ad middlemen skimming returns. Key project mechanics include: Cross‑Platform Proofs: Every post anchors on Ethereum while reaching Web2 audiences. On‑Chain Rewards: SOCS payouts for engagement metrics replace ad skims. Token‑Gated Communities: Premium content locked behind SOCS minimums boosts demand. As DeSoc rolls out its testnet, users will see how SOCS incentives drive quality content and decentralized decision‑making. With cross‑chain syndication, posts are anchored on Ethereum yet still reach audiences on Twitter or Facebook. This blend of familiar social flows and DeFi mechanics may fuel stronger network effects and higher returns than competitors relying solely on data‑driven ad models. BlockDag’s Directed Acyclic Graph Ambitions BlockDAG’s Layer 1 presale has raised over $350 million at $0.0016 per BDAG token, offering buyers a possible 3,025 % ROI if the launch price hits $0.05. ChatGPT’s forecast aligns with market sentiment that high‑throughput DAG architectures will attract institutional capital, but caps projected returns at around 3,300 % given expected token unlocks. Recent performance highlights: Presale Scale: 24.3 billion BDAG tokens sold across multiple batches ROI Potential: Early backers already see 2,660 % gains on initial batches Technical Edge: Testnet demonstrated 2,000 TPS , outpacing many smart‑contract chains While BlockDAG’s fundraising prowess underscores broad interest, ChatGPT’s comparative models suggest diminishing returns as token unlocks and exchange listings dilute upside late in the cycle. Without on‑chain content rewards, it may trail platforms that blend engagement incentives with high throughput. Litechain AI’s Machine‑Learning Focus Lightchain AI has quietly raised over $21.1 million across 15 funding rounds and set a fixed $0.007 bonus‑round price ahead of its late‑July mainnet launch. ChatGPT estimates LCAI could climb to $0.073 by December, delivering roughly 950% returns, driven by demand for decentralized AI services but capped by a narrower application scope. Recent ecosystem moves: Mainnet Imminent: Corenet activation scheduled for late July, unlocking Proof of Intelligence consensus. AI‑Focused Tech: Introduction of an Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine for on‑chain model inference. Developer Grants: Ongoing Pectra update enhances transaction speeds and lowers fees to support AI workloads Despite strong fundamentals, ChatGPT’s scenario analysis finds that LCAI’s specialized niche yields lower overall upside compared to broad‑appeal social‑DeFi and Layer 1 presales. Why DeSoc Could Outpace Competitors by Year’s End DeSoc blends social media and DeFi in one unified protocol. By rewarding content creation, curbing whale dominance and enabling cross‑chain syndication, it taps both user engagement and network effects. BlockDag excels at throughput and Litechain AI at on‑chain AI, but neither offers built‑in rewards for the very behavior that fuels social networks: posting, sharing and commenting. When creators earn SOCS for each interaction and hold governance power via quadratic voting, platform growth becomes a shared endeavor. Transparent vesting schedules and public audits reinforce confidence, while token‑gated communities drive stickiness. As the testnet goes live, early participants will see how these mechanics translate into real‑world value. ChatGPT’s models predict that, given current presale momentum and DeSoc’s unique feature set, SOCS could deliver higher returns than DAG‑based or AI‑focused tokens by the close of 2025. For those betting on social‑DeFi over pure throughput or compute, DeSoc may be the standout performer to watch. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

This platform has recently completed a presale that amassed over $10 million, underscoring the rising demand for platforms that reward genuine social interactions. DeSoc utilizes its native SOCS tokens to facilitate content monetization, governance, and access to premium features, as detailed in their whitepaper . Understanding SOCS: The Fuel Behind DeSoc At the core of DeSoc's functionality are SOCS tokens, which are essential for every transaction and interaction within the network. Users can lock premium content behind SOCS token thresholds, creating exclusive communities and driving token demand. Additionally, all transactions are transparent and verifiable on Ethereum block explorers, enhancing trust among users. Key Features of DeSoc's Platform: Content Proofs Across Platforms: Posts are verified on Ethereum and visible across traditional social platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Direct On-Chain Rewards: Users earn SOCS for engagement, eliminating the need for ad-based revenue streams. Exclusive Access Through Tokens: Access to premium content requires holding certain amounts of SOCS, boosting its utility and value. Comparative Analysis: BlockDag and Litechain AI While DeSoc innovates in the social-DeFi space, other platforms focus on different aspects of blockchain technology: BlockDag's High Throughput System BlockDag captivates the market with its promise of high-speed transactions, leveraging a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This technology has helped it raise significant funds, including a notable presale that secured over $350 million . Despite its technological edge, evidenced by a testnet achieving 2,000 TPS , the absence of a social component might limit its user engagement compared to DeSoc. Litechain AI Focuses on Decentralized AI Litechain AI, on the other hand, emphasizes integrating AI with blockchain, aiming to unlock new potentials in decentralized services. It has impressively raised over $21.1 million across various funding rounds and is preparing for a major release with its token priced at a fixed rate in anticipation of its mainnet activation. However, the niche focus may restrict its appeal compared to more universally applicable platforms like DeSoc. Conclusion: Why DeSoc May Lead the Pack by 2025 DeSoc differentiates itself by merging aspects of social networking and DeFi, appealing to a broad user base eager for platforms that reward real interaction. Its innovative token mechanics not only encourage content creation but also ensure that users are rewarded for their contributions, fostering a strong community-centric ecosystem. With the evolving landscape of blockchain technologies, DeSoc's unique positioning, combined with a transparent and user-focused model, positions it potentially ahead of its competitors in terms of growth and user adoption by 2025.

This has caught the attention of savvy traders. Why are these digital assets becoming favorites among professionals? Delve into what makes XRP and ADA the talk of the crypto world right now. Discover the reasons behind this growing interest and what it could mean for their future. XRP Price Analysis: Recent Trends and Key Support Resistance Levels XRP experienced a notable climb over the past month with a 41.34% increase, despite a short-term dip of about 11.08% last week. In the last six months, the coin remained mostly flat, showing a marginal change of -0.39%. These movements indicate that XRP saw a rapid surge recently while still reflecting sideways action in its longer-term behavior. The coin currently trades in a range between $1.99 and $2.41, with key resistance at $2.59 and another target near $3.02. Support is identified at $1.73 and a secondary level at $1.31. Recent price action suggests bulls have pushed prices higher overall, though the short-term drop indicates existing selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index near 58 reveals a balanced struggle between buyers and sellers. Traders might consider buying near support and taking profits around resistance, with stop-loss and take-profit strategies being advisable in this market. Cardano Price Action: Short-term Surge Amid Long-term Challenges Cardano has recently recorded a significant 35.71% increase in price over the past month, yet it has seen an 18.32% decline over the last six months. This monthly surge indicates strong buying interest and a burst of short-term momentum, while the longer timeframe suggests a more cautious market sentiment. Price movements have been volatile, showcasing quick recoveries in the short term contrasted with prolonged downward pressure. These shifts highlight an environment where traders can achieve short-term gains despite ongoing long-term challenges. The current trading range is between $0.48 and $0.70, with immediate resistance at $0.83 and support at $0.38. Buyers have recently pushed the market upward, but a -3.16% decline over the week reveals persistent bearish pressure. Resistance at $0.83 remains crucial for further upside potential, while support at $0.38 offers buyers a safety net. Caution is advised due to mixed signals from momentum indicators, and traders might look for opportunities within these key levels to balance risk and reward amidst market volatility. Conclusion XRP and ADA have identified strong support levels. This is why seasoned traders are increasingly interested in stocking up on these cryptocurrencies. The reliance on solid support floors indicates a promising outlook. The strategic move to increase holdings in XRP and ADA could signal confidence in their potential for future growth. This trend among professional traders highlights the importance of these key support levels in guiding investment decisions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) Which Investment Offers Better Upside In 2025?

As the market evolves, Uniswap (UNI) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) are emerging as strong contenders. This comparison delves into their potential for growth by 2025. Discover which of these coins could offer a better return on investment, and stay ahead in the crypto game. Uniswap (UNI) Market Snapshot: Past Performance and Current Price Levels Uniswap experienced significant gains over the last month with a 40.34% increase, indicating strong upward momentum. However, the 6-month performance reveals a dip of 17.96%, suggesting a pullback during a longer-term view. This behavior reflects bursts of recent momentum alongside ongoing long-term pressure. The price has fluctuated within a defined range between $5.73 and $8.61, revealing a market responsive to short-term events while being influenced by broader trends. Currently, Uniswap is trading within a key zone, with $4.32 identified as a crucial support level and $10.08 as its nearest resistance target. A secondary resistance at $12.96 and an additional support at $1.448 create broader bounds for price movements. Technical indicators show a slight bullish tilt, with the Relative Strength Index at 61.34, while the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum indicators remain positive. Traders may want to buy near support levels, targeting the primary resistance, and watch for a potential breakout above $10 for further gains. Caution is advised if prices approach $4.32. Hyperliquid Analysis: 6-Month Surge & Recent Short-Term Correction Over the last month, HYPE recorded an approximate gain of 10.23%, while over the past six months, it surged nearly 78.47%. A one-week drop of about 9.22% is part of its volatile behavior, reflecting a mix of strong long-term momentum and recent short-term pullbacks. The price history illustrates an upward trend over half a year with notable rallies, despite the recent weekly correction. Data shows that HYPE has experienced significant growth over a longer period, even while trading within a fluctuating short-term range. HYPE is currently trading between roughly $31.70 and $46.60, with a key resistance level around $53.65 and support at $23.85. A secondary resistance near $68.55 exists, along with further support close to $8.95. The oscillators indicate a mixed market; the awesome oscillator at 2.415 offers some bullish hints, but the momentum indicator at -6.454 and an RSI of 45.97 maintain modest pressure. Neither bulls nor bears dominate as the market settles into cautious equilibrium. Traders may test the support at $23.85 for buy opportunities while monitoring for a break above $53.65 to signal further rally potential. Conclusion UNI shows strong potential due to its established position in decentralized finance. Its ongoing developments and upgrades are promising. HYPE is newer and could offer higher rewards, but it comes with the risks associated with new ventures. For investors willing to take risks, HYPE might be the choice. Conversely, those preferring a safer investment may lean towards UNI. Both have the potential for significant gains by 2025. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, recently shed light on how institutional adoption is accelerating, and software developer Vincent Van Code believes XRP stands to benefit the most. His remarks come in response to a video shared by Ripple, where Garlinghouse explains how prime brokerage is unlocking trillions in institutional trade volume for crypto and DeFi. Prime Brokerage: The Bridge Between TradFi and DeFi In the Ripple video titled “Crypto in One Minute,” Garlinghouse explains that prime brokers are evolving from traditional banking strongholds into modern gateways for digital assets. Historically, major banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs controlled derivative clearing. Now, fintech firms like Hidden Road, recently acquired by Ripple, are challenging them with digital-native solutions Multi trillion dollars markets are coming to XRP and crypto.

The inclusion of digital assets into this flow, backed by a strong balance sheet, allows institutions to engage with crypto markets through trusted, regulated channels. Vincent Van Code: XRP Is Positioned to Capture Trillions Reacting to the video, Vincent Van Code posted that multi-trillion-dollar markets are finally coming to XRP and crypto. He emphasized that the perception of crypto has shifted. Once seen as a hedge or a threat to Fiat, it’s now being recognized as vital technology, compliant, legal, and ready to support institutional scale. He credits Ripple and its years of foundational work as key to XRP’s current position. The XRP Ledger (XRPL), with its low fees, scalability, and regulatory alignment, has quietly become a top-tier infrastructure layer for DeFi. Van Code believes it has already carved out a significant market share, not by fighting the system, but by helping transform it from the inside. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Price Update: Consolidation with Bullish Undercurrents As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.05, slightly down from its recent local high of $3.60. The asset remains technically bullish, holding support above the 21-day EMA and 33-day SMA, both pointing upward. This suggests that the pullback is more likely a consolidation than a reversal. With ongoing developments around Ripple’s institutional partnerships and regulatory progress, many analysts believe XRP is laying the groundwork for a more sustained upward move, especially as financial institutions begin to allocate more capital toward regulated crypto assets. XRP’s Institutional Era Has Begun The convergence of traditional finance and DeFi is no longer a theory; it’s unfolding now. Prime brokers like Hidden Road are reshaping how institutions engage with digital assets, and XRP is positioned at the center of that transition. As Vincent Van Code observed, crypto is no longer about resistance; it’s about integration. And in that reality, XRP isn’t just participating; it’s leading.

Today, traders hunt for the next Pepe Coin among under‑the‑radar picks: Neiro, Bertram The Pomeranian and Remittix. Each brings its own catalyst, from speculative sparks to real‑world payment rails. Here’s how these three could capture the 10,000× factor that once made Pepe Coin a household name. Neiro’s Speculative Spark Neiro’s tiny price and massive supply mirror early Pepe Coin vibes. On July 24, Neiro traded at $0.000449, down from $0.000565 three days prior, showing a 20 % pullback and clearing weaker hands. That dip coincided with a drop in market cap to $461,800 and a 24‑hour volume of $871,000—conditions ripe for a short squeeze. Traders eye Neiro’s next move toward $0.001, a target above its 2025 predicted average of $0.001078, implying a 140 % rally in under 48 hours. If Neiro can sustain its low‑fee, high‑volume model and spark social‑media frenzy like Pepe Coin did, a 10,000× move remains within the realm of wild possibilities. Bertram The Pomeranian’s Community Push Bertram The Pomeranian channels meme‑coin energy through an actual canine persona. BERT commands a market cap of $44.7 million and has climbed 24% over the last week, outperforming major altcoins as traders chase feel‑good stories. Its 24‑hour volume of nearly $2.42 million confirms active trading, while daily active wallets climbed as holders anticipate utility rollouts. Should BERT ignite a similar social‑media loop, the token’s price could multiply by 10× or more, edging closer to Pepe Coin‑style returns. Remittix’s PayFi Proposition Remittix shifts the meme narrative to practical use, funding its token sale with $17.2 million raised at $0.0842 each and 567 million RTX committed so far. Its cross‑border payment protocol pilots live remittance corridors that settle in under two minutes, while a CertiK audit underscores security. A live 50 % bonus tier and $250,000 giveaway drive rapid community growth and on‑chain engagement Remittix’s real‑world edge stands out with: Merchant Integrations: Live partnerships in West African retail POS networks Developer Toolkit: SDK release enabling custom PayFi dApps on Solana and EVM chains Community‑Governed Burns: Quarterly token‑burn votes trimming supply after each funding milestone Staking Rewards: Up to 10 % APY when RTX staking goes live Regulatory Progress: License applications filed in Brazil and Kenya for compliant remittance services Those features target a $190 trillion payment‑flow sector, giving Remittix a use‑case runway that could justify 1,000× growth before venturing toward Pepe Coin‑level returns. Final Thoughts on 10,000× Dreams Pepe Coin proved that meme‑driven narratives can create unprecedented gains. Neiro’s micro‑price and speculative volume, Bertram The Pomeranian’s viral community and real‑world charity tie‑ins, and Remittix’s payment‑focused infrastructure each offer paths to multibagger outcomes. If one of these picks ignites the next social frenzy—mirroring Pepe Coin’s fever—10,000× is no longer fantasy but a tangible target. Watch for volume surges, social‑media mentions and product milestones; they’ll signal which token captures the market’s imagination next.

The price briefly dipped near the $115,000 support level but has already begun to recover, signaling that bullish momentum remains intact despite recent selling pressure. Market participants appear to be reacting calmly, with strong demand quickly absorbing the dip. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pullback Remains Within Normal Volatility Range: Drawdown Analysis Shows No Signs Of Panic According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, today’s price movement coincides with a significant increase in open interest across major exchanges. Binance, Bybit, and Gate all recorded sharp spikes in open interest within the last 24 hours, suggesting that traders are positioning aggressively. Notably, these exchanges were among the recipients of large Bitcoin transfers earlier in the day, likely tied to institutional or whale activity. This alignment of price recovery and rising open interest hints at a shift in sentiment. Short-term traders are re-entering the market, while bulls appear ready to defend key levels. As volatility picks up, Bitcoin’s ability to hold and reclaim recent support will determine whether it resumes its upward march or remains range-bound. The coming days could be critical for setting the tone of the next leg in Bitcoin’s price action. Rising Open Interest Signals Growing Volatility According to Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s head of research, over the last 24 hours, open interest surged by approximately $4 billion, indicating that leveraged positions—particularly shorts—have entered the market in large numbers. This spike coincided with significant Bitcoin transfers to major exchanges like Binance and Bybit, which received a substantial portion of today’s large-volume transactions. These developments suggest increased speculative activity as traders anticipate further price movement. The inflow of coins to exchanges, combined with rising open interest, typically signals upcoming volatility. Short sellers appear to be betting on continued downside, but with Bitcoin already recovering from its recent $115,000 dip, this could lead to a short squeeze if momentum shifts back in favor of the bulls. This market shift comes as Ethereum and altcoins show notable strength. Since May, Ethereum has consistently outperformed Bitcoin, aided by institutional accumulation and clearer regulatory signals in the US. As ETH leads the altcoin rally, investors are watching closely to see whether capital rotation from BTC into altcoins continues. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Accumulate Over $4.1B In ETH In Two Weeks – Details Bitcoin Holds Key Support After Minor Pullback The daily Bitcoin chart shows that BTC remains in a bullish structure despite recent volatility. After briefly consolidating near the $122,000 resistance zone and reaching an all-time high just above that level, the price retraced toward the $115,700–$117,000 support band. This zone, marked by the horizontal yellow range, also aligns closely with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $117,593.23, reinforcing its role as a strong technical support. The overall uptrend that started in early May remains intact, with higher highs and higher lows clearly visible on the chart. Notably, BTC continues to trade well above the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) SMAs, which sit at $112,547.95 and $109,436.38, respectively. These levels serve as deeper support zones if selling pressure intensifies. Volume has increased slightly on red candles, indicating some sell pressure, but there is no sign of panic. As long as BTC holds above the $115,700 level, bulls maintain the advantage. A breakout above $122,000 would signal trend continuation and could open the path to new highs.

The core network fundamentals point to sustained growth potential. Read the full report to learn more about TRON’s key updates and achievements. Key Takeaways TRON saw strong onchain performance in H1 2025, with transaction volume, active addresses, and revenue reaching near-record levels. USDT supply on TRON surged 41% to 81.2B, reinforcing the network’s dominance in stablecoin infrastructure. TRON ranked among the top blockchains in user activity and revenue, outpacing many Layer-1 competitors. New integrations and high-profile Super Representatives signaled rising institutional interest and long-term confidence in the network. TRON’s H1 2025 in Rewind In the first half of 2025 Kiln, Nansen, P2P.org, and Kraken joined the TRON network as Super Representatives , expanding and strengthening its validator base. These additions bring institutional credibility and technical expertise, reflecting growing confidence in TRON’s ecosystem. Their involvement enhances decentralization and reinforces the network’s governance and resilience. In June 2025, a new stablecoin USD1 launched on the TRON network, introduced by World Liberty Financial . Its presence adds to TRON’s growing roster of stablecoins and, if embraced more widely in the future, could bolster the network’s reputation as a hub for stablecoin activity. TRON’s integrations with platforms like AEON Pay, Bridge.xyz, Chainlink, MoonPay, Plume, Turnkey, and Rumble in the first half of 2025 reflected steady ecosystem expansion and growing developer interest. These partnerships span infrastructure, payments, data, and user onboarding, which improves TRON’s utility across key areas of Web3. This ecosystem expansion, combined with strong onchain momentum, contributed to a notable rise in the market cap of TRX , the native utility token of the TRON network. Since the start of 2025, TRX’s market cap has climbed by 33.8%, fueled largely by price appreciation and continued token burns that have reduced supply and supported upward pressure. TRON On-chain Metrics Show Sustained Growth and Rising User Activity TRON’s network utilization continued its upward trend in Q2 2025, reflecting growing demand and consistent user engagement. The quarter recorded over 784M transactions, making it the second-highest in the network’s history, just behind the peak in Q1 2023. This sustained growth in activity highlights the strength of TRON’s onchain ecosystem and its ability to attract and retain transaction volume at scale. Quarterly Transactions on TRON TRON ranked among the top five blockchain networks by transaction volume in H1 2025. While ICP and Solana led the chart by a wide margin, TRON held a solid position ahead of major competitors like BNB Chain, Near, and Sui. TRON’s quarterly revenue continued to climb in H1 2025, reflecting both rising on-chain activity and sustained ecosystem growth. After a steady uptrend throughout 2024, revenue accelerated sharply over the past two quarters, reaching almost $1 billion in Q2 2025. This marks the network’s highest revenue to date. Quarterly Revenue on TRON Moreover, TRON led all blockchain networks in burning revenue during H1 2025, outperforming Ethereum and Solana by a wide margin. With almost $319M in burning revenue in H1, TRON secured the top spot ahead of traditionally dominant platforms, reflecting its high transaction volume and efficient value capture. This strong financial performance highlights TRON’s growing role not just as a high-usage network, but as one of the top-earning blockchain. Monthly active addresses on TRON remained consistently strong throughout H1 2025, showing a clear rebound from mid-2024 levels. After a period of slight fluctuation, user activity picked up steadily in early 2025, culminating in the highest monthly count in over a year by May. This uptick likely comes from an increased usage of stablecoins on TRON. Monthly Active Addresses on TRON TRON ranked third among all blockchains in average daily active addresses during H1 2025, trailing only Solana and Near. With a significantly higher count than BNB Chain, Base, and Aptos, TRON maintained a strong position in user activity despite fierce competition. This ranking underscores the network’s ability to retain a large and engaged user base, reinforcing its relevance in the broader Layer 1 landscape. Stablecoin Growth on TRON Signals Rising Network Utility TRON solidified its lead as the primary network for USDT in H1 2025, driven by accelerating demand and growing utility. The supply of USDT on TRON reached 81.2 billion by the end of the half, marking a 41% increase since 2024. This surge reflects both rising demand for stablecoins and TRON’s dominance as a preferred settlement layer for USDT transfers. The rapid growth reinforces TRON’s position as the leading network for Tether issuance, well ahead of competitors in both volume and adoption. USDT Supply on TRON TRON remained one of the leading blockchains in stablecoin activity during H1 2025, ranking third in total transfer volume behind only Base and Ethereum, where activity is primarily driven by other stablecoins. Despite intense competition from newer and faster-growing chains, TRON outpaced Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Its consistent performance in this metric highlights the platform’s deep integration into global crypto payments and remittance flows. TVL Slides as TRON’s DeFi Sector Navigates a Reset for a Potential Rebound Since the start of 2025, TRON’s DeFi ecosystem has faced headwinds, with USD-denominated TVL falling by 33%, from nearly $7.5B to $5B. This decline not only reflects broader market volatility but also led to TRON losing its spot as the third-largest blockchain by TVL. The launch of USDD 2.0 in January 2025 marks a strategic step toward reinvigorating TRON’s DeFi ecosystem. Unlike its predecessor, which was managed by the TRON DAO Reserve, the updated stablecoin is now fully governed by decentralized smart contracts. Users can mint USDD directly by depositing TRX and USDT, with no centralized custodian involved. This shift not only enhances transparency but also reduces the risk of centralized control or asset freezes. With migration to the new system now underway, USDD 2.0 could help restore confidence in TRON-native DeFi and serve as a foundation for future protocol growth. TRON currently ranks fifth among all blockchains by total value locked, holding 1.95% of the global TVL. This marks a drop of a few positions compared to earlier in the year, reflecting the impact of recent capital outflows and heightened competition. While Ethereum continues to dominate with 66.2%, and chains like Solana and BNB Chain maintain strong positions, TRON’s share remains notable, indicating it is still a relevant player in the DeFi landscape despite recent declines. The Bottom Line TRON’s performance in H1 2025 demonstrated the network’s continued strength as a high-throughput, revenue-generating blockchain with a deeply integrated role in global stablecoin infrastructure. Key metrics such as transaction volume, number of active addresses, and protocol revenue all trended positively, placing TRON among the top-performing chains. Consistent USDT growth further underscored its appeal to both users and institutional partners. However, challenges remain. TRON’s decline in TVL and its slip in DeFi rankings highlight areas where the network could deepen its competitive positioning, particularly in attracting more capital-intensive applications and developers. Strengthening its DeFi ecosystem and increasing cross-chain composability will be critical to long-term resilience. Looking ahead, TRON’s dominant position in the stablecoin economy, especially as the leading network for USDT, could be a major catalyst for future growth. If the US moves toward regulatory clarity or approval of frameworks like the GENIUS Act, demand for stablecoins could surge. In that scenario, TRON is well positioned to capture a significant share of new user flows, cementing its role as a foundational layer for digital dollar transactions worldwide.

In documents filed with the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York, Davis admitted that the token, called LIBRA, was merely a memecoin and not an investment instrument. This admission was interpreted as a shift in strategy ahead of an August 19 hearing that will determine the fate of the $280 million in frozen assets. Another striking detail of the scandal occurred during a meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei at Casa Rosada on January 30. It was determined that approximately $500,000 in USDC was transferred from wallets associated with Davis to the Kraken exchange. The case in question came to the fore after the LIBRA token's sudden price surged and crashed during its launch. The token is among the projects Javier Milei has indirectly supported on social media. However, the token's rapid rise and fall in value within just a few hours caused losses for many investors. Price chart of the altcoin, which once had a market capitalization of over $200 million. Related News: US President Donald Trump Sends Mixed Signals About the Economy - His Latest Statements Here In addition to Hayden Davis, the lawsuit also names Meteora platform co-founder Benjamin Chow and Kip Protocol executive Julian Peh as defendants. The lawsuit was initiated by individual investor Omar Hurlock. Hurlock's lawyers last week requested the initiation of a “discovery” process to force the defendants to provide detailed information about the incident, but Judge Jennifer L. Rochon denied the request. Things escalated further last Thursday with a counter-attack from Davis. In a 30-page defense filing obtained by Clarín, Davis argued that Hurlock's allegations were baseless and that Hurlock hadn't presented any concrete evidence of harm. Davis's lawyers stated, “The plaintiff can't even prove he's a direct victim. He's attempting to file a class-action lawsuit without demonstrating his own damages.” *This is not investment advice.

Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $12.36 $30.91 $49.46 Avalanche Price Target July 2025 The price prediction for Avalanche (AVAX) in July 2025 suggests that bulls have regained control and moved past short-term EMA hurdles, and AVAX recently retested the $26.50 resistance level, but rejected with a market-wide sell-off. However, the AVAX market is picking up again. If momentum continues, then AVAX could spike again to retest the $26.50. In a more optimistic scenario, prices could even reach $33.06 during July, only if momentum remains strong. However, if momentum doesn’t sustain above $26.50, then momentum could rise for a brief time, and AVAX might retreat to $20 or $15 support in that upcoming short-term scenario. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) AVAX Price Target July 2025 15.00 26.50 33.06 AVAX Price Prediction 2025 Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining traction among developers, thanks to its high throughput and low fees, making it an attractive platform for gaming applications. Looking ahead, there’s a promising outlook for the AVAX price in 2025. A Bloomberg ETF analyst recently suggested that an AVAX ETF could receive approval by the end of the year, with a 90% chance of success. This potential approval could significantly boost adoption and drive prices higher. Meanwhile, a look at its daily technical chart reveals that after a challenging Q1 2025, where AVAX dropped to $14.65, the price showed some resilience with recovery displayed in Q2, climbing to $26.50 by mid-May. However, by the end of Q2, it retreated to around $16, facing strong resistance from the 200-day EMA band. Interestingly, the $15-$16 support area has been tested three times in Q2, indicating that bearish pressure is weakening at this level. Even from late June to July, AVAX has retested the $26.50 resistance level following bullish altcoin sentiment. The past couple of months have turned out to be a rectangular box range, and in this range, the AVAX price action has displayed a phenomenal triple bottom pattern The AVAX is on the brink of forming a golden cross between the 200-day and 50-day for a sustained uptrend. The bullish cross between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs is expanding upwards, signifying the bullish strength rising. This pattern, along with good technicals and fundamentals, is increasing investors’ hopes for H2 to be better than H1. Therefore, if bulls continue the ongoing July’s bullish momentum, then knocking the $26.50 would be the resistance that would mark a Change of Character (ChoCh) to AVAX’s current bearish trend. In the final days of July, a short-term rally could push AVAX back to the $26.50 resistance by July 2025. But a bullish scenario could send AVAX to $33.06 by August. For the long term, a price target of $50 is feasible, provided that AVAX maintains above $26.50 and closes daily above this level. Achieving this would signal a shift in trend, breaking the bearish pattern and indicating a Change of Character (ChoCh) followed by an upward Break of Structure (BoS). However, this bullish outlook could be overturned if a strong bearish activity stops $26.50 breach, then AVAX will have no choice but to retreat back to $15 demand area.

The market’s next decisive move will likely be shaped by reactions at the $114,000 and $111,000 support zones. BTC Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin continues to consolidate within the narrow $116K–$120K range, marked by low volatility and subdued price action. This sideways movement suggests an ongoing equilibrium between buying and selling pressure, possibly due to capital rotation into the altcoin markets. A key concern is the emergence of a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, indicating a fading of bullish momentum. This divergence increases the likelihood of renewed selling pressure and suggests a possible continuation of the correction phase. If so, a move toward the $111,000 support level becomes probable. Despite this, the broader market structure remains bullish as long as the $111,000 level holds. If this price point acts as a reliable demand zone, an eventual breakout above $120K could resume the larger uptrend. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, BTC is forming a bullish flag pattern, a classic consolidation formation within an uptrend. The price has consistently printed higher highs and higher lows, supported by an ascending trendline acting as dynamic support, currently near the $114K level. As long as this trendline remains intact, the market is likely to continue consolidating inside the flag, which aligns with a healthy correction. However, a breakdown below this ascending support would likely trigger a sharper pullback toward $111K, forming a key liquidity zone. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan The latest futures order flow shows a noticeable surge in small-sized positions, a strong indication that retail traders are actively participating in the current price range. This spike reveals a high level of retail engagement, especially within the $116K–$120K consolidation zone. Interestingly, large-scale sell-side activity (represented by green circles), typically associated with institutions or whales, is not present. These major players are not offloading their positions, suggesting that they remain confident in the ongoing bullish trend and do not expect a major reversal just yet. This setup, with retail activity high and smart money quiet, has historically preceded major bullish moves. While the market may seem stagnant, this phase often serves as a cooling-off period before another leg of the upward trend. The lack of panic from whales adds weight to the theory that this is a healthy consolidation, not a trend reversal.

According to Pompliano’s show, James made that comment after filing a federal lawsuit on Thursday morning in Washington D.C., demanding that the Fed stop holding its FOMC meetings behind closed doors. He’s challenging the Fed under the Government in the Sunshine Act of 1976 and wants next week’s meeting livestreamed for public access. The judge assigned to the case, Barl Howard, appointed by Barack Obama, granted an emergency hearing set for Monday, just a day before the FOMC is scheduled to begin its two-day session. The lawsuit, Azoria v. Powell , calls for a Temporary Restraining Order that would block Tuesday’s meeting unless the Fed opens it to the public. “They’re violating federal law and operating in secrecy,” James said. “We want the American people to see and hear how these decisions are made, because they’re paying the price for them.” James added that the law clearly states any federal body with a multi-member decision-making committee must conduct its business in public. That includes the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates eight times per year and affects everything from mortgages to credit cards. Fishback challenges Fed’s legal defense and secrecy During the interview, James dismantled the Fed’s legal argument that the Sunshine Act doesn’t apply to the FOMC because it’s just a “subdivision” of the central bank. “They admit the Fed is covered by the law,” he said. “So how can the most powerful part of the institution, the one that sets rates, not be covered too?” He called it a “fake carve-out” designed to avoid transparency. James also rejected the Fed’s claim that public meetings would trigger financial speculation. “You can’t hide every meeting for 50 years using the same excuse. That’s not a legal exemption, that’s a loophole.” James said that if speculation was the concern, Powell wouldn’t give interviews or release minutes. “In January 2022, Powell told reporters there wouldn’t be a rate hike in the next meeting. If that’s not fueling speculation, I don’t know what is. Most TTROs get tossed without a hearing. The fact that Judge Howard wants to hear from Powell’s lawyers on Monday is a big deal.” Lawsuit could change how rate decisions are analyzed James warned that the market isn’t ready. “Wall Street’s still asleep. They don’t think this will happen. They have no idea what’s coming.” If the judge grants the restraining order, James believes the Fed will delay the meeting by a few hours and announce a livestream. “They’ll have no choice. It’s a really bad look to defy a federal judge on transparency.” He also slammed the ongoing renovation of the Fed’s building in D.C. as “unnecessary and taxpayer-funded.” He said those same taxpayers should be able to see what’s going on inside. “The people paying for this have no idea what’s happening. That’s the problem.” James said that if the livestream happens, it will completely change how the markets react. “Right now, everyone waits for the press conference on Wednesday. They guess based on Powell’s tie color, how long he talks, what words he uses.” He said with public access, the volatility will shift to Tuesday, when viewers can watch the decision-making live. “We’ll see who speaks up. Who objects. Who brings the real data and who’s just phoning it in.” He expects to see clear political bias from some committee members and said the livestream would expose it. “You won’t hear someone say, ‘Trump said this so I’ll do that.’ But you will see subtle bias in how they respond to inflation or tariffs. And that’s what we need to see.” James also mentioned that Governor Chris Waller is expected to dissent at the meeting. “Usually, you’d just see his name at the bottom of the statement. But if this is public, we’ll hear why he dissents and who pushes back against him.” He said seeing that back-and-forth in real time would be the most important shift in how the Fed is understood. “Right now, it’s a black box. We’re flying blind.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

According to a post on the social media platform X, India’s Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) says it seized 28 kilograms of gold paste – worth roughly $3.34 million at current prices – after they got off their plane from Dubai. The CISF said the gold paste was “ingeniously” concealed on their bodies, and that the seizure sets a new benchmark for pro-active surveillance and profiling. Gold smugglers will often turn their gold into a paste containing non-metallic substances like resin or glue in order to avoid setting off metal detectors which would otherwise easily spot regular coins or bars. The male suspect was reportedly wearing pants, while the female was wearing a salwar suit, a traditional Indian dress. However, security noticed “bulges” around their midsections, drawing suspicion. Speaking to local NDTV , a senior CISF officer said, “The duo, residents of Gujarat, caught the officer’s attention due to their unusual walking pattern and slight bulges around their abdominal area, which did not match the natural body contour… A total of 28 kg of gold paste was found neatly strapped around their midsections and upper torsos – 16 kg on the woman and 12 kg on the man.” Another official investigating the case said the seizure was “likely the biggest gold haul in the history of Surat airport.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Long-term forecasts indicate potential highs of $5.65 by 2030. Algorand’s strong push for scalability, security, and decentralization is paying off. With the launch of AlgoKit 3.0 in Q1 2025 and growing developer interest, ALGO adoption has improved and is now on the rise. The rising adoption is beneficial for an asset, as it is directly proportional to a token’s price. But the big question for intrigued market participants still remains: Can ALGO Price hit $1 this cycle? Read our in-depth Algorand Price Prediction 2025 and long-term outlook through 2030 to find out.

With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.45 $0.67 $0.89 Algorand Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In Q4 2024, Algorand (ALGO) experienced a significant drive, reaching a high of $0.613, marking a remarkable 470% gain from the $0.1079 level. However, the excitement was short-lived as a sell-off intensified in the final month of 2024, extending that into Q1 2025. By the first week of April, ALGO’s price plummeted to a low of $0.1491, which established a strong multi-year support area. From the second week of April, the price action began to shift, forming a higher-high structure that indicated a recovery from the multi-year support level. By mid-May, Algorand’s price had climbed nearly 70% to $0.24 from the Q2 low of $0.150. Unfortunately, this upward momentum was halted in mid-May as strong supply levels rejected further advances, pushing the price below the 200-day EMA band. In the third week of June, ALGO returned to April’s low, finding support at the $0.15 level. At this point, the price was down 71% from Q4 2024’s high and 32% from mid-May’s peak. The risks were high, with indications that any short-term bearish pressure could lead to a drop to the 2024 low of $0.0943, breaching the $0.15 support. However, everything changed last week in June, which was also the finishing week for H1. The momentum in H2 began with the blast. Algo Price Target July 2025 For Algorand, the demand surged in the last week of June with bulls reviving at the price of $0.15, driven by high demand, breaking through the multi-month resistance trendline. By mid-July, ALGO had surpassed mid-May’s high after breaking the 200-day EMA band. Also, the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands formed a golden cross, signaling continued bullish demand in the short term. From late June to July 18th, ALGO price surged to $0.34, recording a remarkable 110% gain, largely fueled by the overall bullish stance in the crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $123,231. But, BTC went into consolidation, and the altcoin sector faced profit booking that resulted in AVAX pullback to $0.26, which aligns with multi-month resistance that turned into crucial support now. As July is about to conclude, if the $0.26-$0.27 level maintains strong demand, ALGO may aim for a retest of the $0.34 mark by the end of the month, and if it flips $0.34, then in August $ a 0.50 retest could be imminent. But losing the grip at $0.26-$0.27 could drop ALGO to $0.21. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast July 2025 0.18 0.30 0.34 ALGO Price Analysis 2025 (H2) Looking ahead to the remaining second half of 2025, if demand increases in direct proportion to adoption at an unprecedented rate, ALGO could clear significant targets such as the $0.60, $0.80 mark, and potentially reach $0.90 by year-end. While these targets may seem ambitious compared to its current price on the daily chart, a broader view of the monthly chart data reveals that the last three years have been characterized by a range-bound sideways movement, contrasting sharply with the high-strength parabolic growth seen in 2021. This perspective suggests that with the right momentum, ALGO could indeed achieve these higher price levels.

She also accuses Trump of promoting financial instability. The senator compared the adoption of stablecoin regulation to the conditions that led to the 2008 crisis. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized the recently passed GENIUS Act, which creates a legal framework for stablecoins, accusing the crypto industry of writing the law for itself and warning of a threat to US financial stability, according to her interview with Vanity Fair . “When Washington runs on industry, only a handful of people get rich, and the rest of the American people pay the price,” Warren said. The GENIUS Act, signed by US President Donald Trump, sets the rules for the issuance and trading of stablecoins, which has already attracted interest from banks and large retailers. While Warren acknowledged the need for cryptocurrency regulation, she was blunt about how it should proceed: “If we're going to have a large-scale regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, we need to do it right. It’s a mistake to pit laws written by the industry against themselves.” The senator compared the GENIUS Act to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which she believes contributed to the 2008 financial crisis due to the lack of proper regulation of over-the-counter derivatives: “We've seen this movie before: When an industry writes laws to suit itself, it ends in disaster.” According to Warren and economist Sergi Basco from the University of Barcelona, the law creates a false impression of the security of stablecoins: “If people see ‘reputable companies’ issuing stablecoins, they may assume that all such coins are equally reliable,” Basco explained . However, lack of oversight for issuers could lead to bank runs, even if coins are nominally backed by US government bonds: “Even safe assets don't guarantee that we'll avoid collapse—as the Silicon Valley Bank example showed,” he added. Warren has also repeatedly criticized Trump’s personal interest in cryptocurrencies. According to her, the president “turned the White House into a crypto ATM”: “Trump launched a memecoin and a stablecoin that have already made him hundreds of millions. He eliminated the Justice Department’s crypto-crime unit and ordered the SEC to deregulate the industry,” she said. It should be noted that the launch of the Trump memecoin based on Solana took place on January 18, 2025. In addition, in June, the World Liberty Financial platform conducted a distribution of USD1 stablecoins for WLFI token holders. The senator noted the crypto industry is spending record amounts on lobbying, comparing it to the periods of heaviest banking pressure on Congress: “This is a city where money talks. But the way the industry has pushed this legislation is beyond anything we've seen before,” Warren said.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING|COMMODITY|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-26 16:51:09

Litecoin (LTC) also shows major movement with a 20% surge and potential for more growth, now eyeing the $147 mark. But all attention is shifting toward BlockDAG (BDAG) . The recent launch of its X1 mobile app paired with the powerful X10 miner has caught huge attention. This setup delivers up to 10x more mining output straight from a smartphone. The response to this launch has been massive. BlockDAG has already raised $353 million and sold 24.4 billion coins. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release offering a special $0.0016 price until August 11, and a confirmed listing at $0.05, there’s a chance for 3,025% ROI. It’s shaping up as one of the top long term cryptos today. Avalanche Price Forecast Points Toward $35 Growth Target Avalanche (AVAX) is drawing strong attention with hopes of an ETF approval expected by July 28. Though still unconfirmed, the buzz is building. This comes as AVAX crosses its $25.5 resistance level and flips it into a support base. It has also climbed above the 200-day moving average, which has historically led to sharp rallies. Adding to the momentum, AVAX has hit new highs in open interest, pointing to a rise in trading activity. With technical support growing, the price outlook now sets a target between $32 and $35. If this trend holds, short sellers may face liquidations, pushing the price even higher. The $27 to $28 range is where more activity is expected, making it a key zone to watch. Avalanche’s overall setup looks strong, and if the price prediction proves right, more growth could come soon. Litecoin Price Movement Suggests Bullish Chart Toward $147 Litecoin (LTC) is showing a strong recovery. After staying below $100 for a while, LTC jumped over 20% and now trades close to $116. This move helped it break several important resistance zones, attracting interest from across the trading community. The Bull-Bear Power indicator also surged past 22.5, a sign that buyers are gaining strength. However, there’s pressure from both sides. If LTC falls under $116, over $33 million in long positions are at risk, possibly causing a drop. On the other side, short positions worth $19 million could get liquidated if prices rise further, helping fuel upward movement. Along with this, $5 million worth of LTC has moved off exchanges, showing that many holders are not planning to sell. If these trends hold up, the Litecoin (LTC) price chart could soon aim for a breakout above $147. BlockDAG Demo Launch Unlocks 10x Power With $353M Raised BlockDAG has officially launched its much-awaited demo for the X1 app along with the X10 mining device. This release is already creating massive buzz. The X1 app, now used by over 2 million people, allows users to mine up to 20 BDAG coins daily from their smartphones, no mining background required. But the highlight is the new X10 device. When paired with the X1 app, mining output increases 10 times, reaching up to 200 BDAG daily. This portable, Bluetooth-enabled hardware works seamlessly with the app and makes the setup extremely beginner-friendly. This smooth plug-and-play system is changing the way mining is done, easy, mobile, and powerful. The timing of this release is perfect. BlockDAG has raised $353 million in its ongoing presale and has sold over 24.4 billion coins so far. Those who joined in Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% gain, based on the current Batch 29 price of $0.0276. However, during the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, buyers can get BDAG for just $0.0016 until August 11. With the confirmed launch price set at $0.05, this creates a possible 3,025% return. With the demo live and excitement growing, BlockDAG’s combination of easy mining, high returns, and powerful features is turning it into the most talked-about long term crypto on the market. Final Verdict Avalanche (AVAX) may reach $35 if its positive momentum continues, and Litecoin (LTC) is getting close to a major $147 breakout. Both coins are gaining traction among traders and showing solid performance. Still, it’s BlockDAG that stands out. The newly launched X1 app and X10 demo are drawing massive attention. This 10x mining setup is both powerful and beginner-friendly. The limited-time GLOBAL LAUNCH release price of $0.0016 gives a rare chance to benefit from a 3,025% potential return, based on the confirmed $0.05 listing. With $353 million raised and 24.4 billion coins already sold, BlockDAG has built strong momentum. Among the top picks in the market, BlockDAG is not just gaining popularity; it’s proving to be the best long term crypto choice in the current space.

In a recent post on X, he encouraged holders to ignore short-term volatility and enjoy life, predicting that XRP’s current price range won’t last much longer. According to him, the noise of daily market dips and social media drama is masking what could be one of the most pivotal breakout moments for XRP in recent memory. XRP Holds Steady as Momentum Builds At present, XRP is trading around $3.04 after a recent high of $3.60 earlier in July. Despite this slight retracement, the asset remains structurally bullish. It continues to trade above key technical levels, including the 21-day exponential moving average, and is forming a series of higher lows, a strong indication that accumulation is underway and sellers are losing control. Go outside and touch some grass 4-8 weeks $XRP price will not be where it is today Ignore the short term dips, corrections and daily X drama Go enjoy life — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) July 25, 2025 XRP’s price action is coiling within a long-standing ascending channel, with each rally pushing closer to the resistance zone between $3.50 and $3.60. A clean breakout from this range could act as the catalyst for the parabolic rally Van Winkle anticipates. Institutional Flows Are Strengthening the Case Ripple’s strategic acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road is beginning to reshape how institutional investors engage with digital assets. With prime brokerage services now extending into crypto, XRP is positioned to benefit from a new wave of regulated capital. Institutions can now trade and clear digital assets alongside traditional financial instruments, a move that introduces trillions of dollars in potential liquidity. This integration of traditional finance infrastructure with digital assets aligns perfectly with Ripple’s long-standing vision. The company’s enterprise-grade solutions, global payment rails, and compliance-first approach continue to attract attention from major players in banking and finance. These developments are not only deepening XRP’s utility but also reinforcing investor confidence. Legal Clarity Fuels Broader Confidence The long-running legal saga between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has reached a turning point. With both parties finalizing penalties and appeals, regulatory clarity for XRP is more concrete than ever. This has removed a major overhang from XRP’s valuation, allowing market participants to assess its value based on adoption, utility, and macroeconomic positioning, not legal uncertainty. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Meanwhile, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, launched in late 2024, continues to gain traction and integrate seamlessly with the XRP Ledger, offering added liquidity and transactional depth across the ecosystem. Countdown to Breakout Ripple Van Winkle’s forecast is grounded in both technical strength and growing institutional momentum. His message is one of patience and perspective: the charts may be calm now, but the pressure is building. As XRP continues to consolidate near its multi-month highs with strong on-chain and off-chain support, the stage appears set for a breakout. With all indicators aligned, the coming weeks could prove decisive. Holders would do well to heed the advice, step away from the noise, and let the market speak.

Liquidity is hunting,and it’s landing here. Social feeds confirm the frenzy. X (Twitter) is flooded with memes. Mention counts are surging. Trading desks are paying attention. Everyone’s watching the same thing: a coin that’s doing everything right, on and off the chart. All indicators point north. Whale accumulation charts are glowing. Order books are stacked. Resistance?

Today, a fresh batch of altcoins is gaining traction, offering not just speculation, but credible utility and infrastructure growth. For those searching for the best altcoins to buy now, this guide lays out the most promising options, starting with a project that’s reviving the early excitement once seen with tokens like Chainlink and Polygon. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Setting New Standards with U.S. Market Penetration BlockDAG isn’t just another presale crypto, it’s a structural shift in how early-stage tokens grow their footprint. What sets it apart isn’t only the tech or tokenomics, but its recent breakthrough into the U.S. market. While most presale projects remain sidelined due to regulatory uncertainty, BlockDAG has secured a strategic partnership that indicates clear confidence in its long-term compliance and expansion in North America. That alone places it in the company of Coinbase-era tokens like Compound and Uniswap that gained massive momentum through early U.S. traction. From a numbers standpoint, BlockDAG is rewriting presale history. With $353 million raised, over 24.4 billion BDAG coins sold, and the current presale in Batch 29 at $0.0276, its performance already rivals the breakout phases of older legacy tokens. What's even more striking is the 2,660% ROI since Batch 1, a leap few altcoins have shown this early. But there’s a twist that adds urgency: BlockDAG is currently offering BDAG at a limited-time price of $0.0016, a massive discount compared to its ongoing batch price. This window gives buyers the rare ability to access early-stage rates with late-stage maturity, making it one of the best altcoins to buy now before the price correction catches up. 2. Stellar (XLM): A Legacy Token Still Delivering on Cross-Border Promises Stellar (XLM) was launched with a mission to improve global payments, particularly for underbanked populations. While newer altcoins tout advanced DeFi tools or AI integrations, XLM continues to focus on doing one thing well: facilitating cheap, fast, and secure cross-border transactions. It gained early credibility by partnering with major financial institutions and continues to evolve with features like smart contracts through its Soroban upgrade. Unlike many older tokens that have faded from relevance, Stellar still finds strong utility in real-world payment corridors, especially in Africa and Southeast Asia. For investors seeking proven track records and consistent use cases, XLM remains one of the best altcoins to buy now, especially as the remittance sector gains renewed interest post-pandemic. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme-Driven but Resilient Dogecoin might have started as a joke, but its staying power in the market is no laughing matter. From social media surges to being accepted by major retailers, DOGE has transformed into a surprisingly usable asset with a strong community backing. Its long-term appeal lies in its simplicity, low transaction fees, and cultural relevance. It remains one of the most transacted coins on certain blockchains and is still supported by influential figures like Elon Musk, giving it unusual visibility for a meme coin. While its supply inflation model keeps some investors cautious, DOGE still qualifies as one of the best altcoins to buy now for those who value liquidity, retail familiarity, and a strong chance of media-driven price swings. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Ecosystem Builder Shiba Inu started as a Dogecoin competitor but has evolved into a broader ecosystem. With the introduction of Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain designed to reduce fees and increase transaction throughput, SHIB is now more than just a meme, it’s becoming a platform. It has integrated NFT marketplaces, staking pools, and token burns that create deflationary pressure on the supply. The project’s effort to expand into DeFi tools and its commitment to reducing gas fees has given it more legitimacy in 2025 than most expected just a few years ago. For those looking to diversify into a high-risk, high-reward coin that’s actively expanding its ecosystem, SHIB remains one of the best altcoins to buy now, especially when combined with speculative trading strategies or staking incentives. Final Thoughts From legacy infrastructure like Stellar to cultural powerhouses like DOGE and SHIB, today’s altcoin market offers a wide mix of maturity, risk, and upside potential. But it’s BlockDAG that stands out not only for what it promises, but for what it has already accomplished during its presale phase. Few tokens, especially this early, have secured large-scale fundraising, U.S. market access, and high ROI within months. For those serious about identifying the best altcoins to buy now, BlockDAG represents both a return to early-stage opportunity and a forward-looking investment into scalable crypto infrastructure. Whether you're building a new portfolio or diversifying a mature one, BlockDAG deserves top consideration, especially while the $0.0016 price window is still open.

The bank and Gemini are in an ongoing dispute over banking data and fintech policies. Cooperation between the entities is currently on hold. Gemini crypto exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss has accused JPMorgan Chase of pausing the process of re-onboarding Gemini as a client due to his public criticism of the bank's policies toward fintech companies. Winklevoss posted his criticism on X (formerly Twitter). Winklevoss sharply criticized JPMorgan’s decision to impose fees on fintech companies to access users' banking data. He said the decision could ”bankrupt fintechs” that enable consumers to connect bank accounts to crypto companies, including Gemini, to buy cryptocurrencies. “Sorry Jamie Dimon [CEO of JPMorgan Chase], we're not going to stay silent. We will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies. We will never stop fighting for what is right! ” Winklevoss wrote. According to the entrepreneur, it was after this message that JPMorgan announced a pause in the process of reconnecting Gemini as a client, which was previously disconnected during the so-called “Operation Choke Point 2.0” — an unofficial campaign during which some American banks stopped working with cryptocurrency companies. In response, JPMorgan told Bloomberg that the new fees were introduced for security reasons to protect client data. “Data intermediaries access customers’ bank accounts through our secure infrastructure, but do not always act responsibly. We receive almost two billion requests every month, and more than 90% of them do not involve actual use of fintech services. The fee structure will allow us to provide data only on direct customer requests,” the bank said in a statement. JPMorgan declined to comment on its specific relationship with Gemini. According to the publication, the relationship between Gemini and JPMorgan has been tense for several years. Even before US cryptocurrency policies improved under the Donald Trump administration, the bank advised Gemini to find another banking partner because the service had become unprofitable. Despite public criticism of cryptocurrencies by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, the bank is actively developing blockchain-based products, journalists noted.",News|Business,EN,0,0,FIAT|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-26 17:07:32

However, this decision has raised questions from legal and financial experts, especially the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawyer Marc Fagel. Marc Fagel Doubts the Wisdom Behind Wellgistics’ XRP Usage According to a post on X , Marc publicly criticized the company’s choice to invest in this cryptocurrency. He noted that WH appears to be in a poor financial state, with low revenue, ongoing losses, and limited assets. Given this situation, Fagel questioned why a financially struggling healthcare company would choose to hold onto the coin, a volatile digital asset. The concerns center on the reason behind the pharmaceutical logistics company’s move. It remains to be seen whether the decision is based on a sound business strategy or if they are simply taking advantage of the crypto trend. Fagel suggested that this choice might put investors at unnecessary risk, especially in a field where financial stability is vital. Crypto Lawyer Views Wellgistics Move Differently Meanwhile, in another post on X , Bill Morgan, a prominent XRP supporter and a lawyer, offered a different view. He suggested that Wellgistics Health might be using XRP to attract investors and raise funds. He pointed out that using XRP for managing company finances is part of a larger trend in which companies are incorporating digital assets into their investments. Morgan pointed out that startups with limited funding can utilize crypto, such as XRP, as a unique selling point and a smart financial treasury strategy. It is worth noting that Wellgistics Health’s use of XRPL is getting attention, but opinions are mixed. Generally, the Ripple ecosystem has been expanding through new partnerships, exchange-traded fund (ETF) speculation, and growing institutional demand . XRP Treasuries Near $1B as Institutions Embrace Crypto A growing number of public companies are making significant investments in XRP, bringing total corporate commitments close to $1 billion . Notably, this trend indicates an increasing interest in incorporating blockchain-based assets into corporate financial strategies. On June 12, Singapore-based Web3 company Trident Digital announced its plan to raise $500 million to establish a corporate treasury based on XRP . Trident plans to earn returns on its XRP holdings by staking and using them within Ripple’s growing ecosystem. Similarly, Wellgistics secured a $50 million credit line for Ripple-related projects. These moves, among others, are forthcoming as the XRP Ledger gains more traction. Likewise, the company’s actions have brought total Ripple treasury commitments to $971 million, just $29 million away from the $1 billion milestone.

After dipping to $2.22 in June, the token is now trading above $4, marking an 80% bounce in just a few weeks. But this isn’t just another chart flash. It’s not hype-driven noise. The fundamentals are telling a much deeper story. Liquidity is flowing in,real liquidity,and the network is finally being treated like the heavyweight it’s becoming. A Massive Wave of Stablecoins Let’s start with the elephant in the room: $92 billion in stablecoin transfers on SUI last month. That’s an all-time high. It’s not just volume,it’s velocity. And more importantly, over $1.2 billion in stablecoin supply is now locked on-chain. SUI has been quietly heating up. Dropped to $2.22 in June, now back above $4, an 80% bounce in weeks. This isn’t just price action. Liquidity is flowing in fast. Last month saw $92B stablecoin transfers on $SUI , all time high. TVL back above $2.19B and $1.2B+ stablecoin… pic.twitter.com/q9bGhmROyh — CryptoNation (@CryptonationN) July 26, 2025 That’s capital sitting inside the ecosystem. It’s not just bouncing through bridges or wash-trading. It’s sticky, real, and building conviction. TVL Snaps Back Above $2.19 Billion SUI’s DeFi layer is coming alive again. Total Value Locked has rebounded sharply after a Q2 cooldown. Lending protocols are attracting deposits. DEXs are seeing volume. On-chain swaps, bridges, and staking platforms are all flashing green. Builders are shipping. Users are deploying. Liquidity is staying. Futures Market Heats Up Derivatives traders are circling. Open interest in SUI futures sits at $2.1 billion. That’s a big bet on price direction,and it’s backed by conviction. Add to that a daily trading volume of $5.7 billion, and you’ve got a network that’s pulling attention from both retail and institutional desks. When price, volume, and futures align,this isn’t retail noise. It’s capital rotation. Market Cap Momentum SUI’s market cap is pushing past $15 billion. That places it among the top 30 crypto assets globally. Just a few months ago, it was struggling to stay in the conversation. Now? It’s demanding attention. Not through loud announcements. But through solid, on-chain traction. Why This SUI Rally Looks Sustainable This isn’t a flash pump. It’s a liquidity-fueled climb backed by strong metrics: Stablecoin flow is real and sticky. TVL is climbing, not crashing. Futures markets show real directional bets. Volume matches interest,this isn’t thin trading. Price action is following fundamentals,not leading them. SUI has transformed from a speculative layer-1 into a real player with deep liquidity and growing adoption. It’s not chasing the narrative. It’s building one. What’s Next? If $4 holds, the momentum could build even faster. Immediate support sits around $3.80. Resistance zones near $4.20 and $5 are the next targets. But that may not matter if inflows continue. This is shaping up as a stealth rally,one backed by on-chain evidence, not influencer shilling. While the market debates Solana vs. Base vs. Avalanche, SUI is stacking volume, growing DeFi, and pulling in serious capital. Ignore the noise. Follow the data. This isn’t narrative-first crypto.

The token is now up 13.1% over the past week, 28.7% in the last 14 days, and 62.3% over the past month, according to CoinDesk data. The move drew renewed attention from crypto traders, with multiple analysts flagging potential for a broader breakout. ""MartyParty"", a well-known investor and commentator, told followers on X that SUI under $5 remains one of the top altcoin opportunities in the market. “Time is running out,” he warned. “It’s not about price—it’s about how many tokens you have.” Other analysts focused on chart signals that suggest a major breakout may be underway. ""Marcus Corvinus"" described the setup as a “breakout zone loading,” noting that SUI’s price is pressing against trendline resistance — a level that has repeatedly capped its recent rallies. He pointed to a technical formation called an AB=CD pattern, which reflects symmetrical price moves. When completed, this pattern often precedes another leg higher. Corvinus said momentum is building quickly and outlined a series of bullish price targets: $5.64 to complete the pattern, $6.70 as an “acceleration zone,” and $8.00 if the rally gains full momentum. “This isn’t just another pump,” he wrote. “It’s the start of SUI’s next explosive leg.” A third analyst, posting under the handle ""CryptoBull_360"", emphasized the importance of a key resistance level that SUI has failed to break through in previous attempts. He suggested a decisive move above that line could open the door to a rally toward $7–$10. The technical case appears to be supported by trading data. According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, SUI saw a clear period of accumulation during the prior day, followed by a high-volume breakout above the $4.00 psychological level. Volume nearly doubled its 24-hour average during the surge, and support levels formed at multiple price points, indicating sustained institutional interest. With analysts pointing to clean chart structures, accelerating momentum, and expanding upside targets, all eyes are now on whether SUI can deliver the breakout candle that traders have been waiting for. Technical Analysis Highlights SUI-USD rose 14% during the 24-hour session from July 25 at 16:00 UTC to July 26 at 15:00 UTC, climbing from $3.67 to $4.18. After 16 hours of consolidation between $3.65 and $4.00, the token broke above the $4.00 psychological resistance around 04:00 UTC. Trading volume spiked to 28.8 million during the 14:00 hour UTC, nearly double the 24-hour average of 14.35 million, confirming strong buying interest. Key short-term support formed at $3.93, $3.98, and $4.02 as prices moved higher. In the final 60 minutes of the session, SUI rose another 2%, jumping from $4.09 to $4.17, with volume peaking near 2.96 million. Resistance was cleared at $4.10, $4.12, and $4.15 before a short consolidation around $4.16–$4.17.

CFTC: The CFTC is collaborating with the SEC and Congress to clarify jurisdiction, especially over digital commodities and derivatives. FinCEN: AML and CFT requirements remain central, with crypto companies classified as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act, subject to strict compliance. FDIC/OCC: The FDIC has eased restrictions on banks’ crypto activities, while the OCC supports banks’ ability to custody digital assets US Crypto Tax 2025 Cryptocurrency in the US is taxed based on how long you hold the asset and your total taxable income. Short-term gains (assets held for one year or less) are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term gains (assets held for more than a year) are taxed at lower capital gains rates. Additionally, income from mining, staking, or receiving crypto as payment is taxed as ordinary income. Short-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held ≤ 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 10% $0–$11,600 $0–$23,200 $0–$11,600 $0–$16,550 12% $11,601–$47,150 $23,201–$94,300 $11,601–$47,150 $16,551–$63,100 22% $47,151–$100,525 $94,301–$201,050 $47,151–$100,525 $63,101–$100,500 24% $100,526–$191,950 $201,051–$383,900 $100,526–$191,950 $100,501–$191,950 32% $191,951–$243,725 $383,901–$487,450 $191,951–$243,725 $191,951–$243,700 37% Over $609,351 Over $731,201 Over $365,601 Over $609,351 Long-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held > 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 0% Up to $47,025 Up to $94,050 Up to $47,025 Up to $63,000 15% $47,026–$518,900 $94,051–$583,750 $47,026–$291,850 $63,001–$551,350 20% Over $518,900 Over $583,750 Over $291,850 Over $551,350 Additional Crypto Tax Rules Income from mining, staking, or payment: Taxed as ordinary income at the above rates. NFTs: Some may be taxed at a higher collectibles rate (up to 28%). Non-taxable events: Transfers between your own wallets and certain gifts are not taxable. Crypto companies: Subject to standard corporate income tax and must comply with reporting and AML/CFT rules. Example If you are single, earn $50,000 in total taxable income, and realize $5,000 short-term crypto gains and $10,000 long-term crypto gains: Short-term gains taxed at 22%: $1,100 Long-term gains taxed at 15%: $1,500 Total crypto tax owed: $2,600 These rates and rules ensure all crypto investors and companies are taxed in line with other property and investment assets in the US Crypto Adoption Rate In America In 2025, about 28% of American adults—around 65 million people—own cryptocurrency. Crypto ownership in the US has nearly doubled since 2021, rising from 15% to 28%. 14% of non-owners plan to buy crypto in 2025, and 67% of current owners plan to buy more this year. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are the top three cryptocurrencies Americans plan to purchase in 2025. Crypto mining in the USA In 2025, the US leads the world in Bitcoin mining , accounting for over one-third of global mining power. On March 20, 2025, the SEC clarified that proof-of-work crypto mining is not subject to federal securities laws, removing registration requirements for miners. There is no federal ban on crypto mining; regulation is handled at the state level, with some states offering incentives and others imposing environmental restrictions. The Trump administration’s deregulatory approach in 2025 has encouraged domestic mining growth, but all miners must still comply with federal AML and CFT rules. Environmental concerns and energy usage debates continue, especially in states considering stricter oversight or moratoriums on mining operations. US Government’s Crypto Holdings As of April 2025, the US government holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoins, valued at about $18.3 billion. The US is the world’s largest state holder of Bitcoin, with these assets primarily acquired through law enforcement seizures and forfeitures. In March 2025, President Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, consolidating all federally held Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP) as permanent reserve assets. Conclusion US crypto regulation in 2025 marks a major turning point. The old approach of punishing innovation is being replaced with clear rules, legal support, and a national strategy for digital assets. While financial crimes are still a concern, the overall direction is bold, business-friendly, and built for long-term crypto adoption. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to Hougan, the impact and importance of the Bitcoin halving falls by half every four years. Additionally, Hougan says there exists a friendlier regulatory environment and institutional investors have embraced Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Per Hougan, these “bigger forces” don’t synchronize with the four-year cycle. “i) The movement of assets into [exchange-traded funds] ETFs is a 5 – 10 year trend. It started in 2024; ii) Broader institutional adoption is just getting started (ETFs still being approved on national account platforms, pensions and endowments just now considering crypto, etc.) iii) Regulatory progress began in earnest in January 2025 and will run for multiple years; iv) Wall Street is just now starting to build on crypto, and will invest billions in the quarters and years to come. This started in earnest with the passage of the GENIUS Act this month.” As a result, the Bitwise CIO says these emerging forces will be more influential in determining the future of Bitcoin and other crypto assets than the four-year cycle going forward. “All this suggests to me that the long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic “four-year cycle” forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to Ripple Van Winkle, citing analysis from EGRAG Crypto, the latest bullish crossover between the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 55-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) could drive XRP to $9 or even $24, if history is any guide. Historical Patterns Show Explosive Potential Looking at past market cycles, the EMA/SMA crossover has proven to be a reliable signal for XRP’s most significant rallies. In March 2017, a bullish crossover between the 21 EMA and 55 SMA marked the beginning of a monumental surge, with XRP climbing approximately 40,000% to reach its all-time high of $3.84. A similar event unfolded in August 2020. While the gains were more modest, XRP still rallied by roughly 750%, signaling the end of that particular cycle. In October 2024, XRP once again witnessed this golden crossover. Since then, the price has already appreciated by around 560%, sparking speculation that a larger move could be underway. #XRP – Insights on 21 EMA and 55 SMA #Bulli Cross ( $9 or $24): Let’s examine what has happened in the past with the 21 EMA and 55 SMA on the weekly timeframe. In March 2017, we witnessed a #bullish crossover, leading to an astonishing 40,000% pump until the cycle top! … pic.twitter.com/Yi5NNFumlS — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 26, 2025 Price Projections: $9 or $24? Based on previous cycles, two main scenarios emerge. If the current pattern repeats just 10% of the 2017 rally, XRP could see a 4,000% gain, pushing its price toward $24 . Alternatively, if the market replicates double the strength of the 2020 cycle, a 1,500% increase could place XRP around the $9 level. EGRAG Crypto emphasizes that the 2020 cycle was one of the weaker ones in terms of overall momentum. If the ongoing cycle proves stronger, especially with the growing institutional focus on XRP’s underlying technology, the higher end of this forecast may not be far-fetched. Technical and Fundamental Forces Align The technical setup isn’t the only factor fueling optimism. Ripple’s continued expansion into global finance, especially in the realms of cross-border payments and stablecoins, is reinforcing XRP’s long-term value proposition. The introduction of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, is expected to enhance liquidity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and solidify XRP’s role in settlement and remittance use cases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further bolstering confidence is the recent mention of XRP by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in a Web3 report, which describes it as a potential medium for wholesale settlement. This kind of institutional validation strengthens the argument that XRP’s real-world utility is finally being recognized on a broader scale. XRP Approaches Critical Moment XRP currently trades above $1.70, facing strong resistance near the $3 level. If bulls can reclaim and hold this level, analysts expect the asset could enter price discovery mode. The confluence of bullish technicals and improving fundamentals sets the stage for what could be one of XRP’s most significant rallies to date. While markets remain unpredictable, the past suggests that when XRP’s 21 EMA crosses above the 55 SMA, explosive growth tends to follow. If history repeats, XRP may be well on its way to achieving $9 or even $24 this cycle. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

As LINKBTC gains momentum and Bitcoin’s dominance trend declines, the setup appears promising. Cryptowzrd noted he will be monitoring the intraday chart closely for the next scalp opportunity, particularly if LINK breaks above the intraday lower high trendline. Bitcoin Dominance Weakens: A Catalyst For Chainlink’s Surge According to Cryptowzrd, both LINK’s daily candle and the LINKBTC pair ended the day on a bullish note. This positive price action is drawing attention to the potential for further upside movement. Cryptowzrd emphasized that continued strength in LINKBTC, especially if fueled by ongoing weakness in Bitcoin Dominance, could help LINK gain significant bullish momentum from its current levels. Related Reading: Chainlink Sees Heavy Accumulation – Whales Add 8M LINK In One Month Looking ahead, the next major resistance target for LINK is set at $20. Cryptowzrd suggested that a firm hold above this level could act as a catalyst for a stronger rally toward higher resistance levels, possibly reaching $30 and beyond. The speed at which this move might unfold was another key point highlighted by Cryptowzrd. He expects that once LINK clears the $20 hurdle, the rally could accelerate rapidly, driven by increased bullish pressure and technical confirmation across multiple timeframes. While the outlook is bullish, Cryptowzrd also pointed out an important support zone to watch. The $16 level has been identified as the main daily support target. Holding above this area will be crucial to maintaining the current bullish structure and preventing any deeper pullbacks. Overall, Cryptowzrd’s analysis suggests that Chainlink is positioned for a potential breakout phase, with $20 acting as the immediate resistance to watch. If Bitcoin Dominance continues to weaken and LINKBTC remains strong, traders could see a swift and powerful rally unfold in the days ahead. Volatility Vs. Patience: Navigating LINK’s Weekend Setup Concluding his analysis, Cryptowzrd noted that LINK’s intraday chart experienced significant volatility in the last 24 hours, reflecting an uncertain short-term outlook. He expects this choppy price action to continue, but due to the lower trading activity typically seen over the weekend, his expectations remain rational. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Trigger: Why $16 Holds The Key To The Next Rally The key level to watch is $18.40, which serves as an intraday resistance target. According to Cryptowzrd, if Chainlink holds above this level, it could trigger a long setup aiming for a move toward $19.80 or higher in the near term. However, if LINK remains below $18.40, Cryptowzrd expects the price to stay range-bound with continued sideways movement over the weekend.

Things Are Heating Up – Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-us-banking-giants-taking-action-against-cryptocurrencies-again-things-are-heating-up-here-are-the-details/,"US banking giant JPMorgan has reportedly suspended its customer onboarding process with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. This decision comes on the heels of a social media post by Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, in which he accused the bank of “trying to kill fintech and crypto companies.” In another post today, Winklevoss alleged that JPMorgan canceled Gemini's re-acceptance process because of a previous tweet by Winklevoss. In that tweet, Winklevoss warned that major banks were trying to bypass the Open Banking Rule, drafted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which takes effect at the end of 2024. This new regulation gives consumers the right to freely share their bank data with third-party platforms. Platforms like Plaid serve as a key bridge for transferring funds to cryptocurrency exchanges like Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken. Related News: US President Donald Trump Sends Mixed Signals About the Economy - His Latest Statements Here Winklevoss made the following statement: “They want to quietly take away your right to free access to your banking data. We will not remain silent, Jamie Dimon. Sorry.” Some in the crypto industry are viewing this development as a new example of the long-discussed “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” This operation is described as an effort by regulators to indirectly pressure crypto companies to push them out of the financial system. While the debate subsided earlier this year with Trump-era reforms, recent developments have rekindled tensions. Ironically, JPMorgan has recently taken a more lenient approach to cryptocurrencies. According to a report last week by the Financial Times, the bank is exploring loan products directly collateralized by crypto assets like Bitcoin. This stance contradicts CEO Jamie Dimon's previous statements calling Bitcoin a “fraud.” *This is not investment advice.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Ancillary assets The narrative The Senate Banking Committee introduced a discussion draft market structure bill to address how it believes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission should oversee digital assets, introducing the concept of an ""ancillary asset"" and asking the general public to weigh in on the draft by early August. Why it matters While the House voted to advance its Clarity Act last week, the Senate still needs to sign off on market structure legislation before President Donald Trump can sign it into law. This week, the Senate Banking Committee revealed where its efforts are focused: The SEC and its role, but with a somewhat different tack than the House took. Breaking it down The Senate Banking Committee published a discussion draft bill for its Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025, giving the general public two weeks to answer one or more of the dozens of questions it asked about the draft. The draft creates the term ""ancillary asset"" and defines it in terms of how the Securities and Exchange Commission might oversee these. Rashan Colbert, the U.S. policy director for the Crypto Council for Innovation, an industry interest group, told CoinDesk that the discussion draft is clearly focusing on the Banking Committee's jurisdiction. ""Within the bill, you see reference to a digital commodity, but you don't see an attempt to explicitly articulate what that is … along that line, you also don't see an attempt to articulate what the trading of digital commodities actually looks like, because those are things that are squarely within the remit of the Agriculture Committee,"" he said. ""Seeing part of the total picture here, and this is very clear from their work, this is a draft, and they've asked for responses, for information to help them flesh out the picture."" The process for the Senate to advance legislation may look different than how the House passed its Clarity Act, Colbert said, but he expects both Agriculture and Banking Committees to wind up coordinating on market structure legislation. Whatever bill advances will also need Democrat input, given the 60-vote threshold to move a bill through the Senate — at present, the discussion draft was published in a press release that quoted majority members.

Gregory Davis tells Fortune in a new interview that US equities aren’t primed to continue raking in double-digit gains year after year. “Our investment strategy group’s projection is that US equity market returns are going to be much more muted in the future. Over the past ten years, the S&P returned an average of 12.4% annually. We’re predicting the figure to drop to between 3.8% and 5.8% (midpoint of 4.8%) over the next decade.” The Vanguard president also argues that corporate profits have been abnormally high and aren’t likely to continue at that pace. Davis says the classic portfolio makeup of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has fallen out of whack for investors who haven’t rebalanced their holdings amid the longstanding equities bull market. “In the past 10 years, interest rates have mainly been very low, so bonds returned only around 2% a year, or 10% less than stocks. So the stock portion kept compounding at a high rate and getting bigger, and the bond portion kept shrinking as a share of the total. As a result, what started as a 60-40 mix is now 80-20 in favor of stocks.” He also notes that US stocks have beaten international equities by 6% a year over the past decade, further unbalancing investor portfolios. “So 10 years ago, if you started with the standard split 70% U.S. and 30% foreign, you’d now be at 80% U.S. and 20% foreign.” Davis suggests investors should put 60% of their portfolios in bonds, 20% in foreign stocks and only 20% in US stocks over the next 10 years. “If you look at the bond market today and the way yields have risen, we’re projecting that you’re going to pick up very similar returns in a mix of US and foreign bonds as you’ll get in US equities, or also 4% to 5%. So the expectations are comparable, but you’ll have much less volatility on the bond side… What’s the big advantage to betting on risky stocks when you can get 4.3% on three-month Treasuries?” The Vanguard president also doesn’t suggest investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ), which he considers “speculation.” “It’s not investing in a cash flow generating business, it’s not investing in bonds where you have a commitment to getting a coupon payment every six months, then principal at maturity. I t’s basically looking to sell to someone willing to pay more than you did. And the whole idea that a limited supply of Bitcoin will drive up its value is questionable when you consider that there’s an unlimited supply of new types of crypto that could be created. So I personally don’t get it. Vanguard won’t launch a Bitcoin fund. We just don’t see it as a core part of an investment portfolio.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

No slippage. No liquidations. No panic. Just a flawless off-exchange execution that showcased the new face of crypto market maturity. A Whale From the Early Days These weren’t just any coins. They belonged to one of Bitcoin’s earliest miners, someone who accumulated BTC back in 2009–2010, when most of the world hadn’t even heard the word “blockchain.” For years, these wallets sat dormant. Then, in the past week, they finally moved. The reason? Estate planning. Sources say the seller is an original HODLer managing generational wealth. And Galaxy stepped in as the architect of that transition. A whale sold 80,000 $BTC via Galaxy Digital The early Bitcoin investor cashed out around $9 billion, marking one of the largest sales in crypto history. Interestingly, this sale had little impact on BTC price, which quickly rebounded back from the $115,000 level. pic.twitter.com/YHS3cEu3wR — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 26, 2025 The entire transaction was handled via Galaxy Digital’s OTC desk,no open market exposure, no order book dumping. A clean block trade. Efficient. Silent. Professional. BTC Price Snapshot (via CoinMarketCap) Current Price: $117,500 (+2.1% 24h) Market Cap: $2.31 trillion 24h Volume: $35 billion Circulating Supply: 19.66 million BTC FDV: $2.46 trillion What’s stunning isn’t just the size,it’s the lack of impact. At most, BTC dipped to $115,000 before snapping back to $117,000 within hours. There was no flash crash, no cascading liquidations, just a smooth rebound. The market absorbed $9.6 billion without blinking, and that’s not luck; that’s structural strength. Why This Galaxy Sale Matters This wasn’t just a massive transaction. It was a litmus test. A sale of this scale, in earlier years, would’ve cratered the market. Even rumors of old wallets moving coins used to send Twitter (now X) into meltdown. But this time? Galaxy facilitated a historic exit,and no one got wrecked. It speaks volumes about how far crypto infrastructure has come. The ecosystem now boasts deep OTC liquidity, compliant execution desks, institutional-grade custody, and smart players managing exits with precision and discretion. A Shift in the On-Chain Lifecycle More than just a sale, this move signals a generational shift. The earliest Bitcoiners are no longer just HODLing. They’re creating estate plans, diversifying portfolios, and passing assets down. Crypto wealth is aging. But it’s also maturing, getting the same treatment as legacy assets. Galaxy is becoming a trusted bridge for that transition. Their role is evolving beyond exchange. They’re stepping into private wealth management, family office consulting, legacy planning,and doing it in stealth mode. Key Takeaways Market passed the stress test: $9.6B moved, price held firm. OTC desks are battle-tested: Galaxy’s execution was clean, quiet, and effective. Crypto is no longer just speculation: It’s inheritance. It’s legacy. It’s real wealth. This is likely just the beginning. More early wallets will awaken. More old-school holders will offload or restructure. But if the market can keep absorbing events like this with poise, Bitcoin is truly built to last. And Galaxy? They’re not just facilitating trades anymore. They’re managing eras.

He said: “The approval of the new seven-year budget requires unanimity, and until we get the remaining [frozen] funds, there won’t be a new EU budget either.” According to Reuters, the EU froze billions in funding over long-running disputes with Budapest about the rule of law, LGBTQ rights, and migration policies. The proposed €2 trillion budget, roughly $2.35 trillion, from the European Commission aims to support economic growth and defense spending. But under EU rules, every member state has to agree, and Orban is blocking it. He’s tying budget approval to the release of the money Brussels has withheld from his government during years of legal fights. Orban warns Brussels over 2026 elections, blasts support for Ukraine During the same speech, Orban accused EU leaders of trying to interfere in Hungary’s 2026 elections by backing opposition forces. He claimed the bloc is working to install what he described as a “pro-Ukraine and pro-Brussels government” in Budapest, referring to rising rival Peter Magyar, who now leads the Tisza party, a center-right opposition group outpacing Orban’s Fidesz party in polls. Peter Magyar, speaking Saturday at a rally, said Hungary’s future must remain tied to the EU and NATO, but criticized the current draft of the budget. He said, “Hungary is an EU member, and our relations as allies cannot be built on a political style of putting a spoke in the wheel.” He made it clear that Tisza wouldn’t support the proposed budget in its current form but would reopen talks if his party won the 2026 vote. “We need to make a clear and firm decision that our place has been and will be in Europe,” he added, while condemning Orban’s deepening ties with Russia. Orban also took aim at Donald Trump’s critics in the EU . He warned that Brussels is on a collision course with Washington, saying EU officials are risking a trade war with Trump’s White House, one that Europe “cannot win.” He added, “The current leadership of the EU will always be the last to sign deals with the United States and always the worst deals.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to meet Trump in Scotland on Sunday, as Brussels scrambles to negotiate a trade deal. But Orban isn’t expecting much to come out of it, blaming EU leadership for the strained relationship. From anti-Kremlin to Putin’s closest friend in the EU Years ago, Orban was one of the most anti-Russian voices in Hungarian politics. In 2007, he slammed former Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány for getting too close to Moscow, warning that Hungary needed protectionist policies against authoritarian powers like China and Russia. But after the 2008 financial crash, Orban began shifting his outlook. He saw America’s influence slipping and believed the world was heading into a multipolar era, with Russia and China becoming equals to the U.S. That belief led to his Eastern Opening Policy in 2010. The policy was crafted to counterbalance Hungary’s Western alliances and prioritize new relationships with strong non-Western states. The most visible outcome of this pivot was the Paks Nuclear Power Plant agreement, a long-term energy deal with Russia that made Hungary financially dependent on Moscow for decades. Then came 2014, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Unlike most of the EU, Orban rejected sanctions on Vladimir Putin. Brussels and NATO officials labeled Hungary a “Trojan Horse”, accusing Orban of quietly doing Russia’s work from inside the EU. It didn’t help that Putin visited Budapest twice—once in 2015 and again in 2017, to strengthen bilateral ties. By 2019, concerns about Hungary’s growing partnerships with Russia and China had reached Washington. The Trump administration then invited Orban to the White House that year, drawing harsh criticism from Brussels and the United Nations. Two years later, Hungary became the first EU country to approve the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, despite warnings from the bloc. In 2021, Hungary’s delegates to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) teamed up with Russia to challenge Ukraine’s Indigenous law, which recognizes certain ethnic groups as native but excludes Russians. That alignment further confirmed Orban’s foreign policy direction. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

And it’s not just any build. It’s a methodical push toward next-level scalability, speed, and real-world usability. The numbers, upgrades, and adoption trends all point in one direction: BNB Chain is laying the foundation for dominance in 2026. Five Major Upgrades Are Already on the Roadmap A 10× increase in the block gas limit. A turbocharged Rust-based client capable of 20,000 TPS with 150 ms finality. A next-gen StateDB designed for blazing-fast execution. Native protocol-level privacy. These aren’t marketing buzzwords. These are real engineering milestones, built to handle real user demand. Teams are deploying. Engineers are testing. Builders are flocking in. BNB Chain isn’t posturing—it’s shipping. Scalability Is Becoming Its Edge That 10× gas limit alone changes the game. It slashes congestion, accelerates throughput, and pairs with the Rust client to create a chain that feels instant. Finality arrives in milliseconds. Execution times drop as StateDB kicks in. Meanwhile, privacy—long a pain point—is finally coming on-chain by default. And all of this is happening while other chains stall or pivot. BNB IS QUIETLY BUILDING FOR SOMETHING BIGGER IN 2026 While most chains chase hype, @BNBCHAIN is stacking fundamentals, and the results are starting to show. Here is what you need to know: 5 Major Upgrades Coming in 2026 • 10x Block Gas Limit • 20,000 TPS with 150ms… — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) July 26, 2025 DEX Volume Tells the Story This isn’t theoretical adoption—it’s already visible. In June, BNB Chain recorded over $170 billion in DEX volume. This month, it’s trending beyond $200 billion. That’s back-to-back all-time highs. Volume like this means real users, real liquidity, and real confidence in the infrastructure. Binance Web3 Wallet Is Eating the Market With more than 90% of daily volume passing through it, Binance’s Web3 Wallet is crushing competition. It’s easy, fast, and designed for the masses. Users can bridge, swap, earn, and stake in seconds. No friction, no learning curve. Just Web3, finally working. BNB’s Deflationary Design Is Doing Its Job and the run to $800 Mark Over 62.7 million BNB have been permanently burned. Circulating supply now sits around 139 million—and it keeps dropping. This isn’t just a feel-good mechanism. It’s economics at work. While Ethereum inflates and Bitcoin caps at 21 million, BNB continues to shrink. That deflationary loop puts steady upward pressure on value as demand grows. And it’s showing in the market. BNB’s current rally isn’t driven by leverage. It’s not a meme-fueled breakout. Open interest is down, but spot demand is up. That’s organic buying. Long-term conviction. Utility-led movement. DEXs, GameFi, infrastructure apps, governance tokens—they’re all launching atop BNB Chain. Builders don’t wait for the hype cycle. They follow performance. And BNB Chain is performing. 2026 Is the Year of Builders, Not Talkers While some blockchains aim for viral tweets and short-lived trends, BNB Chain is writing code that will still matter years from now. High TPS, low latency, native privacy, and a thriving wallet ecosystem make BNB Chain the go-to for developers who are here for the long haul.

With an impressive presale performance and major partnerships like its coveted CoinMarketCap listing , Ruvi AI is positioning itself to challenge established tokens like Ripple. Analysts are forecasting substantial growth, predicting Ruvi AI could climb to $1 per token , generating a 66x ROI for early investors. Here’s everything you need to know about Ruvi AI’s explosive potential and why it might just be the investment opportunity you don’t want to miss. A Record-Breaking Presale Ruvi AI’s presale has been nothing short of phenomenal, demonstrating extraordinary demand and investor confidence. The numbers say it all: $2.5 million raised in a highly competitive presale. Over 200 million tokens sold , rapidly snapped up by eager buyers. A growing community of 2,400 holders , showing strong support for the project. Currently in its Phase 2 presale , Ruvi AI tokens are priced at just $0.015 each , making it an incredibly accessible entry point for new investors. However, with 70% of Phase 2 tokens already sold , time is running out to seize this price advantage. Once Phase 2 concludes, the token’s price will increase to $0.020 in Phase 3 , a 33% jump . The appeal doesn’t stop there. By the end of the presale, each token is guaranteed to reach $0.07 , offering an almost 5x return for Phase 2 participants. But analysts believe the real opportunity lies beyond the presale, predicting a post-listing valuation of $1 per token . For those who act now, Ruvi AI offers extraordinary growth potential, equating to a 66x ROI . CoinMarketCap Partnership Gives Ruvi AI a Big Edge Ruvi AI’s recent partnership with CoinMarketCap has been a game-changer, putting the project in the spotlight.

His post, which has stirred conversation across the XRP community, warns that many will regret missing the early opportunity and eventually “happily pay $1,000 for 1 XRP.” From Current Price to Future Possibilities As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.17, reflecting steady bullish momentum amid a broader market rebound. The token recently retested key resistance at $3.21 and appears poised for higher moves if volume and sentiment persist. Market watchers note that XRP has formed a solid base above $3.00, which could act as a springboard for future rallies. Historically, XRP has delivered parabolic returns. In 2017, it surged from under a cent to over $3 in less than a year, a more than 60,000% increase. BarriC draws on this precedent, suggesting that XRP’s long-term value could dwarf even its past highs, driven by increased utility in global payments and liquidity solutions. Once $XRP skyrockets to $1,000 A lot of people will get left behind A lot of people will realise they fumbled $XRP A lot of people will FOMO into $XRP and happily pay $1,000 for 1 x #XRP — BarriC (@B_arri_C) July 25, 2025 BarriC’s $1,000 Prediction: FOMO at Full Speed BarriC believes XRP’s path to $1,000 will unfold in stages. First, the token must break past short-term resistance zones, especially the $4.00–$5.00 range. From there, institutional demand, particularly from banks and payment processors, could propel XRP toward the $10–$50 range, eventually setting the stage for a moonshot to $1,000. What makes this prediction stand out isn’t just the price target; it’s the psychology behind it. BarriC highlights how retail investors often act late in a rally. Many will watch XRP climb and hesitate to buy during early gains, only to FOMO in once XRP hits three- or four-digit territory. By then, according to BarriC, the price will no longer matter; they’ll “happily pay $1,000” just to get in. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Realistic or Out of Reach? While BarriC’s vision is compelling, many analysts remain skeptical. For XRP to reach $1,000, its market cap would need to exceed $50 trillion , a figure larger than the entire global stock market. Critics argue that such a valuation is highly improbable, even if XRP becomes a central player in cross-border finance. Still, there’s a growing consensus that XRP’s fundamentals are improving. The resolution of its legal battle with the U.S. SEC, the rise of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, and growing institutional adoption are all tailwinds that could push XRP toward higher valuations, though perhaps not as high as $1,000. Final Thoughts BarriC’s statement serves as both a price prediction and a psychological insight: when XRP begins its next major rally, many will wish they had acted sooner. Whether XRP ever reaches $1,000 remains to be seen. But as history shows, in the world of crypto, what seems impossible today can become reality tomorrow, and the fear of missing out has a way of rewriting what people believe is “too expensive.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The web design agency has been making weekly acquisitions and is currently ranked in the top 30. Steady Growth Based in the UK and publicly traded on the Aquis Stock Exchange (ticker: SWC), The Smarter Web Company, specializing in bespoke web solutions and online marketing, has purchased 225 bitcoins at an average price of £87,096 ($118,076 per unit). In its Friday announcement , the firm disclosed that its total holdings are now 1,825 BTC, with an average purchase price of £80,466 ($109,088 per Bitcoin), making the total stash worth over $210 million, as per the most recent prices. Alongside the news of the purchase, the enterprise also disclosed its financial statements. For the six months ended in April this year, their net cash and cash equivalents increased to £1,230,946M ($1.65 million). Comparing that to the same time last year, that number was just £21,577 ($29,000), representing growth of over 5,500%. The company entered the Bitcoin accumulation race on April 28th with a 2.3 BTC purchase, valued at $215,695 at the time. It went public on Aquis just three days prior, raising £2 million ($2.68M) at the IPO. Its holdings now place it in the 26th spot on the global rankings for public companies holding the asset, as per data taken at print time from BitcoinTreasuries. Their Year-to-Date BTC Yield, which is a key performance indicator (KPI) that reflects the percentage change in the ratio of Total Bitcoin Holdings to Shares In Issue over a given period, is 43,787%, and the company has £1M ($1.34M) in net capital ready to be deployed for further purchases. All According to Plan The corporation is following its “10-year plan,” with the policy aligning with the Directors’ views that digital assets, including Bitcoin, provide a means to preserve value over time and serve as a hedge against inflation. The overall goal is to enhance its treasury in the short term while implementing its organic growth strategy, which will then enable the medium-to long-term plan of making strategic acquisitions when appropriate. Andrew Webley, the CEO, shared: “We have a clear plan to deliver significant value for our shareholders, and today we document this so that our shareholders can share the exciting journey. We are focused on accelerating short-term growth by scaling our proven core services, while also exploring strategic acquisitions that could unlock compelling value.” The post Another Corporate Stack: The Smarter Web Company Adds $26M BTC to Treasury appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|TREASURY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-26 19:03:37

According to CoinDesk Data, BTC was last up 1.45% over the past 24 hours, bringing its 30-day gain to 10.42% and lifting its year-to-date performance to more than 26%. Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode highlighted in its latest ""Week On-chain"" report that July has brought one of the strongest upside breakouts of the year. After dipping to around $105,400 earlier in the month, bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $122,700 before settling into a consolidation phase just below that level. The report noted that this price rally triggered substantial profit-taking from long-term holders while also drawing in new buyers, leading to a sustained inflow of capital into the asset. The result is that bitcoin’s realized capitalization — a measure of the total value of coins based on the last time they were moved — has now surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. Unlike market capitalization, which reflects current price multiplied by total supply, realized cap tracks the actual liquidity deployed into bitcoin over time. This milestone reflects growing conviction among both long-term holders and new entrants, and signals a deepening of the asset’s liquidity base. It also points to bitcoin’s growing role on the macroeconomic stage, with the ability to absorb and settle ever larger volumes of capital. Institutional activity has continued to dominate headlines. On Friday, Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital (GLXY) announced in a press release ""the successful execution of one of the largest notional bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto on behalf of a client."" Galaxy said that it had executed a more than $9 billion bitcoin transaction on behalf of a legacy investor from the early days of the network. The 80,000 BTC sale is one of the largest of its kind in crypto history and was reportedly part of the client’s estate planning. Meanwhile, on Friday, CNBC resurfaced a detail from Tesla’s second quarter of 2022 earnings filings, which disclosed that the company had converted approximately 75% of its bitcoin into fiat currency during that quarter. With bitcoin hovering around $118,000 on Friday morning, David Faber, a ""Squawk on the Street"" co-host, estimated that had Tesla held onto its full bitcoin holdings, the value of its BTC holdings would now exceed $5 billion — four times higher than its reported valuation of $1.25 billion as of the most recent quarter. Technical Analysis Highlights According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, during the 23-hour session ending July 26 at 14:00 UTC, the digital asset rallied more than 3%, carving out a $3,300 trading range between $114,937 and $118,237. Support has remained firm in the $117,140–$117,330 zone, while resistance appears to be consolidating just below the $118,200 threshold. The final hour of trading saw modest gains of 0.07% as BTC climbed from $118,095 to $118,183, with tight-range consolidation suggesting continued buying interest just below psychological resistance.

For presales, it is usually the extended presale campaigns, vague roadmaps, and endless marketing promises that have created a toxic environment where genuine innovation struggles to distinguish itself from elaborate cash grabs. This erosion of trust has reached a tipping point. Investors are now demanding transparency, immediate utility, and proven development progress before committing their capital to any blockchain venture. Right now, investors are now gravitating toward projects that solve actual problems and provide immediate value to users. Let's find out more. BlockDAG: The Never-Ending Tale of Presale Fatigue The BlockDAG presale serves as a perfect example of everything wrong with current crypto fundraising practices. Since the campaign took longer than expected, investors are gradually losing confidence in its potential. This development could likely result in massive sell-offs upon launch, thereby causing a heavy downtrend for BDAG. On Trustpilot, BlockDAG has an average rating of 2.8 out of 5. About 47% of the reviews are negative, with some users calling it a scam and warning others to be careful. The project has been running its presale for over 18 months, constantly shifting launch dates and raising concerns about transparency and legitimacy. Industry analysis reveals that BlockDAG Network has invested heavily in advertising, securing paid placements in media outlets, and launching promotional campaigns on social media platforms rather than focusing on product development. This approach has led many to question whether the project represents genuine innovation or simply another elaborate fundraising scheme. DeSoc: The Blue Chip Social Media Revolution While projects like BlockDAG struggle with credibility issues, DeSoc has become the blue-chip cryptocurrency project that serious investors are flocking to. With $10 million already raised toward its revolutionary vision, DeSoc represents everything the market has been waiting for: genuine innovation, immediate utility, and transparent development. DeSoc is pioneering the first blockchain-based social media platform that enables seamless content syndication across all major social networks. Unlike theoretical blockchain improvements, DeSoc addresses real problems that millions of social media users face daily. This makes the new decentralized social media revolution an immediately valuable and practical solution for everyone’s day-to-day social media use. The platform's unique approach enables users to publish content simultaneously on DeSoc and traditional platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, through sophisticated API integration. This breakthrough eliminates the painful choice between embracing Web3 technology and maintaining an existing social media presence. Revolutionary Monetization Ecosystem DeSoc' s monetization framework represents a paradigm shift in how content creators and users interact with social media. The platform introduces multiple revenue streams through its native $SOCS token, including: ● Content Rewards: Users earn tokens for creating valuable content based on engagement metrics and quality assessments● Tipping and Micropayments: Direct creator support through token-based appreciation systems ● Exclusive Content Access: Premium content monetization through token-gated experiences● Advertisement Partnerships: Strategic use of $SOCS tokens for purchasing ad space across integrated platforms This comprehensive approach ensures that every participant in the DeSoc ecosystem can generate meaningful returns while contributing to platform growth. Transparent Tokenomics Built for Sustainability DeSoc's token distribution demonstrates the careful planning and community focus that distinguishes blue-chip projects from speculative ventures. The strategic allocation ensures long-term sustainability while providing immediate value to early supporters. With 45% of the total 3 billion token supply allocated to presale across 12 structured stages, DeSoc maintains accessibility while building a strong foundation. Platform development receives 20% allocation with team tokens locked for two years, demonstrating long-term commitment. Marketing initiatives account for 15%, community rewards claim 10%, and liquidity reserves secure the final 10%. This transparent structure contrasts sharply with projects that obscure tokenomics or heavily favor insiders over community participants. The Clear Investment Choice The contrast between struggling presale projects and DeSoc's focused innovation could not be more apparent. While others make endless promises and delay deliverables, DeSoc is building the future of decentralized social media with proven funding, clear utility, and demonstrable progress. In fact, its ongoing presale has raked in more than $10 million, a testament to investors' growing interest in DeSoc's dream. The presale is currently selling at $0.01 in its opening stages, and many BlockDag investors are already flocking to it. Don't get left behind.

These projects struggle to maintain investor confidence, which is crucial for the success and stabilization of the token price post-launch. Issues Plaguing Extended Cryptocurrency Presales BlockDAG's presale has become a classic case study of the pitfalls associated with protracted fundraising periods in the crypto world. Originally promising, the campaign has been extended multiple times, leading to waning investor interest and growing skepticism regarding the project's legitimacy and intentions. Adding to the concerns, the legitimacy of BlockDAG has been further questioned due to its low ratings on platforms like Trustpilot, where it scores just 2.8 out of 5. Approximately 47% of the reviews are negative, with several users flagging it as a potential scam. Contrasting Models: The Rise of DeSoc In stark contrast to BlockDAG, DeSoc has emerged as a paradigm of the potential success that transparent and problem-solving-focused cryptocurrency projects can achieve. Raising $10 million in its presale stages, DeSoc has captured the attention and capital of serious investors. DeSoc is innovating at the intersection of blockchain and social media, creating a decentralized platform where users can manage content across various networks seamlessly. This practical approach addresses current issues faced by millions of social media users, making it a valuable addition to the digital space. Investor-Friendly Tokenomics and Monetization in DeSoc DeSoc has developed a multi-layered monetization model that benefits all platform users: Content Rewards: Engagement and quality-based token compensation. Tipping and Micropayments: Enhances direct support for creators. Exclusive Content Access: Special content behind token paywalls. Advertisement Partnerships: Utilizing tokens for ad purchases. Clear and Sustainable Token Distribution DeSoc distinguishes itself with a clear token distribution strategy intended for long-term viability. The project allocates 45% of its tokens to presale, ensuring broad access and foundational stability. The remaining tokens are distributed among development, team incentives (with a lock-up period), marketing, community rewards, and liquidity provisions. Conclusion: The Investment Verdict The ongoing success of DeSoc's presale, now exceeding $10 million, starkly contrasts with the diminishing trust in projects like BlockDAG. It highlights the critical importance of clear project goals, immediate utility, and transparent operations in securing investor confidence and support.

Analysts Favor ONDO, WLD, and BeerBear for Bigger Gains",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-xrp-still-a-top-pick-analysts-favor-ondo-wld-and-beerbear-for-bigger-gains/,"In the booming crypto market, attention is shifting as investors explore emerging tokens with promising potential for substantial returns. While familiar names like XRP have long held the spotlight, exciting new contenders are captivating analysts with their significant growth prospects. In particular, ONDO, WLD, and BeerBear are garnering interest, challenging the status quo and offering fresh opportunities in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. How these newcomers stack up against established players could redefine investment strategies. BEER at $0.0005? Sounds Like a Dream. BeerBear Makes It Real! Tired of meme coins that promise the moon but fizzle out before liftoff? Time for a project that’s got an actual character. Finally, there is a coin for demanding beer connoisseurs. Those ones who love good old Dad jokes. Meet BeerBear ($BEER) – a brutal bear who knows no mercy for scams. It has come as a symbol of resistance against fraud. Offered now at a mere fraction of a cent ($0.0005 to be precise), the $BEER token is expected to reach $0.0020 by the end of the presale. Still cheap—but early birds get the best deal. Let’s crunch some numbers: You have $100 and buy $BEER for $0.0005 (imagine if real beer costs that price, eh?) You’ll get 199,999 tokens. Wait too long, hop on at $0.0020, and you’ll only get 50,000 tokens. Feel the difference? Wanna Grab Some $BEER? Treat Yourself Now! BeerBear is all action. Even before launch, it already boasts a play-to-earn Bear em All game in a demo mode. It is an arcade-style brawler where BeerBear, inspired by John McClane and Rambo, fights greedy hamsters. Why hamsters? Because mindless tapping games are a waste of time. BeerBear brings actual profit potential. Check out the teaser for the BeerBear game. Bonuses and Rewards for True $BEER Buddies BeerBear looks after his crew – $BEER holders – and offers them a handful of nice bonuses. Active community members can earn Beer Points up to 12% from the amount they invest. Besides, there is a referral program where you can earn USDT rewards for inviting your friends for some $BEER. Audits? Tokemonics? Roadmap? All Checked. To fight fraud, BeerBear ensured full transparency. The project passed audits from top-tier agencies: SmartState, Beosin, and HashEx — with no critical issues. So yes, BeerBear is officially legit. Tokenomics ? The total supply is capped at 10 billion tokens, with no additional mints. That scarcity could boost demand, especially since 60% is allocated to presale buyers. As for the roadmap: expect the full release of the ‘Bear ’em All’ game for epic brawls, plus a BeerBear NFT marketplace with rare, collectible skins. Why Buy $BEER Now? Because the best time for beer is ALWAYS! (Dad would love this one). Because this project is so catchy and relevant, they might run out of $BEER before you blink (yep, another Dad classic). Buying later would mean paying more. Because that’s the BEER you won’t have to share with anyone (seriously, Dad’s belly would hurt from laughing). And finally — no jokes here — because $BEER might be just that meme coin you laughed at without buying but then saw it trading above $1 following the listing. Or maybe not. Success depends on many things like the market sentiment and the team’s execution. But so far, so good. Audits passed. Roadmap ambitious. Tokenomics smart. Now it’s up to the community — do you have the guts to help BeerBear become the next big meme coin? Become BeerBear’s Best Buddy Before It Paws Its Way Into the Meme Coin Top 10 XRP Poised for a Comeback: Growth Potential on the Horizon XRP is currently priced between $2.95 and $3.81. It recently dipped by about 10% in the past week but remains up nearly 43% over the month. The nearest resistance is at $4.16, while support is at $2.45. The coin’s Simple Moving Average for 10 days is $3.19, and for 100 days, it stands at $3.39. The Relative Strength Index is 43.14, indicating it’s not overbought. The MACD level is slightly in the negative, suggesting potential recovery. With the Stochastic at 23.85, there’s room for upward growth. If XRP gains momentum, it could break the next resistance at $5.02, potentially rising over 50% from its current range. Ondo Holds Steady: Could a Bullish Breakout Be Near? Ondo (ONDO) is showcasing intriguing movements. The current price fluctuates between $0.92 and $1.13, sitting close to its 10-day moving average. Despite the weekly dip of close to 3%, ONDO shone with a 28.54% surge over the month. With a relative strength index around 42, it’s neither overbought nor oversold, hinting at stable demand. The nearest resistance is at $1.22, but analysts eye $1.43 for a meaningful breakout. The moving average convergence divergence and stochastic indicators suggest consolidation. If the optimism persists, ONDO may push toward the $1.22 mark, a boost of several percentage points. Enthusiasts are hopeful for a lift, keeping a sharp eye on these levels. Worldcoin’s Potential to Surge Amidst Bearish Trends Worldcoin (WLD) is currently in a price range of $1.05-$1.34. Despite a 46.38% drop over six months, recent data shows a 20.84% rise in the last month. This suggests potential for growth. The coin faces its nearest resistance at $1.46; breaking this could push it to $1.75, a potential uptick of over 30%. Support sits at $0.8737, providing a cushion. Indicators like Stochastic and MACD suggest the coin is oversold, signaling possible upward momentum. With the RSI below 40, a bounce could be on the horizon. Traders are hopeful as Worldcoin shows signs it could break free from bearish grips. Conclusion While XRP, ONDO, and WLD offer some potential, their short-term prospects appear limited. For those tired of meme coins that fizzle out, BeerBear ($BEER) stands out with real character. As a symbol against scams, BeerBear brings a play-to-earn game, generous rewards, and full transparency through audits. It offers more than promises, making it an appealing choice for discerning investors seeking bigger gains.

49001955,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=774434,1753557616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49001955.jpeg,Japan may use its $550 billion U.S. trade deal fund to support Taiwanese chip plants in the U.S.,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japan-trump-trade-deal-taiwan-chip-plants/,"Japan’s top trade official said Saturday that $550 billion in investments secured through a U.S. tariff deal might be used to support Taiwanese semiconductor factories inside the United States. Speaking to NHK, Ryosei Akazawa confirmed the funding wouldn’t be restricted to only Japanese or American companies. Japan made the deal this week with the United States, agreeing to pour funds into U.S.-related projects—through equity, loans, and guarantees—in exchange for lower import tariffs on its goods. The exact layout of the program is still vague. But according to Akazawa, what matters now is building supply chains that are “critical to economic security.” He said the financing could be open to any project that serves that goal, including a Taiwan chipmaker setting up shop in the U.S. “If a Taiwanese chipmaker builds a plant in the U.S. and uses Japanese components or tailors its products to meet Japanese needs, that’s fine too,” he told NHK. No specific company names were given. Taiwan’s TSMC could benefit from the fund Taiwan’s TSMC , the world’s top advanced chipmaker, already announced a $100 billion investment plan in the United States earlier this year. The announcement came in March during a White House event with President Donald Trump, and it added to $65 billion already committed toward three chip facilities in Arizona. One of those factories is already running. The push for a stronger U.S. chip supply comes with a catch. Washington’s reliance on Taiwan for high-end chips has been labeled a risk, especially due to the island’s proximity to China. Japan is trying to address that risk, not just for the U.S., but for itself too. Under the deal, Japan is expected to route most of the $550 billion through two state-backed financial arms: the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). A newly revised law lets JBIC finance foreign firms if they play a role in protecting Japan’s supply chains. Akazawa made it clear that only a small slice—just 1 to 2%—of the total investment would be in equity. The rest will be loans and insurance guarantees. That means Japan isn’t trying to take ownership in these projects; it’s trying to support them without carrying the long-term risks of being a shareholder. When asked about a White House claim that the U.S. would keep 90% of the profits from the investment deal, Akazawa clarified what that number meant. According to him, the U.S. was referring only to returns from equity shares, which would be a very small part of the overall fund. “That figure refers only to returns on equity investment,” he said. Japan originally pushed to receive half of the profits, but Akazawa said the compromise wasn’t a huge loss. The country is saving about 10 trillion yen, or around $67.72 billion, in tariff expenses due to the agreement. That trade-off made the decision easier. He also said the government wants to roll out the entire $550 billion within the remainder of Trump’s current term. That sets a tight deadline for both planning and disbursing the funds. So far, no official timeline has been released for when the first batch of funds will be handed out. No companies—Taiwanese or otherwise—have confirmed whether they’re applying. But Akazawa’s comments made it clear that Japan is ready to back whoever helps build secure chip supply chains, whether that’s in Tokyo, Taipei, or Texas.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has publicly expressed its support for stablecoin businesses. However, this support will only be provided if the rules governing digital assets in Nigeria are fully adhered to. This suggests that Nigeria intends to leverage blockchain technology to improve the security and efficiency of payments, particularly during economic downturns. This move signals a shift from a stringent approach towards crypto innovations in the country. SEC Supports Stablecoin Innovation with Clear Rules Speaking at the recently concluded Nigeria Stablecoin Summit held in Lagos, the Director-General of the SEC, Mr. Emomotimi Agama, shared his views on US-pegged digital currencies. He stated that stablecoins now play a crucial role in the country’s financial system. The Director-General explained that while Nigeria remains cautious about digital assets, the government is open to innovation that brings value to its people. Mr. Agama described Nigeria’s digital economy as fast-growing, young, and becoming more decentralized. He said stablecoins are not just a passing trend. They are now widely used in daily financial life, especially during periods of economic instability. Nigeria Ranks Second in Global Crypto Adoption Stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets, typically the US dollar. This makes them more stable than regular cryptocurrencies. In Nigeria, inflation and currency fluctuations are common. This has prompted many citizens to turn to stablecoins to protect the value of their money. Stablecoins are also widely used for savings, trading, and sending money across borders. A recent report by Chainalysis ranked Nigeria second in global crypto adoption. This is mainly because Nigerians use cryptocurrency for daily needs, such as sending remittances, shopping online, and making international payments. Industry Leaders Respond with Hope Many leaders in the digital finance space have welcomed the SEC’s position. Nathaniel Luz, President of the Africa Stablecoin Network, said the announcement brings long-awaited clarity. He explained that most businesses had been careful about entering the Nigerian market. However, now this support gives them more confidence. This change in approach is essential. Just last year, Nigeria took tough actions against crypto firms, including the arrest of a senior Binance official. However, while the legal case against Tigran Gambaryan was still ongoing, the government has been working to create clearer rules for the sector. These efforts also include plans for a digital asset tax system to support the country’s income. By supporting stablecoins in a regulated way, Nigeria is showing its readiness to take a leading role in the future of finance.

Ruvi AI (RUVI) might just be that opportunity. Following Ripple’s incredible 100x growth, analysts are looking at Ruvi AI as the next token primed for explosive returns. With a presale that has already achieved remarkable milestones and a coveted CoinMarketCap listing, Ruvi AI is catching the attention of investors eager to secure their positions early. If you’re wondering why Ruvi AI is making such waves, here’s everything you need to know about its presale success, strategic partnerships, and why analysts believe it could be the next breakout crypto star. A Presale That’s Setting Records Ruvi AI has quickly gained a reputation as one of the most promising projects of 2025. The numbers behind its presale are enough to turn heads: Over $2.5 million raised so far. 200 million tokens sold, reflecting strong interest from investors. A supportive community of 2,400 holders, showing growing enthusiasm. Currently, Ruvi AI is in its Phase 2 presale, with tokens priced at just $0.015 each. However, demand is surging. With 70% of Phase 2 tokens already sold, time is running out for investors to buy in before the price increases. When Phase 3 begins, tokens will be priced at $0.020, a 33% jump. Presale participants have significant advantages. By the time the presale concludes, Ruvi AI’s price will be locked in at $0.07 per token, delivering an almost 5x ROI for current buyers. Analysts predict even greater returns post-listing, with estimates suggesting Ruvi AI could hit $1 per token, a staggering 66x ROI. With numbers like these, it’s no surprise that investors are rushing to secure tokens before the presale ends. Partnerships That Build Trust One of Ruvi AI’s greatest strengths is its focus on credibility. This isn’t just another speculative token, it’s backed by high-value partnerships and rigorous security audits. CoinMarketCap Listing Ruvi AI’s CoinMarketCap listing is a major milestone. Recognized globally for its transparency and reliability, CoinMarketCap opens Ruvi AI up to millions of traders and investors. This partnership reassures buyers that Ruvi AI is a legitimate and trustworthy project with long-term potential. WEEX Exchange Partnership Adding to its list of achievements, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, a well-respected cryptocurrency trading platform. WEEX is known for its secure and user-friendly trading experience, further cementing Ruvi AI’s credibility and reach. This partnership adds another layer of trust for investors. CyberScope Audit Ruvi AI also stands out for prioritizing security. Its third-party audit by CyberScope, a leader in blockchain safety, confirms that its smart contracts are both robust and reliable. This technical validation ensures that investor funds are protected, a critical consideration in today’s cryptocurrency market.

Major SOL news has sparked wild rallies in the past, but all eyes are now on a new contender. After booking a profit from SOL, one expert Twitter trader has gone all in on Unilabs Finance. While the Solana price is consolidating near the high, Unilabs is offering something more powerful, which includes a 40% staking ROI and a newly launched AI Fund. This AI presale star has already raised over $6.8 million. Not only that, the project is aiming to revolutionize the Web3 investment sector with the first DeFi asset management platform fueled by AI technology that currently has over $30 million in AUM. With over 15,000 investors already joining the presale, Unilabs Finance is now the leading contender in the DeFi sector, challenging major giants like Solana. Solana Price Drops Over 10% From High – Can It Regain Bullish Momentum? The current market data shows Solana faces significant obstacles in the market, as the Solana price trades at $185 with an over 10% loss in the last few days. However, in the weekly chart, it is still trading in green with a 5.28% price increase, but it has faced intense selling pressure this week. Image Courtesy: TradingView The $180 support mark for Solana price stands vital according to technical analysis metrics, which need preservation to restore market optimism. The market capitalization of SOL stands at approximately $100 billion, while experts wonder if the Solana price can break out from bearish trends. In the latest SOL news, Coinglass reported a 4.61% drop in Open Interest, from $12 billion to nearly $11 billion. Future optimistic projections about SOL have not yet proven to lead to substantial market recovery, and its short-term direction remains ambiguous. Latest SOL News: Can This Turn Solana Price Bullish? In the latest SOL news, Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. has secured a $200 million equity line of credit from Solana Ventures Ltd. This marks a major milestone in its shift from a fintech infrastructure provider to a key institutional player in the Solana blockchain ecosystem. Source: X This SOL news highlights a growing trend: traditional finance firms are now turning to high-speed blockchains like Solana to manage their treasury operations and earn yields directly on-chain. Maple, which already holds $1.3 billion in TVL, adds serious weight to Solana’s growing DeFi infrastructure. This SOL news strengthens Solana’s position as a key player in next-gen decentralized finance. The current price action reveals that this could be just a healthy correction to the SOL price.

Notably, this price forecast comes following a broader crypto market correction in the past week, during which XRP has registered a 6.74% price decline. XRP Bulls Eye Return To ATH After $3 Retest In an X post on July 25, CasiTrades shows that XRP is on the brink of a major price surge based on the indications of the Elliot Wave Theory – a technical framework that proposes that price movements occur in five repetitive waves. Amidst the price decline in the last week, XRP failed to hold above the critical $3.21 price level, forcing a retrace to retest the major $3.00 support zone, resulting in a slight price bounce. Despite this bearish event, the analyst notes encouragingly that the altcoin did not form a new price low, suggesting the larger bullish structure remains intact. Related Reading: XRP To $10? Basketball Legend’s Poll Puts Crypto On Center Court CasiTrades explains that XRP’s latest retracement reached a deep 0.854 Fibonacci level, a classic reversal zone for second waves in a bullish five-wave structure. This deep pullback, combined with the strong bounce off $3.00, signifies the potential bottom of Wave 2. If bulls can hold the price above this support, this sets the stage for the beginning of Wave 3, the strongest and most explosive leg in the Elliott Wave Theory. For context, the Elliot wave theory begins with an initial price rise, i.e, Wave 1, followed by Wave 2, a pullback that doesn’t breach the starting point. Wave 3 is usually the strongest and longest, driven by increased participation and bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Wave 4 brings another correction, often less severe than Wave 2, before Wave 5 pushes prices to a final high. For Wave 3 to commence in the present market, CasiTrades states the next price target lies at the $3.21 region, which represents a crucial resistance. If XRP produces a sustained breakout above this price barrier, it validates the proposed bullish scenario. In this case, the analyst identifies an immediate price target of $3.82, which aligns with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension of the prior move. Interestingly, this price zone also represents XRP’s all-time high on certain markets. This confluence strengthens confidence in the bullish scenario, especially considering that if the Elliott Wave structure plays out fully, a Wave 5 rally could propel the altcoin into uncharted price territory.

49002294,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=774239,1753558230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49002294.jpeg,Web3 moves from monolithic to modular blockchains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/web3-modular-leaving-monoliths-behind/,"A new research report from Cryptopolitan reveals Web3 is shifting toward modular architectures. It is moving away from monolithic blockchains such as Solana and pre-rollup Ethereum. The study, available under Cryptopolitan’s Reports section highlights a wave of developer interest and rising adoption of rollups as key signals of this transition. According to the new report from Cryptopolitan, modular chains better reflect the core values of Web3. They emphasize decentralization, specialization, and open innovation. In monolithic architectures, blockchain functions like consensus, data availability, execution, and settlement are tightly integrated and performed on the same layer. Modular blockchains decouple these components, distributing responsibilities across different layers or systems for improved performance and flexibility. More rollups are live on public testnets Monolithic blockchains operate with all core functions—execution, consensus, and data availability—tightly interconnected. This design means issues in one layer, like execution errors or heavy transaction loads, can directly impact the entire system, even disrupting consensus. In fact, network congestion in monolithic systems has triggered multiple system-wide failures. Ideally, the monolithic design’s improvements in scalability often mean a weakening of security. Modular architecture overcomes this limitation by decoupling execution from consensus, enabling both to scale independently while preserving robust security. Fragmentation can weaken network cohesion and liquidity, yet modular architectures support faster innovation, tailored functionality, and horizontal scalability. Modular architecture also allows data availability, settlement, and execution to develop independently and in parallel. Moreover, shared settlement layers provide a secure foundation for cross-layer interaction, allowing diverse applications to work together across execution layers, and richer composability and safer multi-chain coordination. The modular shift is still in its early days, but momentum is growing. By 2026, we’ll likely see a surge in rollup acquisitions, ecosystem-level coordination, and the standardization of tooling. Data availability layers such as Celestia and Avail are expected to take the lead as the go-to choice for developers. In contrast, execution layers are expected to evolve into highly specialized, niche solutions. The report notes that over 40 rollups are either live in production or available on public testnets. L2 development is also up 230% YoY, with Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base driving the most GitHub activity. Developer interest in modular blockchain tools is on the rise. Since going live in late 2023, Celestia has seen accelerating adoption, with its DA layer integrated by over 25 modular chains in early-stage rollouts and testnets. Modular infrastructure projects have collectively raised more than $400 million since 2022. Some notable funding rounds include Eclipse with $50 million, Avail with $27 million, and Dymension with $6.7 million. Cosmos SDK also experienced a 13% increase in monthly active developers year-over-year. Additionally, Celestia-based rollups drew in more than 100 developers in Q1 2025. Furthermore, since late last year, Celestia, Rollkit, and Avail saw GitHub activity jump by over 50%. Ethereum blockchain shifts to a modular architecture The Ethereum blockchain took up rollups, becoming the network’s official transition from monolithic to modular architecture. In September 2022, Ethereum upgraded “The Merge” to help the Layer 2 network scale the Layer 1 network better, shifting from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake system. Ethereum now has daily transactions up to 11 million, up from 1 million on L1 a year prior. End users are also seeing over 99% lower transaction costs, and the network is achieving higher throughput without compromising the foundational security of Layer 1. Additionally, the Ethereum rollups are tailored to suit different use cases, including DeFi, gaming, or identity, which in turn drives ecosystem diversity and spurs innovation. The rollups also communicate simply because their formats are standardized, as blobs, and there is a common security layer in Ethereum. Off-chain, they process thousands of transactions a second: they leverage the security of Ethereum by settling on-chain periodically. ZK-rollups achieve similar scalability via cryptographic proofs that offer instantaneous finality. Both methods deliver over 100x throughput improvements without compromising the security of their underlying settlement layers. As rollups are gaining traction, some experts are developing more hybrid blockchains that incorporate the key elements of both monolithic and modular architectures. Hybrid models aim to strike a balance—preserving the simplicity of monolithic systems while embedding modular elements that enable greater scalability and flexibility.

In a new podcast, Goldman Sachs chief economist and head of global investment research Jan Hatzius calls the US dollar the “dog that didn’t bark.” Hatzius says the US economy has stabilized since April, when the stock market plunged amid Trump’s trade war. However, he points out that the dollar has continued to weaken, depreciating even as the economy rebounds. The economist says the dollar’s bearish price action suggests it’s being driven by long-term structural factors rather than the near-term economic outlook. “The dollar is still very highly valued on a broad trade-weighted basis, and that historically sets up for depreciation in the coming years. The US still runs a very large current account deficit that needs to be financed by equal-sized capital inflows. Then there are some of these more tail risk concerns around things like Fed independence that probably also have an impact on how foreign investors perceive investments in the US… This is not about a fire sale. It’s about making it a little bit more difficult to obtain the capital inflows that are needed to cover the current account deficit.” In April of this year, Hatzius said that the US had a current account deficit of $1.1 trillion, which needed to be financed by foreign investments in US assets such as Treasuries and equities. The current account deficit exists because the US spends more than it earns from the global economy. By consuming more than it produces, the country relies on foreign investment to bridge the gap. But when foreign funding slows, pressure builds on the dollar as capital flows outward, increasing the global supply of USD and contributing to its devaluation. At time of writing, the US dollar index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of major currencies, is down about 10% year-to-date.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|VET|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 19:40:00

Ripple CEO Chris Larsen triggered fear after cashing out millions in XRP. But while XRP stumbled, Unilabs Finance surged with rising demand and record presale traction. Unilabs Finance, known for its AI-powered DeFi strategies, is now leading the conversation on smart crypto investing. The contrast between retail panic in Ripple and growing trust in Unilabs reflects a deeper shift. Ripple CEO Sparks Doubt with Massive XRP Sell-Off XRP price fell nearly 10% after Ripple CEO Chris Larsen sold a large chunk. He moved $175 million worth of XRP right after the token reached a new high. The XRP price fell from $3.65 to around $3.1 within days. Source: TradingView Many viewed this as market manipulation, not just profit-taking. On-chain data from CryptoQuant confirmed Larsen moved funds to centralized exchanges. XRP price keeps struggling as community trust erodes. Investors have long worried about Ripple’s founder allocations. This latest move revived those concerns in full force. Larsen’s wallet still holds 2.8 billion XRP, valued over $8.4 billion. That kind of control adds pressure and limits future XRP price recovery. Traders also spotted a pattern: similar outflows marked XRP price peaks in earlier bull runs. Many holders feel betrayed, especially since Larsen and Ripple stayed silent. This silence only added fuel to the backlash. Retail confidence sank fast. While XRP dropped, another project quietly took the spotlight. Unilabs Shines as the Smarter Alternative in a Volatile Week As the XRP price fell, Unilabs (UNIL) took the stage as this week’s top gainer. Unilabs is the first DeFi asset manager powered by artificial intelligence. Its platform scans thousands of tokens using real-time AI analysis. Investors use it to build smart portfolios without emotional decisions. With over $30 million in assets managed, Unilabs shows strong investor trust. XRP’s crash made Unilabs look even more appealing. XRP depends on insider behavior. UNIL grows based on data, not drama. Unilabs' AI tracks activity, community, token health, and more. This week, smart buyers picked structured analytics over Ripple’s risks. UNIL raised $6.8 million in its live presale. The current token price is $0.0074. The next tier is $0.0085, creating urgency for buyers to act now. As Ripple’s XRP price dropped, Unilabs raised over $6.8 million in its ongoing presale. Investors rushed in, especially after seeing UNIL trading at just $0.0074. The next price is set at $0.0085, creating urgency. The platform team launched a referral program and offered the ATH50 code to reward early buyers with a 50% bonus on deposits. This limited-time deal gives users strong upside even before the listing. Unilabs introduced tier-based funds to meet different investor profiles. These include AI Fund, BTC Fund, Mining Fund, and RWA Fund. Each offers optimized exposure using predictive AI models. Each fund rewards $UNIL holders by redistributing 30% of all platform fees. The more $UNIL you hold, the higher your tier and share of rewards. This reward structure creates a consistent yield regardless of market volatility. Conclusion This week proved that hype fades, but trust builds real momentum. XRP price collapsed after the Ripple CEO dumped tokens with zero explanation. That move broke trust and triggered wide sell-offs. Meanwhile, Unilabs gained support by offering tools, data, and rewards. AI helps Unilabs make smarter moves; something XRP can’t control. Demand keeps growing with the Unilabs Finance presale live and bonuses like ATH50 active. Buyers in Stage 4 already report strong gains. Crypto is set to rise again. History shows early buyers always win big. Don’t wait until UNIL hits exchanges. Use the code ATH50, and get 50% more tokens today. Join the presale now before the next surge begins.

The violence between the two countries has now dragged into its third day, with over 33 people killed and more than 168,000 forced to flee. Trump is now using the same playbook he used with India and Pakistan earlier this year: stop the war or forget about trade. On Saturday, Trump said on Truth Social that he spoke to both countries’ leaders and told them clearly; either end this now or face economic punishment. He wrote, “ Both Parties are looking for an immediate Ceasefire and Peace. They are also looking to get back to the ‘Trading Table’ with the United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the fighting STOPS.” Trump makes calls while in Scotland While visiting Scotland for what was supposed to be a mix of diplomacy and golf, Trump made two separate calls to the leaders of Cambodia and Thailand . His first conversation was with Hun Manet, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, where he pushed for “an END to the War.” He also said if the two governments don’t reach a deal soon, he will “not want to make any Deal, with either Country.” Trump didn’t exactly put down the golf club. He had a tee time lined up at his Turnberry resort with one of his sons and U.S. Ambassador to the UK Warren Stephens. But that didn’t stop him from weighing in. “The call with Cambodia has ended, but expect to call back regarding War stoppage and Ceasefire based on what Thailand has to say,” Trump posted. “I am trying to simplify a complex situation!” A few minutes later, Trump called Phumtham Wechayachai, the acting Prime Minister of Thailand. He said Phumtham “wants to have an immediate Ceasefire, and PEACE.” Trump didn’t stop there. He compared this situation to the earlier conflict between India and Pakistan. According to him, the U.S. played a role in ending that flare-up by applying trade pressure. “If you stop it, we’ll do a trade,” Trump said back then. “If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade.” But India’s government publicly denied that version of events. A spokesperson from their foreign ministry said, “The issue of trade didn’t come up in any of these discussions.” Cambodia and Thailand are already deep in Trump’s trade war crosshairs. Just last week, the former president slapped a new 36% tariff on most exports coming from both countries. That move goes into effect on August 1, and the economic pain hasn’t even started. Trump’s latest comments suggest things could get worse if they don’t come to a ceasefire quickly. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-holders-are-about-to-get-rich-heres-why-2/,"XRP is once again capturing the spotlight, with many analysts suggesting a major breakout is underway. Among the loudest and most compelling voices is STEPH IS CRYPTO, a respected chart analyst on X, who believes XRP is repeating a powerful historical pattern, one that could make its holders very rich in the months ahead. A Familiar Pattern with Explosive Potential In a recent chart shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO, XRP’s weekly price action reveals a striking similarity to its 2024 breakout. Last year, XRP spent months consolidating inside an ascending triangle, a bullish formation known for signaling upward price moves. Once the pattern matured, XRP exploded from below $0.70 to over $3.50 in a matter of weeks. Fast forward to 2025, and a nearly identical setup has taken shape. After an extended period of consolidation within a symmetrical triangle, XRP has just broken out to the upside once again. The breakout is visible on the weekly chart and supported by rising volume, an important confirmation of strength. STEPH IS CRYPTO marks this move as the beginning of another major rally, pointing to a continuation of the same bullish structure that led to XRP’s previous surge. #XRP holders are about to get RICH! pic.twitter.com/QSP43FEtRk — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 26, 2025 Fueling the Momentum: Real-World Catalysts This technical setup isn’t happening in isolation. Several fundamental factors are adding fuel to XRP’s upward momentum. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in late 2024, is now being widely adopted within Ripple’s payment network. RLUSD enables seamless on-chain liquidity, making XRP even more effective as a bridge currency for real-time settlements. Meanwhile, Ripple’s years-long legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is effectively over. Judge Torres’ 2023 ruling declared that XRP is not a security in secondary market sales. Though the SEC initially appealed, both sides are now stepping away from further litigation. This legal clarity has boosted investor confidence and unlocked new business opportunities for Ripple and XRP globally. Adding to this bullish outlook is Ripple’s growing role in the future of finance. With multiple central banks and financial institutions exploring CBDCs and blockchain-based settlement solutions, Ripple’s tech stack, and XRP by extension, are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this shift.

As of report time, XRP is trading above $3.70, following its breakout from the symmetrical triangle. The next key resistance sits around the $5 level. If bullish momentum continues, many analysts are targeting the $8–$13 range as part of a broader Wave 3 rally, which often marks the strongest and most impulsive move in Elliott Wave theory. Investor sentiment is rapidly heating up. Social media is buzzing with renewed optimism, and wallet data shows increased accumulation by both retail holders and institutional players. With technicals aligning and fundamentals stronger than ever, XRP may be on the verge of its biggest breakout yet. According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, XRP holders who stayed patient through the quiet months are about to be rewarded. If history is any guide, the next chapter for XRP could be nothing short of explosive.

The trader and analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 326,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is likely done correcting after falling below the $116,000 price level. “Send it.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin’s ABC correction is done and BTC is now targeting new all-time highs at $127,000. Bluntz follows the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a new uptrend after completing an ABC correction. Bitcoin is trading at $117,262 at time of writing. Next up is the Bonk ( BONK ) memecoin. According to the widely followed analyst, BONK is “holding up remarkably well” amid a Bitcoin correction. Bluntz suggests BONK has completed an ABC-wave pattern to the downside and is now poised to hit the $0.000044 price area. “Not only does BONK look like a nice clear ABC has already been put in, but it held strong and defended the lows while BTC dumped… I suspect a rage pump is imminent on BONK.” Source: Bluntz/X BONK is trading at $0.000035 at time of writing.

Hedera’s hashgraph system is gaining interest among enterprise users, especially for apps that need high speed and security. Tron, on the other hand, is growing fast in DeFi and stablecoins, leading many to review its future price targets as demand increases. While Hedera and Tron move ahead with steady gains, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a more active route. With more than $353 million raised in presale and 24.3 billion coins sold, it is building momentum before its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. This week’s X1–X10 miner showcase highlighted the project’s focus on simple and modern mining tools, with both mobile and plug-and-play access. HBAR Forecast Points to Long-Term Growth With Real Adoption Hedera continues to build its name with a network designed for real business use. Its unique hashgraph model brings speed, low costs, and a carbon-negative system, setting it apart from older chains. These traits make it attractive to companies and public agencies needing trusted digital systems. The latest Hedera (HBAR) forecast sees possible prices of $2.20 by 2030, with even higher figures up to $5 in strong market conditions. This is based on Hedera’s use in areas like digital identity, supply chain tracking, and asset tokenization. With backing from firms like Google and IBM, Hedera remains in a good spot for future growth. Hedera still has to compete with other top networks, but its smart design and support for real use cases give it staying power. If business use keeps rising, higher prices could follow, helping Hedera remain a solid layer-1 option. Tron (TRX) Builds Strength With Growing Activity Into 2025 Tron has become a key network in crypto, with more than 200 million accounts and high daily transaction numbers. It’s known for fast speeds, low fees, and strong stablecoin use, especially in DeFi and digital payments. TRX is now trading near $0.09 and moving toward a breakout. Experts point to $0.10 as the key level, with $0.125 as the next goal if interest remains strong. This Tron (TRX) price rise is linked to more activity on tools like JustLend and ongoing upgrades across the chain. Market signals like MACD and RSI also show strength. As more people use Tron for lending and trades, the system gains more trust. Even with ups and downs in the market, Tron’s use and growth could support more price gains through the rest of 2025. New Demo Shows BlockDAG’s Dual Miners in Action on Wednesday BlockDAG drew attention this week by showing its dual mining setup in a live demo. The X1 mobile app worked smoothly with the X10 plug-and-play miner. This test did more than show features. It proved that BlockDAG’s mining idea is already working. The X1 app lets users track and control mining from anywhere. The X10 miner runs right out of the box. Together, they show a new way of mining that could reach more people. This progress comes as BlockDAG leads the market with its presale. So far, it has raised over $353 million, sold more than 24.3 billion coins, and delivered over 18,680 miners. Batch 29 is set at $0.0276, but for now, a limited price of $0.0016 runs until August 11. With the launch price set at $0.05, that creates a chance for a 3,025% return from this level. From the first batch to now, the growth is already 2,660%. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11 will highlight major updates and mark a key step forward. With strong presale results, a working product shown, and the $0.0016 rate still live, BlockDAG is moving at full speed. For those following its progress, this isn’t the start. The build is already in motion. Next Steps for Major Networks Hedera keeps drawing interest for business use with its fast and secure system and stable network control. Tron continues to grow, especially in DeFi and stablecoin use. The Hedera (HBAR) forecast and Tron (TRX) price growth reflect how these networks are holding their ground. Still, BlockDAG stands out with a strong presale, a proven mining setup, and a rare price point ahead of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With the $0.0016 deal ending soon, it gives a limited early-stage chance. For those looking across the market for the best crypto to buy now , BlockDAG’s pace and working tools make it a project to watch closely.

Earnings released by major card issuers showed that total new credit card accounts fell by 5% in Q2, the first drop in over a year. Executives from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Capital One, and American Express all pointed to a clear reason: tightening requirements, especially for lower-end customers. These banks are turning away applicants they see as higher risk, mostly people with lower credit scores or less financial flexibility. They’re adjusting who gets to be a cardholder and leaning harder into the wealthy segment of their user base. This selective approach is becoming more obvious as premium products get the spotlight and mass-market offerings take a back seat. Banks tighten approvals for lower-income consumers Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank told analysts this week that the “highest, fastest-growing part” of the company’s card business has come from “heavier spenders.” Last month, his firm opened a new luxury airport lounge at JFK in New York, reserved for holders of its $395-a-year Venture X card. That lounge includes a cheesemonger station. This focus on premium isn’t limited to Capital One. Both JPMorgan and Citigroup rolled out upgraded high-end cards in recent weeks, while American Express said it plans to update its Platinum card later this year. But while perks go up at the top, access is shrinking below. The Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Survey reported that more banks increased credit card approval standards than eased them in 2025. American Express revealed a 6% drop in new account openings compared to last year. Still, the company reported that the average annual fee per card rose from $101 to $117, pointing to higher adoption of its premium products. The bank isn’t alone in zeroing in on high-income applicants. That strategy includes more aggressive targeting. In April, more than 87% of card-related mail was prescreened, meaning offers were sent only to consumers who already passed certain credit score checks. It’s the highest such share since 2022. Megan Cipperly, vice president at marketing analysis firm Competiscan, said the volume of offers has narrowed to a specific group. “Only a small subset of consumers are receiving the lion’s share of credit-card offers, and they’re not necessarily the ones who need more credit,” Megan said. She noted that consumers with excellent credit scores account for less than 25% of the credit-card market, but they’re getting the most attention. Banks are going after this group hard because they swipe often and pay on time. Every swipe brings the bank an interchange fee, and high-score users usually clear their balances monthly, keeping defaults low. At American Express, flat overall airline spending disguised a deeper trend. Travelers in economy weren’t spending more, but spending on first-class seats rose 10%. On top of that, short-term rentals over $5,000 rose 9%. The premium customer base is growing and spending big. Low-income cardholders struggle as costs climb While high earners drive revenue, the rest of the market is showing signs of stress. Card balances are increasing. That’s a red flag. It means many households are spending more than they can afford. On top of that, credit has gotten even more expensive. The average interest rate on credit cards hit 24.35% this month, based on data from LendingTree. Despite the pressure, delinquency rates have stayed steady. But banks remain cautious. Speaking during JPMorgan’s earnings call, CEO Jamie Dimon said, “The U.S. economy remained resilient in the quarter.” Still, Jamie made it clear that “significant risks persist.” The overall picture is simple. Trump is in office, and under his economic leadership, banks are becoming more conservative with lending. Wealthy Americans are still spending, flying front-of-cabin, and booking luxury rentals. But millions of other Americans are being quietly shut out. If you don’t have excellent credit, don’t expect a welcome letter from a bank anytime soon.

According to the filing, the company plans to use XRP not just as a treasury reserve but for real-time payments and income generation. Pro-Ripple Lawyer Weighs In On XRP Filing In a July 25 X social media post , Morgan shared his take on Wellgistics Health’s S-1 filing submitted to the US SEC a day earlier. He argued that this goes beyond the standard use of XRP as a treasury reserve asset . According to Morgan’s analysis, the document reveals a multifaceted strategic vision that embeds XRP deeply into the company’s financial infrastructure and operational model. Unlike companies that merely hold crypto as a hedge or speculative asset, Wellgistics Health plans to integrate XRP into various core functions. Firstly, the company intends to use the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to implement a real-time, low-cost payment system facilitating transactions between itself, pharmacy customers, and manufacturing and vendor partners. According to a crypto community member, this marks a strong use case for XRP in Business-to-Business (B2B) payments and real-world commerce. Morgan also revealed that Wellgistics Health stated in its S-1 filing that it aims to raise capital through equity or debt securities and allocate proceeds toward acquiring more XRP. The firm plans to leverage its XRP holdings as collateral for funding activities, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s role in capital markets. Moreover, the company suggests it will generate income from XRP-based activities, further underlining the asset’s utility beyond speculative trading . This comprehensive strategy positions XRP as a possible financial instrument for collateralization, daily payments, and multiple income streams. Morgan sees these future developments and opportunities as a significant step in proving XRP’s enterprise viability. Skepticism Grows Despite Bold XRP Plans Amid growing attention around XRP’s evolving use cases , Wellgistics Health’s SEC S-1 filing has stirred both enthusiasm and skepticism across the crypto community. While some XRP supporters see this as further validation of the token’s utility in business and finance, others remain cautious. Community members noted the novelty of a healthcare company embracing a “ banker’s coin ” like XRP, lightheartedly suggesting that broader mainstream adoption may follow soon. Former securities lawyer Mark Fagel added a layer of scrutiny, highlighting Wellgistics Health’s minimal assets, net losses, and a “Going Concern” warning in its audit report. This raised concerns that the company may be using XRP more as a marketing or fundraising tool rather than for actual utility and cross-border payments . In response, Morgan acknowledged the possibility that WH might be leveraging the crypto narrative to attract investors, but also pointed out that the company’s plans align with a growing trend of crypto integration into corporate strategies.

The company stated that BTC has entered a classic “bull flag” formation, a positive technical structure often seen following rapid price increases. According to MakroVision's analysis, the most critical short-term resistance level for Bitcoin is the Fibonacci retracement at around $121,100. Breaking this level could trigger a new upward wave. Meanwhile, support at around $113,600 coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, and a potential return to this level would be considered a healthy technical correction. Related News: Last Week's Most Successful Major Cryptocurrency Whale Revealed: Here Are Their Positions and Profit Amounts! The firm said that if BTC can sustain above $106,000, the medium-term bullish momentum will be maintained. The analysis indicates that if Bitcoin breaks above $121,000, the 1.382 Fibonacci extension point at around $129,600 will be highlighted. If this level is also broken, the next target could be around $133,800. *This is not investment advice.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 20:40:00

The flow began picking up at the end of last year and hasn’t slowed. In June, $3.9 billion was pulled out of U.S. Treasuries while $10 billion went into high-grade corporate bonds on both continents. By July, another $13 billion was added just to U.S. investment-grade corporate debt—making it the largest monthly buy since 2015, according to Bloomberg. This is no minor reallocation. For decades, U.S. government debt was the most trusted instrument in global markets. But now, rising fiscal deficits and ballooning interest costs are making Treasuries less appealing to institutional investors. Michaël Nizard, who manages portfolios at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, began pulling away from sovereign debt late last year. He said he’s kept that position steady ever since. Wall Street sees credit strength while governments pile on debt The U.S. government’s spending problem isn’t new, but the pressure has been increasing. Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, signed during his first term and now continuing to impact revenue during his second presidency, is projected to add about $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. This projection came from the Congressional Budget Office. At the same time, interest costs are climbing. By 2035, debt payments could consume 30% of the country’s revenue. That compares with 18% expected this year and just 9% four years ago. Those numbers contributed to a major downgrade. In May, Moody’s Ratings stripped the U.S. of its last AAA rating, bringing it down to Aa1. The agency specifically cited the growing deficit and the government’s rising interest burden. That rating cut has added to the sense that Treasuries are no longer untouchable. Still, the shift toward corporate debt hasn’t been rapid. The U.S. government doesn’t borrow in foreign currency and has the ability to print dollars. That gives it flexibility that most countries don’t have. Even during the tariff standoff in April, Treasuries performed better than company bonds, even though both markets saw falling prices. Foreign demand also hasn’t dried up—international holdings of Treasuries increased in May. But corporate bonds have started to look more attractive for other reasons. While governments rack up obligations, companies have posted relatively strong earnings. More U.S. firms have beaten Wall Street estimates this earnings season than during the same stretch last year. That’s been enough for major asset managers like BlackRock to favor credit. In a note last week, their team wrote, “Credit has become a clear choice for quality.” Spreads tighten, but demand for company debt holds Valuations for company bonds have been running high, which points to strong demand. U.S. high-grade corporate spreads have stayed below 80 basis points through July. That’s well below the 10-year average of 120 basis points based on Bloomberg index data. In Europe, euro-denominated investment-grade spreads averaged around 85 basis points for the same period, lower than the 123 basis point average over the past decade. But not everyone is sold on this rally. Gershon Distenfeld, who runs funds at AllianceBernstein, has already started cutting back on credit exposure. He reduced his position that favored corporate risk over rate risk earlier in July. Dominique Braeuninger at Schroders echoed that view. She said spreads were too tight to justify the risk of diving further into corporate debt. BlackRock may be backing credit overall, but even they’re taking a cautious approach. The firm is avoiding long-term high-grade notes because of how little they pay relative to risk. Instead, they’ve gone overweight on short-term corporate credit, where the balance looks more favorable. Still, for many fund managers, the picture is shifting. Governments aren’t offering the same sense of security they used to. Jason Simpson, a senior fixed income strategist at State Street, said, “What we’ve seen on the government fiscal side is not great news. Corporates seem to be chugging along nicely.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|EUR|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 20:50:05

This accusation followed his criticism of the banking giant for charging fintech companies for access to customer banking data. In a recent post on X , Winklevoss said JPMorgan paused Gemini’s onboarding process right after he spoke out against the bank’s new policy. Tyler Winklevoss Says JPMorgan’s New Policy is Harmful The controversy began when a Bloomberg report revealed that JPMorgan plans to implement fees for fintech firms that require access to bank data for their services. This includes apps and services that help users buy crypto, manage finances, or use digital wallets. Winklevoss called this policy “anti-competitive” and warned that it could hurt innovation in fintech and cryptocurrency. Although JPMorgan has not yet publicly addressed the recent allegations, this situation has raised worries for the fintech and crypto sectors. They fear that new fees could make it harder for smaller companies to compete and may strengthen the hold of traditional banks. Notably, Winklevoss’s comments reflect a growing conflict between traditional banks and new financial technologies. As more people adopt crypto, partnerships between banks and crypto platforms have become essential. However, moves like JPMorgan’s could hinder this growth, particularly for platforms like Gemini that depend on easy banking connections. JPMorgan Discusses Blockchain’s Role in Capital Markets Meanwhile, JPMorgan has taken a proactive step in shaping digital asset regulation by meeting with the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, also known as the Crypto Task Force. As reported by TheCoinRise, executives from JPMorgan and members of the crypto division discussed the broader implications of blockchain adoption in traditional markets. Topics included risk assessment, benefits of decentralization, and how firms like JPMorgan could position themselves competitively in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The bank also highlighted its current presence in the crypto ecosystem. Its digital platform facilitates repurchase agreements, a critical segment of short-term lending under its “Digital Financing” and “Digital Debt Services” categories. Donald Trump Connection and Regulatory Shadows Recall that the cryptocurrency exchange has taken a significant step towards an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Gemini has filed a confidential draft registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Beyond its market ambitions, Gemini has also garnered political attention . The Winklevoss twins, prominent figures in both crypto and politics, each contributed $1 million to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Though political affiliations aren’t directly tied to the IPO, such connections add a layer of public scrutiny and regulatory sensitivity. The confidential filing structure may be a strategic move to minimize premature exposure and potential backlash. Nonetheless, the firm’s decision to move forward indicates growing optimism within the crypto sector.

The firm aims to build a treasury of up to 3,000 BTC, currently worth around $354 million, over the next 12 months. The company cited the depreciation of fiat currencies like the yen and rising global financial uncertainty as key drivers behind the move. Until now, neither GPT nor any of its subsidiaries had included digital assets in their balance sheets. “In order to efficiently manage surplus funds generated from existing businesses, diversify our asset portfolio to strengthen our financial base, preserve value over the medium- to long-term, and reduce foreign exchange risks, we have decided to add bitcoin to our reserve assets,” the company wrote.

The alert follows increasing reports of fraudulent accounts impersonating Ripple and its executives, with the aim of tricking users into sending their XRP. Ripple Warns Investors Of Rising XRP Scams On July 23, Garlinghouse took to X social media to raise the alarm on a sharp rise in XRP scams, urging investors and community members to stay alert. According to the Ripple CEO, scammers are capitalizing on market momentum and community excitement to ramp up impersonation schemes, particularly targeting unsuspecting XRP holders. Related Reading: How Ripple Is Taking On SWIFT To Grab 14% Market Share As XRP Price Surges One of the most notable developments flagged by Garlinghouse is a recent surge in fraudulent activity on YouTube, where scammers have taken over existing channels, rebranded them to resemble recognized Ripple accounts, and begun promoting misleading content that impersonates the crypto company and its executives. In its official X account, the Ripple team stressed that these YouTube accounts are legitimate and do not belong to the crypto firm, despite appearing convincing. In many cases, the usernames have been altered to mimic the company’s official handles, often making it difficult for unsuspecting users to identify the deception. These scam videos frequently promise giveaways, rewards, or investment multipliers, usually asking users and investors to send XRP in exchange for a larger return. Garlinghouse has emphasized that neither he nor Ripple will ever request XRP from anyone under any circumstances. To combat the growing threat of skyrocketing crypto scams, Ripple is actively and aggressively reporting these fraudulent accounts and encouraging its community to do the same. The company has reiterated that its official channels remain the only trusted sources of communication and provides a direct reminder to always verify account handles and links before engaging. Notably, Garlinghouse concluded his post with an important reminder to stay vigilant against avoidable losses. He warned that “if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.” Ripple Alert Highlights Broader Threat Amid Market Recovery Beyond the immediate focus on the YouTube impersonation scams, Garlinghouse’s report touches on a broader trend of escalating crypto fraud that tends to spike during periods of market recovery or growing optimism. This pattern, described by the Ripple CEO as “like clockwork,” suggests that malicious actors closely monitor community sentiment and time their campaigns to exploit emotional and financial excitement.

In a broader context, the rise in XRP scams has coincided with the recent surge in the altcoin’s price to above $3.6.

Should Holders Be Worried?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-approaching-overbought-territory-should-holders-be-worried/,"XRP has experienced a strong upward surge in recent weeks, hitting an intraday high of $3.21 before settling around $3.18 at the time of writing. While this momentum has excited many in the crypto space, popular analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has flagged a potentially cautionary signal: XRP is entering overbought territory on the weekly Stochastic RSI. This raises an important question: Should holders be concerned? Weekly Stoch RSI Suggests a Cooling Phase May Be Ahead STEPH IS CRYPTO’s technical analysis highlights that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index on the weekly timeframe is now at 90.31 and 81.99—well above the 80 mark that signals overbought conditions. Historically, when XRP’s Stoch RSI reaches this range, the price tends to experience short-term pullbacks or sideways consolidation. In previous cycles, these conditions preceded brief corrections before XRP resumed its upward trajectory. The current setup appears similar, with the indicator flashing red-hot momentum and suggesting that the asset might soon take a breather. #XRP is approaching ‘overbought’ territory.. Should we be worried? pic.twitter.com/xX9thFJYTf — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 26, 2025 What’s Fueling XRP’s Price Action? Beyond the charts, XRP’s recent price rally is being driven by a mix of strong fundamentals, positive sentiment, and speculation. Excitement continues to build around the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF , while Ripple’s aggressive push into real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and CBDC adoption is keeping investor interest high. The launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and the expanding use of the XRP Ledger for global payments are reinforcing the bullish narrative. However, the market was recently rattled by a massive transfer of $175 million worth of XRP by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen to centralized exchanges. This sparked concerns over possible sell pressure and led to over $105 million in long position liquidations. XRP briefly dipped to $3.11, but the market quickly stabilized, suggesting underlying strength despite the shakeout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Should Holders Be Worried? From a technical standpoint, XRP is undeniably overbought on the weekly chart. This doesn’t guarantee a crash, but it often signals that upward momentum may slow down, at least temporarily. For short-term traders, it might be wise to monitor price action closely, reduce risk exposure, or consider partial profit-taking. For long-term investors, however, the broader picture remains encouraging. XRP is widely believed to be in Wave 3 of an Elliott Wave structure, a phase typically marked by powerful gains. With regulatory clarity in the U.S., growing utility, and expanding partnerships, XRP appears well-positioned for continued growth beyond the short-term noise. Final Thoughts XRP’s entry into overbought territory is a valid technical concern, but not necessarily a reason for alarm. As STEPH IS CRYPTO rightly points out, indicators like the Stoch RSI often precede pauses in price action, not full trend reversals. With strong fundamentals and ongoing institutional interest, XRP’s longer-term outlook remains positive. Holders would do well to stay informed, manage risk appropriately, and view any short-term dips as potential setups for the next major move.

49007177,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=774424,1753564231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49007177.jpeg,São Paulo faces major job and economic losses if the U.S. goes ahead with a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/brazil-governors-blame-lula-for-mishandling-u-s-relations-amid-tariff-risk/,"Faced with the looming prospect of a 50% U.S. tariff set for Aug. 1, officials in Brazil’s richest state are rushing to soften the blow on local companies and jobs. Governor Tarcísio de Freitas said on Saturday that as many as 120,000 positions could disappear and gross state product might fall 2.7 % if the U.S. goes ahead with the tariff. Speaking at a forum hosted by XP Inc. in the state capital, he warned that “the possibility of Caterpillar moving its output to another country” is worrisome, along with the ripple effects on small coffee growers, the orange sector, and aircraft maker Embraer. According to a Bloomberg report state will give five‑year loans to help firms with cash needs. The governor said his team is also talking to U.S. lawmakers, companies, and officials to explain the danger and push for changes. Brazilian governors criticize Lula over tariff dispute Freitas shared the stage with governors Ratinho Junior of Paraná and Ronaldo Caiado of Goiás. They asked the federal government to talk with the U.S., saying the tariff could hurt meat plants and organic sugar producers in their states. They criticized President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s handling of relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, noting they had not been consulted before key decisions. “Governors were not consulted by the federal government on these decisions,” Caiado said. Ratinho Junior added that former president Jair Bolsonaro “is not more important than the trade relationship between Brazil and the U.S.” All three leaders are seen as potential challengers to Lula in next year’s election. Meanwhile in the U.S the Trump administration is preparing a fresh emergency declaration to justify the tariff, according to people familiar with internal discussions. Because Brazil runs a goods trade deficit with the United States, unlike most targets of earlier tariff actions, officials are said to be seeking a different legal basis. Staff from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative briefed congressional aides this week on the plan, the sources said. Neither USTR nor the White House commented publicly. The news sent the Brazilian real down as much as 1% against the dollar on the day. Lula urges calm before the U.S tariff storm President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva spoke lightly about the threat of U.S. duties, saying Brazil will respond if the tariffs take effect but won’t pick fights it doesn’t need. At a July event in São Paulo , he stressed the need to safeguard Brazil’s sovereignty and economy. If Washington imposes its planned charges, Lula said Brazil will act, yet always in keeping with its values and global partnerships. His new finance minister echoed former President Haddad’s assurance that Brazil will not go after U.S. firms on Brazilian soil. He added that Brazil’s aim is fair trade, not tit‑for‑tat retaliation. The tariff threat, first aired earlier this month, is widely viewed as support for Bolsonaro, who faces trial over an alleged effort to overturn his 2022 loss. Trump has urged Lula to drop what he calls a “witch hunt” against his ally. Lula, for his part, has insisted the judiciary is independent and has hinted at retaliatory steps if duties are imposed. In a Friday address, the Brazilian president said Trump had been “misled” about the case. “If President Trump had called me, I certainly would have explained to him what’s happening with the former president,” Lula said. “Bolsonaro is not being persecuted; he is being tried.” Two Brazilian officials familiar with the situation argue that drafting a new emergency order shows the 50% rate is “a sanction in search of legal justification.” While Trump could still alter the number, the levy, if enacted, would take effect in less than a week, keeping state and federal authorities on both sides of the dispute working against the clock.

With more pro-crypto bills on the way, the markets have responded. Altcoins are rallying, and Cardano and Solana have returned to the spotlight. As the attention of institutional and retail investors converges on these major Layer‑1 blockchains, a newcomer, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is quietly stealing the show with an explosive early performance on the cusp of exchange listings. Cardano (ADA): Technical Revival Amid On-Chain Slowdown Cardano has reasserted itself as a chart darling in July 2025, climbing from a dip at $0.73 to hover near $0.85. Recent institutional signals add to the optimism with ADA spiking 15% on July 17 following news of new partnerships and integration upgrades. Key among them is interoperability with the XRP Ledger via Tokeo Wallet and EMURGO’s rollout of a “Cardano Card” for real-world spending. The network’s ecosystem also expanded to 2,005 active decentralized applications, which indicates that developer and user interest remain robust. Even as the on-chain metrics remain soft for Cardano with slow transaction growth, slump in DeFi TVL, and declining fee revenue, a regulatory tailwind and upcoming ETF clarity suggest ADA may be poised for another breakout. Solana (SOL): Outpacing the Competition Solana continues to show strength. Despite retracing to around $141 recently, SOL has rebounded sharply—up about 35% in July to trade near $177—and now targets a $220 resistance zone. Fundamentals also favor SOL. Solana leads in memecoin and NFT transaction volumes, accounting for nearly 60% of blockchain memecoin activity. Institutional interest is accelerating with more companies building SOL Treasury, and the debut of the first Solana‑focused ETF (SSK) in the US has brought more mainstream access to SOL, as everyone waits for the first spot SOL ETFs. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Grabbing Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE has fast‑emerged as a dark‑horse player in Crypto Week’s renewed frenzy. With its presale-to-exchange gains already past 175% , it’s proving its narrative has more than hype to it. The project has already drawn in a serious user base and engaged community by laying the groundwork for explosive liquidity once it hits listings on the centralized and decentralized exchange, which is on its roadmap. What’s Fueling the Current Altcoin Boom? We’re witnessing a post‑legislation rally. President Donald Trump’s signing of the GENIUS Act into law and the other pro-crypto legislative efforts in the US have unlocked fresh capital as regulatory clarity now supports market re-entry. In this shift, established altcoins Cardano and Solana are benefiting directly, but narrative-rich, utility-driven community projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE stand to gain even more. Final Thoughts ADA and SOL are surging on technicals and institutional tailwinds amidst major wins for the crypto sector. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale-to-exchange momentum and vibrant community signal a fresh contender and the Next Big Listing Play?

The losses amount to tens of millions, and it’s expected that more will be identified. An Elaborate Scheme The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Washington filed a civil action on Tuesday, demanding the forfeiture of cryptocurrency assets valued at roughly $7.1 million. The funds were seized during an investigation into a scheme involving fraudulent investment in oil and gas, which Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller announced. The assets are only a fraction of the $97 million obtained by coconspirators between June 2022 and July 2024, which Homeland Security Investigations seized in December last year. “The co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,” said Attorney Miller. “Federal investigators and prosecutors in our office moved as quickly as possible to trace and seize the cryptocurrency so that some of the losses can be returned to victims.” According to the filing and other case records, the plot was presented as escrow accounts for purchasing oil tank storage in either Rotterdam, the Netherlands, or Houston, which spanned from at least August 2022 through August 2024. The victims were convinced to send money to these accounts, where the conspirators indicated that investors could make significant profits by renting out the oil tank storage to others. At least seven separate entities have been marked where funds were sent. However, the good news ended there, as once the funds were sent, no further information on the investment was provided, and the co-schemers just stopped replying. How The Funds Were Moved A resident from Newcastle, Washington, Geoffrey K. Auyeung, 47, was indicted as a coconspirator in the U.S in August 2024, being charged with receiving the majority of the funds generated by the deceptive plan. The money was quickly shuffled to one or more of at least 81 accounts at various institutions, either offshore or not, or to one of the at least 19 different crypto accounts. The assets were then funneled into various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, USDT, USDC, and Ethereum, the majority of which was further transferred to accounts at the Binance exchange. The forfeiture filing further states that the crypto accounts, which were seized, were linked to individuals in Russia and Nigeria, where some of the victims’ funds, used to purchase digital assets, were also sent to exchanges in those countries. At least one of the money markets in Russia or Nigeria is alleged to have facilitated money laundering for transnational criminal organizations, including terrorist organizations and other parties that have been known to violate international trade sanctions. At the time of Auyeung’s arrest, $2.3 million was seized from his bank accounts, which is in addition to the $7.1 million in crypto the government is seeking to forfeit. If the court approves the forfeiture, the funds will be distributed accordingly to the victims. Investigators, so far, have identified dozens of such cases, with the total amount of exploits reaching approximately $17.9 million, which is expected to grow as more casualties are identified.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $118,100 (+1.1%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $118,544 24-hour low $117,700 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $118,100 Price Prediction $ 128,009 (10.76%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 1.77% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $ 106,055 200-Day SMA $ 87,760 14-Day RSI 54.56 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin surges above $118K. Resistance for BTC is at $119,883 Support for BTC/USD is at $114,519 The BTC price analysis for 26 July confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price moved toward $118K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation above Fib levels. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces buying demand above $118K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faced minor bullish recovery as it surged toward $118K after a strong rejection. Currently, buyers are triggering minor domination, resulting in a move above immediate Fib levels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $950 million, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $118,100, surging by over 1.1% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades around the bullish region at 60, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $116K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.12, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $119,883, it will fuel a bullish rally to $123,344. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $114,519, beginning a bearish trend to $107,425. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $118,100. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-26 21:40:00
