Periods of price correction for established altcoins often shift focus toward top presale crypto offerings—projects with the potential for substantial returns. These presales allow early participation at discounted rates before exchange listings. This article explores several top presale crypto projects making a splash this February, including Web3Bay (3BAY), which has already raised over $1.2 million in its presale, selling over 300 million tokens. Web3Bay: The Top Presale Crypto Shaking Up Online Shopping! Web3Bay aims to transform online shopping by eliminating centralized intermediaries like Amazon and eBay. Traditional e-commerce platforms often suffer from high transaction fees, restrictive policies, and data control problems. Web3Bay tackles these issues by providing a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers connect directly via the blockchain. The platform utilizes smart contracts, ensuring secure and transparent transactions. Unlike centralized marketplaces, Web3Bay avoids arbitrary user restrictions. Governance is managed by 3BAY token holders through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), putting community members in control of the platform’s future. Web3Bay Presale: Stats You Won’t Believe! Over $1.2 million raised in early presale stages. More than 300 million 3BAY tokens sold. Current price: $0.00456 in Stage 4. Projected launch price: $0.1959, representing a potential 4,200% return on investment for early participants. Beyond decentralization, Web3Bay offers staking rewards, enabling token holders to earn passive income while benefiting from the platform’s growth. As blockchain technology continues to reshape traditional industries, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a top presale crypto contender for 2025. MIND of Pepe: AI-Powered Market Intelligence MIND of Pepe enhances crypto trading with an AI-driven system that analyzes market trends and delivers real-time insights. Unlike traditional analysis tools, this AI agent interacts with decentralized applications (dApps) and monitors social media sentiment to identify opportunities early. $MIND holders gain access to AI-generated reports, predictive trading signals, and automated crypto strategies. This approach empowers traders to make well-informed decisions without constant market monitoring. This is a top presale crypto with a unique offering. Best Wallet: The All-in-One Wallet Solution Best Wallet is a comprehensive crypto wallet designed to simplify Web3 interactions. Supporting over 60 blockchains, it facilitates seamless fiat-to-crypto conversion, staking, and provides a built-in launchpad for early token access. Holding $BEST tokens unlocks advantages, including reduced trading fees, priority access to new crypto projects, and enhanced staking rewards. Investors also participate in governance decisions, influencing the platform’s development. This top presale crypto aims to be the best in its class. Meme Index: A Structured Approach to Meme Coin Investing Meme Index offers a structured way to invest in meme coins by grouping top-performing tokens into a diversified portfolio. Instead of chasing individual meme coins, investors can gain exposure through curated indexes like the Moonshot Index, Titan Index, and Frenzy Index. With $MEMEX currently priced at $0.0157812 and offering Supercharged APY staking rewards of 693%, this top presale crypto is attracting attention from those seeking to capitalize on the meme coin trend while managing risk. Wall Street Pepe: A Meme Coin with Utility Unlike many meme coins, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) provides more than just hype. It offers market insights, trading signals, and a community-driven ecosystem that aims to connect meme culture with serious investing. Currently priced at $0.0003665, it offers staking rewards of 18% APY, making it an appealing option for investors seeking meme coins with long-term potential. This top presale crypto has a strong community. A Quick Recap As the crypto market experiences its natural fluctuations, presales provide a chance to invest early in projects with high potential before they become widely available on exchanges. Projects like Web3Bay, MIND of Pepe, and Best Wallet are introducing innovations that could drive significant adoption in 2025. Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as a particularly compelling top presale crypto investment due to its real-world utility, decentralized e-commerce model, and strong investor interest. With blockchain adoption increasing, the demand for trustless, fee-efficient marketplaces is greater than ever. With a projected 4,200% ROI for early investors, Web3Bay is a top opportunity in 2025.

The altcoin season many traders hoped for is fading, except for one AI-powered token, which analysts say will still rally 1,000x. This isn’t just speculation. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI altcoin is defying the market slump and positioning itself as the biggest crypto opportunity of 2025. With its successful presale, the AI altcoin is set to deliver exponential gains, and early investors are piling in before the price explodes! Bitcoin’s Market Surge Stalls Altcoin Growth—But Not WallitIQ (WLTQ). As Bitcoin’s (BTC) price consolidates and its dominance rises, altcoins are getting crushed. Investors are hesitant, and liquidity is drying up across the board. Historically, an altcoin season follows Bitcoin (BTC) bull runs, but this time, Bitcoin (BTC) is absorbing the liquidity and leaving smaller tokens behind. Yet, there is an exception: WallitIQ (WLTQ), an AI-powered altcoin proving strong amidst the season crunch. Unlike other altcoins that rely on speculative hype, this AI altcoin is built on real-world utility, AI-driven analytics, and a next-gen crypto wallet management system. Unlike meme coins and speculative tokens, this AI altcoin offers investors AI-powered financial solutions, making it immune to market cycles. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The AI Altcoin Set To Defy Bitcoin’s (BTC) Dominance With A 1000x Surge. Bitcoin (BTC) gave early investors a life-changing opportunity. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is now offering that same chance. With a seemingly low price of $0.0420 and a projected 1000x price explosion in the coming months, Investors are in for jaw-dropping profits despite the crash in the altcoin season. WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just about projection but use-case technology and robust fundamental features like the MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management App, powered by AI. Its features include simulated transactions which allow users to test crypto transactions in a risk-free environment without using real assets and interacting with actual blockchain. The Live Market Data feature of the app integrates with the CoinGecko API to provide real-time price tracking with interactive charts and detailed analytics. Other features to be expected on the app include AI-powered bots that simplify trades and predict profitable market movements. The MVP app is unlike anything available in this altcoin season and in crypto today. This AI-driven crypto wallet management system gives investors full control over their assets while using AI to maximize profits. Security is of top priority to the platform, hence a smart contract audit by SolidProof to ascertain maximum transparency and investor security. This has helped to boost investor’s confidence in the project. It is worth mentioning that millions of the AI altcoin’s total supply is reserved and allocated for airdrops & community rewards as giveaways, staking rewards , and exclusive bonuses for early adopters. Additionally, the token has an automatic burn mechanism that reduces supply and drives up prices over time, a major driver for why the AI altcoin is standing firm in this altcoin season. Don’t Throw Away Your Shot! Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dominance may be stalling altcoin season, but WallitIQ (WLTQ) is proving that AI-powered tokens are the future. The presale is still open at $0.0420 , but not for long as tokens are fast selling out. With the project’s impressive technology, benefits attached, and a mouth-watering 1000x rally on the way, the AI altcoin is a must-have investment. With the altcoin season fading out, this is your shot at making generational wealth in this bull run. Join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale today before the window closes. Hurry and accumulate as many tokens as possible.

Bitcoin: Popular Investor Says Memecoin More Superior With ‘World’s Best Chart’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-vs-bitcoin-popular-investor-says-memecoin-more-superior-with-worlds-best-chart/,"A known crypto investor made a bold claim that Dogecoin is the king of all cryptocurrencies, stirring a debate and discussion among members of the cryptocurrency community. Global Macro Investor founder and CEO Raoul Pal believes that the popular meme coin is capable of becoming “the hardest money ever created,” citing how Dogecoin has outperformed Bitcoin historically. Related Reading: TRUMP Coin Spikes 17% As Arthur Hayes Says It Could Outperform Bitcoin ‘Greatest Chart Of All Time’ Pal asserted the superiority of the prominent meme coin to Bitcoin, saying that its dominance could make it the “hardest” currency ever created. The top executive’s recent statement made ripples in the crypto community by making a strong argument that Dogecoin is better than the firstborn cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. One of the most WILD things in all of crypto is that $DOGE has proven to be harder money than $BTC and has outperformed by 550% since launch (10 years!) and looks like it might even to continue to outperform over time!🤣 What a time to be alive… pic.twitter.com/3EXQFEzPsb — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) November 24, 2024 In a recent broadcast on his X account, the Global Macro Investor CEO showed the chart of Dogecoin, which he described as super-bullish, branding it as the “greatest chart of all time.” Pal is known to be a staunch supporter of Dogecoin and previously revealed that the popular meme coin is among his favorite assets. The advisory publication executive has disclosed in previous interviews that he owns a large concentration of Dogecoin in his portfolio. Join me for Drinks… https://t.co/yl7VSaYeHt — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) February 11, 2025 Dogecoin Superiority Theory The former hedge fund manager believes that the meme coin is “the king of all cryptocurrencies”, saying that Dogecoin trumping Bitcoin is a possibility that could happen in the future. Pal considers the popular token as superior to Bitcoin, rooting his claim on Dogecoin outperforming Bitcoin historically. He further supported his Dogecoin superiority theory by noting that the meme coin has outdone the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, outperforming Bitcoin’s by an astounding 500% since it was created. CEO Foresees Dogecoin Extending Its Gains Data shows that Pal’s assumption is accurate since the numbers do not lie. Statistics indicate that Dogecoin has outperformed the flagship cryptocurrency since its debut in 2013. When it was launched, DOGE’s price was $0.00056 per coin but now that price has skyrocketed by 461,407%. In comparison, during Dogecoin’s launching, the Bitcoin price was pegged at $1,210 per coin. Now, the crypto is being traded at $96,340, a 7,862% increase since then.

As of writing, DOGE is being traded at $0.269 per token with a market cap of $39 billion. Pal argued that once Dogecoin scores a breakout against Bitcoin, it will earn the title of the hardest money in the world, claiming DOGE will become the new standard and dethrone Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency top dog. Meanwhile, some analysts take the prediction with a grain of salt. They say that Pal’s predictions might be too ambitious, considering the gap in quality between the two digital assets.

With bullish momentum expected to continue, many are shifting toward undervalued altcoins moving their funds to strengthen their portfolios. A low cap AI-powered altcoin transforming real estate tokenization, is gaining traction for its unique approach and strong growth prospects. With AI-driven technology and exclusive benefits, analysts predict a massive 33,000% increase in 2025 as adoption and mainstream interest rise. Why Dogecoin Traders Are Seeking New Opportunities Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the most recognized altcoins in the market. Originally launched as a meme, it has built a strong community and gained support from influential figures like Elon Musk. Despite its widespread popularity, Dogecoin has struggled to maintain momentum. Its price remains stagnant due to limited utility beyond speculative trading. As a result, many Dogecoin traders are shifting their focus to emerging altcoins with stronger growth potential and real-world applications. PropiChain: A Low Cap Altcoin Attracting Dogecoin Traders with a 33,000% Surge PropiChain is disrupting the $600 trillion real estate industry by integrating advanced technology to simplify property transactions. The platform introduces a modern approach to buying, selling, and investing in real estate on a global scale, setting it apart from traditional investments, including altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE). By integrating blockchain-based smart contracts, PropiChain streamlines property deals and enhances security. These contracts automate lease agreements, property transfers, and rental payments, minimizing the need for intermediaries like brokers and agents. Removing middlemen makes transactions faster, more affordable, and less prone to fraud. The transparency and immutability of blockchain ensure that all transactions are securely recorded, creating a verifiable and tamper-proof property ownership history. PropiChain also incorporates Metaverse technology, transforming how investors and buyers engage with real estate. Immersive 3D virtual tours allow users to explore properties remotely, eliminating geographical barriers and expanding investment opportunities. This advancement makes real estate more accessible to a global audience. An investor in New York can virtually tour a beachfront villa in Thailand or a luxury apartment in Dubai without ever leaving home. By integrating Metaverse technology, this altcoin increases transparency, enables real-time interactions between buyers and sellers, and removes logistical challenges that have traditionally slowed real estate transactions. A key innovation within PropiChain’s ecosystem is Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which converts physical properties into digital assets. This allows investors to own fractional shares in high-value real estate, significantly lowering market entry barriers. The platform also harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance real estate investment strategies. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide 24/7 support, while predictive analytics track market trends and property value fluctuations to identify profitable opportunities. By combining Metaverse-powered virtual experiences, blockchain-based security, AI-driven insights, and RWA tokenization, this altcoin is redefining real estate investment. Its approach makes transactions more secure, efficient, and inclusive, positioning it as a game-changer in the industry. PCHAIN Presale: A 33,000% Profit Opportunity for Early Investors While Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to sustain upward momentum, PCHAIN is emerging as a high-potential investment with a projected 33,000% surge. In its second presale round, this altcoin has already secured over $1.2 million, with 60.77% of the allocation sold. The first presale round closed after raising more than $1.3 million. Analysts suggest a $1,000 investment could grow to over $330,000 by Q2 2025. Once this presale stage ends, the token price will increase from $0.01 to $0.023, marking a 109% jump. Investors looking for substantial returns are seizing the opportunity before prices rise. PCHAIN’s listing on CoinMarketCap signals strong market readiness. Additionally, leading blockchain security firm BlockAudit has thoroughly reviewed the project’s smart contract, confirming its safety and reliability. This certification assures investors of a secure and transparent investment platform.

According to a new announcement from Tether, the crypto firm has purchased a minority stake in the Torin, Italy-based football club Juventus. Says Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino of the new partnership, “Aligned with our strategic investment in Juventus, Tether will be a pioneer in merging new technologies, such as digital assets, artificial intelligence and biotech, with the well-established sports industry to drive change globally. We will explore avenues for innovative collaborations and the potential to revolutionize the global sports landscape.” Juventus is an institution that is older than most banks. Founded in 1897, Juventus has won Italy’s top flight Serie A a record 36 times, most recently in 2020. The Zebras have also won the Coppa Italia a record 15 times and the Supercoppa Italiana a record nine times. The Italian giants are considered one of the top five football clubs of all time by the UEFA club coefficient rating and currently boasts two American stars, Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah. According to the Tether announcement, the funds for the stakes were provided by Tether’s investment arm, which relies on assets outside of the stablecoin reserves. Tether is far from the first crypto giant to invest in the beautiful game. In 2023, Coinbase inked a sponsorship deal with Borussia Dortmund, a legendary German football club that made it to the Champions League final last year. The year before that, former Juventus star and living football legend Cristiano Ronaldo released exclusive non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with Binance.

Experts identify emerging trends that could elevate Ethereum's value further. At the same time, Remittix is gaining traction as a preferred choice. Its innovative solutions address practical payment issues, potentially making it a top cryptocurrency investment. Offering a low DeFi coin price, Remittix presents the opportunity for significant profits. This development arises at a time when global finance is grappling with challenges beyond the scope of traditional banking solutions. Ethereum Price Prediction: Consistent Growth and Noticeable Upgrades Since its inception, Ethereum has significantly evolved, underpinning numerous applications and financial services. Current predictions suggest that Ethereum's value might reach new peaks by year's end. Recent enhancements have improved the network's speed and cost-effectiveness. Investors consider these developments crucial for sustained value. Recent analyses indicate that Ethereum's value might surge by 20% to 30% in the upcoming months. This potential increase coincides with more institutional involvement in its network. The continuous stream of upgrades and the multitude of applications built on Ethereum keep demand robust. Each new application strengthens the token's overall utility. Such analyses reinforce the optimistic Ethereum price forecast, prompting investors to consider these figures carefully in their portfolio planning. Remittix: A Groundbreaking Altcoin with Tangible Impact Remittix addresses a significant global payment issue. Many individuals worldwide lack access to banking services—around 1.4 billion people remain unbanked. These individuals often rely on crypto wallets and services like Western Union for cash access. Remittix aims to streamline and reduce the cost of this process, offering a crypto-to-fiat system that eliminates unnecessary steps and accelerates transfers. During its ICO, Remittix has already sold 460 million tokens, with the current DeFi coin price around $0.0567. Early investors have seen returns exceeding 240%. Some analysts even forecast potential returns up to 10x in the near future. This optimistic projection positions Remittix as a top choice for investors seeking practical applications and robust growth. The Remittix system, known as PayFi, bridges digital currency with everyday finance. It allows seamless money transfers from crypto wallets to bank accounts, bypassing traditional banking delays. This system facilitates swift and inexpensive cross-border transactions. For instance, someone in a region with limited banking access can send crypto to another person abroad, who can then collect cash through a local agent. This process preserves the core principles of cryptography, enabling users to retain control over their funds while integrating into modern financial systems. Remittix distinguishes itself by tackling real-world challenges, particularly for those facing lengthy wait times and high fees for international transfers. Its solution conserves time and money, and when a token addresses real problems, it often becomes a favorite among investors. Promising high returns and a clear practical application, Remittix attracts both new and experienced investors alike. Investors value Remittix for its clear focus on resolving everyday issues. Its user-friendly platform simplifies international money transfers. The Remittix team has implemented security measures, including extensive smart contract testing and securing key funds for three years. These actions foster trust and reduce risk. In a volatile market, Remittix stands out with its solid strategy and practical utility. Investors often look to the latest Ethereum price forecasts to understand market trends. While Ethereum remains strong, Remittix offers fresh optimism with its innovative strategy. With its affordable price and potential for rapid growth, Remittix is poised to become a significant player in digital finance. Its straightforward and effective design addresses a widespread issue affecting millions globally, making it a leading cryptocurrency choice for future planning.

This was the fifth European license Bitget had received and has brought it one step closer to Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) licensing. With its new license from Bulgaria’s National Revenue Agency, Bitget will be able to facilitate crypto trading, asset transfers, custodial solutions, public offerings, and wallet services. Bitget is looking to get from VASP to CASP “The successful application of the VASP license in Bulgaria is a part of Seychelles-based Bitget’s expansion strategy to serve users across the European Union,” Bitget chief legal officer Hon Ng said . Bitget has already received regulatory approval in Poland, Italy and Lithuania. VASP license holders need to apply for a MiCA Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) and pass different requirements, such as conforming to possibly stricter Anti-Money Laundering and capital provisions. CASP holders must also have a physical presence in the European Union (EU). CASP applications began to be considered in January. MiCA regulations came into force on Dec. 30, but VASP license holders were given up to 18 months (through July 1, 2026) to transition at the discretion of the licensing country. Bitget seeks registration worldwide Bitget operates in the United Kingdom as well as the four EU member states. Its activities in the UK were temporarily halted in May after the passage of new regulations by the UK Financial Conduct Authority. The exchange was declared compliant and allowed to reopen in November. Bitget claims it is available in more than 200 countries and regions. It was one of five cryptocurrency exchanges that were removed from the Apple and Google app stores earlier in February. The Japanese Financial Services Agency requested the move because the exchanges were not registered. Japanese users trying to download the Bitget app from Apple see a message that says, “This application is currently not available in this country or region.” The other exchanges affected were Bybit, MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank. In December, Bitget launched the BitEXC exchange in Vietnam, customized to that country’s regulations. Bitget received a Bitcoin Service Provider license from the Central Bank of El Salvador in December. It also applied to another agency for licensing to provide services with other crypto assets.

On February 13, Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson put forward HB 4087, a bill designed to update the state’s Management and Budget Act by incorporating Bitcoin investments. With this, Michigan now joins 19 other states in the US that have introduced or are deliberating similar cryptocurrency investment policies, with final legislative approval still pending. Michigan’s HB 4087 Bill Under the newly proposed legislation in Michigan, the state treasurer would have the ability to invest in cryptocurrency using money from both the general fund and the economic stabilization fund, though the total investment cannot exceed 10%. The bill does not impose any restrictions on which types of cryptocurrencies can be acquired. Furthermore, it includes a clause permitting the state to lend its crypto assets, as long as such lending does not pose additional financial risk. The treasurer is authorized to loan these assets to generate additional returns for Michigan. To maintain security, the state must store its cryptocurrency through secure custody services or invest in exchange-traded products from regulated investment companies. Michigan’s state pension fund is already involved in cryptocurrency investments, with holdings in Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds. According to a filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November, the State of Michigan Retirement System reported owning 460,000 shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, along with an equal number of shares in the asset manager’s Ethereum Mini Trust. US State Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Several US states have proposed strategic Bitcoin reserve bills which are expected to potentially drive $23 billion in BTC purchases, according to VanEck’s Matthew Sigel. This figure excludes pension fund allocations and could rise if legislation advances. Currently, 20 states have proposed crypto reserve bills, with Arizona and Utah progressing further. Texas recently introduced a new Bitcoin investment bill, while Montana, Ohio, Florida, and others have proposed similar legislation. North Dakota is the only state to have rejected such a proposal.

As we move closer to the next bull run, three projects are dominating investor discussions: Qubetics ($TICS), Render Token (RNDR), and Arbitrum (ARB). While Render Token has skyrocketed by 50% in the past week, and Arbitrum struggles under rising selling pressure, Qubetics is rapidly becoming the next bull run crypto with its groundbreaking real-world asset tokenization marketplace and soaring $12.6M presale. While Render’s bullish momentum highlights the demand for decentralized GPU rendering, and Arbitrum faces critical resistance levels, Qubetics is shaking up blockchain technology with its tokenized asset marketplace and TICSScan transparency platform. With its presale currently in Stage 21 and the mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, investors are piling in before the next 10% price increase. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization The tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is poised to be the biggest shift in blockchain adoption, and Qubetics is at the forefront of this transformation. Traditional markets suffer from high barriers to entry, lack of liquidity, and inefficiencies in transferring ownership. By turning real estate, intellectual property, and luxury assets into digital tokens, Qubetics makes investing in high-value assets as simple as buying crypto. Imagine you’re a real estate investor looking to buy fractional ownership of a prime Manhattan property. Instead of going through weeks of paperwork, brokers, and hefty fees, you can purchase tokenized shares of the building on Qubetics’ platform in seconds, with full transparency. The same applies to investors in fine art, collectibles, or even renewable energy projects—tokenization allows users to trade, own, and liquidate real-world assets seamlessly. By integrating AI-powered smart contracts, Qubetics eliminates fraud, reduces costs, and increases transaction speed. This isn’t just a futuristic idea—it’s a real solution for a trillion-dollar industry, positioning Qubetics as a must-watch project in the next bull run crypto cycle. TICSScan: Enhancing Blockchain Transparency To further boost investor confidence and security, Qubetics has introduced TICSScan, its own blockchain explorer. This feature allows users to: Track transactions in real-time, ensuring complete transparency in tokenized asset trades. Monitor smart contracts, providing developers and businesses with detailed data on blockchain activity. View validator performance, ensuring network stability and decentralization. For example, an investor purchasing fractional ownership in a tokenized commercial property can instantly verify their transaction and ensure it’s recorded immutably on the blockchain. This level of transparency makes Qubetics a trustworthy platform for large-scale asset tokenization—a critical factor in institutional adoption and mainstream investor confidence. Qubetics Presale: The Best Short-Term Crypto Play Right Now Investors are rushing into the Qubetics presale—and for good reason. Unlike other crypto projects that rely on speculation, Qubetics has a working product, a clear use case, and major partnerships in place. Qubetics Presale by the Numbers: Current Presale Stage: 21 Funds Raised: Over $12.6 million $TICS Tokens Sold: More than 471 million Total Token Holders: Over 19,800 Price Projections for $TICS: $TICS at $0.25 post-presale = 240.64% ROI $TICS at $1 post-mainnet launch = 1,262.56% ROI $TICS at $10 in 2025 = 13,525.66% ROI Every Sunday at 12 AM, the price increases by 10%, rewarding early investors. If you invest $1,000 today at $0.0733 per token, your holdings could be worth $135,256 if Qubetics reaches $10 per token. With the mainnet launch coming in Q2 2025, Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for the short term. Render Token (RNDR): The AI Powerhouse Rides a 50% Rally While Qubetics is making headlines for its presale success and real-world adoption, Render Token (RNDR) has been on fire, gaining 50% in the past week. RNDR, which powers decentralized GPU rendering for AI, gaming, and metaverse applications, has soared to $4.66, driven by strong demand and a trading volume of over $55 million. The rally comes as AI and 3D rendering industries see explosive growth, with Render’s decentralized network reducing the costs of high-performance computing. As metaverse and AI projects scale up, Render is becoming a key infrastructure player in decentralized cloud computing. Investors are bullish on RNDR’s ability to reshape digital rendering, but as always, the crypto market remains volatile. While Render Token is having a great run, it’s crucial to watch for potential pullbacks and market corrections. Arbitrum (ARB): Struggling to Hold Key Levels Amid Selling Pressure Unlike Qubetics and Render, Arbitrum (ARB) is struggling to gain momentum. The Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution has seen its price drop to $0.50 due to rising selling pressure. With increasing competition from Optimism (OP) and Polygon (MATIC), Arbitrum is facing challenges in retaining market dominance. While its scalability features remain attractive to developers, investors are concerned about Arbitrum’s ability to sustain user engagement in an increasingly competitive Layer 2 ecosystem. Analysts believe that Arbitrum needs a catalyst, such as a major upgrade or partnership, to regain investor confidence. Until then, ARB remains a risky bet compared to strong gainers like Qubetics and Render Token. Conclusion: Qubetics Stands Out as the Best Next Bull Run Crypto While Render Token is riding an impressive 50% rally and Arbitrum struggles under market pressure, Qubetics is proving to be the most promising project for the next bull run crypto. With a revolutionary asset tokenization marketplace, the powerful TICSScan blockchain explorer, and an explosive crypto presale that has already raised $12.6M, Qubetics is leading the charge in Web3 innovation. Investors looking for short-term profits and long-term growth should consider Qubetics as a top-tier investment before the next 10% price increase. With the mainnet launch approaching in Q2 2025, now is the time to get in before the next major surge. Don’t miss out—join the Qubetics presale now before the next price hike!

Why is Qubetics considered the next bull run crypto? Qubetics combines real-world asset tokenization with blockchain transparency, making it a high-utility, real-use case crypto that’s attracting major investment. 2. How does the Qubetics presale work? The presale operates in 7-day cycles, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. Early investors secure the best price before each stage closes. 3.

On Friday, BTC has stabilized just above the $97,000 mark, however, despite a mild 0.54% daily gain, Bitcoin’s momentum has paled in comparison to the surging altcoin market. Bitcoin Dominance Plunges to 14-Day Lows as Altcoin ETF Speculation Gains Traction On February 14, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Grayscale’s filings for Dogecoin and Ripple (XRP) spot ETFs, triggering a notable rally in both assets. XRP soared by 14% within the daily timeframe, while DOGE surged by 7%, underlining strong investor enthusiasm for alternative cryptocurrencies. The rising optimism surrounding altcoin-based ETFs has impacted Bitcoin’s market dominance. BTC.D, which tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization, plunged 3% over the past week, reaching a 14-day low of 66.7%. This sharp decline suggests that traders are actively reallocating capital from Bitcoin to alternative assets, anticipating significant price movements in the altcoin sector. Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), Feb 14, 2025 Several market factors have contributed to this shift. The acknowledgment of altcoin ETF filings signals a potential breakthrough for wider institutional adoption beyond Bitcoin. Additionally, memecoins have regained traction following Donald Trump’s campaign endorsements of crypto, further fueling speculation in the sector. If Bitcoin’s dominance continues its decline, it could indicate a prolonged altcoin season where alternative assets outperform BTC price in the short to medium term. Bitcoin ETFs Pull $650M This Week, Dampening Price Momentum Another significant factor behind BTC price stagnation is the growing trend of capital outflows from BTC-focused ETFs. Data from SosoValue’s Bitcoin ETF daily flows chart reveals a combined $650 million in outflows over the past four trading days, spanning February 11 to February 15. These 4 consecutive withdrawals days indicate that institutional investors may be de-risking their BTC positions, potentially rotating funds into altcoins amid speculation of new ETF approvals. While Bitcoin ETFs saw strong inflows in January following the landmark approval of spot BTC ETFs, the recent reversal suggests waning enthusiasm among institutional investors. Bitcoin ETFs Netflows | Source: SosoValue.com One possible explanation for this trend is the anticipation of broader ETF acceptance for alternative cryptocurrencies. If XRP and DOGE receive regulatory approval, institutional capital that previously flowed into Bitcoin ETFs may instead be redirected to these newly listed products. Such a scenario could further weaken Bitcoin’s short-term price momentum, especially if current outflows persist. Despite Bitcoin’s fundamental strengths, its near-term outlook remains uncertain amid shifting market dynamics. The ongoing dominance contraction and ETF outflows indicate that BTC bulls may struggle to reclaim decisive momentum unless fresh catalysts emerge. With traders increasingly focusing on altcoin opportunities, Bitcoin could face an extended consolidation phase unless it breaks decisively above $100,000 in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Losing $95,000 Support Could Trigger More Downsizing Despite positive sentiment in the altcoin markets, Bitcoin price forecast charts reveal weak bullish momentum. Consolidating just below the midline of the Bollinger Bands near $97,260 at press time, failure to close above $97,000 could see bears regain control. In this scenario, the lower Bollinger Band at $93,440 aligns with a key support zone, making $95,000 a critical level to watch. If sellers push BTC below this threshold, the next leg down could test $92,500, with a broader downside move potentially extending toward $90,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains weak at 46.13, with its signal line crossing below, signaling continued bearish momentum. Bitcoin Price Forecast On the bullish side, BTC needs to reclaim the 20-day moving average at $99,094 for a momentum shift. A successful break above this level could open the path toward $104,748, the upper Bollinger Band. However, decreasing volume suggests waning buyer interest, making an immediate breakout unlikely unless fresh catalysts emerge. If ETF outflows persist and BTC loses $95,000, downside risks could accelerate, putting further pressure on the broader crypto market.

Many experts point out that the token's network struggles and high token supply may hold back its growth. Fans often check the Pepe Price Prediction to see if the token might bounce back, but the outlook remains gloomy. Recent market charts show a clear downward trend. This has led many to wonder if holding Pepe is wise. The discussions around the Pepe Price Prediction reveal that technical issues and market pressure weigh on its value. Many investors now search for tokens with clear use and real-world benefits instead of holding a token that seems set to fall further. The debate around the Pepe Price Prediction serves as a reminder to look at both price action and practical use when choosing investments.

Traditional international transfers are slow and cost a lot. Remittix makes it easy to send money across borders.

However, a growing number of investors are turning their attention to Remittix, a new token that offers a practical solution for quick and affordable money transfers. With its current DeFi coin price, Remittix is considered one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. Recent analyses have sparked a debate over which token will thrive in 2025, focusing on Shiba Inu's pricing, Dogecoin's trends, and the promising potential of Remittix. Shiba Inu: A Cryptocurrency with a Rich History Once buoyed by strong community backing, Shiba Inu's price soared, but it now faces numerous obstacles. Enthusiasts frequently check exchanges and forums for Shiba Inu price updates, questioning whether its value will stabilize or continue to decline. The token's history includes rapid increases, but now it faces the potential for a 50% drop. This unpredictability causes some investors to tread carefully, as they meticulously track every fluctuation in hopes of a reversal that could renew confidence. Investors understand that a token's past success doesn't ensure future profits. The current Shiba Inu price highlights market difficulties and fierce competition. As investors analyze data, they note the absence of new features that could drive sustained growth. Although discussions around ""Shiba Inu Price"" often focus on its potential, the prevailing sentiment is one of prudence. Nevertheless, some devoted supporters remain optimistic that enhancements in network utility might revitalize its strength. Dogecoin: A Popular Crypto Facing Challenges Dogecoin has garnered widespread recognition and a dedicated following. Recent assessments indicate a significant drop in its price. Enthusiasts monitoring Dogecoin's value observe that it could decline further this year. This depreciation has led many investors to reconsider their positions. Although Dogecoin maintains a strong community, its current price trajectory is cause for concern. Observers suggest Dogecoin's decline may be linked to overarching market trends and economic stresses. Many continue to watch Dogecoin's price closely, comparing current patterns with past peaks in hopes of a rebound. Despite its enduring popularity, Dogecoin's recent challenges imply it could lose its prime position if the current trend persists.

The SEC asked a federal appeals court to extend its deadline to respond to Coinbase, which filed an appeal of a federal judge's ruling last month. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled last year that the SEC had brought a plausible case that Coinbase sold unregistered securities on its platform. The exchange asked the appeals court panel to weigh in on how securities laws might apply to crypto. On Friday, the agency asked for a four-week extension to its deadline (currently set for Feb. 14) to file its response, citing Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda's new crypto task force, headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce. ""The crypto task force’s work may affect and could facilitate the potential resolution of both the underlying district court proceeding and potential appellate review, conserving judicial resources. Because the Commission’s review of crypto-related issues is ongoing, the Commission requests this additional time to prepare its answer to Coinbase’s petition and for appropriate review,"" the filing said. This is the second case the SEC asked for an extension in; earlier this week, the SEC and Binance filed for a 60-day stay in the regulator's case against that exchange and affiliated parties, saying the extension could similarly lead to a resolution.

The company increased its crypto holdings by over 8,000% in nine months. By the end of 2024, it had spent nearly 9 billion yen, equivalent to $58 million, out of its 10 billion yen investment plan, about $65 million. Bitcoin as Protection Against the Weak Yen Remixpoint started buying Bitcoin (BTC) to protect against the falling value of the Japanese yen. With rising inflation and economic worries growing, Bitcoin seemed a good option. The company also invested in Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE). By December 31, Remixpoint held 5.8 billion yen, which amounted to $38 million in digital currencies. This is a big jump from the 68 million yen it had on March 31. The company made a profit of 1.35 billion yen in the third quarter. This includes 658 million yen in unrealized gains from its crypto asset holdings. In November 2024, Remixpoint started including changes in its crypto value as part of its income. The Tokyo-based company, once focused on energy, also offers cryptocurrency services. Notably, this follows a trend set by Metaplanet, another Japanese firm that saw its stock price soar after investing in Bitcoin in April 2023. Trump’s Win and the Crypto Boom Remixpoint increased its crypto buying after President Donald Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election. His victory was seen as good news for the crypto industry, with hopes of friendlier rules. This sentiment helped crypto prices rise, and Remixpoint quickly grew its Bitcoin holdings to 125.2 BTC. The company’s stock also soared by over 360%. Reportedly, most U.S. financial advisers also showed more interest in crypto investments. This comes after Donald Trump won the presidential election. His policies could support the crypto market. However, Remixpoint’s stock growth was cut short by market volatility. Its stock fell 15%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 index only dropped 0.79%. This shows the market can be unpredictable. What’s Next for Remixpoint? Remixpoint’s strategy has brought big gains, but it also carries risks. Cryptocurrency prices are known for big ups and downs, meaning the company’s success depends on a very uncertain market. For now, its Bitcoin bet is yielding profit, making Remixpoint one of Japan’s most crypto-friendly companies. However, it is uncertain if this strategy will continue to succeed or if the market will turn against it. With its nearly reached 10 billion yen investment goal, all eyes are on Remixpoint to see what it does next.

Many are looking to Remittix (RTX), poised for a 50x surge this year, as institutional investors reassess their holdings. As the market shifts, the best-performing PayFi token in 2025, such as Remittix, is attracting smart money and establishing itself as the most potent substitute for SOL and ADA. Join the Remittix presale . 50% Drop in 2025 for Cardano and Solana: Is the Bear Market Approaching? There is more than speculation regarding a 50% drop in 2025 for Cardano and Solana as top crypto analyst warns of ADA and SOL crash. Analysts believe that Cardano's price instability, even with institutional support from Grayscale's ETF filing and whale accumulation, portend trouble down the road. The expansion of Solana's network and the consideration of ETFs have also not been able to generate substantial long-term bullish momentum. The future of Solana is still uncertain, though, due to its well-publicized outages and centralization issues. Institutional funds have been drawn to Solana's TVL despite its 486 percent YoY increase, but investors are turning to safer, more sensible options due to worries about the company's long-term stability and transaction reliability. Why Remittix Is the Best-Performing PayFi Token in 2025 The best-performing PayFi token in 2025 will be Remittix, which is poised for a 50x surge while Cardano and Solana may experience a 50% drop. Remittix is leading the way in blockchain-powered remittances by bridging the gap between cryptocurrency and fiat, as traditional banking systems are unable to satisfy contemporary financial demands. The Remittix Pay API is already being integrated by companies and independent contractors, enabling real-time settlements free from the volatility of fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices. Remittix is aiming to increase merchant adoption beyond payments, enabling international merchants to take cryptocurrency and instantly settle in fiat without being impacted by cryptocurrency volatility. Remittix is also running a significant giveaway to boost adoption and attract new investors at a never-before-seen pace. With more financial institutions investigating its ecosystem, the project, which has already raised over $11.8 million in its presale , is expected to emerge as the year's leading PayFi solution, according to analysts. Will Remittix Outperform Cardano and Solana? Although experts predict a 50% drop in 2025 for Cardano and Solana, Remittix's PayFi model is drawing a lot of interest from investors. Remittix is a better investment choice for both institutions and individual investors due to its decentralized, scalable, and cost-effective solutions. Furthermore, Remittix is a more sustainable investment due to its merchant adoption programs, deflationary tokenomics, and fiat accessibility. RTX is emerging as the best-performing PayFitoken in 2025, surpassing Cardano and Solana due to its increasing widespread adoption. Remittix is expected to generate long-term value for its investors by concentrating on practical use cases as opposed to conjecture. Will Remittix 50x While ADA and SOL Crash? Analysts estimate a 50% drop in 2025 for Cardano and Solana, so smart money is quickly shifting to Remittix. Remittix is the best substitute for ADA and SOL because of its practical financial applications, robust presale performance, and expanding ecosystem. It is poised for a 50x surge. Remittix is emerging as the front-runner for investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency breakout. Being the best-performing PayFi token in 2025, it is revolutionizing the way cryptocurrency payments operate and guaranteeing long-term growth and substantial returns for investors. With its emphasis on widespread adoption, international payment options, and continuous ecosystem development, Remittix is becoming the most popular PayFi token, outperforming Cardano and Solana in terms of usefulness and room for expansion.

Meanwhile, although Solana has expanded its network and considered ETFs, these moves haven't sparked enduring positive momentum. Despite Solana's impressive 486 percent year-over-year TVL growth, the future remains uncertain due to its known outages and centralization issues.

The Remittix Pay API is being adopted by companies and freelancers, offering real-time settlements without being affected by the volatility of crypto prices. Remittix is also working to expand merchant adoption beyond just payments, allowing global merchants to accept crypto and instantly convert it to fiat, untouched by crypto price swings. Additionally, Remittix is conducting a large-scale giveaway to accelerate adoption and entice new investors at an unprecedented rate. With growing interest from financial institutions and having raised over $11.8 million in its presale , analysts expect it to emerge as the year's dominant PayFi solution. Could Remittix Surpass Cardano and Solana? While experts anticipate a 50% decline in 2025 for Cardano and Solana, the Remittix PayFi model is attracting considerable interest from investors. Offering decentralized, scalable, and cost-effective solutions, Remittix is becoming an appealing investment for both institutions and individual investors. Moreover, Remittix is seen as a sustainable investment, thanks to its merchant adoption initiatives, deflationary tokenomics, and easy fiat access. RTX is on track to become the leading PayFi token in 2025, outpacing Cardano and Solana due to its growing acceptance. By focusing on practical applications rather than speculation, Remittix aims to deliver long-term value for its investors. Is a 50x Growth Possible for Remittix as ADA and SOL Decline? With predictions of a 50% drop in 2025 for Cardano and Solana, smart investors are rapidly moving towards Remittix. Thanks to its practical financial uses, strong presale performance, and growing ecosystem, Remittix is poised for a 50x increase, making it an ideal alternative to ADA and SOL. It stands out as the top choice for investors seeking the next major cryptocurrency success story. Emerging as the leading PayFi token in 2025, it is transforming how crypto payments are processed, promising long-term growth and significant returns for investors.

US SEC Seeks 30-Day Extension,https://coingape.com/is-coinbase-vs-sec-lawsuit-ending-us-sec-seeks-30-day-extension/,"Coinbase Vs SEC Lawsuit: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested a 30-day extension in its legal case against Coinbase. The request was made in a court filing on Friday, where the SEC mentioned that its newly formed crypto task force could help resolve the case. This move has raised speculation about a possible settlement between the regulator and the cryptocurrency exchange. US SEC Seeks 30-Day Delay in Coinbase Lawsuit The US SEC’s request for an extension in the Coinbase Vs SEC Lawsuit was filed in a federal appeals court, where Coinbase had earlier appealed a district court ruling. Judge Katherine Polk Failla previously ruled that the SEC had a valid case against Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities. Coinbase then sought the appeals court’s opinion on how securities laws apply to digital assets. The SEC stated that the crypto task force, led by Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce, could influence the case’s outcome. “The crypto task force’s work may affect and could facilitate the potential resolution of both the underlying district court proceeding and potential appellate review, conserving judicial resources,” the SEC said in its filing. The commission asked for additional time to prepare its response to Coinbase’s appeal. This Is A Developing News, Please Check Back For More The post Is Coinbase Vs SEC Lawsuit Ending?

Cardano (ADA) enthusiasts have withdrawn, releasing 330 million ADA with no signs of coming back, sparking debates about ADA’s prospects. Meanwhile, PEPE traders are upholding an important support level, hoping for a potential 55% rise if the momentum continues. However, the most vigorous purchasing action is at BlockDAG’s presale, where the FINALCALL700 bonus is giving a whopping 350% more coins with each buy. This has escalated BlockDAG (BDAG) presale to over $194.5 million, drawing both large and small buyers eager for a strong growth chance before it hits the exchanges. With these significant changes in the market, let’s analyze how each of these cryptos is faring and which one might offer the best opportunity for users. Cardano Whales Depart—What’s Next for ADA? The departure of Cardano whales has sparked concerns over ADA’s immediate future, with a significant sell-off of over 330 million ADA. This considerable selling pressure has led to a 9.8% drop in a day and a 19.1% decrease over the week, making people wonder about the coin’s stability. Despite the sell-off, on-chain data indicate a 4.79% rise in new wallet creations, while active engagement has grown by nearly 12%, showing sustained interest in the network. However, the lack of re-engagement from large holders suggests a careful strategy by big holders, restraining the chances for a quick rebound. If purchasing pressure doesn’t resume shortly, ADA’s downward trend might continue. For now, smaller traders are watching cautiously, waiting for signs of a comeback. With stiff competition from new projects, the exit of Cardano whales underscores the uncertainty about ADA’s long-term place. PEPE Traders Uphold a Vital Support Level The support bet by PEPE traders is drawing attention as bulls firmly defend a crucial support point near $0.00000996. Exchange data shows a $14 million outflow of PEPE, hinting at accumulation by major buyers. This indicates a belief in an upcoming breakout if the momentum keeps up. Currently, long positions worth $1.90 million show bullish sentiment, while short sellers seem overstretched at $0.00001044. Analysts believe that if PEPE keeps support above $0.00000905, it could climb by up to 55% to $0.00001625. With the meme coin market remaining highly unpredictable, this price action will be key in setting the next trend. The PEPE trader support bet is a gamble with high stakes, but if momentum shifts against the bulls, downside risks could grow, leading to further pullbacks. BlockDAG’s 350% Bonus Sparks Massive Presale Interest BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus has ignited an intense purchasing spree, offering 350% extra BDAG coins with each transaction. This unprecedented promotion has escalated the presale to over $194.5 million, with more than 18.4 billion BDAG coins distributed as participants eagerly accumulate before anticipated price increases. Each batch of the presale has increased BDAG’s value, starting at $0.001 and reaching $0.0248 currently. This steady climb ranks BlockDAG among the top return-generating crypto opportunities of 2025, drawing attention from both large-scale and individual participants. Large-scale participants are actively acquiring millions of BDAG coins, boosting trust in its future prospects. Concurrently, the number of BDAG wallet holders has exceeded 170,000, indicating broad interest that extends beyond large entities. Historical data shows that simultaneous enthusiasm from both individual and large participants before a launch often leads to positive market performance post-listing. With its scalable network, growing developer involvement, and practical applications, BDAG is positioning itself as a major player in the crypto market. Continuing this momentum, BlockDAG’s target price of $1 post-launch seems achievable, potentially offering significant gains for early backers. Final Thoughts The departure of significant Cardano holders has introduced market uncertainty, with large-scale holders moving on and individual buyers remaining cautious. In contrast, PEPE’s market stance is pivotal, with supporters maintaining a crucial level that could drive a major price increase. Yet, the most striking prospect resides with BlockDAG. With $194.5 million raised, 18.4 billion BDAG distributed, and intense accumulation by significant backers, its crypto presale momentum is robust. With the FINALCALL700 bonus still available, early participants are grabbing BDAG before its anticipated 2025 mainnet debut. Missing out now could mean losing the chance to see BDAG’s value soar, positioning it as the top presale of 2025 and potentially one of the most lucrative crypto ventures of the year.

Institutional acceptance is growing, and new advancements are propelling the industry forward. Choosing the right cryptocurrency for the coming year could be a game-changer. This analysis of the top 5 cryptocurrencies for 2025 includes the latest information, pricing, and developments to help you stay ahead. Whether it’s a new generation of decentralized e-commerce, the most powerful smart contract networks, or an expanding oracle solution, each of these cryptocurrencies has significant potential. Web3Bay, a platform that is revolutionizing online shopping, is one name that stands out. Bitcoin, Solana, Chainlink, and Polkadot are also gaining traction, making them important to watch in 2025. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) Web3Bay is poised to transform e-commerce by establishing a decentralized marketplace that connects buyers and sellers directly, eliminating intermediaries. Instead of depending on traditional platforms that charge exorbitant fees and control transactions, Web3Bay gives users complete control, lowering expenses and increasing transaction transparency. The platform is powered by the 3BAY token, which provides benefits such as a 5% discount on purchases and governance rights, allowing holders to vote on platform modifications. Web3Bay is also becoming a DAO, in which the community will determine the platform’s future. This strategy makes it more than just a shopping website; it’s a step toward decentralized commerce. The Web3Bay presale has already generated over $1.2 million, with 300 million tokens sold. The 3BAY token, which is now priced at $0.004562625, has a projected launch price of $0.1959, indicating substantial potential for early investors. As a decentralized alternative to eBay and Amazon, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a major player in blockchain-powered commerce. With mainstream e-commerce plagued by high costs and limited control, Web3Bay offers an innovative solution that could make it one of the best crypto coins to invest in for 2025. For those considering the best crypto coin to invest in, Web3Bay presents a compelling case. 2. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin remains the market’s most powerful player, with prices presently hovering around $96,939. Despite recent declines, its trading range of $94,747 to $97,268 suggests strong support. While Bitcoin has long been known as digital gold, the discussion in 2025 is shifting to its changing role in the financial system. Countries are investigating regulatory frameworks for BTC-based ETFs, and institutional adoption is pushing Bitcoin deeper into mainstream finance. Beyond price fluctuations, Bitcoin’s network continues to expand. While it remains speculative, there has been talk of moving Bitcoin to a hybrid Proof-of-Stake model. Bitcoin, with its unparalleled security, decentralized nature, and rising adoption, remains a key name among the best crypto coins to invest in for 2025. Even as other projects innovate, Bitcoin serves as the foundation of the entire cryptocurrency market. For those looking for the best crypto coin to invest in, Bitcoin’s established position is a significant factor. 3. Solana (SOL) Solana is demonstrating its potential as a leading smart contract platform, currently priced at $201.49 despite a recent 2.32% drop. With an intraday low of $194.02 and a high of $207.06, Solana continues to demonstrate strength as it attracts more developers and projects. One of the market’s most intriguing speculations is the potential approval of a Solana ETF. If this occurs, it could bring a surge of institutional funds into the ecosystem, potentially driving SOL’s value even higher. The network’s speed and low transaction fees have made it a popular choice for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. Its ongoing upgrades, community growth, and developer activity keep it ahead of many competitors. With scalability still a major challenge for blockchain, Solana’s high-speed transactions and low fees position it as one of the best crypto coins to invest in for 2025. Solana’s potential makes it a contender for the best crypto coin to invest in. 4. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is now trading at $18.49, down 1.12%, with a trading range of $17.53 to $18.92. The most exciting development around Chainlink is the recent surge in whale activity. On-chain data reveals the highest level of large LINK transactions in 14 months, which frequently signals significant moves in the future. Whether this results in price increases or new partnerships, it is evident that major players are paying attention. Chainlink remains the preferred oracle network, connecting smart contracts to real-world data. As blockchain adoption grows, so will the demand for reliable oracles. Chainlink’s continuous integrations with DeFi protocols, gaming apps, and enterprise solutions keep it a key player. With increasing utility and indications of accumulation by major holders, LINK is securing its place among the best crypto coins to invest in for 2025. Chainlink’s oracle network and whale activity make it a best crypto coin to invest in. 5. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot’s price is holding steady at $4.77, up slightly by 0.21% today. The trading range has been between $4.54 and $4.87, indicating consistent performance. However, Polkadot’s greatest strength resides not in its short-term price movement but in its upcoming upgrades. The network is preparing to implement Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, which will allow more developers to create on Polkadot while maintaining interoperability with Ethereum. This step could significantly expand Polkadot’s ecosystem, making it easier for projects to switch between blockchains. Faster transaction speeds and enhanced developer tools will further strengthen its position. As the competition among blockchain networks intensifies, Polkadot’s unique multi-chain architecture keeps it in the conversation. With critical upgrades on the way, it earns a solid spot among the best crypto coins to invest in for 2025. Polkadot’s upgrade and interoperability make it a best crypto coin to invest in. Key Takeaways: Identifying the Best Crypto Coin to Invest In The top 5 cryptocurrencies for 2025 provide a mix of stability, innovation, and real-world utility. Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce with its decentralized marketplace, while Bitcoin remains the market leader. Solana is gaining traction due to institutional interest and high-speed transactions, and Chainlink’s recent whale activity suggests big developments ahead. Polkadot is preparing for a substantial upgrade, making its blockchain more accessible and scalable. With 2025 already showing strong momentum for cryptocurrency markets, these projects are well-positioned for growth. The industry continues to evolve, and keeping up with these key players could be critical for anyone considering the future of blockchain. Whether it’s decentralized commerce, smart contracts, or multi-chain networks, these five cryptocurrencies have the potential to make a significant impact this year. For those seeking the best crypto coin to invest in , these five offer compelling opportunities.

Since 2021, AI scam services have grown by 1,900%, and in 2024, crypto wallets linked to scams received over $9 billion. The report from Chainalysis expects this figure to exceed $12 billion as regulators uncover more fraudulent wallets. As investors cheered the rise of AI in 2024, a crypto evil lurked in the shadows and took advantage of this technology, making massive profits from illicit activity. AI service providers saw scammers’ demand for their technology explode, with revenue rising by a staggering 1,900%. Elon Musk, Lee Hsien Loon (Singapore’s senior minister), and the former president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, are some of the trending faces in crypto scams as hackers use AI to create and post deepfakes of these individuals on TikTok and X to endorse their shady services. Because these celebrities can influence the masses, fraudsters develop AI-generated endorsements that look believable to persuade more victims to invest. High-yield investment and pig butchering scams take the lead with the highest crypto revenues in 2024 Pig butchering is a romance opportunity scammers use to build relationships with victims on dating apps or social media and persuade them to invest in crypto shams. The term “pig butchering” stems from the idea that these fraudsters first “fatten” their victims by building fabricated bonds before “butchering” their wallets. 2024 saw pig butchering’s revenue soar by about 40% year over year (YoY). On the other hand, high-yield investment scams are basically Ponzi schemes promising passive income and high returns in short time frames. Smart Business Corp, for example, included Bitcoin in its portfolio and promised unreasonable returns to affiliates in Spanish-speaking countries in 2024 but never fulfilled this promise. To date, the Ponzi scheme has received over $1 billion on-chain. While HYIS inflows dropped by about 35% in 2024, the scams still managed to pull in half of all scam revenue. AI tools teach Cybercriminals how to hack crypto platforms ChatGPT, among other AI tools, can easily generate or change new code. Black hat hackers exploit this ability to identify weaknesses in blockchain systems and smart contracts by creating phishing emails. However, most of these AI tools have gotten better at identifying and declining malicious prompts, forcing cybercriminals to move to dark web forums. Still, with illegal AI models like WormGPT accessible to everyone, criminals without any technical skills can easily launch a cyber attack. These mod GPTs boast carding, phishing, malware, and scanning capabilities that allow for unethical money-making. The massive scale of AI-powered crypto scams doesn’t downplay the good that comes with artificial intelligence technology. However, just because the benefits exceed the potential for criminal exploitation doesn’t mean we should take these illegal activities for granted. It is hard to tell whether crypto will survive such scams, but it all depends on the collective effort . Government agencies, regulators, and blockchain firms need to exert sustainable efforts when fighting crypto scams because the more AI evolves, the better these scammers adapt.",OP-ED|ChatGPT|TikTok,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|ASIA|BTC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-15 00:08:47

According to a Bloomberg report , the social networking firm is making significant investments in this category as it seeks to become a leader in futuristic robots that can act like humans and help with routine physical tasks. A new unit will be established within Meta’s hardware division, Reality Labs, which will be responsible for handling the task, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Reports indicate that Meta is not planning on building Meta-branded robots, which could directly compete with Tesla Inc.’s Optimus, although it may explore this option at later stages. Meta will initially focus on humanoid robots for household chores Indications are that Meta is now planning to start on its humanoid robot hardware but initially focusing on household chores. According to people privy to the developments but could not be named as the initiative is yet to be announced, the company has bigger plans, which entail making the underlying AI, sensors, and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies. The social networking giant has reportedly started discussions about its plans with some robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. This initiative is also reflective of the exploratory projects of other tech giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Deepmind division. According to Bloomberg, Meta has since confirmed this development with the formation of a new team that will be led by Marc Whitten. Whitten resigned as CEO of General Motors Co.’s Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at Unity Software and Amazon.com Inc. “The core technologies we’ve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics,” Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. According to the Bloomberg report, Bosworth mentioned the company’s advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth, and always-on sensors. Expansion into humanoids is expected to add value to Meta’s AI Executives at Meta are of the view that while AI-powered humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Meta’s advances in AI and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices may speed up progress in the industry. “We believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs.” – Bosworth Current humanoids are still not useful enough to perform small tasks like folding clothes, carrying a glass of water, placing dishes in a rack for cleaning, or performing other household chores that could excite consumers in this category. According to Bloomberg, Whitten – who will report to Bosworth – will have a headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, as per comments by one of the sources. Meta wants to make a mark in the industry in the same way that Google’s Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.’s chips did for the phone industry by creating a foundation for the rest of the market. One of the people involved in the project revealed that Meta is already developing software, sensors, and computing packages for its devices, which is the same technology needed to support humanoids. The social networking company has invested billions of dollars over the years in Reality Labs’ hardware division. This division is responsible for selling products like the Quest VR headset and the increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses . The company is also planning to spend $65 billion this year on related products, among them AI infrastructure and the new robot work. Pushing into humanoids still new for Meta According to Bloomberg, AI-powered humanoids are an evolution of what companies have been doing with autonomous cars. They use similar underlying technologies but large amounts of data and AI processing. Meta’s executives believe that humanoids are more challenging on the safety side because every home has a different layout compared to city streets, which are more standardized. Meta’s Fundamental AI Research Group, or FAIR, has been exploring robots’ work for months as the company pushes its way into new territory to compete with Tesla and Nvidia . An individual close to the developments, as cited by Bloomberg , indicated that Meta believes humanoids are still years from being widely available. This could also take the company years to underpin third-party products. However, it will be a major focus for the company and the tech industry. For Tesla, Elon Musk has indicated that the Optimus robot will be sold at $30,000, and the company is beginning with limited production this year. Other companies, like Boston Dynamics, have made progress indicating their intentions to sell to businesses, while Meta is targeting homes.

Now, analysts are eyeing a potential move toward $3,000 for the digital asset. Ethereum Defends Key Demand Zone Amidst Volatility According to an X post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, ETH has managed to hold above the critical $2,380 – $2,460 demand zone. With no major supply barriers ahead, the cryptocurrency could be on track to reach the $3,000 price target. For the uninitiated, a demand zone in trading is a price area where buying pressure is significantly strong, often leading to price reversals or upward movements. It is identified by historical price action, where demand previously exceeded supply, causing prices to rise.

According to the trader, while ETH has successfully remained above the $2,500 level, the key hurdle to overcome is the $2,800 price level. They noted: The key level for continuation, and for me to say that this correction is over, would be a retake of that $2.8K level. Flips the market structure locally and has been at an important high timeframe level during this cycle. From a technical perspective, fellow crypto trader Merlijn The Trader highlighted the formation of a ‘textbook double bottom’ on the 5-day Ethereum chart. They further pointed out that ETH’s multi-year trendline remains intact, suggesting that the price structure is primed for an upward breakout. Similarly, seasoned crypto influencer Crypto Rover has identified a potential triple-bottom formation on the weekly Ethereum chart. If this pattern plays out, the $4,000 resistance level will be a crucial barrier for ETH to break before it can attempt a new all-time high (ATH). Is ETH About To Surprise The Market? Ethereum’s below-average price performance over the past year has drawn significant attention in the crypto market. Compared to peers like Solana (SOL), XRP, and SUI, ETH has failed to deliver substantial returns to its holders since reaching its current ATH of $4,878 in November 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Positioned For A ‘Major Move Upward’ In 2025, Analyst Forecasts This lackluster performance has fuelled an unprecedented level of bearish sentiment around ETH. A recent report revealed that ETH short positions have surged by 500% since November, highlighting dwindling investor confidence in the asset. However, this excessive bearish sentiment could set the stage for a surprise move. If ETH manages to trigger a short squeeze, it could force the liquidation of numerous short positions, fuelling a sharp upside rally. At press time, ETH trades at $2,740, up 4.1% in the past 24 hours.

In every meme coin cycle, a few select tokens turn early believers into millionaires overnight. Investors who got into Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE before their parabolic runs didn’t just make gains—they secured generational wealth. But here’s the reality: most people only hear about the biggest winners after it’s too late. The real question is, which of these top new meme coins to join today are on the verge of an explosive breakout right now? Degen (DEGEN) is making noise with major exchange listings and skyrocketing adoption, while Osaka Protocol (OSAK) is expanding its multi-chain presence across Ethereum, Avalanche, and more. But the one coin that’s stealing all the attention? BTFD Coin (BTFD) —a meme coin with a live P2E game, 90% APY staking rewards, and a presale that’s nearly 96% complete, offering 3650% ROI potential before launch. If you missed the early days of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, this could be your shot at redemption. The final stretch of BTFD Coin’s presale is here, and once it’s over, the price jumps. Let’s explore further. BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad Prepares for the Final Charge with 3650% ROI Potential What if you could secure a 3650% return on investment just by getting in on the top new meme coin to join today? That’s exactly what early adopters of BTFD Coin are looking at. The Bulls Squad—BTFD’s growing army of investors—is gearing up for what analysts predict could be one of the biggest meme coin launches of 2025. The BTFD presale is currently in Stage 14 at $0.00016 per coin, and it’s over 96% complete. The moment the presale ends, BTFD lists at $0.0006, securing an instant 275% ROI for early holders. But here’s where things get even crazier—analysts predict BTFD will hit a moon price of $0.006, meaning investors at today’s price could be staring at a 3650% ROI. To put that into perspective, let’s do some quick math. If you invest $2,000 today at $0.00016 per BTFD Coin, you’ll receive 12.5 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD lists at $0.0006, that $2,000 turns into $7,500. But if analysts are right and BTFD reaches $0.006? That same investment skyrockets to $75,000. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype wave—it has real utility, including a P2E game that launched on January 1, 2025, rewarding players with BTFD tokens . The project also features a staking program offering 90% APY, meaning holders can earn passive income on their tokens before the price even hits its moon target. This combination of gaming, staking rewards, and community-driven hype is fueling BTFD’s growth. But time is running out—the presale is about to close, and once it does, the price jumps to $0.0006. If you wait, you’re paying nearly 4x more for the same token. The Bulls Squad: A Community-Driven Powerhouse Meme coins don’t succeed without strong communities, and BTFD’s Bulls Squad is proving to be a force to be reckoned with. Unlike other projects where whales control the market, BTFD thrives on its grassroots movement, rewarding early believers with exclusive incentives. The BTFD referral program lets users earn 10% in BTFD tokens for every new investor they bring in, and top referrers can collect even bigger rewards at the end of the month. With over 10,700 active holders and 69 billion BTFD tokens already sold, the Bulls Squad is gaining momentum fast. The clock is ticking. If you’re serious about securing 3650% ROI potential, now’s the time to act. Get your BTFD tokens before Stage 14 closes and the price jumps forever. Degen (DEGEN): Major Exchange Listings Fuel Growth While BTFD Coin dominates presale headlines, Degen (DEGEN) is making waves in the broader meme coin market. The token was recently listed on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, giving it a significant liquidity boost. This listing frenzy has pushed Degen’s market cap to $70 million, with a circulating supply of 17.7 billion DEGEN tokens. Originally launched as a reward token for the Farcaster Degen channel, DEGEN has evolved into a major player in the meme coin scene. Exchange listings have increased trading volume, and many speculate that if the momentum continues, DEGEN could push past its all-time high. Osaka Protocol (OSAK): Multi-Chain Expansion & Community Raids Osaka Protocol (OSAK) is making big moves in the multi-chain space, positioning itself as a spiritual successor to Shiba Inu. With over 20,000 holders across Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and Base, the project has quickly become a decentralized force. In addition to its growing ecosystem, OSAK is planning a decentralized NFT project, which could significantly expand its use case. While the token is still recovering from a previous all-time high, the community’s aggressive marketing campaigns and frequent “raids” are keeping it relevant in the meme coin space. How to Claim BTFD Coin’s Massive ROI Potential Securing BTFD at presale prices is simple, but you have to act fast before Stage 14 sells out. Here’s how: Visit the BTFD official website and connect your preferred wallet, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Choose your payment currency (ETH, USDT, or BNB), confirm your purchase, and secure your BTFD tokens before the presale ends. Final Thoughts: The Window for 3650% ROI Won’t Stay Open Forever Based on current trends and expert predictions, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be one of the biggest meme coin launches of 2025 and surely the top new meme coin to join today . The P2E game is already live, the staking program is offering massive APYs, and the Bulls Squad is growing by the day. Meanwhile, Degen’s exchange listings and Osaka Protocol’s multi-chain expansion are proving that meme coins with strong communities continue to thrive. But when it comes to life-changing returns, only one token is currently sitting at the final stretch before a major price surge. If you wait until BTFD Coin lists at $0.0006, you’ll already be paying nearly 4x more. And if you wait until it hits $0.006? You’ll be watching early investors 36x their money while you’re stuck on the sidelines. The choice is yours: join the Bulls Squad today and ride the wave, or miss out and regret it later.

XRP’s use case is among the most robust in the cryptocurrency sector, and its global adoption continues to expand. The legal dispute with the SEC introduced uncertainty in the past, but Ripple’s court victories have boosted optimism. XRP’s current price hovers around $2.40, with recent market activity fluctuating between $2.32 and $2.48. It remains one of the most actively traded altcoins, and as more financial institutions integrate it, its value could experience a significant surge.

The scalable intellectual property solution Story launched its public mainnet on Thursday and aims to serve as a blockchain where rights holders can upload IP, set the terms of use and monetize it throughout the protocol’s application ecosystem. Explains Story’s launch announcement , “AI (artificial intelligence) is undermining IP as we know it. The traditional IP system can no longer keep pace with the speed and scale of generative AI. Centralized intermediaries make exchanging, licensing, and monetizing IP prohibitively expensive. IP owners see their works used in AI models without attribution or compensation, and even AI companies themselves can’t possibly make millions of individual licensing agreements. AI and IP are locked in a zero-sum struggle, making the marketplace of ideas both illegible and illiquid. Story proposes an entirely new framework for intellectual property, one that creates an open and programmable market for IP. Story is a peer-to-peer intellectual property network purpose-built to transform IP into a programmable asset class, enabling permissionless exchange, ownership, and monetization across AI and the broader internet.” The project’s native IP token is trading at $2.08 at time of writing and is down more than 18% on its first day of trading. It’s already the 158th-ranked crypto asset by market cap. Coinbase is adding the “experimental” label to IP, which the platform uses for tokens that pose certain risks such as price swings and canceled orders because of lower trading volume and availability.

FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a new meme coin whose strategic presale timing positions it to deliver remarkable returns to investors in the anticipated crypto market resurgence. The Rise Of AI Meme Coins: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Leads The Charge As Whale Top Pick FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to surpass Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) in the upcoming crypto market uptrend. This new viral meme coin has emerged as a top contender, likely to take the lead in the next wave of crypto market growth as whales increasingly accumulate its presale tokens. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale is currently underway, providing an opportunity for early adopters to get in on the ground floor of a new innovative meme cryptocurrency. With a very low entry point of $0.0000002 , this emerging meme token will position whales and other presale investors for potential explosive growth. By fusing the enigmatic appeal of a mystical hippo with Pepe’s signature playfulness, this FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to become the next crypto market sensation. This new AI meme coin is poised to shake up the meme coin landscape by building upon the creative genius of Matt Furie, the visionary behind Pepe the Frog. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is shaping into one of the most promising meme coin launches in 2025. It offers AI-powered tools , NFT incentives , and a mission beyond crypto. Using cutting-edge features like FloppyX AI Agent, which allows users to create stunning video content with an interactive character system, this new AI meme coin aims to provide users with a fun and rewarding experience. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is also expanding beyond Ethereum (ETH), with plans for multi-chain integration on Binance Smart Chain and Solana, improving accessibility and usability. SolidProof’s smart contract audit will facilitate multi-chain interactions effortlessly, guaranteeing secure, transparent, and efficient transactions across a decentralized ecosystem. Is Pepe Coin (PEPE) Still A Viable Investment Option In The Meme Coin Sector? Despite being a strong player in the meme coin sector, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has been experiencing significant fluctuations. The Pepe Coin (PEPE) price currently trades at $0.00000969, representing a staggering decline of over 65% from its December high. It’s worth noting that Pepe Coin (PEPE) also dropped by over 46% in its monthly chart and 4% in its weekly charts. Even with the Pepe Coin (PEPE) loyal community, its persistent downturns have created an opening for innovative alternatives like FloppyPepe (FPPE) to capture the attention of whales and the broader crypto market. Is Dogwifhat (WIF) A Losing Bet For Whales? The recent performance of Dogwifhat (WIF) hasn’t been impressive enough to catch the attention of major investors or whales. Although the Dogwifhat (WIF) 24-hour trading volume has surged by over 63%, this spike is driven by selling pressure, contributing to the coin’s decline. Whales accumulating Dogwifhat (WIF) may not be enough to single-handedly push its current trading price of $0.67 to higher levels. This is because Dogwifhat (WIF) has suffered devastating declines, plummeting over 18% and 56% in its weekly and monthly charts, causing whales to accumulate more appealing alternatives, such as FloppyPepe (FPPE). Rush To Secure FloppyPepe (FPPE) Tokens Before Whales Cause A Sell-Out As whales embark on a buying spree for these new AI tokens ahead of the crypto market resurgence, their presale supply will dwindle fast. Investors are urged to secure a share before the FloppyPepe (FPPE) token prices skyrocket, and this rare opportunity slips away! FloppyPepe (FPPE) token holders will reap rewards beyond initial presale profits as the project unfolds. They can also gain eligibility to participate in weekly meme contests , with opportunities to earn exclusive NFT rewards and rare digital assets, which other meme coins like Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) can’t rival. Holders can also gain additional revenue streams by staking their FloppyPepe (FPPE) tokens, tapping into the long-term growth potential of this meme craze, and maximizing their returns on investment.

Houston resident Heather Sanders says she received a call bearing Wells Fargo’s phone number, reports FOX News. Sanders says the person on the other line convinced her that her account was at risk, with someone trying to move funds out of her account and into Zelle. During the call, Sanders says the thief asked her to input her old PIN into her phone and enter a new PIN twice before hitting the pound sign. She also says that the scammer told her to cut her debit card, place it inside of an envelope and wait for a courier to pick it up. “I made the mistake, I didn’t cut the chip in half. I just cut the card in half like he said.” At the end of the conversation, she says the thief told her to expect another call at 8:30 am the next day. But instead of giving Sanders another call, the thieves plundered her account – withdrawing over $4,000 from different locations including a Wells Fargo ATM. Sanders abruptly sought the assistance of Wells Fargo to recover her funds but the bank denied her request for reimbursement. “We understand you unknowingly participated in a fraud scheme. While you may have acted in good faith, we can’t assume liability for financial transactions a customer negotiates or otherwise authorizes with unknown individuals.” Although all hope seemed lost, after FOX News aired Sanders’ story, Wells Fargo reportedly changed its tune . Says the victim, “After it aired Friday, they reached out by Monday, opened it, and escalated it to their highest department. I had an answer within three days, they said it could take up to 10. I don’t believe if you wouldn’t have run the story, they would have stuck with their decision, no matter what evidence I sent.” In a statement, Wells Fargo says it is happy it could resolve the issue by “working directly with our customer.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

From Arctic Pablo Coin’s thrilling presale adventure to Coq Inu’s strong community backing, and Cheems’ rise in the Solana ecosystem, these meme coins offer something for everyone. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Magical Adventure in the Crypto World Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is quickly emerging as one of the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now, offering investors the chance to partake in a thrilling journey. The coin’s unique narrative is centered around an explorer named Arctic Pablo, who embarks on an expedition through icy terrains to uncover hidden treasures. The idea is that each presale phase ties into a different mystical location, providing a fresh storyline and an added layer of excitement. Arctic Pablo Coin presents an exciting opportunity for investors, thanks to its innovative presale strategy, unique tokenomics, and attractive staking rewards. One of the key reasons Arctic Pablo Coin stands out is its dynamic presale structure. Unlike many other meme coins, the presale is divided by locations, with each stage representing a different part of Arctic Pablo’s adventurous journey. This not only creates a fresh and engaging narrative for investors, but it also adds an element of excitement as the presale progresses. Currently in the 10th stage, known as Aqua Frost, the coin is priced at $0.000059. However, projections suggest that the return on investment (ROI) could be an eye-watering 13,451.72% when the coin is listed at $0.008. Another key feature of Arctic Pablo Coin is its deflationary tokenomics. The burn mechanism permanently removes unsold tokens at the end of each presale phase, creating scarcity and potentially increasing the coin’s value. With over $1.24 million raised during the presale, this approach shows strong investor confidence and ensures the coin’s long-term sustainability. For those looking to maximize their investment, Arctic Pablo Coin also offers an exciting 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) through its staking program. By staking tokens, investors can earn substantial rewards, making this a highly attractive option for long-term holders. All staked coins will be vested for a two-month period from the launch date, allowing investors to grow their holdings while being part of the Arctic Pablo Coin journey. This combination of exciting presale opportunities, deflationary mechanics, and high staking rewards makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the most promising meme coins presale to join right now.

At a price of $0.068542, the token has shown significant growth since its launch, making it a promising choice for risk-tolerant investors. With a circulating supply of 69.42 trillion COQ and a market cap of $59.29 million, Coq Inu is a relatively abundant coin. This makes it highly speculative but offers a potentially lucrative investment if the price increases even slightly. The coin has experienced a 266,748.8% increase from its all-time low, showcasing the significant growth potential of this meme coin. Cheems: A Playful Meme Coin with Solid Community Support Cheems ($CHEEMS) has been around for a while, gaining popularity as part of the Solana ecosystem. Known for its humorous connection to the internet-famous Cheems meme, this coin has built a loyal following over the years. Despite its price fluctuations, Cheems remains a noteworthy player in the meme coin space.

Failure to hold support could result in further downsides. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong community and meme buzz, which can drive short-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up 8x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $96 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 80x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand.

Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token.

XRP vs. Bitcoin vs. BlockDAG,https://thecoinrise.com/which-is-the-best-long-term-crypto-to-hold-xrp-vs-bitcoin-vs-blockdag/,"Cryptocurrencies have cemented their place in global finance, with Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP leading the charge. However, a new player, BlockDAG (BDAG), is quickly gaining momentum, challenging these established giants with cutting-edge technology and a revolutionary mining approach. While XRP aims to dominate cross-border payments and Bitcoin remains the benchmark for digital assets, BlockDAG is introducing decentralized mining through its X1 Miner and an advanced DAG-based structure, making it the most forward-thinking investment right now. So, which cryptocurrency is the best long-term hold? Let’s analyze their strengths and potential growth trajectories. XRP: A Dominant Payment Solution, But for How Long? XRP has positioned itself as a fast, low-cost solution for cross-border transactions, targeting banks and financial institutions. Its ability to process transactions in mere seconds at a fraction of a cent makes it more efficient than Bitcoin and even Ethereum. XRP’s widespread adoption has driven its market cap above $130 billion, reflecting its significant role in fintech. Despite these strengths, XRP faces intense competition. Traditional payment processors, as well as emerging blockchain solutions, could diminish its dominance. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple has historically weighed on its price. While XRP’s ecosystem continues to expand, its long-term viability as the go-to payments coin is not guaranteed. Bitcoin: The Conservative Bet on Scarcity and Institutional Adoption Bitcoin is often hailed as the safest long-term crypto investment due to its fixed supply of 21 million coins and increasing institutional adoption. With the rise of Bitcoin ETFs and its deep integration into global finance, BTC has become a store of value similar to digital gold. Over the last five years, Bitcoin has delivered an impressive 900% return, consistently proving its ability to recover from market downturns. However, Bitcoin’s scalability issues, high transaction fees, and energy-intensive mining process remain concerns. Its reliance on proof-of-work mining centralizes power in the hands of large mining firms, making it inaccessible to everyday users. This is where BlockDAG introduces a game-changing alternative. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Future of Scalable and Decentralized Mining Unlike Bitcoin’s traditional blockchain structure, BlockDAG leverages a directed acyclic graph (DAG) architecture, enabling parallel transaction validation instead of sequential block processing. This innovation solves Bitcoin’s congestion issues, allowing for near-instant transactions with minimal fees. But BlockDAG’s biggest advantage is how it democratizes mining. Through the X1 Miner , a mobile-friendly mining solution, anyone can mine BDAG directly from their smartphone without needing expensive hardware. This breaks down barriers to entry that have kept Bitcoin mining in the hands of large institutions. BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $195 million, selling more than 18.4 billion BDAG tokens. Early adopters from Batch 1 have already secured a 2,380% ROI, with BDAG now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. Analysts project BDAG hitting $1 in 2025, meaning today’s buyers could be looking at a staggering 3,930% return. Adding even more urgency, BlockDAG recently launched its FINALCALL750 bonus, offering 350% extra BDAG for every purchase. A $1,000 investment today could turn into $4,500 worth of BDAG overnight, positioning BlockDAG as one of the most lucrative crypto opportunities of 2025. Final Verdict: Which Crypto Wins? While XRP has strong use cases and Bitcoin remains the dominant store of value, BlockDAG’s next-gen technology, scalable DAG structure, and accessible mining model set it apart. With its lightning-fast transactions, decentralized mining through X1, and record-breaking presale growth, BDAG presents the highest upside potential for long-term holders. If you’re searching for a crypto with exponential growth potential, BlockDAG is the most strategic investment right now—but with presale batches selling out fast, time is running out to capitalize on this rare opportunity.

While these major networks often dominate the conversation, the truly transformative opportunities often reside in projects with substantial growth potential. Early investors in Solana witnessed remarkable returns, but with its price already elevated, the search for the next big opportunity continues. Web3Bay (3BAY) presents a unique proposition, not just as another DeFi or NFT project, but as a potential disruptor of e-commerce through decentralization. Having already raised $1.120 million in its presale, selling 300 million tokens, Web3Bay is attracting attention for its potential to become one of the highest-growth assets in the crypto space. This article examines why Web3Bay is generating such excitement and how it could potentially achieve significant growth alongside projects like SUI and Solana. Web3Bay’s Distinct Approach: Decentralizing E-commerce Solana has established itself as a leading Layer-1 blockchain, known for its high-speed transactions and expanding ecosystem. SUI, a more recent entrant, has also gained recognition for its focus on scalability and next-generation blockchain efficiency. While both platforms concentrate on DeFi, gaming, and NFT ecosystems, neither directly tackles the vast potential of e-commerce. Web3Bay differentiates itself by focusing on this trillion-dollar industry. Rather than simply being another smart contract platform, Web3Bay is bringing the power of decentralization to online shopping, a sector that impacts billions globally. By eliminating intermediaries, streamlining fees, and empowering users with control over their transactions, Web3Bay is developing the future of commerce. This direct application is attracting early investors who recognize the potential of this approach. Unlike SUI and Solana, which rely on developer-driven ecosystems, Web3Bay offers a practical use case that everyday consumers can readily adopt. This direct relevance is driving its presale success, with both individual investors and larger backers accumulating 3BAY tokens in anticipation of future price appreciation. Web3Bay’s approach to e-commerce is not just a technological advancement; it’s a shift in how we interact with online marketplaces. Web3Bay’s $1.120 Million Presale: A Harbinger of Growth? Web3Bay’s presale success, exceeding $1.120 million, demonstrates that investors recognize the long-term value of its decentralized e-commerce model. This level of early-stage interest is similar to what propelled Solana to become a major crypto success story. Web3Bay is exhibiting signs that it could be the next breakout project, potentially with even greater upside. With a current presale price of $0.004562, Web3Bay offers an opportunity for early entry before potential price increases. Analysts project that based on anticipated demand and adoption, 3BAY could reach $0.1959 after the presale concludes. This would represent a substantial return on investment. As adoption expands, a rise towards $0.50 or even $1 in the coming years is plausible, suggesting a potential return on investment. Early Solana investors experienced similar gains when SOL was trading at just a few cents before reaching triple-digit valuations. Those who recognize Web3Bay’s potential at this stage could be positioning themselves for significant future returns. The Web3Bay presale is not just about acquiring tokens; it’s about participating in the evolution of e-commerce. Web3Bay: Utility Over Speculation Many projects in the current crypto market rely heavily on speculation rather than real-world utility. Meme coins experience rapid pumps and dumps, DeFi projects grapple with liquidity challenges, and even established blockchains can encounter scalability issues. Web3Bay takes a different path by creating a product that directly challenges some of the largest companies in the world. For years, e-commerce giants have dominated online shopping, controlling seller policies, increasing fees, and monetizing user data. Web3Bay challenges this centralized model by establishing a decentralized, transparent e-commerce marketplace where buyers and sellers can interact directly. Web3Bay’s focus on user empowerment and direct interaction is what sets it apart. Many missed out on early opportunities with Solana and Ethereum. Web3Bay, however, is at the beginning of its growth phase. Its presale offers a compelling early-stage opportunity in the crypto space. Those who acquire 3BAY tokens before widespread adoption could see exponential returns. For investors seeking the next significant opportunity, Web3Bay is emerging as a compelling option. While Solana and SUI have demonstrated growth, their potential upside is not as substantial as what Web3Bay offers. Web3Bay is not just building a platform; it’s building a community. Looking Ahead: The Future of E-commerce With Solana and SUI already at substantial valuations, the most promising investment opportunities lie in emerging projects with practical applications. Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leading decentralized e-commerce platform, addressing the challenges that traditional online marketplaces often overlook. As its presale surpasses $1.120 million and demand continues to grow, Web3Bay is demonstrating that it is more than just another altcoin. It represents a movement toward the future of online commerce. For those seeking a potentially transformative investment, Web3Bay offers a compelling opportunity before its presale concludes and potential price increases begin.

The analyst outlined several factors that could contribute to the parabolic rally to the ambitious $100 target. Factors That Could Contribute To The $100 XRP Price Target In a YouTube video, Jikh highlighted a potential end to the Ripple SEC lawsuit as one of the factors that could spark the XRP price rally to the $100 target. He cited the SEC’s removal of the Ripple case from its website, which indicates that legal pressure is easing. The Commission’s agreement with Binance to pause their ongoing legal battle has also sparked optimism that the Ripple lawsuit could soon end. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Golden Pocket: Analyst Says It’s A Good Buy At These Levels Jikh then alluded to a Nasdaq report stating that 80% of Japanese banks are set to adopt XRP for global payments. The analyst is confident that this move will cause adoption to skyrocket, which could contribute to the projected rally to $100. He noted that Japan’s banking system is huge, which makes this a big deal for the altcoin. Furthermore, the crypto pundit highlighted the potential approval of the XRP ETFs as another factor that could drive the XRP price to the $100 target. He noted how the Bitcoin price surged to new highs after the Bitcoin ETFs were approved, and Jikh believes something similar could happen. Another factor that the crypto analyst believes could contribute to the XRP price rally to $100 is the possibility of Ripple’s payment system replacing SWIFT. He highlighted how the global payment industry is worth trillions of dollars. As such, Ripple processing a huge chunk of these global payments could cause XRP’s utility and demand to skyrocket, ultimately impacting its price. Other Bullish Fundamentals For The Altcoin Meanwhile, Jikh also alluded to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple’s Real USD (RLUSD) as factors that could contribute to the XRP price rally to $100. He noted that the XRPL processes around 1,500 transactions, making it a potential option for tokenization plans, which is bullish for the asset. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Shake Off Crash, Target This Major Resistance On The Road To $3.85 If the XRPL becomes the go-to platform for tokenizing real-world assets such as stocks and bonds, this will help drive demand up and make the crypto more valuable. The RLUSD stablecoin is also bullish for XRP as its burn mechanism helps remove XRP from circulation as its utility grows. Jikh then alluded to the possibility of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse being on the White House Crypto Advisory Council. This is especially bullish for the XRP price as Garlinghouse being on the Council could cement its place in the newly-created US sovereign wealth fund. At the time of writing, the asset’s price is trading at around $2.55, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Qubetics Presale Hits $12.6M, TRON Surpasses 125M Users, and Cronos (CRO) Eyes a Comeback!",https://thecoinrise.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-and-hold-for-short-term-qubetics-presale-hits-12-6m-tron-surpasses-125m-users-and-cronos-cro-eyes-a-comeback/,"Which altcoins should you be eyeing right now for short-term gains? The crypto market is buzzing with excitement, and three projects—Qubetics, TRON (TRX), and Cronos (CRO)—are making major waves. Qubetics’ presale has skyrocketed past $12.6 million, TRON has surpassed an incredible 125 million active users, and Cronos (CRO) is showing signs of a strong recovery after a sharp decline. While TRON’s expanding network adoption and Cronos’ market rebound have caught investor attention, Qubetics is leading the pack with its decentralized VPN innovation and a presale that keeps smashing milestones. With the mainnet launch expected in Q2 2025, investors are jumping in before the next 10% price increase. Let’s break down why these are the best altcoins to buy and hold for the short term . Qubetics: Revolutionizing Privacy with Decentralized VPN Technology The internet is broken—censorship, surveillance, and privacy invasions are at an all-time high. Traditional VPN services claim to offer security, but the reality is that most centralized VPN providers log user data, comply with government censorship, and are prone to data breaches. Enter Qubetics’ decentralized VPN (dVPN) . Unlike traditional VPNs that route traffic through centralized servers, Qubetics leverages blockchain technology to decentralize internet access, ensuring true anonymity, censorship resistance, and security. Imagine you’re a journalist covering political conflicts in a country that restricts online freedom. With Qubetics’ dVPN, your internet traffic is routed through an encrypted peer-to-peer network, eliminating the risk of government surveillance or censorship. Similarly, if you’re a crypto trader in a region where exchanges are blocked, Qubetics allows you to securely access global markets without worrying about IP bans. For businesses, this technology is a game-changer. Corporations dealing with sensitive financial data or private communications can operate securely, knowing that no single entity controls the network. Whether it’s protecting intellectual property, safeguarding trade secrets, or ensuring anonymous communications, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN is the future of online privacy. Qubetics Presale: The Best Short-Term Crypto Play Right Now Investors are rushing into the Qubetics presale—and for good reason. Unlike other crypto projects that rely on speculation, Qubetics has a working product, a clear use case, and major partnerships in place. Qubetics Presale by the Numbers: Current Presale Stage: 21 Funds Raised: Over $12.6 million $TICS Tokens Sold: More than 471 million Total Token Holders: Over 19,800 Price Projections for $TICS: $TICS at $0.25 post-presale = 240.64% ROI $TICS at $1 post-mainnet launch = 1,262.56% ROI $TICS at $10 in 2025 = 13,525.66% ROI Every Sunday at 12 AM, the price increases by 10%, rewarding early investors. If you invest $1,000 today at $0.0733 per token, your holdings could be worth $135,256 if Qubetics reaches $10 per token. With the mainnet launch coming in Q2 2025, Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for the short term . TRON Surpasses 125 Million Active Users—Can It Keep Up the Momentum? While Qubetics is surging in presale, TRON (TRX) is making headlines for a different reason. The blockchain network recently surpassed 125 million active addresses, solidifying its position as one of the most widely used blockchain platforms. In January 2025 alone, TRON added over 2 million active users, pushing its total transaction volume to an impressive $3.6 trillion. This surge in adoption boosted TRX’s price by 3.5%, bringing it to $0.243, with a trading volume of $2.3 billion. TRON’s low transaction fees and high-speed network have been a key driver behind its growth, especially in the DeFi and NFT sectors. With TRON’s continued expansion, investors are closely watching whether TRX can sustain this momentum and push towards new all-time highs. Cronos (CRO) Eyes a Comeback After a Sharp Decline Cronos (CRO), the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, has had a volatile ride in recent months. After a sharp decline, CRO is showing signs of recovery, prompting speculation about its next move. Currently, analysts predict CRO could trade between $0.1381 and $0.1658 in 2025, with an average price of $0.1422. The token’s future growth will depend on the continued expansion of Crypto.com’s DeFi ecosystem and NFT marketplace. With the broader market showing bullish signs, CRO’s recovery potential is strong, but investors should be cautious of resistance levels that may slow its comeback. Conclusion: Qubetics Takes the Lead as the Best Altcoin to Buy Now With Qubetics dominating its presale, TRON expanding its network, and Cronos attempting a recovery, the crypto market is offering major short-term opportunities. Qubetics, with its decentralized VPN technology, booming presale, and upcoming mainnet launch, stands out as one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for the short term . TRON’s 125 million users reinforce its strong network growth, and Cronos remains a potential comeback play. For those looking to maximize gains before the next bull run, Qubetics presale is the best short-term crypto opportunity right now.

State senator Chris Rose introduced the Inflation Protection Act of 2025 on Feb. 14. It would allow the Board of Treasury Investments of West Virginia to invest up to 10% of public funds in its account to invest in precious metals, digital assets with a market cap exceeding $750 billion or stablecoins regulated in the United States. Only Bitcoin fits the fund’s requirements Bitcoin is not mentioned in the bill , but it is currently the only digital asset that meets that criterion. If the proportion of digital assets or precious metals grows to exceed 10%, the board is not required to sell them, but no more investments in them are allowed until it falls below that mark. Digital assets can be held in the custody of the treasurer or a third party, or may be in the form of an exchange-traded product. Under the bill, the state’s treasurer can loan or stake its digital assets as long as it is “without increasing the financial risk of the state.” Bitcoin cannot be staked straightforwardly, as the cryptocurrency has a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. It can, however, be staked in wrapped form or held in a staking pool. The bill has been referred to the state senate’s Committee on Banking and Insurance, and from there it will go to the Committee of Finance. Bitcoin reserve funds are gaining support nationwide Rose, a former coal miner, was elected on Nov. 5. He ran on a highly conservative platform and vocally supports U.S. President Donald Trump. In the months he has been in office, he has sponsored 12 bills, including this one. He is not a member of the banking or finance committees. The West Virginia bill was introduced a day after a similar bill reached the Georgia Senate. The Georgia bill specifies that the state would invest in Bitcoin. Of all the state bills on digital asset reserve funds in the United States, Utah’s has made the most progress. That state’s Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments bill has made it through the state house of representatives and has been passed to the state senate.

40342289,https://crypto.news/?p=14336450,1739588400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/40342289.jpeg,"U.S. government prioritizes creating a framework for stablecoins, not Strategic Bitcoin reserve. Why?",https://crypto.news/u-s-government-prioritizes-stablecoins-not-bitcoin-reserve/,"The hopes for a lightning-speed establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin reserve were high. However, it is the stablecoins regulation that becomes a dominant narrative in the high-profile crypto discussions. While the government is working on the legal framework, not everyone in the crypto community understands well how they can capitalize off stablecoins. The U.S. is not going to develop a local CBDC, but the officials are already working on the regulation of the stablecoins pegged to the American dollar. On Feb. 6, 2025, Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill and Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence Subcommittee Chairman Bryan Steil introduced a discussion draft of a bill that will regulate the issuance and operation of the USD-pegged stablecoins. While not everyone agrees that the Strategic Bitcoin reserve is going to strengthen the American dollar in the global arena, Steil believes that properly regulated stablecoins will do this. According to Steil, clear regulations will “bolster the U.S. dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency and protect consumers and investors.” Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott outlined another important benefit of stablecoins–namely, financial inclusion. Through the expansion of the USD-pegged stablecoins, the American dollar value can reach countries with a high unbanked population or weak local currencies. None other than Sen. The new bill is not the first effort aimed at regulating stablecoins in the U.S. The previous effort is known as the Clarity for Payment Stablecoin Act of 2023, however, it is different from the bill discussed these days. On top of this bill, there is a bipartisan bill introduced by the Senate team that includes an author of the Bitcoin reserve proposal, sen. Cynthia Lummis. The bill is called Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act. It regulates stablecoins with a market cap exceeding $10 billion. The new bill is called Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, or STABLE Act. The bill obliges U.S. stablecoin issuers to obtain permission from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and back their crypto 1:1 by cash, short-term U.S. Treasury bills, or central bank reserves. The bill makes OCC accountable for the control over the federally qualified non-bank payment stablecoin issuers. Tether situation Both bills will impact the future of Tether, a USD-pegged stablecoin with the biggest market cap. Tether has a long history of legal battles and speculations concerning the solvency of the company. The audits provided by Tether in the past were not always met with trust. On Feb. 13, JPMorgan analysts voiced their concerns over Teather’s prospects in the light of the upcoming regulations, claiming that Tether will probably have to sell part of its Bitcoin holdings in order to fit the new requirements. According to JPMorgan, Tether has only 66% to 83% of the required amount to back its crypto supply, depending on which bill will be adopted. JPM analysts are salty because they don't own Bitcoin. — Paolo Ardoino 🤖🍐 (@paoloardoino) February 13, 2025 Although Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dismissed JPMorgan’s concerns with wit and humor and added that the company holds enough money. The biggest stablecoin issuer already had to leave Europe following the adoption of the new stablecoin laws while the main competitor of Tether, the Circle, managed to comply with the new rules. You might also like: Coinbase delists Tether, other MiCA noncompliant stablecoins Introduced bills are not looking just to hunt down dubious players, they rather aim to offer safe opportunities for U.S. citizens and companies and cement the global American dollar dominance in the crypto race era. The latter task especially needs speedy solutions as de-dollarization became a consistent narrative of many major countries in the 2020s. The pace of change in DC's crypto policy might catch everyone off guard but not in the way they expect. While many overestimate how quickly the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve will take shape, they’re overlooking how rapidly the US is moving on stablecoins. The story is stablecoins. — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) February 13, 2025 Bitwise portfolio manager and head of Alpha Strategies Jeff Park, whose posts about economy and cryptocurrencies usually turn heads, outlines the growing momentum of stablecoins for a good reason: unlike Bitcoin, they take the American dollar value across the world with an unseen ease. The countries whose residents rely on the USD but have troubled access to it may enjoy the benefits of the USD’s strengths while maintaining independence from the local economic conditions and restrictions. Some Americans cannot understand how they will benefit from the rise of the USD-pegged stablecoins if their value is not changing. The answer is simple: as stablecoins facilitate wider exposure of the USD value across the world, it will increase international demand for the American dollar, driving its value and benefiting the U.S. position in the global economy. Demand for easy-in-use dollars will drive liquidity of stablecoins, benefiting the crypto market per se. Those who want faster returns may think of more sophisticated ways like investing in the American stablecoin issuers’ stocks. During a Feb. 12 speech at a San Francisco conference, Fed governor Christopher Waller expressed the very same sentiment, outlining the stablecoins’ potential in expanding the U.S. dollar abroad. However, he warned about possible problems if the framework turns out to be flawed. The new regulations will hit at the right time, as stablecoins are on the rise. The latest examples are coming from Ripple and MasterCard. Ripple launched its stablecoin RLUSD this year. In several weeks, the market cap hit a whopping $100 million mark. MasterCard has recently acknowledged it was using blockchain for its transactions in 2024. According to the company statement, around 30% of its transactions were tokenized that year. The company went further to claim stablecoins have the potential to disrupt traditional finance.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2.

Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven its appeal.

Toncoin (TON) experiences volatility due to large holder actions, Hedera (HBAR) sets its sights on new price heights, and Web3Bay continues its growth within the Web3 commerce sector. While traders scrutinize TON’s potential price reversal and HBAR’s optimistic targets, investors seeking substantial returns are increasingly drawn to Web3Bay , a blockchain-based marketplace reshaping online shopping. Having achieved a $1.2 million presale mark and demonstrating 50X growth potential, Web3Bay is demonstrating that the most promising crypto opportunities arise not from speculative tokens but from practical, real-world application. The project has sold nearly 300 million tokens during its presale. Toncoin’s Deep Dive: Will the Whales Sink or Swim? Toncoin (TON) has been subject to substantial whale activity, with significant token sales by large holders. The market has reacted with notable volatility, and analysts suggest a significant price reversal is possible as TON approaches a key support level. Whale sell-offs frequently induce anxiety among individual investors. However, they can also pave the way for a robust recovery if sufficient buying interest emerges. Although Toncoin remains an asset of interest for short-term traders, its long-term direction remains uncertain, especially when compared to projects with strong utility-driven demand, such as Web3Bay. The top performing crypto, Web3Bay, offers a more stable and promising investment opportunity. Hedera’s High Hopes: Can It Reach $2.23? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) has shown an upward trend, with analysts predicting a 50% increase that could propel the token to $2.23. This optimism is fueled by enterprise adoption, as Hedera consistently secures partnerships across finance, supply chain management, and data handling. While HBAR’s fundamentals are robust, its growth is more gradual and heavily reliant on corporate collaborations. This makes it a suitable long-term holding, but not the type of explosive opportunity that generates substantial short-term gains. Compared to HBAR, Web3Bay’s model facilitates faster user adoption, as it directly targets millions of e-commerce users, rather than depending on the slower pace of enterprise agreements. Web3Bay is a top performing crypto with the potential for rapid growth. Revolutionizing Retail: Web3Bay’s Bold Vision for E-Commerce Unlike Toncoin, which deals with market volatility, and Hedera, which concentrates on enterprise adoption, Web3Bay addresses a challenge that affects everyone—online shopping. Currently, the e-commerce sector is dominated by giants like Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, which impose significant seller fees, restrict product listings, and control all user data. Web3Bay is changing this dynamic by establishing a decentralized, blockchain-powered marketplace where buyers and sellers interact directly, retaining more of their profits and data. Unlike numerous blockchain projects that struggle with real-world applications, Web3Bay seamlessly integrates cryptocurrency payments and traditional payment options (including PayPal), making it one of the few Web3 platforms prepared for mainstream users. With over $1.2 million secured in presale, Web3Bay is proving that investors recognize its disruptive potential. The current 3BAY price of $0.004562 represents an early entry point before its anticipated launch at $0.1959, presenting a potential 4,193% return on investment. Web3Bay is a top performing crypto poised to revolutionize e-commerce. If Web3Bay follows the growth pattern of previous e-commerce disruptors, 3BAY could realistically reach $0.50 in 2025, transforming a $1,000 investment today into $10,960. In contrast to volatile assets like TON or slow-moving assets like HBAR, Web3Bay possesses the fundamental elements to scale rapidly as it addresses real problems within a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Web3Bay is a top performing crypto. The Next Big Thing in Crypto: Web3Bay’s Winning Formula The Web3 space is filled with speculation, but Web3Bay is among the few projects with a clear path to mainstream adoption. While Toncoin navigates unpredictable whale movements and Hedera awaits corporate adoption, Web3Bay is actively developing a decentralized economy where users gain immediate benefits. Instead of depending on hype cycles or partnerships, Web3Bay’s value comes from its actual marketplace users, making it one of the most sustainable blockchain projects available. Web3Bay is a top performing crypto because of its focus on real-world utility. While Toncoin whales create market fluctuations and Hedera pursues its next price milestone, Web3Bay is spearheading a much larger movement—decentralized commerce. With a presale that has already exceeded $1.2 million, and one of the most practical use cases in blockchain, Web3Bay isn’t simply another cryptocurrency—it represents the future of online shopping. For those seeking the best Web3 investment for 2025, Web3Bay is the clear leader before its presale concludes and demand increases. This top performing crypto is changing the landscape of online commerce.

Every week, new contenders enter the race, and this time, three powerhouses are stealing the show—BTFD Coin, Pudgy Penguins, and Floki. These aren’t just your run-of-the-mill internet money grabs; they’re cultural phenomena with real traction, real hype, and real potential to explode. So, if you’re looking for the top new meme coins to invest in this week, buckle up—because things are about to get wild. BTFD Coin’s presale is making serious waves, already raking in over $6.07 million, selling more than 69 billion tokens, and boasting a holder count of 10,700 and growing. With only two stages left, time is running out to grab this coin at presale prices before it blasts off to exchanges. What’s more? Every token bought during Stage 14 is DOUBLED—yes, you get twice the tokens for your money using the LAUNCH100 bonus code. Curious? Keep reading! BTFD Coin: The Bulls Are Heading Into the Meme Coin Arena, and You Don’t Want to Get Left Behind Picture this: You’re at a high-stakes poker game.

The Bulls Squad is an investment playbook wrapped in meme magic. Baby Bull is your entry point, showing the importance of stacking up early. Nerdy Bull crunches the numbers, proving the staking rewards (a jaw-dropping 90% APY ) make this a money-making machine. Raging Bull? He’s the designer of the group with unimaginable creativity. And Peoples Bull? He’s the community-driven powerhouse ensuring BTFD Coin keeps growing. Together, they turn holders into winners. With analysts predicting that BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006 post-exchange and potentially $0.006 down the line, the ROI sits at a mind-blowing 3,650% for those who buy in now at $0.00016 per token. But time is running out—Stage 14 is nearly sold out, and after two more stages, the presale is gone for good. And don’t forget—every purchase made now is DOUBLED during this stage. Use the LAUNCH100 bonus code, and you’ll be locking in an even bigger stack before the FOMO train leaves the station. Floki: The Viking of Meme Coins Keeps Sailing Floki has been around long enough to earn its stripes, and this meme coin refuses to fade into the background. Named after Elon Musk’s dog, this token is more than just a fun name—it’s part of an ecosystem that includes DeFi, NFTs, and a metaverse project known as Valhalla. The community, famously known as the Floki Vikings, is one of the strongest in the space, constantly pushing the project forward. Floki’s strength lies in its ability to ride the hype cycles while continuously expanding its utility. With major marketing campaigns and partnerships, it keeps cementing its place among the top new meme coins to invest in this week. If you believe in meme coins with actual ecosystems, Floki is one you can’t ignore. Pudgy Penguins: The Chilled Out Meme Coin With a Cult Following If you think meme coins are just about wild speculation, Pudgy Penguins is here to prove you wrong. What started as an NFT phenomenon has evolved into a tokenized movement that merges collectibles, community, and Web3 innovation. Pudgy Penguins leans heavily on branding, social influence, and merchandising to create lasting value. The Pudgy Penguins brand has already seen mainstream adoption, with partnerships, toy lines, and even talks of animated series. And with its recent expansion into tokenomics, Pudgy Penguins is solidifying itself among the top new meme coins to invest in this week.

40343399,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675012,1739589667,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40343399.jpeg,Google insists it will maintain AI lead over China’s DeepSeek,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/google-insists-ai-lead-over-china-deepseek/,"Demis Hassabis, Google’s AI Chief, feels confident in the company’s ability to maintain its lead in the AI sector despite the emergence of China’s DeepSeek. Hassabis claimed Google has models that can not only compete but beat out the field. DeepSeek, the infamous low-cost AI model created by a nondescript Chinese group, has had the US’s top AI startups and companies worried and on the defensive since its emergence and consequent run to the top of Apple and Android app stores. In fact, investors dumped American tech stocks, including Nvidia, Vertiv Holdings, and Microsoft, based on fears that the existence of models like DeepSeek could threaten the dominance giants in the sector currently enjoy. Google sounded confident during its all-hands meeting in Paris Google’s AI chief told employees at an all-hands meeting in Paris on Wednesday that he’s not worried about DeepSeek, insisting to his company’s staff that it possesses superior artificial intelligence technology. During the meeting, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai read aloud a question about DeepSeek that wanted to know “what lessons and implications” Google has been able to glean from DeepSeek’s success as the company trains future models. The question was an AI summary of submissions from employees. DeepSeek has claimed, according to a research paper released last month, that its AI model was trained at a fraction of the cost of other leading models like OpenAI’s funds-guzzling ChatGPT. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis provided the answer. In his response, he urged people to look at the details, which suggests an exaggeration on DeepSeek’s end. Hassabis surmised that DeepSeek’s reported cost of AI training was likely “only a tiny fraction” of the total cost of developing its systems. He said DeepSeek most likely used a lot more hardware than it revealed and that it also relied on Western AI models. “ We actually have more efficient, more performant models than DeepSeek,” Hassabis boasted , adding that Google is quite “calm and confident” that it has all the ingredients it needs to maintain leadership. While Hassabis boasted about Google’s capabilities, he also acknowledged DeepSeek’s accomplishments and how impressive they are. He called the lab responsible for building the model possibly “the best team” out of China and something to be taken seriously. While Hassabis acknowledged DeepSeek’s impressive achievements, he also noted the security and geopolitical implications of their advancements, as several US agencies have restricted staff from using DeepSeek, citing security concerns. Employee concerns were also addressed during the meeting During the all-hands meeting, Google executives also took the opportunity to address employee concerns regarding the recent changes to the company’s AI principles, particularly the removal of a pledge against using AI for weapons or surveillance. Pichai read aloud an AI-summarized version of the questions, ending with “Why did we remove this section?” The question was directed to Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs, who has reportedly worked with Hassabis, James Manyika, a senior vice president at the company, and others on the effort that “shifted our approach,” starting last year. The pledge removal affected AI principles established in 2018 after Google refused to renew a government contract called Project Maven, which helped to analyze and interpret drone videos using AI. Walker explained that the shift in AI principles reflects the evolving nature of the technology and the need for more nuanced discussions compared to the strict prohibitions that governed it in 2018. He also pointed out that the tech is now being used in more diverse scenarios, though it is still unclear why that should cause a removal of Google’s pledge not to use AI for surveillance or weapons .

40343109,https://coingape.com/?p=239068,1739590203,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Analyst Reveals How The XRP Price Will Hit New ATH Of $5,https://coingape.com/analyst-reveals-how-the-xrp-price-will-hit-new-ath-of-5/,"Crypto analyst Dark Defender has predicted that the XRP price could soon rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $5. The analyst revealed a bullish pattern that had formed for XRP, which showed that the crypto could reach this price target and rally higher. How The XRP Price Will Reach A New ATH Of $5 In an X post , crypto analyst Dark Defender predicted that the XRP price will reach a new ATH of $5. He remarked that after eliminating the $2.90 level, XRP could proceed to the critical Fibonacci level of $5.85. The analyst also revealed that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has the golden cross, which he claimed is bullish. He outlined the short-term targets for XRP, which include $2.90, $5.85, and $8.03. Dark Defender added that $2.44 and $2.33 are support levels for the crypto. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that XRP could hit this $5 price target sometime in March, after which it would rally to the $8 mark. Dark Defender had previously predicted that the crypto could hit $8 as long as it reclaims the $3 price level, which remains a crucial breakeven point. Meanwhile, crypto analyst CasiTrades warned market participants to watch out for the $2.67 and $2.95 resistance levels, which are critical to XRP’s reaching a new ATH. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto noted that the crypto was bouncing off and asserted that $4 should be the next level, which would also mark a new ATH for XRP. Another Bullish Formation For The Crypto In an X post, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto highlighted another bullish XRP price pattern. He remarked that XRP is now eyeing the ascending triangle and added that a close above $2.75 could lead to a positive move. According to Egrag Crypto, the target for XRP is $3.40. He asserted that closing above this level is key for a new ATH. Meanwhile, although he didn’t give much detail, the analyst also alluded to a familiar pattern that he claimed is emerging for XRP. Egrag Crypto remarked that he is still analyzing this recurring pattern. However, he added that he is amazed at how it is unfolding with such “coherence and synergy to previous patterns.” It is worth mentioning that the analyst recently predicted that XRP could reach $110 in the next market cycle. For this cycle, he predicted that the crypto could top at around $13. Ripple Whales Are Making Their Moves Amid the projected surge for the XRP price, Ripple whales have been making their moves as they look to position for this price surge. Whale Alert data shows that a Whale recently moved 60 million XRP ($163.7 million) from an unknown wallet to another unknown wallet. Meanwhile, as CoinGape reported, these whales also moved 430 million coins. Ripple was at the center of one of the transactions, as the firm transferred 300 million coins from its wallet to an unknown wallet.

Although it recently recorded a slight daily gain, the asset remains trapped in bearish territory, trading below the $4 mark. Despite this challenging price performance, analysts suggest that Toncoin may be nearing a significant accumulation phase. Related Reading: New Data Suggests Toncoin (TON) Might Be Undervalued—Here’s What It Means Key Metrics Indicate Potential Recovery Amid these market conditions, a CryptoQuant contributor, Crazzyblockk, recently shared a detailed outlook on TON. In a post titled “TON Enters Key Buy Zone – A Prime Opportunity,” the analyst outlined key findings from the Ton Price Models. These models indicate that Toncoin has reached the 0.6x 250-day moving average bottom zone—historically considered a strong accumulation level. Crazzyblockk notes that this data-driven model suggests TON is undervalued, presenting a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors. Notably, the Ton Price Models leverage historical data to identify oversold conditions and potential entry points. According to Crazzyblockk, assets trading near 0.6x–0.8x of their 250-day moving average often signal strong buy conditions. Historically, these levels have served as ideal accumulation zones before major market upturns. The analyst emphasized that TON’s current price position aligns with previous setups that have led to significant price recoveries, making it a promising target for data-driven investment strategies. Toncoin Price Performance And Outlook Meanwhile, Toncoin’s price on the higher time frame has continued to demonstrate a bearish move. In the past two weeks alone, this metric has fallen by a double-digit of 23.4% and roughly a 54.3% decrease away from its all-time high of $8.25 registered in June 2024. However zooming in, TON has shown resilience recording a slight increase of 2.8% in the past day. This uptick although little has been able to push TON’s price above $3.8 nearing the $4 mark. Interestingly, while TON’s price has risen today, its daily trading volume is notably lower compared to last Friday, when the asset was trading at a similar price level. Last Friday, TON’s trading volume exceeded $214 million. However, as of today, it has decreased to $161.2 million. One possible explanation for this drop in trading volume could be a shift in investor behavior, with some market participants holding their positions rather than actively trading, potentially in anticipation of continued price appreciation. Speaking of price appreciation, a renowned crypto analyst known as Ali on X has recently shared an interesting analysis on Toncoin using the TD Sequential indicator. Related Reading: Is Toncoin Set for a Comeback? Key Market Signals Point to a Possible Rebound This indicator is a tool that helps identify potential trend reversals and exhaustion points in price movements. It works by counting a series of consecutive price bars that close higher (in an uptrend) or lower (in a downtrend) than previous bars, forming a sequential count. Once the count reaches a certain number—often 9 or 13—the indicator suggests that the prevailing trend may be losing momentum and could reverse or pause. According to Ali, TON is on the verge of a rebound based on this tool. #Toncoin $TON is showing signs of a potential rebound as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal on the weekly chart! pic.twitter.com/nRtabmxjxQ — Ali (@ali_charts) February 14, 2025 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Toncoin (TON)|altcoin|altcoin market|TON|Toncoin|Toncoin Market|TONUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|TON|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-15 03:30:18

In a data breach notification, the Office of the Maine Attorney General says the California-based non-profit organization NorthBay Healthcare Corporation experienced an external system breach affecting 569,012 Americans. In a notice sent to affected people, NorthBay Health says an unauthorized entity gained access to the firm’s computer systems between January 11th, 2024 and April 1st of the same year. The firm also says that an internal investigation revealed that the data breach exposed the records of individuals including names, birthdays, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, financial account numbers, medical information, biometric information, health insurance information, driver’s license numbers and state or other government-issued identification numbers. The hackers also siphoned highly sensitive data including usernames and passwords, credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, security codes and personal identification numbers (PINs). NorthBay Health says it has revamped its security protocols to prevent witnessing similar data breaches in the future. The firm is also recommending that impacted customers keep a close watch on their credit reports and account statements, offering a free one-year membership to Experian IdentityWorks. “If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained.” NorthBay Health says that it has so far not detected any misuse of its customer data for fraud or identity theft.

Regulatory clarity is improving, institutional adoption is growing, and new technologies are reshaping how we think about finance. However, challenges remain, particularly in global policy coordination, retail customer protection and infrastructure development. Many industry leaders highlighted key trends that will define the years ahead. Some of these developments – like stablecoins as widespread payment tools and the rise of institutional involvement in crypto – seem inevitable. Others, such as the tokenization of RWAs (real-world assets) and on-chain compliance solutions, could radically transform finance but require further innovation and regulatory acceptance. The question is – A re we ready for these shifts Entering the compliance era A major theme for 2025 is regulatory enforcement. The EU’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation is being implemented by the EU member states, with the first licensed firms setting compliance benchmarks. This is a significant step toward legitimizing the industry and could serve as a model for other jurisdictions. However, global regulatory alignment remains a challenge. While MiCA provides clarity in Europe, many other markets lack comprehensive frameworks. This inconsistency creates uncertainty for businesses operating across borders, complicating compliance efforts. Stablecoins as the gateway to crypto and multi-custodial future For many, stablecoins will be their first real interaction with digital assets. In emerging markets, where local currencies are volatile and access to US dollars is limited, stablecoins become a critical financial tool for remittances, savings and commerce. Yet, widespread adoption depends on three key factors. Regulatory clarity. Governments must define how stablecoins fit into financial systems. On/off-ramp accessibility. Users need easy ways to convert between stablecoins and local currencies. While existing systems like SWIFT still play a role, alternative solutions could become dominant in the coming years. Infrastructure development. Global payment networks must evolve to accommodate stablecoin transactions at scale. Yet, as stablecoins integrate further into the global economy, another shift is occurring. 2025 will see a shift toward hybrid custody models. Traditional finance institutions, crypto-native firms and self-custody solutions are increasingly coexisting. This provides flexibility for different types of investors but also might raise concerns about security risks and governance. Large institutional players enter the crypto space Large asset managers and sovereign wealth funds are stepping into crypto. Their participation requires strong due diligence, compliance frameworks and risk mitigation strategies. However, institutional players prefer ‘clean’ assets – some sovereign wealth funds reportedly favor ‘virgin’ Bitcoin to avoid potential regulatory scrutiny. This raises questions about market segmentation and whether these clean assets will trade at a premium. On-chain identity versus traditional AML/KYC checks The idea that KYC reviews could become obsolete with blockchain-based identity solutions is a game-changer. However, adoption depends on whether regulators recognize blockchain-based identity systems as legally valid and acceptable. Without regulatory buy-in, this innovation could remain underutilized. Tech to transform the industry Tokenization of RWAs Tokenization was one of the major topics at the conference. By representing real estate, equities and other assets as blockchain tokens, institutions can potentially unlock additional liquidity. Tokenization could also make it easier for retail investors to participate in asset classes that were once reserved for institutions. However, they remain vulnerable. The crypto market is driven by hype cycles and narratives, and retail investors need more protection via the following. Improved financial education to help retail investors make informed decisions. More transparency in token projects and exchanges. Implementing stronger safeguards against market manipulation and scams. Without addressing these issues, the industry risks losing credibility among everyday users, slowing adoption despite tech advancements. Programmable money Unlike traditional currency, programmable money allows users to embed rules into transactions. This means financial operations can be automated, conditional and compliant by default. This innovation can become a long-term differentiator for crypto beyond Bitcoin . On-chain compliance and analytics Blockchain analytics tools are now integrated into AML and KYC compliance processes. This convergence of regulation and technology allows firms to monitor transactions in real-time, detect illicit activity and ensure regulatory compliance. This shift suggests that crypto is not moving away from regulation but rather adapting to it. Companies that use these tools will likely gain a competitive edge as compliance standards tighten. The road ahead The digital asset industry is moving from speculation to utility, from regulatory uncertainty to compliance and niche adoption to mainstream acceptance. The foundation is being laid – but execution will determine success. The key to navigating this transition is balancing innovation with regulation, ensuring retail customers’ protection and building scalable infrastructure.

Staking is a core mechanism in PoS blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, where validators lock up tokens to secure the network and earn rewards in return. The proposed ETF structures would enable fund investors to benefit from staking yields while maintaining ETF liquidity and compliance with SEC rules. Jito Labs, Multicoin propose two staking models for ETFs Jito Labs CEO Lucas Bruder, Chief Legal Officer Rebecca Rettig, Multicoin Managing Partner Kyle Samani, and General Counsel Greg Xethalis laid out two potential approaches to incorporating staking into crypto ETFs. The first option is staking a portion of the fund’s assets through third-party validators, allowing ETFs to earn rewards while making sure there is enough liquidity for redemptions. The second model introduces liquid staking tokens (LSTs), where ETFs would hold staked versions of assets—such as JitoSOL for Solana—instead of the native tokens themselves. The SEC has a history of skepticism toward staking in ETFs. When asset managers initially applied for Ethereum ETFs, some included staking as a feature, but the SEC ordered them to remove it before approving the applications. The regulator cited concerns about liquidity, tax implications, and whether staking itself could be classified as a securities transaction. One of the biggest obstacles has been the SEC’s T+1 settlement rule, which requires ETFs to allow next-day redemptions, because staked tokens are typically locked up for a set period before they can be withdrawn, which is known as the unbonding period. At the meeting, Jito and Multicoin proposed a workaround: ETFs could stake only a portion of their assets, leaving enough unstaked to ensure redemptions are never delayed. “Staking only 40% or 60% of assets would allow ETFs to maintain liquidity while still generating staking rewards,” the companies told SEC officials. Liquid staking could solve redemption concerns Beyond partial staking, Jito and Multicoin pushed liquid staking as an alternative. Instead of staking native tokens directly, ETFs could hold LSTs, which represent staked assets and maintain liquidity. A major example of this approach is JitoSOL, the liquid staking token for Solana (SOL). Investors who stake SOL with Jito receive JitoSOL in return, which can be traded, transferred, or redeemed for SOL plus rewards. Because LSTs don’t have unbonding periods, ETFs holding them would be fully compliant with redemption rules. Per the meeting notes, SEC officials reportedly acknowledged the potential of liquid staking but raised concerns about how LSTs should be classified under securities laws. The SEC also has two other major concerns about staking in ETFs: taxation and whether staking constitutes a securities transaction. Under U.S. tax law, staking rewards are treated as income and must be reported as taxable earnings. But for an ETF, distributing staking rewards could impact its tax structure, particularly if it’s set up as a grantor trust. The bigger issue is that the SEC’s view on staking-as-a-service. Jito and Multicoin told them that staking should not be considered a securities transaction and that ETFs could be structured to fit existing regulations, so according to the meeting notes, they also discussed possible structural solutions for addressing SEC concerns. One model is the “Services Model”, where ETF issuers contract with validator service providers to stake a portion of their assets while keeping liquidity high. Staking rewards would be accrued to the fund’s value or distributed pro-rata to investors. “In the Services Model, staking service providers will stake native assets on behalf of the ETPs; issuers and APs will have to determine whether and how redemptions can be effectuated within a T+1 cycle due to staked assets becoming available only upon an unbonding period,” the meeting note said. The second approach, known as the “LST Model”, would allow ETFs to hold LSTs directly, using either a dual-commodity model (holding both the native asset and the LST) or a single-commodity model (100% LST). This approach is similar to precious metals basket ETFs like WITE and GLTR, which hold multiple related assets to track broader commodity markets. The meeting note said, “The LST Model addresses the redemption timeline to comply with the relevant rule and eliminates the question of how the Commission should analyze staking as a service. The LST Model also simplifies the creation-redemption mechanism, accounting, and grantor trust issues for the ETP and could be operated consistent with precious metals basket ETPs such as WITE and GLTR.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-15 04:47:06

Despite the sell-pressure on bigger coins and the uncertainties circling the global crypto market, meme coins seem to be on another sentiment frequency. Investors who keep benefiting from these surges in prices are constantly looking for the next wave to jump on. Enter $CHONE, a rising meme coin with stronger upside potential. Speculations suggest a 1500% surge in price in the coming months. What Andy BSC’s 210% Pump Signals for Meme Coin Traders The surge in Andy BSC over the past 7 days shows that retail traders are piling into meme coin again. The supposed silence in trading activities around big cryptocurrencies seems to be diverted funds to low and mid-cap meme tokens. FOMO and momentum are driving explosive price action overnight, with some coins going 10x-20x. This pattern isn’t random. It follows the rotation of capital within the meme coin sector. While the global market sits back to see where Bitcoin and the rest go, investors are wasting no time investing in meme tokens with the right climate for a pump. Quick returns over long-term profit seem to be the new sentiment driving liquidity into a lot of meme tokens. $ANDY surged by 210% in 7 days, pushing its market cap to $33 million. Its current daily trading volume is above $10 million, with a 54.24% gain in the last 24 hours. Smart money is now looking for the next low-cap, high-potential token to invest in. And this is where the spotlight shines on Chill Drone ($CHONE) . $CHONE Could Be the Next 1500% Market Play $CHONE has a very low market cap of $558.53k and a daily trading volume below $50k. $CHONE low cap offers a more primed market than $ANDY before its 210% surge in 7 days. The huge upside potential to this current trading volume makes $CHONE ideal for early-stage investors. Chill Drone ($CHONE) is rapidly building social traction and community hype through its narrative. As more and more investors buy into the $CHONE narrative, its philosophy is slowly becoming a household chant among its online audience and various crypto communities. $CHONE has also hinted at the announcements of strategic partnerships that could trigger a major rally. In its recent community update, it also announced that it will reward top $CHONE holders in the coming week, sparking excitement within the community. This, alongside other upcoming catalysts, is setting $CHONE up for a pump as high as 1500% in 24 hours or one week. Unlike Andy BSC, which already had its pump and is currently down about 35% in the last 24 hours, $CHONE is just getting started, and investors should position themselves early enough. $CHONE is currently pegged at $0.00056. Why Meme Coins Are the Best Play Right Now Liquidity is flowing heavily into meme coins, and big whales and institutional investors are joining the trend. Traders are actively hunting for the next big move. Historical trends show that once momentum starts, it rotates into newer tokens. We can see this momentum with tokens like Andy BSC, and newer tokens like $CHONE are well-positioned for the next rally.

The latest news suggests a resounding YES! British banking giant Barclays has just revealed a significant $131 million investment in BlackRock’s IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF . This move isn’t just a drop in the ocean; it’s a tidal wave signaling a potential shift in how institutions view and interact with digital assets. Barclays’ Bold Bitcoin ETF Investment: What Does It Mean? The revelation, initially reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, has sent ripples through the crypto community. Barclays, a major player in global finance, holding a substantial position in a Bitcoin ETF like IBIT is a powerful endorsement. It signifies a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, even within traditionally conservative financial institutions. But what exactly does this investment mean for the future of crypto? Institutional Investment in Bitcoin ETF: A Game Changer? Institutional investment is often considered the holy grail for crypto adoption. Large players like Barclays bringing significant capital into the Bitcoin ETF market validates the asset class and provides much-needed liquidity. This influx of funds can lead to increased stability and maturity in the crypto market, potentially reducing volatility in the long run. Moreover, it opens the door for other institutions to follow suit, creating a snowball effect. IBIT and the Rise of Spot Bitcoin ETFs BlackRock’s IBIT is a spot Bitcoin ETF , meaning it directly holds Bitcoin, unlike futures-based ETFs. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by regulatory bodies like the SEC in the US was a landmark moment. It provides a regulated and accessible way for institutions and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. IBIT, being managed by BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, brings an added layer of trust and credibility, making it an attractive option for institutional investors like Barclays. Crypto Adoption: Barclays Leading the Charge? Barclays’ investment can be seen as a significant step forward for crypto adoption . It demonstrates that even established financial institutions are recognizing the potential of digital assets and are willing to allocate capital to this space. This move could encourage wider adoption by other traditional financial players, further legitimizing cryptocurrencies and driving mainstream acceptance. Is Barclays setting a trend? It certainly appears so. Analyzing the $131 Million Investment While $131 million is a substantial sum, it’s important to consider it within the context of Barclays’ total assets under management. However, the symbolic importance of this Institutional Investment in a Bitcoin ETF outweighs the absolute dollar value. It’s a clear signal of intent and a public declaration of Barclays’ entry into the crypto space via a regulated and established product. This could be just the beginning of a larger allocation to digital assets in the future. In conclusion, Barclays’ $131 million investment in BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving landscape of finance. It underscores the growing crypto adoption by traditional institutions and marks a significant milestone for the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an asset class. As more institutions follow suit, the future of crypto looks increasingly intertwined with the established financial world.

40345512,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129035,1739595509,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive: Hong Kong SFC’s Expert Panel to Reshape Crypto Regulation Landscape,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hong-kong-sfc-crypto-panel/,"Hong Kong is making significant strides in the realm of virtual assets! In a landmark move towards establishing itself as a premier crypto hub, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has officially convened its Virtual Asset Consultative Panel (VACP). This inaugural meeting, held on February 14th, signals a proactive approach to navigating the complexities of the digital asset world. But what exactly does this mean for the future of crypto in Hong Kong and beyond? Let’s dive into the details. What is the Hong Kong SFC Advisory Panel and Why Does it Matter? The Virtual Asset Consultative Panel (VACP) is not just another committee; it’s a strategic assembly of senior management figures from all licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong. Think of it as a think tank dedicated to shaping the future of Hong Kong crypto regulation . Chaired by Dr. Eric Yip, this panel is designed to be a crucial bridge between regulators and industry leaders. Why is this important? Because effective regulation in the rapidly evolving crypto space requires a deep understanding of both the opportunities and the inherent risks. Here’s why the VACP is a game-changer: Expert Guidance: Comprising seasoned professionals directly involved in the virtual asset industry, the panel offers invaluable insights to the SFC. Proactive Policy Shaping: Instead of reactive measures, the VACP aims to proactively shape regulatory policies, ensuring they are both robust and conducive to innovation. Sustainable Ecosystem: The ultimate goal is to foster a sustainable and resilient crypto ecosystem in Hong Kong, attracting businesses and investors while maintaining market integrity. Focus on Investor Protection: A Top Priority One of the core mandates of the SFC, and consequently the VACP, is investor protection . The crypto market, while brimming with potential, can be volatile and complex. Ensuring that investors are adequately protected is paramount for building trust and fostering wider adoption. The panel will likely address key investor protection measures such as: Enhanced Disclosure Requirements: Making sure virtual asset trading platforms are transparent about risks and operational practices. Robust Security Protocols: Strengthening cybersecurity measures to safeguard investor assets from hacks and fraud. Fair Trading Practices: Implementing rules to prevent market manipulation and ensure fair trading environments. Encouraging Innovation in the Virtual Asset Space While safeguarding investors is crucial, stifling innovation is not the objective. The SFC recognizes the transformative potential of virtual assets and aims to strike a balance. The VACP is tasked with finding ways to encourage innovation within a well-regulated framework. This includes exploring opportunities in areas like: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Examining the potential and risks of DeFi protocols and how they can be integrated responsibly. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Understanding the evolving landscape of NFTs and their applications beyond collectibles. Blockchain Technology: Exploring broader applications of blockchain technology and its integration with traditional financial systems. Challenges and Opportunities for Virtual Asset Trading Platforms in Hong Kong For licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong, the establishment of the VACP presents both challenges and significant opportunities. The increased regulatory scrutiny demands compliance and adaptation, but it also provides a pathway to legitimacy and broader market acceptance. Challenges Opportunities Navigating evolving regulatory landscape Enhanced credibility and trust Meeting stricter compliance requirements Access to institutional investors Adapting to new operational guidelines First-mover advantage in a regulated market Maintaining profitability under tighter regulations Long-term sustainability and growth The Road Ahead for Hong Kong’s Crypto Ecosystem The inaugural VACP meeting is just the beginning. It marks a pivotal moment in the development of Hong Kong crypto regulation . The ongoing dialogue between the SFC and industry experts is crucial for creating a regulatory framework that is both effective and forward-looking. The focus on fostering a resilient crypto ecosystem while prioritizing investor protection and encouraging innovation sets a positive tone for the future of virtual assets in Hong Kong. Expect to see further developments and policy updates stemming from the VACP’s deliberations. Hong Kong is clearly positioning itself as a serious player in the global crypto arena, and this consultative approach could serve as a model for other jurisdictions navigating the complexities of digital asset regulation.

Toncoin Is Still Trading A Notable Distance Above Its Realized Price In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in a few indicators related to Toncoin. The first metric of relevance is the “Realized Price,” which tells us, in short, the cost basis of the average investor on the TON network. When the spot price of the cryptocurrency is trading above this indicator, it means the holders as a whole can be assumed to be carrying a net amount of unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the metric implies the dominance of loss in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Volume Close To Growing Again: Bullish Sign? Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows the trend in the Toncoin Realized Price over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Toncoin price has been above the Realized Price for a while now, which means the investors on the whole have been enjoying gains. This arrangement hasn’t changed even after the drawdown that the coin has witnessed recently. Historically, the Realized Price has acted as a support level for the asset. The reason behind this is the fact that investors can be likely to react to dips to their cost basis by buying more, if the mood in the market is bullish. At present, the metric has a value of $2.43, which is significantly under the spot price. Based on the historical pattern, Glassnode notes that the level “remains a crucial level for potential buying pressure.” The next indicator shared by the analytics firm is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. This metric keeps track of the ratio between the spot price and Realized Price of Toncoin. From the chart, it’s apparent that the ratio has gone down recently and has reached a value of around 1.54. “This means that, on average, investors are sitting at ~54% unrealized profit,” explains Glassnode. Related Reading: XRP Targeting $15 If This Pattern Holds, Analyst Says While the overall market has been able to withstand the recent downturn, it doesn’t mean that there has been no panic loss selling at all for Toncoin. As the below chart for the Realized Loss shows, the buyers who got in during the top ended up realizing a massive amount of loss in the price plunge. TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.77, up almost 3% in the last 24 hours.

Concurrently, DOGEN is capturing attention with an extraordinary 25,000% return on investment. These unexpected developments are generating buzz in the crypto sector. What implications might these trends have for investors and the broader market? DOGEN Explodes 500% Post-DEX Listing; CEX Listing on the Horizon? DOGEN, the meme-inspired token designed for those who never settle for mediocrity, is demonstrating robust technical and fundamental strength. Crafted for top achievers, DOGEN represents an alpha mindset, which has already resonated with a community of over 30,000 followers on X. Recent Price Movements & Trends Following its debut on Raydium DEX on February 4th, DOGEN surged to an all-time high of $0.0066 before settling to around $0.002. Despite this correction, it's still up a remarkable 566% from its initial presale price of $0.0003. The presale itself garnered $5.5 million, highlighting the substantial early interest in the project. Technical Signals & Breakout Prospects DOGEN's fully diluted valuation (FDV) is currently $28 million, with potential growth to $40 million. This increase in valuation indicates a near-term price target of $0.004 or higher. The recent price trend shows DOGEN testing crucial support within a descending channel. A break above $0.0032 could reverse the current downtrend, paving the way for a strong bullish move towards $0.0056, in line with past resistance levels. An anticipated listing on a major exchange is likely to bring new liquidity and enhance access to $DOGEN, often a significant price driver for meme coins. With just 1 billion tokens in circulation (10% of the total supply), DOGEN's price remains highly reactive to increased demand, setting the stage for further volatility that favors bullish investors. Consider Buying DOGEN Before Potential 3x Increase – Don't Miss Out on CEX Hype Community Excited About DOGEN Reaching $100M+ Valuation DOGEN's impressive performance post-listing and strong presale momentum have caught the attention of many in the community. The eezzy’s journal channel, with over 50,000 subscribers, has highlighted DOGEN's potential as a major memecoin on Solana, possibly achieving a market cap over $100 million. DOGEN has already showcased its capability for rapid rallies, and with growing speculation surrounding its CEX listing, the likelihood of retesting its $0.005 all-time high—or surpassing it—is increasing. Should the momentum persist, DOGEN could enter a parabolic price discovery phase, surpassing its current FDV limits. DOGEN is Still Undervalued – Act Now Before the CEX Listing XRP: A Fast and Affordable Option for Global Transactions XRP operates on the XRP Ledger, aiming to facilitate fast, affordable, and borderless transactions. Developed by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it launched with a total of 100 billion coins, of which 80 billion were given to Ripple for further development. XRP functions independently of a central authority, ensuring secure and irreversible transactions without requiring a bank account. Ripple leverages XRP to enhance liquidity and support its ecosystem, managing supply through escrow. The technology seeks to enable seamless currency transfers globally. In the current crypto market cycle, XRP remains influential in cross-border payment solutions, underscoring its significance in the digital currency arena. Final Thoughts While XRP may offer less immediate growth, DOGEN presents significant potential for those pursuing luxury and success. With expectations of a 700% increase by the end of its presale and possible thousand-fold growth during this altcoin season, DOGEN is following in the footsteps of tokens like BONK and Popcat. It fosters a community of leaders while offering tangible benefits and exclusive perks for early supporters.

In a significant victory for the crypto exchange, France’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) has officially removed Bybit from its blacklist. This positive development marks the culmination of over two years of dedicated effort by Bybit to align with regulatory standards, signaling a major step forward for the platform in the European market. Let’s delve into what this triumph means for Bybit, its users, and the broader landscape of crypto exchange regulation. Bybit’s Blacklist Removal: A Deep Dive into France’s Regulatory Review For those following the developments in crypto exchange regulation, Bybit’s journey in France has been closely watched. Back in May 2022, the AMF, France’s financial regulatory body, added Bybit to its blacklist of unauthorized entities. This was a significant hurdle for Bybit, raising concerns about its operational compliance within France. However, instead of retreating, Bybit chose to engage proactively with the regulators. According to a recent report by Cointelegraph, this engagement has paid off. After more than two years of working closely with the AMF, Bybit has successfully demonstrated its commitment to meeting regulatory compliance standards. As a result, the AMF has officially taken Bybit off its blacklist. This removal signifies that the French regulator now recognizes Bybit’s efforts and improved operational framework. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has confirmed this positive update, underscoring the exchange’s dedication to navigating the complex global regulatory landscape. This successful delisting in France is not just a win for Bybit, but also a testament to the possibility of constructive dialogue and collaboration between crypto exchanges and regulatory bodies. Why is Regulatory Compliance a Game Changer for Crypto Exchanges? In the often turbulent world of cryptocurrencies, regulatory compliance is emerging as a crucial factor for long-term success and sustainability. For crypto exchanges like Bybit, adhering to regulatory frameworks offers a multitude of benefits: Enhanced Credibility and Trust: Operating within a regulated environment significantly boosts an exchange’s credibility. Users gain confidence knowing that the platform is overseen by financial authorities, reducing perceived risks. Wider Market Access: Compliance often opens doors to new markets and user bases. Removal from a blacklist , like in France , is a prime example of regaining market access through regulatory adherence. Sustainable Growth: While navigating regulations can be challenging, it ultimately fosters a more stable and sustainable business model. It reduces the risk of sudden operational disruptions due to regulatory crackdowns. Attracting Institutional Investors: Institutional investors, who are increasingly interested in the crypto space, often prioritize regulated platforms. Compliance can pave the way for attracting larger investments and partnerships. Conversely, non-compliance can lead to severe repercussions, including: Blacklisting and Operational Restrictions: As Bybit experienced initially in France , non-compliance can result in being blacklisted, limiting or completely halting operations in specific jurisdictions. Legal and Financial Penalties: Regulatory bodies can impose hefty fines and legal actions against non-compliant entities. Reputational Damage: Negative publicity surrounding non-compliance can severely damage a crypto exchange’s reputation and erode user trust. Bybit’s Next Frontier: Pursuing the MiCA License in the EU Fresh from its success in France , Bybit is setting its sights on a bigger prize: obtaining a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in the European Union. MiCA is a landmark regulatory framework designed to harmonize the regulation of crypto-assets across all EU member states. Securing a MiCA license would be a significant achievement for Bybit, allowing it to operate legally and seamlessly across the entire EU market. CEO Ben Zhou’s statement about pursuing the MiCA license underscores Bybit’s strategic focus on long-term growth within a regulated framework. This move signals Bybit’s commitment to not just meeting minimum requirements but aiming for a gold standard in regulatory compliance within the European crypto space. Navigating Global Regulatory Challenges: What Lies Ahead for Bybit? While the blacklist removal in France is a cause for celebration, Bybit, like many global crypto exchanges , still faces ongoing regulatory compliance challenges in other regions. The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and rapidly evolving. Different countries and jurisdictions have varying approaches, creating a complex web of rules and requirements for international platforms to navigate. Bybit’s public acknowledgment of “ongoing regulatory challenges in other regions” is a realistic and transparent assessment of the current situation. It highlights the continuous effort required for crypto exchanges to operate globally while adhering to diverse local regulations. However, the success in France demonstrates that proactive engagement and a commitment to compliance can lead to positive outcomes, even in challenging regulatory environments. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Users and the Industry? Bybit’s successful delisting from the AMF blacklist offers several key takeaways: Positive Signal for Regulatory Engagement: This case serves as an encouraging example for other crypto exchanges . It shows that engaging with regulators, rather than avoiding them, can lead to constructive solutions and improved operational standing. Growing Regulatory Acceptance in Europe: France’s decision to remove Bybit from the blacklist , coupled with the EU’s MiCA framework, indicates a growing trend towards regulatory clarity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Europe. Importance of User Due Diligence: For crypto users, this development underscores the importance of choosing regulated and compliant platforms. Operating on exchanges that prioritize regulatory compliance can offer greater security and peace of mind. Continued Evolution of Crypto Regulation: The regulatory landscape is not static. Crypto exchanges and users alike must remain vigilant and adaptable to ongoing changes and developments in regulations worldwide. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Bybit in Europe? Bybit’s removal from France’s AMF blacklist is undoubtedly a significant milestone. It’s a testament to the power of proactive regulatory compliance and constructive dialogue. As Bybit sets its sights on the EU-wide MiCA license, the platform is positioning itself for long-term success and wider adoption in the European market. This victory in France is not just about clearing a hurdle; it’s about building a foundation for a more secure, regulated, and trustworthy future for crypto exchange operations globally. The journey of crypto exchange regulation is far from over, but Bybit’s recent achievement in France is a beacon of progress and a reason for optimism.

Five underrated meme coins are quietly gaining traction, catching the eye of astute investors. Once thought to be mere novelties, these coins could soon deliver exceptional returns. Find out which tokens might become the next breakout sensations in the crypto world. DOGEN Sees a 500% Rise – Could It Be the Next Solana Meme Coin Worth $100M+? DOGEN is making waves, and if you're not on board, you might be overlooking one of the most exciting meme coin stories of 2025. Following a 500% jump after its DEX debut, DOGEN is gaining serious traction, and with a CEX listing on the horizon, the bullish sentiment is only growing stronger. This meme token, built on Solana, promotes itself as the top pick for savvy investors, and the buzz around it is only getting louder. 📈 DOGEN’s Price Continues Its Ascent Since its launch on Raydium DEX on February 4th, DOGEN soared to $0.0066 before settling and stabilizing around $0.002. Even at this price, it's still up by 566% from its initial presale price of $0.0003, marking an incredible return for early investors. The presale for DOGEN brought in $5.5 million, indicating strong initial demand. Unlike the random meme coins that surface daily, DOGEN has already amassed a community of over 30,000 followers on X, signaling sustained engagement. Anticipate DOGEN’s Next Surge – Jump In Before the Breakout! 🔥 CEX Listing: Will It Trigger FOMO? Meme coins thrive on buzz and ease of access, and a listing on a centralized exchange (CEX) might be just the catalyst DOGEN needs for its next big move. Historically, CEX listings have significantly boosted tokens, bringing in fresh liquidity and attracting new investors who missed the presale. The eezzy’s journal channel, with over 50K subscribers, has already highlighted DOGEN as a potential leader among Solana meme coins, with a chance to reach a $100M+ market cap. If that materializes, we're looking at a potential fivefold increase from current levels. Should You Dive In? DOGEN shows all the markers of a meme coin on the brink of another breakout. With strong fundamentals, limited supply, an active community, and an upcoming CEX listing, it presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. If you missed its initial 500% rise, there might still be time to catch the next wave. But once the FOMO from the CEX listing kicks in, opportunities could vanish quickly. Do your own research, but remember, you were given a heads-up. 💎🐶 Are you ready to go all-in on DOGEN? Dogwifhat (WIF): Introducing a Fresh Dog-Themed Meme Coin on the Solana Blockchain Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin themed around dogs, launched on the Solana blockchain and inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. Meme coins often thrive on strong community backing and viral potential, with dog-themed tokens being particularly beloved in the crypto space. WIF aims to create a lively and engaging community. Leveraging Solana's speed and low transaction costs, WIF could appeal to fans of meme coins and projects driven by communities in the current market climate. Its distinct theme and rising popularity may capture attention. As with any meme coin, its value hinges on community enthusiasm and adoption. BONK: Solana's Shiba Inu-Themed Community Memecoin BONK is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It seeks to empower the Solana community by shifting influence away from venture capital tokens. Following a Coinbase listing, BONK's value more than doubled, and as a ""community coin,"" it distributed 50% of its supply to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi sectors. By mid-December 2023, it had climbed to the third-largest meme coin by market cap and was among the top gainers with a year-to-date surge of over 10,000%. Its integration into Solana's expanding decentralized application ecosystem, including the launch of BonkSwap, establishes it as a significant player in cryptocurrency. BONK's potential rests on community involvement and its expanding use within Solana's network, making it an appealing option in the current market cycle. Floki: Evolving from Meme Coin to Multi-Purpose Cryptocurrency Floki began as a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk's 2021 tweet about naming his Shiba Inu ""Floki."" It has since transitioned to focus on utility and charitable endeavors. Floki is developing real-world applications through projects like the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and the DeFi service FlokiFi. Collaborations, such as with NOWPayments, enable the use of FLOKI tokens in transactions. Additionally, Floki contributes to educational projects, such as building schools in Laos and Nigeria. Its expanding ecosystem and ventures into NFTs and DeFi distinguish it from other meme coins. With ongoing developments, Floki's potential utility may attract those exploring emerging cryptocurrencies in the current market cycle. AI16Z: Merging AI and Blockchain for a New Venture Capital Approach AI16Z is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) launched in October 2024, blending artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to enhance venture capital investment strategies. The project is managed by an AI agent named ""Marc AIndreessen,"" aiming to minimize human biases and inefficiencies found in traditional models. The AI16Z token serves governance and utility purposes, enabling holders to engage in decision-making and facilitating platform transactions. With a market cap surpassing $2 billion, AI16Z demonstrates robust investor interest. Its alignment with industry trends toward AI automation suggests significant growth potential. In the current market cycle, this innovative approach might appeal to those interested in the convergence of AI and blockchain technology. Conclusion While WIF, BONK, FLOKI, and AI16Z may show less immediate potential, DOGEN attracts those seeking luxury and achievement. It's projected to grow 700% by the end of its presale, with the possibility of thousand-fold returns during this bull run, following in the footsteps of successful tokens like BONK and WIF. By building a community of leaders, it offers tangible benefits, including exclusive perks for early participants.

40345705,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129058,1739595926,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive $599M Bet: Hong Kong’s Avenir Group Plunges into BlackRock Bitcoin ETF,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/avenir-group-bitcoin-etf-investment/,"In a move that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market, Hong Kong-based family office, Avenir Group, has disclosed a staggering $599 million investment in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). This significant allocation, first reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, underscores the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin and marks a pivotal moment for Bitcoin ETFs in Asia. Is this a sign of things to come for institutional Bitcoin ETF adoption? What’s Driving Institutional Bitcoin Investment? The news of Avenir Group’s substantial investment raises a crucial question: what’s fueling this surge in institutional Bitcoin investment ? Several factors are at play, creating a perfect storm for institutional capital to flow into Bitcoin: Increased Regulatory Clarity: With regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies becoming clearer in regions like Hong Kong and the US, institutions feel more comfortable entering the space. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has legitimized Bitcoin as an asset class for many traditional investors. Growing Demand from Clients: Many institutional investors are responding to increasing client demand for Bitcoin exposure. High-net-worth individuals and even some pension funds are looking to diversify their portfolios with digital assets. Bitcoin’s Maturing Market: Bitcoin’s market infrastructure has matured significantly. Improved custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and sophisticated trading tools make it easier and safer for institutions to participate. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): As Bitcoin’s price appreciates and its narrative strengthens as a store of value and hedge against inflation, institutions risk being left behind if they don’t allocate. The ‘digital gold’ narrative is particularly compelling in the current economic climate. This confluence of factors makes a compelling case for institutions to consider Bitcoin as part of a diversified investment strategy. The Avenir Group’s move is likely just the tip of the iceberg. Hong Kong Bitcoin: A New Hub for Crypto Investment? Avenir Group being based in Hong Kong Bitcoin further highlights the region’s growing importance in the cryptocurrency landscape. Hong Kong is positioning itself as a crypto hub, actively developing regulations that are welcoming to digital assets while maintaining investor protection. This proactive approach is attracting significant attention from both local and international investors. Here’s why Hong Kong is becoming a crypto hotspot: Forward-Thinking Regulatory Environment: Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has established a licensing regime for virtual asset service providers and has been relatively open to crypto innovation. Strategic Location: As a gateway to mainland China and a major financial center in Asia, Hong Kong offers access to a vast pool of capital and talent. Strong Financial Infrastructure: Hong Kong boasts a well-established financial infrastructure, making it easier for institutions to engage with digital assets. Government Support: The Hong Kong government has expressed support for the development of the virtual asset industry, recognizing its potential economic benefits. With Avenir Group’s investment, Hong Kong’s role in the global Bitcoin and crypto market is further solidified. Expect to see more significant crypto-related developments emerging from this region. Avenir Group Bitcoin: Understanding the Family Office’s Strategy Who exactly is Avenir Group Bitcoin and why is their investment so noteworthy? Family offices are private wealth management firms that manage the investments and financial affairs of wealthy families. Their investment decisions often signal broader trends in the market due to their sophisticated understanding of finance and risk management. Key takeaways about Avenir Group’s investment: Aspect Details Investor Type Family Office Investment Amount $599 Million Investment Vehicle BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) Significance Large institutional allocation, signals growing confidence in Bitcoin ETFs Avenir Group’s substantial investment in a Bitcoin ETF, particularly from a family office, suggests a long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin. Family offices are known for their patient capital and strategic, long-term investment horizons. This allocation isn’t a short-term trade; it’s a strategic positioning in the evolving digital asset landscape. BlackRock ETF: IBIT’s Success Attracts Major Capital The chosen investment vehicle is also significant: BlackRock’s BlackRock ETF (IBIT). BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, entering the Bitcoin ETF space has been a game-changer. IBIT has rapidly become one of the most successful Bitcoin ETFs, attracting billions of dollars in assets under management (AUM).

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As crypto eyes a 2025 comeback, Ethereum, Cardano, and Rexas Finance race for top returns. Table of Contents Ethereum’s price outlook: Strong potential but not the highest return Cardano’s growth potential: Promising but limited upside Rexas Finance: The token poised for the highest returns Conclusion: The clear winner for maximum returns Investors seek the best chances for large returns as the crypto industry prepares for a significant comeback in 2025. Because of their established networks and continuous advancements, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) remain among the top candidates. But Rexas Finance (RXS) , a fast-expanding real-world asset (RWA) token, is becoming a major rival with an explosive price trajectory. Given the current market dynamics and price predictions, which of these three will deliver the highest returns by July 2025? You might also like: Rexas Finance at $0.175: Billionaire investor says it’s like buying Ripple early 2017 Ethereum’s price outlook: Strong potential but not the highest return Price swings in Ethereum have lately been notable. Currently trading at $3,254.49, it has plummeted 32% over the past three months and 4.39% in the last 24 hours. ETH has witnessed a meager 2.68% year-to-date. Resilient in price, Ethereum has broken through the bottom of a rising trend channel, implying a reduced growth pace or a period of sideways movement. Ethereum is now testing another vital resistance mark at $3,340, while it effectively broke opposition at $2,607. Analysts say a breach over this level would indicate a fresh, optimistic trend — still, the conflicting indications from trading volume point to near-term uncertainty. Despite Ethereum’s strong foundations and network dominance, the predicted price increase by July 2025 will likely not generate the best returns. While Ethereum might be a good investment, it is not the best option for maximum profitability over this period since price projections point to modest gains instead of an exponential explosion. Cardano’s growth potential: Promising but limited upside Cardano (ADA) had a wild week, losing 12.5% and recovering with a 10.4% gain. ADA is trading at $0.9838 right now, 12.8% above its recent local trough. Long-term investors are hopeful about the network’s developments, even if the short-term price action is still erratic. They are excited about the network’s governance and upgrades. Analysts expect Cardano’s next transaction speed improvements, privacy elements, and developer-friendly tools to help drive a consistent increase in 2025. This rising acceptance can drive ADA’s price to new highs. Notwithstanding these encouraging advances, the technical study indicates that ADA might only reach between $1.78 and $1.96 by July 2025. Although remarkable, a price rise of this kind is unlikely to compete with tokens experiencing hyper-growth. Although Cardano is still a good long-term investment, its possible returns in the next few months might not be commensurate with those of more explosive cryptocurrencies. Rexas Finance: The token poised for the highest returns By mid-2025, Rexas Finance is expected to rank highest among all the return contenders. Rexas Finance is changing asset management and investment as a groundbreaking real-world asset (RWA) project that lets users tokenize and exchange real-world assets effortlessly. The platform has attracted investors because of its creative approach and outstanding presale performance. Priced at $0.20, Rexas Finance is currently in its 12th and last presale stage and reflects a notable rise from its starting presale price. With approximately $44.94 million raised thus far from the presale, the project’s great demand and faith are shown. Investors expect a significant price explosion following the official launch price of $0.25 on June 19, 2025. The Certik audit of Rexas Finance, which strengthens credibility and confidence, is one of the main elements increasing investor interest. Investors have been comforted by this security check, therefore confirming RXS as a real and interesting project. Moreover, analysts project Rexas Finance would rise to $7 by the end of June and explode to $15 by July 2025. With such a gathering, the stratospheric return on investment would be significantly higher than the expected returns of Ethereum and Cardano within the same period. Conclusion: The clear winner for maximum returns Although Ethereum is still a good investment with a steady long-term view, its expected price increase by July 2025 is not significant enough to provide the best profits. Although Cardano’s price estimates show relatively modest increases, its future enhancements set it for steady development. However, Rexas Finance could be the leading high-return investment available. RXS is positioned for rapid ascent with its unique approach to real-world asset tokenization, successful presale, and optimistic price projections. Forecasts of a jump to $15 by July 2025 suggest that RXS will provide the kind of life-changing rewards that neither Ethereum nor Cardano can equal within the specified period.

If you’re an FTX creditor who unfortunately missed out on the initial February 18th repayment, don’t lose heart just yet. Sunil Kavuri, a prominent voice representing FTX’s largest creditor group, has brought forth crucial information via X (formerly Twitter) that could significantly impact your claim. Let’s delve into what this means for you and what steps you can take. Were You Left Out of the First FTX Repayment Wave? Understanding Why It’s disheartening to be excluded, especially when it comes to recovering funds tied up in the FTX collapse. Kavuri’s update clarifies the reasons behind the initial exclusions. According to FTX’s notifications, certain categories of creditors were not included in the first distribution. These primarily include: Claims Under Review: If your claim is still undergoing scrutiny, it wasn’t processed in the first batch. This is a standard procedure to ensure the legitimacy of all claims. Claims Exceeding $50,000: A threshold was set for the initial distribution. Creditors with claims above this amount might have been deferred to subsequent phases. Incomplete Compliance Requirements: This is a critical aspect. Failure to complete essential steps like Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, tax documentation, or distribution provider requirements automatically disqualified creditors from the February distribution. It’s important to note that these exclusions aren’t necessarily permanent roadblocks. Instead, they highlight areas that need attention to ensure your eligibility for future distributions. The Promising Horizon: Q2 2025 Distribution – A Second Chance for FTX Creditors Here’s the silver lining: the possibility of a second distribution wave is on the horizon! According to Kavuri’s update, FTX is targeting Q2 2025 for the next round of repayments. This offers a crucial window for excluded creditors to rectify any outstanding issues and position themselves for inclusion in this future distribution. This timeline provides a valuable opportunity to get your affairs in order and ensure you meet all necessary criteria. Navigating the Path to Q2 2025 FTX Repayment: What Actions Should You Take? The announcement of a potential Q2 2025 distribution isn’t just news; it’s a call to action. For FTX creditors who were initially excluded, here’s a step-by-step guide to increase your chances of participating in the next repayment phase: Identify Your Exclusion Reason: First and foremost, understand why you were not included in the February distribution. Review any communication from FTX or the distribution provider. Was it due to KYC, tax documents, claim review, or claim size? Complete KYC Verification: If KYC was the issue, prioritize completing this process. Ensure all your identity documents are submitted correctly and are up-to-date. KYC is non-negotiable for regulatory compliance and fund security. Submit Tax Documentation: Gather and submit all required tax forms accurately and promptly. Tax compliance is essential for the distribution process and varies based on jurisdiction. Clarify Claim Status (If Under Review): If your claim is under review, try to understand what additional information or clarification is needed. Respond promptly to any requests from FTX or the claims administrator. Engage with Distribution Provider: If you haven’t completed requirements with the designated distribution provider, reach out to them immediately. Understand their specific requirements and deadlines. Monitor Official Channels: Keep a close watch on official FTX channels, creditor communication platforms, and updates from representatives like Sunil Kavuri for any new announcements or instructions regarding the Q2 distribution. Why is KYC and Compliance So Crucial for FTX Repayment? You might be wondering why KYC and tax compliance are such significant hurdles in receiving your FTX repayment . It boils down to legal and regulatory necessities. Here’s a breakdown: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Regulations: KYC is a cornerstone of AML compliance globally. It ensures that funds are not being used for illicit activities. Tax Laws: Distributions of assets, especially in complex cases like FTX, have tax implications. Proper tax documentation ensures compliance with relevant tax authorities in various jurisdictions. Preventing Fraud and Errors: Rigorous verification processes help prevent fraudulent claims and ensure that repayments reach the rightful FTX creditors . Legal and Fiduciary Duty: Those administering the FTX estate have a legal and fiduciary duty to ensure a fair, transparent, and compliant distribution process. While these requirements might seem cumbersome, they are in place to protect the integrity of the process and ensure legitimate creditors receive their due funds in a legally sound manner. Sunil Kavuri’s Role: Championing FTX Creditor Interests The updates from Sunil Kavuri are invaluable for crypto claims holders in the FTX case. As a representative of a large creditor group, Kavuri acts as a vital communication bridge, disseminating information and advocating for creditor interests. His proactive engagement on social media platforms like X provides timely updates and insights that might not be readily available through official channels alone. Following figures like Kavuri is a proactive way for creditors to stay informed and understand the nuances of the ongoing FTX proceedings. Looking Ahead: Optimism and Action for FTX Creditors The path to recovering assets from FTX has been and continues to be a complex and lengthy process. However, the potential Q2 2025 distribution offers a renewed sense of optimism for those who missed the initial cut-off. The key takeaway is proactive engagement. Don’t wait passively. Take concrete steps to address any outstanding requirements related to your claim. By prioritizing KYC, tax compliance, and claim verification, FTX creditors can significantly improve their chances of participating in the anticipated Q2 distribution and finally seeing some resolution in this challenging situation.

The decision, announced in a letter to Elon’s legal team on Friday, came with a firm response: OpenAI is not for sale—and never was. The letter, signed by OpenAI’s attorney William Savitt, was sent to Marc Toberoff, Elon’s lawyer. It left no room for negotiation. “The proposal, even as first presented, is not in the best interest of OAI’s mission and is rejected,” Savitt wrote. He also made it clear that the board’s decision was unanimous. OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor doubled down. In a statement to the press, he said OpenAI had no interest in selling. “Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity,” Taylor said . Elon goes public, OpenAI fires back Elon didn’t take the rejection quietly. His legal team, led by Marc Toberoff, disclosed the takeover attempt on Monday, confirming that Elon and a group of investors had put in a formal offer to acquire OpenAI’s nonprofit entity. Toberoff argued that OpenAI had strayed too far from its original mission and needed to return to being an open-source, safety-driven AI research lab. “It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,” Toberoff wrote. Sam Altman wasn’t having it. OpenAI’s CEO wasted no time responding to Elon’s bid with a post on X (formerly Twitter). His counteroffer? “No thank you, but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Elon fired back. He called Altman a “swindler” and later followed up with another shot, calling him “Scam Altman.” A bitter rivalry rooted in OpenAI’s transformation The fight between Elon and Altman isn’t new. Elon co-founded OpenAI in 2015, alongside Altman and other tech leaders, with the goal of developing AI for the benefit of humanity. At the time, it was structured as a nonprofit. But things changed. By 2018, Elon had left OpenAI’s board, citing concerns that the company wasn’t progressing fast enough. In 2019, OpenAI moved to a “capped profit” model, allowing it to raise billions from investors, and the biggest backer is Microsoft, which has invested at least $10 billion. Now, OpenAI is far from the small research lab it started as. It’s a dominant force in AI, with its ChatGPT model setting the industry standard. And investors are lining up. SoftBank is reportedly finalizing a $40 billion investment, valuing OpenAI at $260 billion. In a court filing on Friday, Musk said he will withdraw his $97.4 billion offer if OpenAI’s board agrees to stop its transition into a for-profit entity. If OpenAI refuses, Elon argues that the nonprofit should be compensated based on what an independent buyer would pay for its assets. “If OpenAI, Inc.‘s Board is prepared to preserve the charity’s mission and stipulate to take the ‘for sale’ sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid,” the filing states. “Otherwise, the charity must be compensated by what an arms-length buyer will pay for its assets.” Elon’s attorney, Marc Toberoff, has also taken the fight beyond the courtroom. On January 7, Toberoff sent a letter to the attorneys general of California and Delaware, urging them to open up bidding for OpenAI’s nonprofit division. However, legal experts say OpenAI’s board is under no obligation to accept Elon’s offer. Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, noted that nonprofit boards don’t operate under the same rules as for-profit companies. “In a for-profit corporation, directors typically don’t face legal exposure for rejecting a takeover bid,” Fleming said. “In a nonprofit, where the goal isn’t to maximize shareholder value, there’s even less reason to think directors would face legal risk simply for saying no.” Speaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai via video link, he doubled down on his criticism, arguing that OpenAI is trying to erase its nonprofit roots entirely. “What they’re trying to do now is completely delete the nonprofit,” Musk told UAE’s AI Minister Omar al Olama. “That seems like really going too far.” Elon compared OpenAI’s shift to a bait-and-switch, saying he donated $50 million to help build an open-source, nonprofit AI organization—only for it to turn into a corporate-driven enterprise. “I provided all of the funding for OpenAI, almost $50 million for nothing, as a nonprofit, and it was meant to be open source,” Elon said. “This is like if you create a nonprofit to save the Amazon rainforest, and then it turns into a logging company that cuts down the trees and sells the wood.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",AI|OpenAI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-15 05:11:06

POL: Opening New Opportunities in the Polygon Ecosystem The Polygon Ecosystem Token, known as POL, serves as a utility token central to the Polygon network. It allows users to stake their tokens, contributing to the network's security and functioning. In return, stakers receive rewards and a say in the network's governance, enabling them to vote on proposals that guide Polygon's future, ensuring community interests are prioritized.

In today's market, where swift and secure trading is crucial, SEI shines. While other coins offer various features, SEI's trading focus makes it unique.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream – Is the Doge Still Barking? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun take on cryptocurrencies. It used the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there is no cap on how many can exist. Initially seen as a joke, Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021. It climbed into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with its total value surpassing $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin’s creators, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, meant it as a light-hearted project. But it quickly showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. As for its potential, Dogecoin relies on its strong online community. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but it doesn’t offer unique features like smart contracts. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as a risky but exciting asset. Other coins, like Ethereum, have more established uses and technologies. Market trends show that social media can greatly impact Dogecoin’s price. So, whether it’s attractive depends on one’s appetite for risk and belief in the community driving it. Conclusion As DOGE targets $0.40, XYZ emerges as the pioneering sports memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth and uniting fans in a community-driven, sustainable ecosystem.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Distinctive Memecoin on Ethereum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling it to integrate with Ethereum's ecosystem. Initially, a significant portion of its supply was sent to Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, who donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned part of it, reducing the total supply by 40%. This act helped elevate SHIB's profile. SHIB supports decentralized applications like ShibaSwap and has plans for a future NFT platform and governance system, showcasing its potential for broader uses in the crypto landscape. Conclusion While SHIB and others may show limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero. With a 700% ROI during its presale, starting at $0.0002, it combines governance, rewards, and staking features. Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers to advocate for financial freedom and dismantle toxic systems.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A new meme coin on Solana is gaining buzz, with analysts predicting huge returns from small investments. Table of Contents DOGEN skyrockets 500% post-DEX listing; can it triple with a CEX soon? Solana gears up for a breakout: 20% surge on the horizon as altcoin season nears Conclusion Could a small sum become a fortune overnight? A new meme coin on the Solana blockchain is grabbing headlines. Analysts are excited about its potential to deliver huge returns from a tiny investment. It’s stirring up conversations across the crypto world. This could be the breakthrough many have been waiting for. You might also like: Early investors show interest in Dogen as it aims to surpass DOGE DOGEN skyrockets 500% post-DEX listing; can it triple with a CEX soon? DOGEN , the meme token for those who refuse to settle, is proving its strength with both technical and fundamental momentum. Designed for winners, DOGEN embraces the alpha mentality, attracting a rapidly growing community of over 30,000 followers on X. Explosive price action and market momentum Since its Raydium DEX listing on February 4th, DOGEN surged to an all-time high of $0.0066 before consolidating around $0.002. Even at this level, it remains an impressive 566% above its lowest presale price of $0.0003. The project’s presale alone raised $5.5 million, showcasing massive early investor interest. Technical outlook: Is a major breakout coming? With a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $28 million, DOGEN shows upside potential toward $40 million, pointing to a short-term price target of $0.004+. Currently, DOGEN is testing key support within a descending channel. If the price breaks above $0.0032, this could reverse the downtrend, setting the stage for a bullish surge toward $0.0056 — a level that aligns with previous resistance zones. Adding to the bullish case, an upcoming major CEX listing is expected to drive fresh liquidity and wider adoption. With only 1 billion tokens circulating (10% of total supply), DOGEN’s price remains highly responsive to demand, fueling potential volatility in favor of the bulls. DOGEN buzz: Is a $100m+ market cap on the horizon? DOGEN’s post-listing rally and presale success have sparked major community discussions. The eezzy’s journal channel (50K+ subscribers) has highlighted DOGEN as a top contender in the Solana meme coin space, with projections pointing to a $100m+ market cap. With increasing speculation ahead of the CEX launch, DOGEN stands a strong chance of retesting its $0.005 ATH — or pushing beyond it. If momentum builds, it could enter a parabolic breakout phase, pushing well past its current valuation ceiling. Solana gears up for a breakout: 20% surge on the horizon as altcoin season nears Solana ’s price is currently ranging between $177.92 and $221.63, with technical indicators pointing to a potential rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42.70 and Stochastic at 26.92 suggest the asset is oversold, signaling a possible upward move. Breaking past the key resistance level at $242.68 could trigger a 20% rally, while a push to the next resistance at $286.39 could see gains exceed 40%. With a 6-month price increase of 39.01%, Solana has demonstrated strong momentum. As altcoin season heats up and a broader crypto bull run gains traction, SOL appears poised for further upside. Conclusion Although SOL and other established coins show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out with its focus on luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of the presale, with potential for thousand-fold returns during this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, building a community of market-dominating leaders and offering real benefits to early adopters.

Within 5 hours, the project erased $4.4 billion from the market. In a since-deleted X post, Javier Milei mentioned that the project aims to “fund small Argentine businesses and startups.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter Traders were concerned about the project’s authenticity during the first hour of its launch. However, The Kobeissi Letter mentioned on X that multiple Argentinian politicians posted the news of the launch, hence confirming that the president’s account is not hacked or compromised. The project website, however, seemed off. It linked to a Google Form for funding applications, which is unusual for a project of such scale. The domain was apparently registered for one year only and created just hours before the project’s launch. $LIBRA TEAM IS CASHING OUT They already made $87M by removing USDC and SOL from liquidity pools https://t.co/hRGnRPTDiE pic.twitter.com/aiDmODKi6o — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) February 15, 2025 Minutes into the launch, large holders of the coin started liquidating $LIBRA worth millions of dollars, resulting in gains of over $4 million as the coin topped $4.6 billion in market cap. It then dipped down in a straight line after marking a top at 5:40 PM ET. The coin crashed within 3 hours of the launch. Bubblemaps data shows that within the first 3 hours, insiders cashed out $87.4 million of the project by removing the liquidity. In a more recent X post, Javier Milei stated that he was not aware of the project’s details. He deleted his earlier post about the coin to avoid spreading the word. Source: DexScreener At the time of this writing, $LIBRA sits at a market cap of $162.0 million after erasing $4.4 billion from the market. The effects of this scam coin were also seen in $TRUMP, which fell sharply and lost over $500 million in market cap.

Will You Be Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the cryptocurrency market surges with innovation and investment momentum, Bitcoin, Qubetics, and Chainlink are key assets shaping the space. With Qubetics Wallet revolutionizing crypto management, Bitcoin holding strong near $97K, and Chainlink maintaining crucial support levels, these three projects are making waves in 2025. Could they be the next crypto to explode? Let’s dive into their latest developments and price action. Qubetics Wallet: The Future of Crypto Management Is Here As digital assets continue their global adoption, crypto wallets play a pivotal role in bridging users to blockchain technology. Secure, efficient, and user-friendly wallets are in high demand, and Qubetics Wallet is emerging as a top-tier solution. Designed for iOS, Android, and desktop, Qubetics Wallet ensures seamless interaction with digital assets while maintaining the highest security standards. With its integration into the Qubetics Network, this wallet is set to redefine how users store and manage cryptocurrencies. Qubetics is proud to announce its integration with the 1inch Network. This leading DeFi aggregator connects users to hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for optimized trades, unmatched liquidity, and the best possible rates. Qubetics has announced a groundbreaking partnership with SWFT Blockchain, setting a new standard in blockchain technology by introducing a state-of-the-art wallet. This collaboration combines the expertise of Qubetics, a trailblazer in blockchain innovation, with SWFT Blockchain’s cutting-edge technology to create a wallet poised to revolutionize blockchain transactions. Qubetics Presale Rockets Past $12.6M—Stage 21 Sees Unprecedented Growth! The $TICS token presale has reached a crucial milestone, surging into Stage 21 at a price of $0.0733. With over 19,800 holders securing 471 million tokens, the presale has already raised a staggering $12.6 million. Investors are eyeing the projected price of $0.25 before the presale ends, signaling a potential 240.64% ROI. However, the real fireworks are expected post-mainnet launch, where analysts anticipate an explosive rally toward $10–$15 per $TICS token. As Qubetics continues gaining momentum, it is cementing itself as one of the top altcoins for massive return potential in 2025. Bitcoin Price Holds Steady Near $97K—Is a Breakout on the Horizon? Bitcoin remains the backbone of the cryptocurrency market, maintaining its dominance amid low volatility. Currently, BTC is trading at $96,870.78, reflecting a marginal 0.10% gain over the last 24 hours. Despite a 25.81% drop in trading volume, Bitcoin dominance stays firm at 59.9%, signaling strong investor confidence. Analysts are watching for signs of a breakout past $100K, which could ignite another wave of bullish momentum. Institutional interest and growing adoption continue to support Bitcoin as one of the best cryptos to buy now for long-term growth. Chainlink Holds Critical Support—Poised for a Major Upside? Chainlink (LINK) shows strong resilience, defending a crucial support range between $17.50 and $18.50. This level has been tested multiple times, with consistent buying pressure preventing a further drop. Renowned crypto analyst Ali pointed out that the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal, suggesting a potential reversal. If LINK holds above this range, analysts predict an imminent move toward $20.85, possibly reaching $21–$23 in the short term. As smart contracts dominate decentralized finance (DeFi), Chainlink’s oracle technology remains essential to blockchain infrastructure. Its current price action and market positioning make LINK one of the best cryptos to join for long-term growth. Which Is the Best Crypto Presale to Join in February 2025? For investors seeking high-growth potential, the best crypto presale to join in February 2025 is Qubetics $TICS, given its rapid fundraising success and bullish projections. However, Bitcoin and Chainlink remain strong contenders for short-term gains and long-term sustainability. Final Thoughts: The Next Big Crypto to Watch As we navigate 2025, Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Chainlink stand out in the crypto landscape. Qubetics Wallet is poised to transform user experiences in cryptocurrency management, Bitcoin remains the benchmark for stability and growth, and Chainlink’s resilient support levels suggest an imminent price breakout. With Qubetics’ $TICS presale gaining unstoppable momentum, Bitcoin’s steady dominance, and Chainlink’s strong technical indicators, these three assets present exciting opportunities for crypto enthusiasts. Whether you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in February 2025, top altcoins for massive return potential, or the next big crypto, these projects should be on your radar.

Among them, the popular ones are XPR and Litecoin, which have a huge possibility of approval later this year. As a result, the LTC price has been surging monstrously in the past few days, attracting significant volume onto the platform. With the growing momentum and the raised optimism among the market participants, the upcoming breakout may clear the path towards $200 by reaching a very important resistance. After Trump’s inauguration, the crypto space has become more hopeful with clear regulations. Moreover, after the SEC changed its perception of the cryptos, an acknowledgement is also considered a major bullish signal for the crypto. Recently, the LTC ETF filings received the SEC’s acknowledgement and with the proposals holding over a 90% chance of approval, the traders have been extremely bullish over the LTC price rally, which has reached a pivotal zone. The LTC price has surged above an important resistance at $126, which has cleared the path for a bullish continuation towards the higher targets. However, a major breakout is yet to occur that could squash the probability of a rejection. As seen in the above chart, the LTC price is constantly testing the resistance of the decisive symmetrical triangle, which has intensified since the start of the month. Therefore, a breakout appears to be imminent anytime in the next few days, while the probability of a sustained upswing currently remains uncertain. Although the volume has been above the average range, the technicals suggest less confidence among the market participants. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the money flow in and out of the asset, has been stuck around the average range of ‘0’ since the start of 2025. This suggests there is no huge inflow of money into the platform, hinting towards less confidence among the traders. Besides, the ADX has reached close to the lower threshold, suggesting a massive drop in the rally’s strength while the DMI levels show signs of a potential bearish crossover. Hence, a breakout above the triangle may only occur with a massive rise in the buying volume; else, the Litecoin (LTC) price may remain consolidated within the pattern until the market dynamics do not shift in favour of the bulls.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,LTC|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-15 05:47:30

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Kaspa struggles with volatility, while TRON shows steady growth but faces limited upside potential. Table of Contents XYZVerse sets a new trend; could this be the next 50x meme coin? Bullish mood on XYZ Conclusion Kaspa (KAS) and TRON (TRX) have been strong players in the crypto market, but their recent performance raises questions about their ability to sustain long-term growth. Kaspa, once seen as a promising high-speed Layer-1 blockchain, has struggled with persistent volatility and a declining trend. Over the past six months, its value has dropped by nearly 42%, failing to maintain strong bullish momentum. Despite short-term rebounds, the coin faces stiff resistance at $0.14, and any failure to break past this level could lead to further downside, with key support at $0.05 and a worst-case scenario dip toward $0.00894. Kaspa’s technical indicators remain mixed, showing signs of price consolidation rather than clear growth, making it a questionable bet for investors seeking explosive returns. On the other hand, TRON has shown steady upward momentum, gaining 79% in the past six months. Unlike Kaspa, TRX has built a more stable market position, with both the 10-day and 100-day moving averages aligning at $0.24 — indicating a relatively strong trend. However, despite this growth, TRX still faces resistance at $0.26, and its upside potential remains somewhat limited. Even if it breaks through this level, the next target sits at $0.30, which represents only a 20% increase — modest compared to the explosive gains often seen in high-momentum meme coins. Additionally, a decline below $0.18 could push TRX into a bearish zone, making it vulnerable to sharper corrections. With both KAS and TRX showing growth limitations and resistance-heavy price action, investors looking for high-reward opportunities may need to turn elsewhere. You might also like: BTC, XRP surge while experts eye XYZVerse for huge gains XYZVerse sets a new trend; could this be the next 50x meme coin? Meme coins have consistently defied market expectations, delivering some of the biggest gains in crypto history. Unlike traditional cryptos that rely on slow, fundamental-driven adoption, meme coins thrive on community hype and viral momentum — factors that have driven projects like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE to astronomical highs. XYZ is positioning itself as the next big sensation, with the potential to outperform not only KAS and TRX but also many established altcoins. The excitement surrounding XYZVerse is substantial. As the first all-sports meme token, it is attracting both sports fans and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, creating a distinctive crossover that is gaining significant traction. Due to a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already anticipating major potential gains. More than just a meme coin XYZVerse distinguishes itself from the majority of meme coins, which frequently lack substance and rely on trends, by establishing a new trend that combines the dynamic world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. This strategy has proven successful, as evidenced by the rapid pace of the presale, with early buyers acquiring tokens at a price significantly lower than what some anticipate will be their future value. The XYZVerse presale is currently underway, and demand is high. The price has already risen from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already achieved. Early investors have secured a substantial discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, these figures have captured significant attention. Bullish mood on XYZ XYZVerse has already been featured on CoinMarketCap, where the community has expressed a strongly bullish sentiment on this coin, with 95% of voters anticipating that the value of XYZ will increase. XYZ has garnered further attention from reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, referring to XYZVerse as a “moonshot opportunity.” While nothing is guaranteed in the crypto realm, the excitement surrounding XYZVerse is undeniable. Beyond the current hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A 15% share is allocated to liquidity to establish a solid market foundation. To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Additionally, a significant portion of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for XYZ over time. A community-driven project with big plans A distinguishing characteristic of XYZVerse is its community engagement strategies. The team’s recent Ambassador Airdrop Program allows users to earn tokens by supporting the project. Furthermore, discussions with prominent sports figures are underway to increase project awareness. By connecting traditional sports enthusiasts with the dynamic cryptocurrency realm, XYZVerse is developing a unique project that combines entertainment with authentic engagement. Could XYZVerse be the next big meme coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. Conclusion While KAS and TRX have their strengths, XYZVerse’s unique blend of meme culture and sports positions it as a potential standout in the 2025 crypto market.

Polymarket users are pricing in a 22% chance that DOGE ETF approval sparking new all time highs in Q1 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Extends February Rally as SEC Acknowledges Grayscale ETF Filings Dogecoin (DOGE) action has been on an uptrend in recent months amid shifting political dynamics in the US. Notably, Elon Musk’s deepening ties with Donald Trump’s administration and the newly-established D.O.G.E. department have reignited investor interest in the memecoin. The bullish momentum strengthened on Friday after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally acknowledged Grayscale’s spot ETF filings for XRP and Dogecoin. Dogecoin Price Action | DOGEUSDT While the acknowledgment does not indicate immediate approval, it marks a departure from the SEC’s historically rigid stance on altcoin ETFs. Under previous leadership, such applications were routinely dismissed or withdrawn under regulatory pressure. The agency’s willingness to engage in discussions about DOGE and XRP ETFs suggests a shifting regulatory landscape that could pave the way for broader altcoin adoption. “This is a good sign for altcoins. In the past, these assets were told to withdraw immediately after filing. The fact that they remain on the table slightly increases our already optimistic odds of approval.” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas via X.com, Feb 15, 2025. As widely expected, DOGE price reacted positively to the news, rising 3% to break above the $0.29 level for the first time in 10-day dating back to Feb 4 . DOGE’s 3% price gains has been relatively muted, compared to XRP which rose 7% on a similar news catalyst. However, other market indicators suggest Dogecoin traders are anticipating further gains. Polymarket Traders Anticipate ETF Approval Could Trigger DOGE All-Time High by June 2025 Following the SEC’s acknowledgment of Grayscale’s DOGE ETF application, Dogecoin’s price jumped 3%, fueling speculation that an ETF approval could drive new record highs. While DOGE currently trades at $0.28, prediction market data suggests that traders expect much higher price levels in 2025. On Polymarket , a crypto-based prediction platform, traders are now assigning a 22% probability that Dogecoin will reach a new all-time high (above $0.73) by June 30, 2025. This probability is up significantly from earlier in the year, reflecting growing optimism around ETF approvals and increasing institutional interest in memecoins. Dogecoin All Time High Prediction Markets, Feb 15, 2025 | Source: Polymarkets The trading activity mirrors trends seen in Bitcoin markets before its spot ETF approval. In late 2023, BTC was priced around $30,000, and many traders bet on a six-figure breakout post-ETF approval. The subsequent rally to $50,000 in early 2024 validated these predictions. If Dogecoin follows a similar trajectory, ETF-driven speculation could propel DOGE toward $0.50 and beyond before mid-2025. As of now, DOGE remains in a consolidation phase, with key resistance levels at $0.30 and $0.35. A breakout above these levels, combined with further regulatory clarity, could set the stage for an all-time high retest later this year Dogecoin Price Forecast: Close Above $0.32 Could Spark Further Gains Dogecoin price forecast charts show that the memecoin has gained 15.88% in the past week, rising from $0.24 to a high of $0.2832, with bullish momentum building above the lower Bollinger Band at $0.2183. The price action has reclaimed the Hull Moving Average (HMA) at $0.2745, signaling a potential trend shift. If DOGE sustains its position above this level, buyers could push for a test of the mid-Bollinger Band at $0.2799, aligning with the upper boundary of the descending channel. Dogecoin Price Forecast A decisive breakout above the midline resistance could drive DOGE toward $0.32, which marks a key psychological and technical level. Beyond this threshold, the upper Bollinger Band at $0.3416 would become the next target. If DOGE closes above $0.32, bullish continuation toward $0.35 and beyond becomes likely. The cumulative volume delta (CVD) has turned positive, confirming growing buy-side pressure, further supporting an upside bias. Conversely, failure to hold above the HMA may see DOGE retrace toward $0.27, potentially retesting the lower Bollinger Band at $0.2183. A drop below $0.21 would invalidate the bullish structure, exposing DOGE to a deeper correction.

According to the analyst, the market is at a crucial stage, focusing on closing above $2.75 to confirm bullish momentum. If this level is breached, the next target will be $2.94, a local high that could further strengthen the uptrend. According to the analysis, anything below $3.40 is considered “noise,” reinforcing the importance of surpassing these resistance levels. #XRP – Quick Update: 4-Hour Time Frame Analysis Let's dive into the latest on #XRP !

If we can achieve this, we'll be… pic.twitter.com/e2yceX6V8B — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 14, 2025 Resistance and Support Levels The most immediate resistance is $2.75, which must be cleared for XRP to continue its upward trajectory. A strong close above this level would indicate bullish strength, increasing the likelihood of reaching the next target at $2.94. XRP is currently trading at $2.69, after a remarkable 24-hour increase of 10.79%. The asset briefly surpassed the $2.75 level, hitting a 7-hour peak of $2.78 before a slight decline. Notably, a recent bid skew on Coinbase hinted at XRP reaching the $2.94 target, and this is the closest the asset has come since that event If the asset can rebuild that momentum and close above $2.75, it would confirm this breakout. Beyond this level, $3.22 and $3.40 are major resistance points, with $3.40 as the highest immediate resistance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Breaking past it could open the door for a more substantial rally. The digital asset recently hit a multi-year peak of $3.39 and could stage another push toward that level if it maintains the bullish momentum. On the downside, the market has several key support levels that could act as safety nets in a pullback. Price levels around $2.21 and $2.00 offer near-term support, while lower levels at $1.80, $1.74, and $1.60 provide a more significant foundation. A drop below these levels would indicate a deeper correction, but the bullish structure will remain intact if XRP remains above them. How High Can XRP Climb In This Cycle? While EGRAG CRYPTO did not provide specifics about XRP’s trajectory after breaching $3.40, other analysts have projected price targets in the double and triple-digit ranges for the asset in the current cycle. Dark Defender, another well-respected crypto analyst, recently predicted that the digital asset could climb as high as $18.22 . While this target seems lofty, others have set even higher targets, with one pundit recently predicting that a $100 XRP price will happen 100%.

Now listed on Binance with a $9.28 billion market cap, it continues to dominate, boasting a daily trading volume of $472 million. Following in SHIB’s footsteps, PEPE surged 17,889%, with a $4.1 billion market cap and $943 million daily trading volume. It’s yet another example of how meme coins can defy expectations and print millionaires overnight. But here’s the reality: once meme coins reach their peak, they rarely repeat their explosive runs. SHIB and PEPE made history, turning early buyers into millionaires, but their golden days are long gone. With massive market caps and slower growth, the biggest gains have already been made. The real opportunity now lies in finding the next breakout meme coin before it skyrockets. History has shown that new contenders emerge, delivering life-changing profits to those who spot them early. Catzilla may well be the next coin to explode, and here is why. You might also like: New Solana gem Catzilla could score bigger than AI16Z and PENGU What is Catzilla? Catzilla (CATZILLA) is a meme coin with a giant orange cat as its mascot. It represents a fusion of meme culture, GameFi, and anime-inspired chaos. Built on Solana, Catzilla takes inspiration from the legendary Kaiju monsters and internet-famous cats, creating a meme coin with attitude. Unlike traditional dog-themed meme coins that have dominated the market, Catzilla introduces a fresh narrative — a giant, unstoppable feline ready to claw its way to the top. Here is why Catzilla is the next big meme coin to watch Unlike coins that launch overnight, Catzilla’s structured 14-stage presale ensures gradual and steady demand, allowing investors to enter early before price surges. Best-Deal Price: CATZILLA tokens are offered with a huge discount from its anticipated listing price, giving early investors prime entry before its public launch. Strong Community Backing: Meme coins thrive on hype, and Catzilla has already raised over $2,000,000, with thousands of supporters rallying behind its kaiju-cat narrative. Growth Potential: Currently priced at $0.0009, it is already 350% more expensive compared to its initial launch price of $0.0002. By Stage 14, the price will hit $0.0016. Catzilla already has a massive group of supporters on CoinMarketCap who are totally bullish on this coin. Catzilla is beyond mere speculation Catzilla is not just a thin hype; it is a strong ecosystem including: A GameFi-Integrated Approach: Players will be able to engage in action-packed gameplay where they can earn and utilize CATZILLA tokens. Staking & Rewards: Catzilla offers staking incentives, giving holders passive income opportunities while fueling long-term growth. A Growing Community: With millions already raised in presale and a rapidly expanding base of supporters, Catzilla is positioning itself as the next big meme coin contender. While SHIB and PEPE have already made their legendary runs, Catzilla is shaping up as the next major contender. If history is any indicator, the next wave of meme coin millionaires will come from those who recognize the next big trend before it takes off — and all signs point to Catzilla leading the charge. Don’t wait until Catzilla is all over the headlines. The best time to join is before the FOMO kicks in. To learn more about Catzilla, visit the website , X , Telegram chat .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP may drop to $1.80 while Panshibi prepares for a 100x take-off, attracting savvy investors. Table of Contents XRP price prediction: Is a Ripple dip on the horizon? Panshibi could experience the biggest meme take-off in 2025 Conclusion Crypto price analysts have predicted that XRP holders may take a loss in March. According to predictions, XRP price analysis indicates a potential decline to $1.80. Amid the uncertainty about the XRP price, Panshibi (SHIBI ) looks poised for a 100x take-off and savvy investors are acting on this prediction already. Most investors, including XRP holders, are buying into the limited Panshibi presale as the FOMO gets stronger. We discuss more on this below. You might also like: DOGE $0.50 predicted for March; Panshibi gains attention as a strong contender XRP price prediction: Is a Ripple dip on the horizon? The current price prediction for XRP suggests that it could dip in the coming months. However, its outlook presents strong bullish prospects. The crypto asset is gradually retracting its monthly loss after breaching the resistance at $2.50. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.73, having gained over 15% in the past week. Interest​​ in XRP has soared again since the pause in its legal proceedings with the SEC. XRP’s potential ETF approval has also sparked interest among individual and institutional investors, contributing to its current bullish momentum. Through strategic partnerships, XRP has expanded its adoption to countries like Portugal, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia. XRP appears to be developing strong bullish sentiment at the moment, making the $1.80 prediction wide off-market. However, the volatile nature of the market makes everything a possibility. Hence, hedging against potential loss with the promising Panshibi seems smart, and it may be profitable in the long run. XRP price is en route to the $3 price zone again. Reclaiming this level could trigger an impressive XRP bull run, which could see it hit $4. However, if XRP’s key support fails, it may fall back to $2.30. Top experts say it will take a major dip for XRP to drop below $2. Panshibi could experience the biggest meme take-off in 2025 Panshibi could make good profits for investors in 2025. The new meme coin has shown a high propensity to boom and with strong support from its community, it could compete with other meme coins for the top meme spot. Panshibi will launch as a unique meme coin that combines elements of three different communities. The Panda-themed coin is built around Asian lore and has fun elements that will appeal to meme lovers. This dynamism will help Panshibi attract people to its community. The Panshibi community will run on a Social-Fi mechanism with the aid of AI. This mechanism rewards users for their interaction and activeness in an ecosystem. Panshibi will spice things up by adding quests to its ecosystem and juicier rewards for winners and participants. The Panshibi token, SHIBI, will be used to reward users. Beyond that, SHIBI holders can stake their tokens to get high staking rewards. The meme coin token will also allow holders to gain access to exclusive opportunities and rewards. Putting community first is one of the things Panshibi got right; ensuring transparency is the other. The meme project has been well-audited by Coinsult to ensure safety. It will give token ownership back to the community after presale and also implement a 10-year liquidity lock. These features have raised investors’ level of trust in Panshibi. Panshibi has 720 million tokens on presale, and it has 60 days to sell them all. SHIBI sold a significant amount within its first 22 days, raising almost a million dollars. The meme coin is on the verge of completing its third stage now and will start the next stage at a higher price. The smart decision is to join the Panshibi presale now that its price is still lower and there are still enough tokens. Conclusion While some analysts predict an imminent XRP fall, the altcoin is still waxing stronger. However, investors can protect themselves against this uncertainty by joining the Panshibi presale. The new meme coin is tipped to do 100x, and early investors are likely to gain more from the yield. To learn more about Panshibi, visit its website , Telegram, and Twitter .

FXGuys ($FXG) is gaining attention as investors from Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Chainlink (LINK) shift their focus to this high-potential altcoin. With its Trade2Earn model, trader funding, and unmatched staking rewards, FXGuys is redefining the market to become one of the top DeFi platforms. As the market evolves, this new DeFi coin could be the most rewarding investment you can make this year! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys: The Future of Crypto Trading! Are you seeking ways of reaping 100x profits from your investment this year? FXGuys has got you covered. This revolutionary project integrates decentralized finance with proprietary trading, which empowers you with tools that boost returns and minimize risks. FX Guys has a Trader Funding Program that offers retail traders a chance to access between $200,000 and $500,000 in crypto trading capital after completing an evaluation process. With an 80/20 profit-sharing model favoring the trader, the FX Guys platform creates a new standard in the online trading space. Another significant feature is the FXGuys Trade2Earn program, which rewards you with $FXG tokens for all the trades you execute. The strategy incentivizes trading activity, powering volume and engagement on the platform. By incorporating DeFi principles with advanced trading mechanics, FXGuys places $FXG among the top DeFi coins in the market. The speedy entry of investors into FXGuys highlights confidence in the project’s potential for considerable growth. This project’s 100x token price growth potential makes it a viable investment option in the 2025 bull cycle. A significant factor that fuels increased adoption is the staking feature, which allows $FXG investors to secure a 20% APY. This model incentivizes holding tokens and creates a continuous stream of passive income, making it an attractive option for retail and institutional investors. With the FXGuys BETA platform available for free trials on its prop homepage, market experts say it will accelerate the adoption rate for the $FXG token. Ondo Finance Expands Tokenized Assets, but Investors Eye FXGuys for Bigger Profits Ondo Finance has partnered with World Liberty Financial to boost tokenized real-world asset adoption. This collaboration integrates Ondo’s tokenized assets into WLFI’s ecosystem, enhancing treasury reserves and enabling lending and margin trading with OUSG and USDY tokens. Earlier, Ondo Finance launched Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a real-world asset tokenization platform. The new platform enables on-chain access to stocks, bonds, and ETFs. Announced on February 4, 2025, Ondo GM will address market fragmentation, reduce fees, and improve accessibility. Meanwhile, ONDO was valued at $1.32 on February 13, down 3% in the past week. Looking at the price dip despite these developments, investors have turned to $FXG due to its huge profit prospects. FXGuys outshines ONDO by offering Trade2Earn rewards, staking rewards, and trader funding, while ONDO relies on tokenized assets without direct profit incentives. Chainlink Faces Selling Pressure as Investors Shift to FXGuys for Trading Rewards Chainlink’s token has recorded huge losses recently, dropping from its January 2025 highs. Whales keep selling, adding selling pressure in the LINK market. Whales influence market movements, with their activity rising 30.26%. RSI at 35.16 nears oversold territory, indicating a possible reversal. If demand intensifies, LINK could recover; otherwise, further losses may follow in the coming days. LINK traded at $18.36 on February 13, 2025, down 5% in the past week. However, a notable demand zone between $14.27 and $16.65 could cause a rebound if buyers join the market. On the other hand, resistance at $23.78 holds 110.43 million LINK sell orders, needing massive demand to break through. FXGuys surpasses Chainlink by offering Trade2Earn rewards, exciting staking benefits, and up to $500,000 in funding, while LINK struggles with whale sell pressure and speculative rebounds. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Experts Say $FXG is One of the Top DeFi Coins to Buy in 2025! Experts believe that $FXG is one of the top DeFi coins to buy in 2025, offering real utility, passive income, and unrivaled trading benefits. As ONDO and LINK investors accumulate $FXG, the altcoin’s potential for 100x gains becomes notable. With staking rewards, Trade2Earn incentives, and trader funding, FXGuys will dominate the market in 2025. Currently available in Stage 3 of its public presale, $FXG is valued at $0.05 and will gain 20% when it transitions to Stage 4 at $0.06. Furthermore, Stage 3 buyers will receive a 100% return on their investment once $FXG hits mainstream markets at $0.10. The FX Guys presale has raised over $4 million so far as investors buy aggressively due to its profit prospects. Experts believe that the token price will rise by 10,000% a few months after its launch on multiple exchanges.

Over the past week, the asset has just ranged below this six-digit mark with its price now hovering above $96,000 as of today. This sideways movement reflects a lack of significant momentum and has left many traders questioning what might spark the next major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle: Analyst Says The Upside Isn’t Over Yet Late Longs Liquidated: The Impact Despite the lack of a breakthrough, Bitcoin’s price behavior continues to attract the attention of market analysts. One such expert is Amr Taha, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform. Taha’s recent analysis in a post titled: “Late Buyer’s Liquidation Events Happened 3 Times Under 98K,” sheds light on a notable pattern of liquidations among long positions. His insights offer a deeper understanding of how market dynamics can shift following these liquidation events. Taha describes “late longs” as traders who enter the market after a substantial price increase, often motivated by fear of missing out (FOMO). These positions tend to be highly leveraged, making them more vulnerable to even minor price corrections. According to Taha, late longs often emerge near local price peaks, and their presence can destabilize the market. The analyst points out that when these positions are liquidated, it serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it reduces the market’s open interest, helping to flush out excess leverage and restore a more balanced trading environment. Secondly, these liquidation events can present opportunities for experienced traders. By stepping in after forced selling, savvy market participants can potentially secure better entry points and position themselves for the next upward price movement. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin has seen quite a bullish performance in the past day increasing by 1.3% in price to currently trade at $96,725, at the time of writing. However, on a broader scale, the asset still appears to be somewhat bearish with its weekly and monthly price performance in red. Interestingly, despite the uptick in BTC’s price today, its daily trading volume as of today remains lower than that of last week. Last Friday, BTC’s daily trading volume stood above $50 billion however, as of today this metric has dropped to $24.7 billion.

LeBron has now earned a total of $17.66 million across multiple tokens, with his most recent earnings of $4.56 million from trading LIBRA. However, some users have started to question whether these consistent wins are just sharp trading skills or insider trading. LeBron’s Timeline Of Making $17.6 Million LeBron has built a strong reputation for spotting profitable meme coin opportunities. He first made $8.9 million from trading MELANIA, and $3.2 million from TRUMP, when it was officially launched the day before President Trump’s Swearing ceremony. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1890609875031388189 A week ago, LeBron invested 25 SOL ($4,807) to buy 128.8 million HARRYBOLZ tokens. Later HARRYBOLZ meme token saw a massive surge after Elon Musk changed his profile name to Harry Bol. This move triggered a sharp price jump, pushing the token’s value to $0.025. As the price spiked, he strategically sold 109.8 million tokens for 3,649 SOL ($737K). Even after taking profits, he still holds 18.97 million HARRYBOLZ, worth approximately $277K. And this legendary trader didn’t stop here LeBron’s latest big win came from trading LIBRA token, adding $4.56 million to his profits. His ability to spot meme coin trends early and make quick moves has helped him stay ahead in the market. A Strategy Move or Insider Trading? LeBron’s ability to capitalize on viral market movements highlights the power of on-chain analysis and smart trading strategies. However, some X users are casting doubt on whether his success is purely skill-based. His repeated early moves on tokens that later surge have led some to speculate whether he has insider knowledge or connections within certain projects.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|SOL|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-15 06:35:33

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-and-whales-moved-490-million-xrp-in-24-hours-heres-what-happened/,"Many whopping XRP transactions have been recorded in the past day, with whale wallets moving hundreds of millions of tokens. The blockchain tracking service Whale Alert reported multiple high-value transfers, beginning with a 300 million XRP transaction from Ripple , the major distributor of XRP, to an unknown wallet. Following this, additional large movements took place, including tens of millions of XRP sent from Coincheck to another unidentified destination. These transactions have drawn attention from investors and analysts, as they come at a time when XRP whales have been accumulating tokens following the asset’s price dip in early February. The recent increase in wallets holding over one million XRP and these whale transactions following less than a week after suggests that large investors may be preparing for something significant. Understanding the Whale Transactions The first major transaction reported was the 300 million XRP movement, valued at approximately $778.7 million, from Ripple to an unknown wallet. This was followed by a 90 million XRP transfer worth around $229.6 million. Another significant transaction saw 40.8 million XRP, equivalent to $104.6 million, moved from the exchange Coincheck to an unknown wallet. The latest recorded transaction involved 60 million XRP, valued at $163.6 million, moving between unknown wallets. A total of 490.8 million XRP tokens were moved in under 24 hours, and the nature of these transactions raises several questions. Movements from exchanges, such as the Coincheck transaction, often suggest large investors are withdrawing funds for long-term holding. Similarly, the transfer from Ripple itself could indicate an internal reallocation, an upcoming strategic move, or a large institutional transaction. Transfers between unidentified wallets may point to private sales or whale accumulation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Market Impact XRP has experienced notable whale activity following its recent price decline. Whale activity picked up in January and has continued into February. Historically, large holders accumulating an asset often signals an expectation of future price appreciation, and these transactions could indicate preparation for a significant shift in the asset’s valuation. Another possibility is that these transfers relate to upcoming partnerships, institutional adoption, or regulatory developments. Ripple, a key player in the XRP ecosystem, has been actively forming partnerships that could impact the asset’s future. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also acknowledged Grayscale’s XRP ETF filing . While the ETF has not been approved, the acknowledgment is a positive sign, and whales may be accumulating tokens in anticipation of the ETF approval. Whatever the whales anticipate could have long-term implications for the token’s trajectory, and many retail investors will likely follow their lead.

The token is set to be listed on exchanges at 2 PM UTC on Monday, February 17th. While it shows early promise, experts warn that its full growth potential may be limited unless it secures a listing on prominent platforms like Binance. Pepeto Aims for 100x Returns Pepeto ($PEPETO), however, is positioning itself for potential 100x returns, thanks to its resemblance to the popular Pepe token and speculation about a former Pepe team member’s involvement. With its utility-driven platform and growing community, analysts believe Pepeto is a strong candidate for listings on major exchanges like Binance. Pepeto’s Presale Exceeds $4 Million Pepeto’s presale is still ongoing at $0.000000110 per token and has already raised over $4 million. The project is gaining significant traction on social media: Instagram: 31.3K followers X (Twitter): 18.1K followers Telegram: 30.8K members What Makes Pepeto Stand Out to Analysts Staking Rewards: Pepeto offers a compelling 387% APY to encourage long-term investment.

PepetoBridge: Cross-chain technology for seamless asset transfers. DAO Governance: Empowering the community to participate in key decisions. Could Pepeto Outshine Wall Street Pepe on Binance? While Wall Street Pepe is preparing for listings on exchanges such as BingX, Gate.io, and MEXC, Pepeto’s impressive presale results and its utility-driven platform have sparked speculation about a potential Binance listing. The rumors of involvement from a former Pepe team member have only added to the excitement, positioning Pepeto as a leading candidate for 100x growth in the upcoming bull market.

This performance has led analysts to adjust their price targets for both companies. Coinbase reported a revenue of $2.3 billion for Q4 2024, an 88% increase from the previous quarter, with a net income of $1.3 billion. Retail trading volumes reached $94 billion, while institutional volumes hit a three-year high of $345 billion. This growth is attributed to a post-election boost in market optimism, as President Donald Trump has pledged to establish the U.S. as “the world’s crypto capital” and has appointed industry-friendly leaders to key regulatory positions. Over the past year, Coinbase’s stock has risen approximately 112%. Analysts from JPMorgan have raised their price target for Coinbase’s stock (COIN) to $344, up from $264. They noted, “The fourth quarter, and we would argue 2024 overall, was a pivotal and consequential period for the crypto ecosystem—market caps exploded, volumes jumped, new participants entered the market, and regulatory confidence completely flipped.” Robinhood, primarily known for stock trading, has seen substantial growth in its cryptocurrency segment. In Q4, the company reported crypto transaction revenue of $358 million, accounting for approximately 35% of its total revenue—the highest contribution to date. This represents a 700% increase in crypto revenue year-over-year. Robinhood’s stock has surged about 365% in the past 12 months. JPMorgan analysts have increased their price target for Robinhood’s shares (HOOD) to $45 from $39, highlighting the growing importance of crypto trading in the company’s business model. They stated, “Typically, we see crypto revenue contribute 10-20% of revenue any given quarter.” The surge in cryptocurrency trading volumes has been largely driven by renewed market optimism following the U.S. election. President Trump’s administration has expressed strong support for the cryptocurrency industry, with promises to position the U.S. as a global leader in the crypto space. This favorable regulatory environment has encouraged increased participation from both retail and institutional investors, contributing to the impressive financial performances of both Coinbase and Robinhood. The combination of favorable political developments and a bullish cryptocurrency market has propelled Coinbase and Robinhood to exceed financial expectations in Q4 2024. Analysts remain optimistic about the future growth prospects of both companies, as they continue to capitalize on the expanding crypto ecosystem.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-15 06:37:57

Critics are already calling this emerging project the “next XRP,” thanks to its focus on cross-border transactions and real-world adoption. But is RTX truly poised to make the same global impact or is this just another passing trend? In this guide, you’ll discover what makes Remittix (RTX) special, why it’s grabbing headlines and perhaps most importantly how to buy it safely if you decide it fits your investment strategy. What Makes Remittix (RTX) the Next XRP? Remittix has been garnering attention for its laser focus on bridging cryptocurrencies with traditional finance. Much like XRP aimed to revolutionize cross-border bank transfers, RTX goes a step further by converting digital assets into FIAT and depositing the proceeds directly into global bank accounts. Early figures are compelling: the presale has already attracted over 30,000 token holders, showing that interest in Remittix (RTX) is more than just hype. Transaction efficiency is another reason analysts compare RTX to XRP. While XRP can handle around 1,500 transactions per second, Remittix is designed to finalize transfers at comparable speeds without the hidden fees or complex user experiences often found in other blockchain projects. For instance, international freelancers and small businesses can save significant time and money using RTX to accept global payments, something that historically has been cumbersome and expensive with traditional banking methods. This immediate practicality is fueling the token’s rapid growth, making “how to buy RTX” a trending query for curious investors. Even though XRP tackled the banking sector effectively, RTX aims to be more accessible. If Remittix maintains its trajectory, some believe it could eventually rival or surpass XRP’s market impact. The key lies in the platform’s ability to unify crypto’s speed and convenience with the well-established infrastructure of global banking. As more people demand simple, low-cost and near-instant financial services, the utility behind Remittix continues to shine. How to Buy Remittix (RTX) in a Few Simple Steps For many newcomers, how to buy a novel token like RTX can seem daunting, but Remittix aims to streamline the process. The most direct route is through the ongoing presale, available at the official Remittix Presale . In just a few clicks, you can contribute funds using supported cryptocurrencies, after which you receive equivalent RTX tokens in your wallet. First, ensure you have a compatible wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet loaded with a cryptocurrency like USDT or ETH. Next, visit the presale page, connect your wallet and follow the on-screen instructions to purchase your preferred amount of RTX. Finally, confirm the transaction, and your Remittix (RTX) tokens will appear in your wallet once the presale round completes. The platform offers intuitive prompts, reducing the complexity typically associated with how to buy new altcoins. Because Remittix is still in a presale phase, many investors see an opportunity to lock in a lower price before it lists on major exchanges. Keep in mind that presale tokens can be highly volatile, so carefully assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. While early adoption might deliver significant rewards, it also carries more uncertainty. Thoroughly review the Remittix whitepaper and stay tuned to social media updates to ensure you understand any evolving features or changes that could affect RTX’s value. Why Remittix (RTX) May Become a Game-Changer Remittix has quickly captured the spotlight for its commitment to practical, real-world financial solutions. Unlike many blockchain ventures that focus solely on DeFi or NFTs, RTX aims for international remittances, an industry worth trillions of dollars annually. If it can successfully merge user-friendly interfaces with crypto’s speed and low fees, Remittix (RTX) could meet or even exceed XRP’s impact. Part of the attraction is the simplicity behind how to buy RTX: the presale process is straightforward, offering investors a chance to secure a position before wider market exposure. Still, no investment is without risk and potential buyers should evaluate factors like market volatility, developmental milestones and regulatory climates. Researching how to buy tokens responsibly choosing reputable wallets, verifying official websites and understanding security fundamentals remains essential. Keeping an eye on the project’s roadmap and user adoption rates can also offer clues about whether RTX is living up to its ambitious goals. Whether you’ve been intrigued by the “next XRP” narrative or simply appreciate an altcoin that addresses everyday banking frustrations, Remittix stands out as a compelling option in a crowded market. With a solid presale performance and a focus on bridging fiat and crypto, RTX might just become one of the year’s most talked-about tokens. If you believe in the long-term potential of PayFi solutions, checking out Remittix Presale could be an important next step on your investment journey.

Milei admitted that he had not taken enough time to research the token before supporting it. After finding out more about it, he unfollowed its Twitter account. The president’s X account promoted a Solana meme coin called $LIBRA late Friday. According to him, the token was designed to stimulate the economy by funding small businesses. Traders initially piled in to buy the meme coin, driving it to a market cap of roughly $4.5 billion. This growing skepticism over the token’s legitimacy and concerns of a potential pump-and-dump scheme led to a sharp price drop. LIBRA crashes 89% as traders question its legitimacy Just a few hours after being launched on X (formerly Twitter), LIBRA fell 89%. The crypto analytics platform DexScreener reports that the token rose to $4.50 at launch before falling to $0.50. The Viva La Libertad Project’s website states that the meme coin initiative aimed to strengthen Argentina’s economy by supporting small projects and local businesses. “This private project will be dedicated to encouraging the growth of the Argentine economy by funding small Argentine businesses and startups,” a message initially posted and deleted in Milei’s account read (as translated by X). “The world wants to invest in Argentina.” The incident echoed the unexpected launch of U.S. President Donald Trump’s TRUMP token in January, just days before his inauguration. Like that event, meme coin traders rushed to buy LIBRA as its value surged—only to later question its legitimacy and whether President Milei’s account had been compromised. Trump’s token ultimately proved legitimate, and according to Bloomberg Línea, Milei confirmed that he did share the LIBRA token launch. On-chain analysts exposed LIBRA’s red flags as developers allegedly dump $87M in tokens As concerns mounted over the launch, market concern rose, and many traders sold their assets while on-chain analysts pointed out several issues . Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis highlighted key issues, including the token’s initial funding in SOL from an instant swap service and a significant portion of the supply being controlled by a single wallet. Chainalysis observed that both the address that initiated the token’s creation and the address that holds a significant portion of the LIBRA supply are controlled by single private keys instead of multi-signature setups, which are prevalent in newly established token launches. On-chain data visualization startup Bubblemaps claimed that the LIBRA team is unloading their assets, which has led to a rapid price drop over recent hours. Bubblemaps posted on X saying they had already made $87M by removing USDC and SOL from liquidity pools. The researchers pointed out that LIBRA dropped 85% in value after devs took in $87M of buy pressure into their accounts. There is $500M more to go. A note at the bottom of the project’s website identified it as a private initiative developed by KIP Network Inc., linking $LIBRA to the company and its KIP Protocol, a Web3 framework for AI applications. Multiple experts pointed out that the token’s distribution model presents major risks. Coinbase Head of Product Conor Grogan reminded everyone that established launches use multi-signature wallets and strict KYC measures.

Can the ETH price hit $10K as investors speculate on Solana’s implosion? Ethereum Price Revival Closer As Investors Speculate Solana’s Implosion as Meme Coins Become Extractive With meme coin mania hitting peak levels, Solana has become the go-to blockchain for launching meme coins. SOL’s value received a massive boost in 2024 and early 2025 due to the meme coin hype and Solana being the only competitor to Ethereum. Lately, the developments surrounding nation-states and top influencers launching meme coins that almost always crash 80% to 90% have caused a bad rep to the Solana ecosystem, which many suggest could lead to an implosion. Under such circumstances, Ethereum’s popularity will skyrocket. Can this push ETH’s value to hit $10K? Popular Coinbase supporter CBDuck added , “Another 87M extracted out of solana ecosystem. At this point, I don’t think ETH builders are worried, they are just patiently waiting for this imbalance of economical output vs. extraction to implode.” Another influencer, Lexaprotrader, said Solana and its ecosystem might be “headed to zero now.” “Three extremely extractive launches in a row. I can’t imagine a more bearish series of events. We basically have the leaders of the ecosystem acting like Sahil on steroids.” MoneyLord, a user on Twitter, also noted a similar take , saying that “Solana” was becoming an “extraction chain.” According to the investor, Solana “has no future.” With such bearish sentiments from investors and many investors losing money within a few minutes or hours, this Solana meme coin meta will likely end soon. X user with screenname ‘Palis’ added that the only way the meme coin meta would end is if the Solana ecosystem gets more project launches like Libra, where the “rotation rugs” are “swift, violent and extractive as possible.” According to Palsi, “We need every single public market participant who buys to lose, ALL of the gains to go to insiders. If we have anymore big launches like this, I hope they’re even *more* violent and *more* extractive Zero PNL screenshots on the timeline, zero profits anywhere to be heard of, zero long term copium narrative like Trump, only pain and suffering and devastation. This is the only way this meta ends.” The Solana ecosystem faces this dark and bearish fate that hints at capital and investor attention rotating to Ethereum. With Ethereum’s gas fees almost comparable to Solana’s , ETH might flourish again. Will this bullish phase push Ethereum price to end its uninspiring performance streak and kickstart a parabolic rally to $10K? Can ETH Hit $10K As Solana Investor Confidence Dampens? Ethereum price has been consolidating in a multi-year symmetrical triangle setup since late 2022. The February 3 crash failed to breach the triangle’s lower trendline. Instead, ETH is receiving support from this structure and will likely bounce higher, attempting a breakout. Ethereum’s symmetrical triangle setup was formed as the price produced lower highs and higher lows since late 2022. Connecting trend lines with the swing highs and lows shows a compressing trend with volatility declining. As the price reaches the triangle’s apex, it breaks out, leading to a volatile move. ETH/USDT 1-month chart Considering the above outlook, Ethereum price would attempt a bullish breakout from the symmetrical triangle. A conservative target for this setup is 77.61%, obtained by measuring the triangle’s height and adding it to the breakout point. On the other hand, a liberal outlook would note an Ethereum price forecast of an 184% rally from the breakout point of $3,500, which projects a target of $10,000.

Its quarterly revenue was up 88% year-over-year which translated to a net income of $1.3 billion for the period. The firm also reported a full-year revenue of $6.6 billion, net income of $2.6 billion, and Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of $3.3 billion. Our Q4 and FY 2024 financial results are now live. pic.twitter.com/R5LuW7pwI9 — Coinbase ️ (@coinbase) February 13, 2025 Coinbase Eclipses Expectations The bumper revenue report obliterated analyst expectations, which were earnings of $1.36 on revenue of $1.59 billion. The firm makes the lion’s share of its profits from higher than industry average transaction fees, with transaction revenue in the quarter surging 172% to $1.6 billion. This equates to nearly 70% of its total revenue, which was primarily driven by crypto market gains, which increased 45% over the three-month period. Coinbase subscription and services revenue rose 15% to $641 million, and it saw stablecoin revenue grow 31% year-over-year to $226 million. Meanwhile, Blockchain Rewards revenue grew 39% to $215 million, and custodial fee revenue grew 36% to $43 million. Coinbase executives, including CEO Brian Armstrong, believe crypto is entering a golden age, transitioning from a niche asset class to mainstream financial infrastructure. “It’s the dawn of a new era for crypto. Crypto’s voice was heard loud and clear in the US elections, and the era of regulation via enforcement that crippled our industry in the US is on its way out.” The firm plans to expand its international business in 2025 and is seeking growth in subscription and services revenue, including retail staking. Coinbase is also aiming to make USDC the leading stablecoin, leveraging network effects and compliance advantages.

This has pumped the Ripple price by more than 12% in the last 24 hours. Since this price movement is insulated from Bitcoin’s price action, investors should start picking the best altcoins to capitalize on this situation. Chances are High for SEC to Drop the Ripple Lawsuit The battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission has been going on for years. However, the time has come to bury the hatchet and let XRP not be considered a security anymore. While the talk of the SEC dropping the lawsuit has been going on since last year, the signals have now gotten stronger with the SEC willing to acknowledge NYSE’s application to list Grayscale’s XRP ETF. NEW: There it is — The SEC just acknowledged @Grayscale & @NYSE ’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF (this was mostly expected but officially means the clock will start soon for this and Dogecoin) pic.twitter.com/IQgTqPiiOe — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) February 13, 2025 In a tweet, James Seyffart argued that the old SEC would not have even acknowledged the application, which means there is a chance for the Ripple lawsuit to be over. 3 Altcoins to Capitalize on XRP’s Gains The move by the Securities and Exchange Commission won’t only impact the XRP price, but it will also signal that regulations are more attuned now for the growth of the cryptocurrency market. This new era has brought the following three altcoins to the forefront. Jupiter (JUP) While XRP price surged, the native crypto of the Solana-based decentralized exchange, Jupiter, JUP, has experienced a surge of more than 12% over the last 24 hours. This is the result of almost a 91% increase in its trading volume. The market capitalization of this token is currently $2.47 billion. Source: TradingView While JUP’s value is still 26% lower than what it was able to achieve in late January of this year, the way its price has been pumping, it is possible that it could move up enough to retest its all-time highs, provided there is enough momentum. if you voted on Jupiter proposals in Q4, we have some good news for you… Active Staking Rewards (ASR) are now claimable link below pic.twitter.com/I9IwkukhQt — Jupiter ( , ) (@JupiterExchange) February 13, 2025 The reason for this surge has been attributed to the Active Staking Rewards (ASR) becoming claimable recently. While this would have put more tokens into circulation, the price chart has shown that people are now more interested in other perks that Jupiter could bring. Further growth is expected since the recent JUP Planetary call got featured on X. JUP Buyback Details, Meow’s 555 Proposal, ASR, and more | J.U.P Planetary Call #37 https://t.co/5WV0PAwYda — Jupiter ( , ) (@JupiterExchange) February 13, 2025 DexBoss Calling itself the “boss of DEXs,” DexBoss (DEBO) describes itself as a cryptocurrency project that could help people rule the decentralized economy. The native crypto of this project, DEBO, is currently on presale and is being offered at a discount price of $0.011. The listing price has been set to $0.0505, which means those who invest early will likely make upwards of a 400% profit once the token goes live on exchanges. Source: DexBoss While the listing boost will excite the intraday traders, in the long term, DEBO could gain more ground thanks to its large list of use cases. These use cases stem from the fact that the exchange is not limiting itself to a simple type of financial product, as futures and options are also covered. Cross-chain compatibility has been implemented to allow the trading of over 2,000+ assets across several blockchains, and comprehensive trading tools that focus on features like stop-loss orders, limit orders, and more. Official Trump Though XRP price is pumping, U.S. President’s official meme coin, Official Trump (TRUMP), has been parabolically making a comeback after trading at lows for so long that investors started to call it a “Trump & Dump” project. Source: CoinMarketCap The politically charged meme coin has risen by more than 12% over the last 24 hours and has experienced close to a 10% increase in its trading volume. Trading at around the $19 level at the time of writing, TRUMP has a market capitalization of 3.8%. While ideally this could have been the result of the Official TRUMP meme community, the follower count on X, although large, doesn’t personify the strength of the meme coin community. The biggest aspect we could find was Trump’s rollback of his reciprocal tariffs. Furthermore, in his meeting with Narendra Modi, India’s Prime Minister, Trump also announced a COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology for the 21st Century) between the two countries. Conclusion XRP price’s recent surge signals a potential turning point for crypto markets, as regulatory clarity could drive broader adoption. Investors seeking high-growth opportunities should keep an eye on Jupiter, DexBoss, and Official Trump—each showing strong momentum. While XRP remains a dominant force, these emerging altcoins could offer substantial gains in the evolving market landscape.

This price surge comes after rising speculations of a possible ETF and the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially accepting to review the Grayscale XRP ETFs proposal! With a potential XRP ETF approval around the corner, is this a good time to invest in Ripple tokens? Moreover, investors and institutions are closely monitoring the price action with questions like “What happens if XRP gets ETF?” Are you concerned about its short-term prediction? Read our latest short-term Ripple price analysis today! Ripple Price Records A Strong Bullish Reversal! The price of XRP has jumped ~11% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $8.988 billion, a change of +72.94%. Moreover, it has surged ~20% over the last seven days, highlighting an increase in the buying-over-selling pressure for the altcoin in the market. TradingView: XRP/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a constant rise in the green histogram with its averages recording a bullish convergence in the daily time frame. This highlights that the 03rd largest crypto token may continue gaining value. On the other hand, the SMA indicator witnesses a positive crossover in the XRP price chart. This suggests a strong bullish action for the altcoin in the cryptocurrency space. When Will XRP Price Hit A New ATH? Suppose, the market favors the bulls, in that case, the Ripple price could retest its immediate resistance level of $3.00. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for this altcoin to head toward its upper resistance level of $3.50 this month. Conversely, if the bears outrun the bulls, the XRP coin price could retest its support level of $2.50. Furthermore, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, this altcoin may plunge toward its crucial low of $2 in the coming time.

A threshold by crypto analyst Ali Martinez is crucial for maintaining upward momentum. After maintaining this level, the digital asset rebounded sharply, gaining approximately 13.65% over the past 24 hours and trading at $2.8. This move aligns with Martinez’s earlier analysis, where he suggested that if XRP remained above $2.30, it could rally toward $3—a level it previously lost in early February when the broader market experienced a decline . The latest price action indicates that the asset follows this trajectory, reinforcing the bullish outlook. As expected, $XRP is rebounding from the lower boundary of its channel, gaining momentum toward $3! https://t.co/NwaknkzCih pic.twitter.com/C9O6Ys3hiF — Ali (@ali_charts) February 14, 2025 XRP’s Ascending Channel The latest chart shared by Martinez shows XRP trading within a well-defined ascending channel. After testing the lower boundary of this formation, the asset has started to climb back toward the midline, signaling renewed buying pressure. The resistance levels within this channel suggest that $3 remains a realistic short-term target if momentum continues. The market reaction to this setup further supports the bullish case. XRP’s ability to hold above its key support and rebound with significant strength indicates growing investor confidence. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If the price breaks through the midline resistance, the next focus will be the channel’s upper boundary, which could indicate further gains beyond $3. Notably, another prominent analyst recently stated that the decline is XRP’s final backtest of any level below $3. If Martinez’s prediction comes true, the asset might not fall again. Anticipation For A Bigger Surge XRP’s recent surge comes amid broader optimism in the cryptocurrency market. With Bitcoin and other major digital assets also showing strength, the overall market environment appears favorable for continued gains. Additionally, XRP’s price action suggests that traders closely monitor technical levels and react accordingly. Bulls recently flooded the market anticipating a price surge, and the digital asset did not disappoint. XRP remains on an upward trajectory, with analysts like Martinez closely monitoring its progress. In January, XRP hit a multi-year high of $3.39, and many experts have set much higher targets for the asset’s immediate future. One prominent analyst set a target of $15 by March 10, and crossing the $3 mark could aid the digital asset’s journey to this target.

While full-scale crypto trading remains a challenge due to regulatory hurdles, digital asset custody services are emerging as a primary focus for institutional investors. According to The Information’s crypto reporter Yueqi Yang, banks like State Street, BNY Mellon, and Citigroup are actively working to establish or expand crypto custody operations. State Street, a major player in the traditional asset custody space, is set to launch digital asset custody services next year. BNY Mellon, which already offers limited custody for Bitcoin and Ethereum, is looking to expand its offering to include more tokens. Meanwhile, Citigroup is exploring ways to enter the space by developing its own custody services or partnering with external firms. Related News: What Does the Recent SEC News About the XRP Spot ETF Mean? Is It Really Approved? Despite this growing interest, many banks still face significant regulatory hurdles. Institutions that want to offer crypto services must obtain approval from the Federal Reserve and the New York Department of Financial Services. In addition, regulatory capital requirements add another layer of complexity that slows down entry into crypto trading.

But there’s one meme coin that’s currently the talk of the presale town—BTFD Coin. Not only is it soaring through its presale at an insane pace, but it’s also offering one of the most lucrative referral programs the meme coin space has ever seen. Add in a jaw-dropping 3,650% ROI potential, and you’ve got a golden ticket that’s too good to ignore. BTFD Coin’s presale has already smashed past $6.07 million, with over 10,700 investors scooping up more than 69 billion BTFD tokens. Now, in Stage 14, the price is sitting at $0.00016, but it won’t stay there for long. With just two stages left before this rocket launches, time is running out to grab a presale spot. Oh, and what about the LAUNCH100 bonus code that DOUBLES your tokens if you act fast? Let’s dive into the best meme coins to invest in now! BTFD Coin – The Meme Coin With an Unmatched Referral Program & Massive 1000x Potential If you’re looking for a meme coin that’s more than just hype, BTFD Coin is where you need to be. Built on Ethereum and backed by a strong community, this meme coin is all about turning market dips into golden opportunities. But what’s making waves right now is its extraordinary referral rewards. BTFD Coin Referral Rewards: A Money-Making Machine Imagine getting paid just for spreading the word about BTFD Coin. That’s exactly what the referral program offers: Every friend you refer gets a 10% bonus in tokens (as long as they invest $50 or more). The top 20 referrers on the leaderboard earn an extra 10% of the total raise amount in BTFD tokens. The leaderboard resets every month, so you always have a fresh chance to cash in. Let’s put this into perspective: Say you refer five friends, and each of them buys $1,000 worth of BTFD. That’s $5,000 raised, which means you’ll pocket $500 worth of BTFD—for doing nothing but sharing a code as long as you hit the top 20. The 3,650% ROI Opportunity You Can’t Ignore BTFD Coin isn’t just handing out rewards—it’s setting up for a massive price explosion. Analysts predict that once it lists on exchanges, the token could start at $0.0006, but if it follows the trajectory of past meme coin giants, it could moon to $0.006. If that happens, an investment today at $0.00016 could see an ROI of 3,650%. All in all, BTFD Coin’s lightning-fast presale growth, highly rewarding referral program, and potential for massive gains make it a no-brainer for anyone looking to enter the meme coin market. Dogecoin – The OG Meme Coin That Could Make a Comeback Soon Born as a joke, Dogecoin has become a staple in the crypto world, with Elon Musk’s tweets and the community’s loyalty keeping it relevant. Why Dogecoin Still Holds Strong in 2025 Despite a Volatile Market Adoption & Real-World Use: Dogecoin has been adopted as a payment method by brands like Tesla, AMC Theatres, and even online retailers. Whale Accumulation: Large investors are buying up DOGE in bulk, indicating potential for another bull run. Upcoming Developments: With the integration of Dogecoin into Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) still being speculated, DOGE could see another price surge. Dogecoin remains one of the most recognized meme coins, and its steady adoption ensures it stays relevant in the long run. Dogwifhat – The Solana-Powered Meme Coin That’s Winning Hearts One of the biggest surprise hits in the meme coin space is Dogwifhat (WIF). This Solana-based meme coin took off due to its adorable branding, strong community backing, and Solana’s growing dominance in crypto. Why Dogwifhat Has Been Pumping Hard Solana’s Ecosystem Growth: With Solana’s transaction speeds and low fees, Dogwifhat has become a favorite for traders looking for high-speed meme coin action. Massive Social Media Buzz: This token went viral thanks to its meme-worthy branding and has attracted thousands of new investors. Big Exchange Listings: More major exchanges are listing Dogwifhat, adding to its visibility and demand. Dogwifhat has meme power, community hype, and strong fundamentals—three things that could help it explode even further.

How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL.

Positive post-US election developments, friendlier investor attitudes towards cryptos, and a supportive market backdrop may drive performance. US President Donald Trump has signaled a desire for a strategic bitcoin reserve and has installed crypto-friendly policymakers. By Ashley Oerth, Associate Global Market Strategist Digital assets enjoyed strong performance in 2024. Following Republican victories in the US House, Senate, and presidency, bitcoin broke above the $100,000 mark, and the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies now sits at $3.5 trillion as of Jan. 31, 2025. 1 While US large-cap equities have risen 4.8% since the election, bitcoin has risen 47.6%, and ether has risen 37.4%. 2 In 2025, we expect this momentum to continue as a series of positive headlines and legislative progress look likely. Cryptocurrencies are disproportionately influenced by broader macro conditions and sentiment, in our view - and that can result in significant moves higher or lower. Today, we believe conditions and sentiment are shifting to be more supportive for digital assets, including positive post-US election developments, friendlier investor attitudes towards cryptos, and a market backdrop that looks likely to be positive given central bank rate cuts and a more normal global growth environment. We highlight five stand-out factors below that suggest cryptocurrencies may continue to see positive performance in 2025: 1. Crypto-friendly US policymakers enter office President Donald Trump has signalled a slew of crypto-friendly policies, including his desire for a strategic bitcoin reserve and the installation of crypto-friendly policymakers at the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the two key US regulators for the crypto space. However, the surge in digital assets support is broader-based than just the president: According to a pro-crypto industry group, 294 pro-crypto candidates from both parties were elected to the House and Senate in the 2024 election. 3 This will most likely mark a significant departure from the Biden administration's approach, which had generally been hostile towards digital assets. For example, the SEC under Chair Gary Gensler pursued a number of cases against crypto enterprises without specifying the framework they were following, earning the unpopular description of a ""regulation by enforcement"" approach to policy. Biden himself has generally pushed back on crypto, opposing the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) bill despite bipartisan support. A key flashpoint has been SAB 121, an SEC bulletin published in 2022 that imposed strict requirements for publicly traded institutions that hold custody of digital assets on behalf of clients. SAB 121 forced such institutions to record these assets on their balance sheets, triggering regulatory capital requirements and effectively shutting out most banks from participating in the digital assets ecosystem. In the absence of bank custody solutions, many crypto investors have instead turned to a myriad of costly (and at times unreliable) solutions. SAB 121 has now been revoked, opening the door for more large institutions to provide custody solutions in the digital assets space. As the US posture towards digital assets evolves, we anticipate that a larger cohort of investors will embrace digital assets and may help propel a bull market in cryptocurrencies. Investor interest in US bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) has grown since the November election 2. Investing in cryptocurrencies is getting easier 2024 brought the launch of spot bitcoin ETPs in the US and Hong Kong, helping to propel $34.6 billion in net flows as of year-end 2024, according to Bloomberg. 2025 may see additional countries permit spot ETPs to a broader set of investors, and additional cryptocurrencies may become more easily accessed through ETPs. Recent regulatory filings indicate a slew of ETPs investing in additional cryptocurrencies, based on the US SEC as of the end of January. As more products become available to a wider set of investors, we anticipate cryptocurrency prices may benefit. 3. Perceptions of bitcoin are changing As bitcoin market cap grows, investor attitudes towards the largest cryptocurrency continue to evolve. The launch of widely accessible spot bitcoin ETPs in the US in January 2024 marked a key milestone as the world's largest capital market provided an easy on-ramp for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin (and later, ether). In the US, for example, investors have already allocated $40.6 billion to spot bitcoin ETPs since Jan. 11, 2024, making up $101.8 billion in assets as of the end of 2024. Compare this to gold ETFs, which have $124.2 billion in AUM. 4 One year after launch, bitcoin ETPs are approaching the value of gold ETFs in the US 4. The market backdrop looks favorable Lower rates in the US, eurozone, UK, and other major economies suggest that 2025 may be a risk-on year in global markets. Indeed, our outlook for 2025 favors more cyclically-oriented parts of the market, including stocks and credit. An environment in which investors take on more risk is likely to be supportive of cryptocurrencies, which tend to be influenced substantially by macro conditions. 5. Tokenization is building momentum. Tokenization involves representing something on a blockchain in the form of a token, which enables a variety of benefits for information and asset custody management and exchange. We believe today's financial system can realize a number of potential benefits through tokenization such as reduced counterparty risk, faster payment and settlement, and improved customizability in client investing experiences. Already, central bank digital currencies and asset tokenization pilot projects have been building momentum over the past five years, including tokenized money market funds, tokenized bonds, and tokenized private markets offerings. The UK government is planning to issue tokenized gilts for the first time within the next two years. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank is preparing to launch its digital euro, which is expected to facilitate tokenized use cases. As the adoption of this technology increases, we anticipate cryptocurrencies may also benefit. 2025: A year to watch Cryptocurrencies are volatile investments that can rise or fall substantially on news flow. Overall, we suspect that cryptocurrencies will continue to notch new highs in 2025, driven by improving regulatory clarity and friendlier policymakers who have been generating headlines favorable to digital assets. (See, for example, crypto price behavior around Trump's election win, the announcement of Trump's SEC chair pick, and the authorization of spot bitcoin and ether ETPs in the US.) We also anticipate that lower rates in many major economies could help increase demand for riskier assets.

This does not constitute a recommendation of any investment strategy or product for a particular investor. Investors should consult a financial professional before making any investment decisions. Bitcoin is a digital currency (also called cryptocurrency) that is not backed by any country's central bank or government. Bitcoins can be traded for goods or services with vendors who accept bitcoins as payment. Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are considered a highly speculative investment due to their lack of guaranteed value and limited track record. Because of their digital nature, they pose risks from hackers, malware, fraud, and operational glitches. Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies aren't legal tender and are operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrency accounts aren't backed or insured by any type of federal or government program or bank. Blockchain is the decentralized, digital public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Fluctuations in the price of gold and precious metals may affect the profitability of companies in the gold and precious metals sector. Changes in the political or economic conditions of countries where companies in the gold and precious metals sector are located may have a direct effect on the price of gold and precious metals. Fixed income investments are subject to credit risk of the issuer and the effects of changing interest rates. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. An issuer may be unable to meet interest and/or principal payments, thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuer's credit rating. A bull market is an environment in which stock prices are rising or are expected to rise. UK gilts are bonds issued by the British government. Risk-on refers to price behavior driven by changes in investor risk tolerance; investors tend toward higher risk investments when they perceive risk as low.

On Friday, the agency told a Manhattan appeals court that a resolution in its high-profile lawsuit against Coinbase could be near. But before that happens, the agency needs more time—30 extra days—to respond to the exchange’s legal challenge. The case, filed in 2023, aimed to force Coinbase to follow the same rules as Wall Street stock exchanges and brokerages. Crypto firms fought back, saying traditional finance regulations don’t fit digital assets. Now, under President Trump, the agency is taking a different route. Last month, he ordered all federal agencies, including the SEC, to draft a new regulatory framework for crypto. The agency said in its filing that this directive “could facilitate the potential resolution” of the Coinbase lawsuit. On Thursday, Coinbase reported a surge in revenue and profits in its Q4 earnings report. Investors are betting on a Trump-fueled crypto boom, and the numbers reflect that. Tether is helping Congress draft stablecoin legislation While the SEC slows down, Tether is actively engaging with U.S. lawmakers to shape stablecoin regulations. The company, which controls 60% of the $230 billion stablecoin market, has been a controversial figure in Washington due to its lack of full audits. Tether has always only provided quarterly reports from global accounting company BDO. Stablecoins like USDT are backed by hard assets—in this case, U.S. dollars and Treasury bills. Tether is also one of the largest holders of U.S. government debt, with $114 billion in short-term Treasuries in its reserves. With new stablecoin regulations on the horizon, the company wants a seat at the table. Federal judges are also weighing in. Last month, Judge Katherine Polk Failla gave Coinbase the green light to file an interlocutory appeal. The Second Circuit will now decide whether existing securities laws even apply to crypto assets traded on the platform. In the meantime, Congress is moving fast. Three new stablecoin bills were introduced last week—one from Rep. Bryan Steil, another from Senator Bill Hagerty, and a third from Rep. Maxine Waters. The goal? Get a bill to Trump’s desk by April. Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that the company is working directly with lawmakers. “We are going to work within the regulatory framework, and we are going to try to advise on every single one of these field proposals to make sure that our voice is heard,” he said. If passed, the new laws would force Tether to undergo full monthly audits from a U.S.-approved accounting firm and maintain 1:1 reserves with assets pre-approved by regulators. But Ardoino made one thing clear: Tether isn’t backing down. “We are not going to just throw in the towel and let Tether die just for the sake of not adapting to U.S. legislation,” he said. “But there is still a lot of uncertainty over what’s actually going to happen, and we want our voice to be heard in the legislative process.” CFTC leadership shake-up as Trump reshapes financial regulators Crypto regulation isn’t just shifting at the SEC. Over at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Brian Young is stepping in as the agency’s new enforcement director. The announcement came Friday from Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who took over after Trump’s election. “He is a fearless leader that will build an even more impressive enforcement program that will stay true to the CFTC’s mission to protect the American public from fraudsters and scammers,” Pham said in a statement. Young is a former DOJ veteran who ran the CFTC’s whistleblower office before taking the top enforcement job. His appointment is part of Trump’s broader effort to reshape financial oversight in favor of pro-business, pro-crypto policies. At the same time, Brian Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner and current head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z crypto arm, is set to lead the agency. Quintenz served on the CFTC from 2017 to 2021 and has been one of the biggest advocates for clearer crypto regulations. His return signals a policy shift at the CFTC, where crypto-friendly policies are now back in play. In her first major decision, Pham reorganized the CFTC’s enforcement division into two parts: complex frauds and retail fraud, wanting to streamline investigations while focusing on major financial crimes.

Recent developments in the SEC’s legal battles against prominent exchanges like Coinbase and Binance indicate that the regulator is slowing down legal action against crypto firms and waiting for its task force to guide future decisions. SEC Requests a 28-Day Extension in the Coinbase Case Last month, providing a brief relief to Coinbase in its legal battle against the SEC , Judge Failla halted the legal proceedings against the exchange. The court even allowed Coinbase to file an interlocutory appeal to seek clarity on whether existing securities laws apply to digital assets traded on the exchange. An interlocutory appeal occurs when a ruling by a trial court is appealed while other aspects of the case are still proceeding. The SEC was supposed to respond to the exchange’s request to file the appeal on or before February 14, 2025. Experts like Eleanor Terrett predicted that the regulatory agency might ask for an extension of the deadline. As forecasted by experts, the SEC has requested a 28-day extension to respond to Coinbase’s appeal to leave to file an interlocutory appeal. Unsurprisingly, Coinbase has accepted the extension request filed by the US SEC.

SEC Leadership Shift: What You Should Know Hours before Trump’s inauguration, gary gensler gary gensler Gary Gensler is a pioneer and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He has extensive experience that spans Wall Street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. Gary S. Gensler was on born October 18, 1957, in Baltimore, Maryland.He graduated from Pikesville High School in 1975, where he was later given a Distinguished Alumnus award. He also earned a degree in economics.Gensler served in the United States Department of the Treasury as Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets from 1997 to 1999, then as Undersecretary for Domestic Finance from 1999 to 2001He has expressed his desire to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. Chairman stepped down from its post as the SEC chairman. The untimely exit of Gensler paved the way for the entry of pro-crypto attorney Mark Uyeda as the acting SEC chair . The SEC established a Crypto Task Force to provide clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to the crypto asset market. The task force currently operates under the leadership of SEC Commissioner hester peirce hester peirce Hester Peirce of the Securities and Exchange Commission, often known as ""Crypto Mom,"" is one of the most outspoken supporters of cryptocurrency at the government level in the United States. Prior to joining the Securities and Exchange Commission, she worked in a variety of roles evaluating and formulating financial regulations, having graduated from Yale Law School. She worked at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank, most recently before becoming commissioner, where she produced, among other things, critiques of legislation like the Dodd-Frank Act. She, often known as ""Crypto Mom,"" is a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission. She was born in Ohio and graduated from Yale Law School. Prior to joining the Securities and Exchange Commission, she worked in a variety of capacities evaluating and creating financial regulations. She worked at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, a libertarian-leaning think tank, most recently before becoming commissioner, where she produced, among other things, critiques of legislation like the Dodd-Frank Act. As chairman Jay Clayton steps out and a Joe Biden nominee takes his place, Republican Peirce will find herself in the minority. Clayton, on the other hand, was not particularly forward-thinking when it came to digital assets. President Biden has declared his intention to select Gary Gensler, a crypto expert who would presumably be more prepared to deal with Peirce than Clayton was. The SEC's approval of initial public offerings for crypto businesses like Coinbase, the first U.S.-authorized Bitcoin ETF, and, of course, the ICO safe harbour are all obvious targets for Peirce. We won't know what Peirce thinks about the SEC's pursuit of Ripple until after the fact, per SEC protocol, but the outcome of that case will almost certainly serve as a springboard for more clarity. Peirce told guests at the Crypto Finance Conference in January that the future SEC chairman's priority should be supporting innovation and giving regulatory clarity: ""We need to embrace innovation and figure out how to create a regulatory framework that encourages it, which, in our field, I believe means providing clarity.""

40350712,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675158,1739605550,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40350712.jpeg,Zuckerberg’s Meta has paused efforts to license books for AI training,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-pauses-to-license-books-for-ai-training/,"Meta took a break from talking to book publishers in regard to licensing deals to get training data for some of its generative AI models. This has been revealed by the new court documents connected to the case Kadrey v. Meta Platforms. New filings sent to the court on Friday include parts of depositions of Meta employees that were taken by lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the case. These documents show that some Meta employees have concluded that negotiating AI training data licenses for books might not be scalable. Sy Choudhury, who is in charge of Meta’s AI partnership projects, said that Meta’s attempts to get writers interested and involved were met with very slow uptake in engagement and interest. According to the transcript, Sy Choudhury said, “I don’t recall the entire list, but I remember we had made a long list from initially scouring the Internet of top publishers, et cetera and we didn’t get contact and feedback from — from a lot of our cold call outreaches to try to establish contact.” This is one of many cases in the U.S. courts that pitted AI companies against writers, news outlets, visual artists, musicians and other copyright owners. OpenAI, Anthropic, and other technology companies have been accused of using their work to train chatbots without permission or payment. Meta attempts to get copyright permissions Authors like Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates are among the plaintiffs. Since the case was first filed in 2023, the lawyers for the plaintiffs have changed their lawsuit several times. The most recent amended complaint from the plaintiffs’ lawyers says that Meta, among other things, compared pirated books to copyrighted books that were offered for license. This was to see if it made sense to try to get a licensing deal with a publisher. Meta is also accused of training some of its AI models, including the famous Llama series of “open” models, with “shadow libraries” that contain stolen e-books. The lawsuit says that Meta may have used torrenting to protect some of the libraries. People who use torrenting to share files across the internet have to “seed,” or upload, the files they want to get at the same time. The plaintiffs said this was a form of copyright infringement. The court files show that Meta stopped trying to license some AI-related books in early April 2023. They explained that the problem was with timing and other logistics. According to a transcript, Choudhury said that some publishers, especially fiction book publishers, did not actually own the rights to the material that Meta was thinking about licensing. Choudhury said, “I’d like to point out that the — in the fiction category, we quickly learned from the business development team that most of the publishers we were talking to, they themselves were representing that they did not have, actually, the rights to license the data to us […] And so it would take a long time to engage with all their authors.” In the same light, a transcript shows that Choudhury said that Meta has stopped licensing efforts linked to AI development at least once before. He said, “I am aware of licensing efforts such, for example, we tried to license 3D worlds from different game engines and game manufacturers for our AI research team […] we got very little engagement to even have a conversation.” The US AI industry, which has begun to face competition from China, is facing many lawsuits. In fact, OpenAI and Meta say that being forced to pay copyright holders for their material could kill the US AI industry. Fair use or copyright? – US AI lawsuits in 2025 Both plaintiffs and defendants have something to say. Tech companies have argued that their AI systems make fair use of copyrighted material by studying it to learn to create new, transformative content. Copyright owners argue that the companies unlawfully copy their works to generate rival content that threatens their livelihoods. Some people who own copyright, like big record labels, the New York Times, and a number of best-selling authors have kept pressing their claims. On the other hand, some content producers, like Reddit, News Corp, and the Financial Times, started licensing their work to tech companies on their own. Thomson Reuters and Ross Intelligence dispute shows how judges may handle fair use arguments. Thomson Reuters said Ross stole intellectual property from Westlaw and used it to make an AI-powered legal search engine. Invoking fair use, Ross denied doing anything wrong. 🚨🇺🇸COURT RULES COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL CAN’T BE USED FOR AI TRAINING A U.S District Judge just crushed AI firms, ruling that training on copyrighted content is not fair use. The case, Thomson Reuters vs. Ross Intelligence, could set a devastating precedent for AI companies… pic.twitter.com/w685u7zjKS — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) February 12, 2025 A federal judge in Delaware said that Ross Intelligence could not copy the technology, information, and company’s material in order to make a competing legal platform based on AI. The decision by U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas Ross Intelligence is the first decision made by a U.S. court on the closely watched issue of fair use in AI-related copyright litigation. Clearly, AI companies could have it rough this year with copyright accusations.

The financial infrastructure has been built to change how international payments function through procedures that offer timelier inter-financial operations, reduced costs, and raised security levels. The rising market acceptance positions RTX as a critical entity within decentralized finance (DeFi) and remittance service industries. But what makes it stand out? Let’s explore the details. Why Remittix PayFi is a Game-Changer Through its Remittix PayFi protocol, the system addresses financial system challenges by resolving high costs slow processing times, and preventing limited access. The application of blockchain technology on this platform helps users make international transactions at reasonable rates while bypassing lengthy processing delays. Decentralized transactions through the RTX ecosystem become possible because PayFi establishes an effortless connection between the networks. More people are gaining crypto-based financial independence in different regions of the world. The technology provides users with the advantage of escaping banking limitations. The underbanked population encounters difficulties with financial services but RTX establishes a decentralized, borderless system to meet their needs. How RTX Enhances Cross-Border Transactions Average funds delivery with traditional remittance services takes long while the process remains costly. The Remittix PayFi platform of RTX enables users to benefit from smart contracts and blockchain-based settlements through their service. Impediments in transactions are eliminated through this system because payments operate with enhanced security, faster speeds, and increased transparency. RTX functions perfectly for immigrants making payments, independent operators doing business, and everyone requiring foreign payments. Additionally, RTX promotes financial inclusivity. Users who encountered limitations in traditional financial services can now perform transactions through blockchain due to its decentralized attributes, eliminating bank dependence. The Role of RTX in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) RTX functions beyond payment services as it supports the operation of DeFi networks. Users benefit from integrating lending, borrowing, and staking platforms through this system. Remittix PayFi protocol increases DeFi market stability, empowering users with easier access to yield farming and staking opportunities. RTX uses this strength to secure its market position throughout the ongoing evolution of the crypto industry. RTX within DeFi establishes a system for executing tiny payments between users. RTX facilitates efficient payments without traditional banking fees for content creators, gaming platforms, and online services. Security and Transparency in RTX Transactions Crypto users focus on security because of its importance in protecting their finances. A decentralized smart contract framework through the Remittix PayFi protocol enhances top-level transaction security while protecting users from fraudulent activities. RTX transactions automatically get stored permanently on a public ledger because blockchain maintains its permanent nature. The platform demonstrates complete openness, creating fulfilled trust relationships with clear oversight of every user transaction. RTX implements state-of-the-art encryption methods for fund protection so users can benefit from more secure protection than what traditional remittance systems can offer because they remain vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks. Expert Opinions on RTX and PayFi Protocol Several analysts have weighed in on RTX’s potential. Crypto expert @CryptoInsider recently tweeted: “RTX is reshaping the way we think about global transactions. With the PayFi protocol, we’re seeing the dawn of a truly borderless financial system.” New research indicates that RTX adoption continues to rise because users use the platform for their typical financial activities. The usage of RTX in cross-border payments has steadily grown, based on the presented chart. As of February 14, 2025, Remittix (RTX) is in its presale phase, having raised over $11.8 million. The token price is $0.0599, with an anticipated increase to $0.0628 in the next stage. Conclusion The combination of RTX and Remittix PayFi protocol transforms international payment systems. RTX establishes a modern global financial system through its speedy, cost-efficient, and secure payment system, which competes against traditional remittance services. RTX technology attracts more users and businesses, enhancing its position as a prominent crypto space narrative while expanding its influence. Following RTX’s progress should be vital for all traders, investors, and regular users seeking real crypto transformation.

Following its recent performance, some analysts consider that BTC could be near a breakout and a massive rally toward a new high. Related Reading: CZ Sparks Memecoin Frenzy With Dog Picture: Four.Meme Starts Token Betting Event Bitcoin Ready For A Breakout Or a Breakdown? Amid the market volatility, Bitcoin has found price stability, staying within the mid-zone of its post-election breakout level. During the recent 12% correction, BTC saw its price retest the range lows as support, bouncing toward the $100,000 barrier. However, it failed to regain this zone as support and continued its sideways move within this range. Over the last week, the flagship crypto has hovered between $94,000 and $98,000, incapable of holding the $99,000 mark since late January. Crypto trader EliZ noted that Bitcoin has been within this “mini range” for nearly two weeks, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is poised for “a big move” out of this consolidation zone. He cautioned investors that the direction the flagship crypto could take “is almost impossible to predict.” It is worth noting that market sentiment has recently divided, as Bitcoin’s price action doesn’t seem to reflect bullish news. A Nansem analyst suggested that the market appears momentarily satiated and more “reactive to negative sentiment than positive news.” Ali Martinez said Bitcoin looks “primed for a breakout,” highlighting an almost two-week symmetrical triangle in BTC’s chart. After the recent price performance, the cryptocurrency tested the pattern’s upper trendline, suggesting another retest could be near. Nonetheless, the analyst stated that a confirmation of the breakout will be key before the next BTC move. BTC Price Eyes $150,000 Cycle Top Crypto Jelle also considers that Bitcoin is preparing to start its next leg up. BTC’s “explosive moves generally kick off after the first price-discovery consolidation is completed,” which, according to other analysts, it has. Rekt Capital has stated that Bitcoin is about to embark on its second price discovery uptrend, as BTC has completed the first price-discovery correction of its post-halving parabolic phase. According to Jelle’s X post, Bitcoin gained 577% in 133 days in 2017, while it recorded a 70% increase in 56 days in 2021. Moreover, he pointed out another signal that could shed some light on BTC’s top this cycle. The analyst affirmed, “Bitcoin crossing above its 2-year MA multiplier has historically been a great top signal.” Bitcoin topped after crossing above the 5X multiplier in the first two cycles. Meanwhile, it didn’t hit last cycle’s top until “tagging the 5x multiplier – well above the 4x multiplier,” suggesting that a diminishing trend could be forming.

However, Jelle affirms that even if BTC’s price only hits the 3x multiplier this cycle, the price is still poised for a significant rise. According to the chart, the potential multiplier for the cycle targets the $152,000 mark. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $98,243, a 1.7% increase on the daily timeframe.

Meanwhile a new contender Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is emerging as a potential high-growth opportunity, driven by its strong tokenomics and integration with Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming. Yeti Ouro has announced a limited-time 25% bonus on all purchases. This offer is available until midnight on Sunday, providing investors with an opportunity to boost their returns before the next price increase on Monday. Ripple (XRP) News Today Ripple’s XRP has seen a shift in market sentiment. As of Feburary 14, The crypto market is filled with high hopes as the SEC is expected to announce its decision on Grayscale Investments application to convert its XRP Trust into a spot ETF. This shift comes as the SEC appears to be easing up on its crypto stance following former Chair Gary Gensler’s departure last month. The SEC has acknowledged Grayscale and NYSE Arca’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF. It’s the bullish XRP news that Ripple watchers have been waiting for. Ripple (XRP) is currently trading at $2.69. Source: CoinMarketCap Yeti Ouro (YETIO) Gains Investor Interest With High ROI Potential Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is capturing attention as one of the fastest-growing projects in 2025. Built on Ethereum, Yeti Ouro is more than just a meme coin. It combines blockchain gaming, deflationary tokenomics, and staking rewards, making it a utility-driven digital asset. At the time of writing, YETIO’s presale is in its second stage moving to the third stage, priced at $0.017 per token; the token’s price is certainly expected to rise. Interestingly for investors, this is the best time to invest as the project is offering a 25% bonus on all purchases. The project has already sold over 174 million tokens, with the presale going into stage 3 on Monday. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on market sentiment, Yeti Ouro is structured for long-term sustainability. Its scarcity-driven model, featuring a total supply of 1 billion tokens, ensures that early investors benefit from limited availability. Additionally, YETIO has implemented a 5% burn mechanism, reducing supply and increasing the potential for price appreciation. Security remains a priority for Yeti Ouro . Smart contract audits by SolidProof provide transparency and protection, mitigating the risks associated with early-stage blockchain projects. This has further strengthened investors’ confidence in the project and its long-term potential. Yeti Go: The Play-To-Earn Game Driving YETIO’s Demand Yeti Ouro’s strong market position is largely fueled by its gaming ecosystem, led by Yeti Go. Built on Unreal Engine 5, this Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game allows players to earn YETIO tokens by competing in high-speed races, completing challenges, and unlocking exclusive in-game rewards. The development team behind Yeti Go has partnered with leading game asset creators, known for their work on Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space. This collaboration ensures that Yeti Go delivers an engaging gaming experience, rivaling mainstream racing games. The audio composition is being expertly crafted by industry professionals with Grammy-nominated experience, having contributed to projects for Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. Beyond its stunning graphics and immersive gameplay, Yeti Go is designed to increase token demand. Players will need YETIO tokens for in-game purchases, customizations, and upgrades, ensuring a continuous cycle of token utility. Unlike speculative meme coins, Yeti Ouro’s token demand is directly tied to user engagement, making it less susceptible to broader market fluctuations. Why Analysts Predict A Huge ROI For Yeti Ouro Financial analysts and blockchain experts are closely watching YETIO’s rapid growth, with some forecasting a 10,000% increase if it follows the trajectory of Axie Infinity’s rise in 2021. Yeti Ouro’s market value currently stands at $17 million during its presale, presenting significant upside potential when compared to Ripple’s $300 billion market cap. Predictions suggest that YETIO could reach $0.50 to $1.70 by the end of 2025. If Yeti Go’s adoption grows as expected, long-term price projections estimate YETIO could surpass $5 by 2026.

In the first scenario, Van de Poppe tells his 169,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin and altcoins will have “one hell of a year.” According to the analyst, the crypto market will follow the four-year cycle with Bitcoin peaking in the fourth quarter of 2025 while altcoins will have a bullish run in the first quarter of 2026. The four-year cycle is based on Bitcoin halving events when BTC miner rewards get slashed in half, triggering a supply and demand imbalance that has previously led to bullish crypto market conditions. In the second scenario, Van de Poppe says Bitcoin and altcoins will have even bigger rallies as equities rise in prices, too, all fueled by President Trump’s policies. “The second scenario for Bitcoin is that the last cycle [2020 to 2024] has peaked too early. This cycle has barely started for altcoins, we’ve had the longest bear market in the altcoin [market] since its existence…. The S&P [index] is going to copy-paste the last four years of the dotcom bubble [1997 to 2000] with four years of 20% returns or more which is a very rare case and which is basically designing the entire bubble that was happening in the dotcom bubble and might be the case again with AI (artificial intelligence) and blockchain [technologies]… If the S&P is going to do that, Bitcoin is going to be the beta play on top of that where also [US President Donald] Trump is going to fuel that entire run where Bitcoin goes to a $1 million and altcoins can go completely wild with irrational valuations.” According to the analyst, a trend reversal will follow thereafter. “The entire macroeconomic perspective is going to change and we will be having the biggest correction or crisis after that.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The crypto market is a dynamic beast, constantly evolving, and right now, all eyes are on Bitcoin. The latest readings from the Altcoin Season Index are flashing a clear signal: we’re currently navigating a Bitcoin Season . But what does this actually mean for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, or curious observer? Let’s break down this fascinating market indicator and understand the implications of a Bitcoin Season . Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Crypto Compass The Altcoin Season Index , a tool provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), acts like a compass for the volatile crypto seas. It’s designed to tell us whether Bitcoin is leading the charge or if altcoins are stealing the spotlight. Think of it as a tug-of-war between Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, of course!). Here’s the core of how it works: Measurement Window: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC over the past 90 days. This timeframe provides a solid snapshot of recent market performance. Performance Benchmark: It compares the performance of each of these top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin . The key question: has an altcoin outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days? Threshold for Altcoin Season: To officially declare an ‘ Altcoin Season ‘, a significant majority – at least 75% – of these top 100 coins need to have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day period. Bitcoin Season Defined: Conversely, a ‘ Bitcoin Season ‘ emerges when 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins have managed to beat Bitcoin’s performance. Index Score: The Altcoin Season Index itself is scored from 1 to 100, giving a nuanced view of the market’s leanings. Currently, the index stands at 44, as of 00:32 UTC on Feb. 14, a slight nudge up from 43 the day before. This number, below the 75 threshold, confirms that we are indeed in a Bitcoin Season . Why Does Bitcoin Season Matter to the Crypto Market? Understanding whether we’re in a Bitcoin Season or an Altcoin Season is crucial because it provides insights into market sentiment, investment flows, and potential opportunities. Here’s why it’s a metric you should pay attention to: Market Dominance: Bitcoin Season often signifies a period where Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market increases. Investors tend to flock towards the perceived safety and established track record of Bitcoin , especially during times of uncertainty or market correction. Capital Rotation: When Bitcoin is outperforming altcoins , capital often rotates from riskier altcoin investments back into Bitcoin . This can lead to altcoin prices stagnating or even declining while Bitcoin experiences gains. Investment Strategy Adjustment: Recognizing a Bitcoin Season can help you adjust your investment strategy. It might be a time to consolidate holdings into Bitcoin , take profits from altcoins , or strategically re-evaluate your portfolio’s risk profile. Identifying Potential Altcoin Opportunities: While a Bitcoin Season suggests Bitcoin’s current strength, it doesn’t mean altcoins are completely out of the picture. Savvy investors might use this period to research and identify undervalued altcoins with strong fundamentals that could potentially outperform when the market shifts. Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: Spotting the Difference Let’s clearly differentiate between these two market phases: Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Altcoin Season Index Value Below 75 75 or above Market Leadership Bitcoin Altcoins Investor Sentiment Risk-off, flight to safety (Bitcoin) Risk-on, appetite for higher returns (Altcoins) Capital Flow From altcoins to Bitcoin From Bitcoin to altcoins Dominance Trend Bitcoin dominance increases Bitcoin dominance decreases Potential Strategy Focus on Bitcoin, selective altcoin accumulation Explore altcoin opportunities, diversify Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights So, what should you do now that the Altcoin Season Index is pointing towards a Bitcoin Season ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current crypto holdings. What percentage is allocated to Bitcoin versus altcoins ? Does it align with your risk tolerance in a Bitcoin Season ? Bitcoin Focus: Consider increasing your exposure to Bitcoin , especially if you are risk-averse or believe in Bitcoin’s long-term dominance. Selective Altcoin Research: Don’t completely ignore altcoins . Use this time to research fundamentally strong projects that might be temporarily undervalued during the Bitcoin Season . Look for altcoins with strong use cases, active development, and growing communities. Risk Management: Be mindful of increased volatility that can sometimes accompany market shifts. Implement proper risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders and diversifying across different asset classes. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. Market conditions can change rapidly in the crypto world. The Dynamic Dance of Crypto Seasons The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for understanding the ebb and flow of the crypto market . It reminds us that the market is not static; it moves in cycles, shifting between periods where Bitcoin leads and times when altcoins take center stage. Currently, the index at 44 is clearly signaling a Bitcoin Season , prompting a strategic reassessment for many crypto participants. By understanding the nuances of Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season , and by utilizing tools like the Altcoin Season Index , you can navigate the crypto market with greater clarity and make more informed decisions.

Notably, market experts ‘Ali Martinez’ and ‘Bluntz’ have recently predicted that the dog-themed meme coin awaits a massive price breakout in the coming days. These bullish projections are primarily attributed to technical patterns on the price chart. Top Analysts Predict Floki Price Breakout Looms Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez has conveyed in an X post on February 15 that Floki price looks ready for a rebound, although the key target remains $0.000042. This statement, hinting that price gains for the meme coin await, echoed a market buzz primarily mirroring optimism amid a bullish crypto landscape as the week closes. Although the $0.000042 level is marked as a key support, the token currently trades considerably above this level. Source: Ali Charts, X Further, renowned market expert Bluntz took to X, spotlighting a couple of strong technicals for the meme token. The analyst reveals that the asset’s price chart shows a ‘nice ascending triangle’ pattern, indicating that buyers are pushing to cross the current resistance. Given this resistance is breached, the meme coin could see remarkable price gains ahead. Source: Bluntz, X Also, the ascending triangle formation follows a bullish divergence setup that flags the potential for further upside action, per the analyst. Overall, these optimistic Floki predictions promptly gained significant traction as the broader crypto market showed potential for further gains. Crypto Market Reflects Recovery Sentiment It’s worth taking into account the broader crypto prices upswing on Saturday despite the macroeconomic heat. While Bitcoin held around $98K, meme coins embarked on a significant rising action. DOGE pumped over 4% to the $0.27 level, whereas SHIB and PEPE also traded dominantly in the green. In turn, even Floki saw an upside action, further garnering investor enthusiasm amid the bullish predictions. FLOKI Price Action Today At the time of reporting, FLOKI token’s price gained roughly 2% and is currently trading at $0.00009871. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00009702 and $0.0001046, respectively. Trading volume for the asset jumped 23.17% to $163.1 million, aligning with the rising intraday movement. Further, even the coin’s futures OI jumped 2% to $17.44 million, per Coinglass data. Also, the derivatives volume surged nearly 19% to $26.92 million. Altogether, the derivatives market data indicated a heightened investor appetite for the asset. This has added to optimistic market sentiments surrounding the token’s future price movements, in line with the abovementioned predictions.

Analysts predict further gains, with targets ranging from $2.94 to $3.03 if the price maintains momentum above key support levels. The Rally Goes on Ripple’s XRP has been at the forefront of gains in the past few days, outperforming most cryptocurrencies from the top 20 club. Its price charted another 8% increase on a 24-hour scale, briefly rising to a two-week high of $2.82 (per CoinGecko’s data) before slightly retracing to the current $2.76. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko The US SEC’s decision to acknowledge 21Shares’ application to convert its XRP Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is the most likely factor fueling the pump. E arlier this month, the securities regulator acknowledged a similar proposal filed by the world’s biggest digital asset manager – Grayscale. The aforementioned developments mean the SEC has officially received the applications and started a formal review process, which usually lasts up to 240 days. In the end , the watchdog must either approve or deny the ETF filings. A potential green light would give investors additional options to gain exposure to XRP’s price movements, providing a level of protection and oversight. It also removes the burden of having to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency directly. Meanwhile, a possible approval could also indicate that the SEC has embraced an entirely different approach toward the digital asset industry. Recall that the agency was not that friendly during Gary Gensler’s tenure, filing countless lawsuits against crypto businesses such as Ripple. The former Chairman resigned on January 20 and was succeeded by Mark Uyeda, who seems much more open to innovation and positive toward the cryptocurrency industry. XRP’s Next Potential Targets According to multiple market observers, the asset’s price has much more room for growth. The X user CRYPTOWZRD noted that XRP closed the previous day “strongly bullish,” expecting a further uptrend toward the $3.03 resistance target and beyond. Others who recently contributed include Ali Martinez and EGRAG CRYPTO. The former predicted a rise to $3 as long as the price held steady above $2.30. The latter suggested that “a strong close” above $2.75 could result in a local high of $2.94. “Remember, anything below $3.40 is merely noise in the market,” the analyst added.

Are you curious to understand what this means for the future of Bitcoin and your investments? Recent reports highlight a compelling trend: long-term holders are spending less of their Bitcoin at a loss, suggesting a growing confidence and resilience within this crucial investor segment. Let’s dive into the details and explore what this could signify for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Decoding the Decrease in Bitcoin Loss Spending According to a recent Bitcoin News report, citing on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, there’s been a notable 31% decrease in loss spending by Bitcoin long-term holders . This figure represents a drop from approximately 5,500 BTC in early February to 3,800 BTC. But what exactly does ‘loss spending’ mean, and why is this decrease significant? Loss spending occurs when investors sell their Bitcoin for a price lower than their purchase price. A reduction in this activity suggests that long-term holders, who are often considered the ‘smart money’ of the Bitcoin ecosystem, are becoming less inclined to sell at a loss. Here’s a simple breakdown to understand the numbers: Period Bitcoin Loss Spending (BTC) Early February 5,500 Recent Data 3,800 Decrease 31% This 31% reduction is not just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of shifting sentiment and potentially stronger market conditions. It implies that long-term investors are holding onto their Bitcoin with greater conviction, even amidst market fluctuations. But why is the behavior of Bitcoin long-term holders so closely watched? Why Bitcoin Long-Term Holders are Key Market Barometers Bitcoin long-term holders are often viewed as the bedrock of the Bitcoin market. These are investors who have held their Bitcoin for a significant period, typically more than 155 days, and are less likely to be swayed by short-term price volatility. Their actions can provide valuable insights into the overall health and future direction of the market. Here’s why their behavior is so crucial: Stronger Hands: Long-term holders are considered ‘stronger hands’ because they tend to have a higher conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. They are less prone to panic selling during market downturns. Market Stability: Their reluctance to sell at a loss can contribute to market stability. Reduced selling pressure can help prevent significant price drops and foster a more bullish environment. Confidence Indicator: A decrease in loss spending among long-term holders can be interpreted as a sign of growing confidence in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation. They are essentially signaling that they believe prices will rise again, making current prices attractive for holding rather than selling. Considering these points, the 31% drop in loss spending is not just a minor statistic; it’s a potentially significant signal from a segment of the market known for its strategic, long-term perspective. But how does this trend affect the broader Bitcoin market sentiment ? Positive Shifts in Bitcoin Market Sentiment The reduction in loss spending by long-term holders can contribute to a more positive Bitcoin market sentiment . Market sentiment refers to the overall attitude or feeling of investors towards a particular asset. It’s a crucial factor influencing price movements and investment decisions. When long-term holders reduce loss spending, it can signal several positive shifts in market sentiment: Reduced Fear of Further Downturn: Less loss spending suggests that long-term holders are less fearful of further price declines. This can reassure other investors and reduce overall market anxiety. Increased Confidence in Recovery: It indicates a growing belief in Bitcoin’s ability to recover and appreciate in value. This optimism can attract new investors and encourage existing ones to hold or even increase their positions. Potential for Bullish Momentum: When selling pressure from long-term holders decreases, it creates more room for bullish momentum. With less supply being sold at a loss, any increase in buying demand can have a more pronounced positive impact on price. In essence, the actions of long-term holders can act as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Their confidence can breed broader market confidence, potentially leading to more favorable market conditions. Is this decreased loss spending a precursor to a phase of Bitcoin accumulation ? Is Bitcoin Accumulation on the Horizon? The decrease in loss spending could indeed be an early indicator of a potential Bitcoin accumulation phase. Accumulation is a period where investors, particularly long-term holders and institutions, strategically increase their Bitcoin holdings. This phase typically occurs when investors believe that Bitcoin is undervalued and poised for future growth. Here’s how reduced loss spending ties into accumulation: Sign of Bottoming Out: Reduced loss spending can suggest that the market might be approaching a bottom. Long-term holders are less likely to sell at a loss if they believe the price is near its lowest point. Strategic Buying Opportunities: As long-term holders become less willing to sell at lower prices, it can create strategic buying opportunities for those looking to accumulate Bitcoin before a potential price uptrend. Supply Squeeze Potential: If accumulation increases while long-term holders are reducing selling, it can lead to a supply squeeze. This happens when the available supply of Bitcoin decreases relative to demand, potentially driving prices higher. While it’s still early to definitively declare an accumulation phase, the reduced loss spending provides a compelling piece of evidence suggesting that long-term holders are positioning themselves for future gains. How does this shift in behavior reflect on the broader Bitcoin investor behavior ? Evolving Bitcoin Investor Behavior The 31% decrease in loss spending reflects an evolving Bitcoin investor behavior , particularly among long-term holders. It underscores a maturation of the market and a shift towards more strategic, less reactive investment approaches. Key aspects of this evolving behavior include: Increased Holding Mentality: Long-term holders are demonstrating a stronger ‘hodling’ mentality, a term in the crypto community for holding onto assets despite volatility. This suggests increased faith in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Strategic Decision-Making: The reduced loss spending indicates more strategic decision-making. Long-term holders are likely analyzing market indicators and making informed choices rather than reacting emotionally to short-term price swings. Potential Shift from Speculation to Investment: This trend might signify a broader shift in the Bitcoin market, moving away from purely speculative trading towards more long-term investment strategies. As Bitcoin gains more mainstream acceptance and institutional interest, this trend is likely to strengthen. Ultimately, the decreased loss spending by long-term Bitcoin holders paints a picture of growing confidence and strategic positioning within the market. It’s a signal that resonates beyond just the numbers, hinting at a more robust and resilient Bitcoin ecosystem. Conclusion: A Reassuring Signal for Bitcoin’s Future The 31% decrease in loss spending among Bitcoin long-term holders is more than just a data point; it’s a reassuring signal of underlying strength and growing confidence in the Bitcoin market. This trend suggests that long-term investors are increasingly convinced of Bitcoin’s long-term value, reducing selling pressure and potentially paving the way for a more bullish future. As Bitcoin market sentiment improves and the potential for Bitcoin accumulation grows, the evolving Bitcoin investor behavior of long-term holders offers a compelling narrative of resilience and strategic foresight. This development warrants close attention as it could be a key indicator of Bitcoin’s next major market phase.

The two shared pictures of the meeting, which took place at the El Salvador Presidential Palace on X. While details of the meeting were not made public, Saylor said that the discussion focused on how El Salvador could benefit from Bitcoin adoption. He said: “Yesterday, @NayibBukele and I had a great discussion about the opportunities for El Salvador🇸🇻 to benefit from and accelerate global Bitcoin adoption.” Bukele responded by saying : “Alexa, summon the orchestra.” Many people have taken this as positive news of a potential partnership between Strategy and El Salvador. Multiple speculations are now being made about what the agreement could be. Bukele and Saylor are heavily pro-Bitcoin and believe in making Bitcoin a reserve asset. Under Bukele’s leadership, El Salvador became the country with the largest Bitcoin reserve, and Saylor led Strategy to become the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Some speculate that MicroStrategy could move its headquarters to El Salvador, noting that another major crypto company, Tether, has already made a similar move. However, that is highly unlikely, given that MicroStrategy already has its headquarters in the US, where the regulatory environment is starting to change for the better.

Source: X El Salvador reiterates Bitcoin commitment Meanwhile, Bukele’s meeting with Saylor reiterates El Salvador’s commitment to Bitcoin. Although the Central American country became the first to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021, there have been concerns about whether it prioritizes its pro-Bitcoin policies. This followed its recent decision to reverse Bitcoin status as a legal tender as part of the terms of a $1.4B loan agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While the decision raised some eyebrows in the Bitcoin community, many believe it does not change its pro-Bitcoin stance. That view appears to be true so far, with the country continuing with one Bitcoin per day strategy. It recently acquired its latest Bitcoin, taking its holdings to 6,078 BTC worth over $597 million. This accounts for around 15% of the country’s national reserve. Strategy increases BTC holdings to over 478k BTC Compared to El Salvador, Strategy has been more bullish in its acquisition strategy. It announced its latest purchase a few days ago, buying 7,633 BTC for over $740 million. Its total bitcoin holdings are now 478,740 BTC, worth $46 billion, with the cost of acquisition being $31.1 billion. The company is not just sitting on over $14 billion in unrealized profits; it also continues to generate gains on its BTC holdings. Saylor said on February 11 that Strategy treasury operations had generated 18,527 BTC worth $1.8 billion for shareholders this year. Strategy Bitcoin Yield (Source – Michael Saylor) This perhaps explains why it changed its name to Strategy to reflect its full focus on Bitcoin. MicroStrategy was initially a business intelligence software company before pivoting to BTC in 2020. The success of its strategy has led others, such as Kulr Technolgy, Semlar Scientific, and Metaplanet, to copy its approach. Meanwhile, Strategy’s recent acquisitions and Saylor’s meeting with Bukele have done nothing to lift the BTC’s price. The flagship asset, which has been below $100,000 since February 4, remains stuck in the $90,000 range. This is likely due to several factors, including the recent rise in inflation rate and the tariff wars that continue to play out between the US and other countries.

News just broke that State Street, a titan of traditional finance, is poised to dive deeper into the crypto realm. According to a recent report from Tree News on X, the financial behemoth is gearing up to launch its own digital asset custody services by 2026. This isn’t just another ripple in the crypto pond; it could be a seismic wave, signaling a massive influx of institutional capital into the cryptocurrency market. Let’s unpack what this exciting development means for the future of finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. What is Digital Asset Custody and Why is State Street’s Entry a Big Deal? First, for those new to the crypto space, let’s clarify what digital asset custody actually entails. In simple terms, it’s the secure storage and management of digital assets, like cryptocurrencies, on behalf of clients. Think of it like a bank vault for your Bitcoin or Ethereum, but specifically designed for the unique challenges and security needs of digital currencies. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies require specialized security measures due to their digital nature and reliance on cryptographic keys. Why is State Street, a giant in traditional finance , entering this space significant? Well, State Street isn’t just any financial institution. We are talking about one of the world’s leading providers of financial services to institutional investors. Their involvement lends immense credibility and legitimacy to the digital asset market. Here’s why their foray into crypto custody is making waves: Institutional Trust and Confidence: State Street’s reputation for security, regulatory compliance, and robust infrastructure can alleviate concerns for institutions hesitant about entering the crypto market due to custody risks. Market Maturity: The entry of established players like State Street signals a maturing crypto market, moving beyond early adopters and attracting serious institutional capital. Increased Adoption: By offering secure and regulated custody solutions, State Street can pave the way for wider institutional crypto adoption , as it removes a significant barrier to entry for large investors. Competitive Landscape: State Street’s move will likely intensify competition in the digital asset custody space, potentially driving innovation and better services for clients. Feature Traditional Asset Custody Digital Asset Custody Assets Handled Stocks, bonds, cash, physical commodities Cryptocurrencies, security tokens, NFTs, other digital assets Security Measures Physical vaults, paper trails, established legal frameworks Cryptography, cold storage, multi-signature wallets, blockchain security protocols Regulatory Landscape Well-established and mature Evolving and varies across jurisdictions Technology Focus Primarily traditional IT infrastructure Heavy reliance on blockchain and cryptographic technologies As you can see, digital asset custody is a specialized field, and State Street’s decision to enter it underscores the growing importance and institutional demand for secure crypto solutions. Why 2026? Decoding the Timeline for State Street’s Crypto Custody Launch The announcement that State Street is targeting 2026 for its digital asset custody rollout raises an important question: Why such a timeline? Two years might seem like a long wait in the fast-paced world of crypto, but for a financial giant like State Street, this timeframe is likely strategic and well-considered. Here are some potential factors influencing the 2026 target: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally. By 2026, there’s an expectation of greater clarity and harmonization in regulations, which is crucial for a regulated institution like State Street. They need a stable and predictable regulatory environment to operate confidently. Technological Infrastructure: Building a robust and secure crypto custody platform is not an overnight task. It requires significant investment in technology, talent, and security protocols. Two years allows State Street to develop and rigorously test a platform that meets their stringent security and operational standards. Market Demand and Maturity: While institutional crypto adoption is growing, State Street might be anticipating further market maturation by 2026. This timeline allows them to align their launch with a potentially larger and more receptive institutional market for digital assets. Integration with Existing Systems: Integrating digital asset custody services with State Street’s existing vast infrastructure and client base is a complex undertaking. The 2026 timeframe likely accounts for the necessary integration work to ensure seamless service delivery. While the wait until 2026 might feel long for eager crypto enthusiasts, it suggests a thoughtful and strategic approach by State Street, aimed at a sustainable and impactful entry into the digital asset space. The Broader Impact: How State Street’s Move Fuels Institutional Crypto Adoption State Street’s decision to offer digital asset custody services is more than just company news; it’s a significant indicator of the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption . For years, many institutional investors have been on the sidelines of the crypto market, citing concerns around volatility, regulation, and crucially, custody solutions. State Street’s entry addresses the custody concern head-on and can act as a catalyst for further institutional involvement. Consider these potential ripple effects: Validation of Crypto as an Asset Class: When a financial institution of State Street’s stature embraces digital assets, it sends a powerful message that cryptocurrencies are not just a fringe phenomenon but a legitimate and increasingly important asset class. Opening Doors for Pension Funds and Endowments: Many large institutional investors like pension funds and university endowments have mandates that require secure and regulated custody solutions. State Street’s offering can open the door for these massive pools of capital to allocate to digital assets. Increased Market Liquidity: As more institutions enter the crypto market, it will likely lead to increased liquidity and trading volumes, potentially reducing volatility and making the market more attractive to a wider range of investors. Innovation in Financial Products: With robust digital asset custody in place, we can expect to see further innovation in financial products linked to cryptocurrencies, such as ETFs, derivatives, and structured products, catering to institutional needs. Institutional crypto adoption is not just about price speculation; it’s about integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. State Street’s move is a powerful step in this direction, promising a more mature and institutionalized crypto market in the years to come. Challenges and Opportunities: Navigating the Road Ahead for State Street While State Street’s entry into digital asset custody is undoubtedly a positive development, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Navigating the nascent and evolving crypto landscape is not without its hurdles: Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite anticipated progress, the regulatory landscape for digital assets may still be complex and fragmented in 2026. State Street will need to navigate diverse and potentially conflicting regulations across jurisdictions. Cybersecurity Threats: Crypto custody is a prime target for cyberattacks. State Street must invest heavily in cutting-edge cybersecurity measures to protect client assets from theft and hacking attempts. Technological Complexity: The technology underlying digital assets is constantly evolving. State Street needs to stay ahead of the curve and adapt its platform to new technologies and security protocols. Client Education: Many traditional finance institutions are still learning about digital assets. State Street will need to educate its clients and provide them with the necessary support and understanding to utilize their crypto custody services effectively. Opportunities: First-Mover Advantage: While not the very first, State Street is among the first major traditional finance institutions to offer comprehensive digital asset custody . This early entry can give them a significant competitive advantage in a rapidly growing market. Expanding Client Base: Digital asset custody services can attract a new segment of institutional clients to State Street, including crypto-native funds and companies looking to diversify their treasury holdings. Innovation and Revenue Streams: Beyond custody, State Street can leverage its digital asset platform to offer a range of related services, such as staking, lending, and prime brokerage, creating new revenue streams in the digital asset ecosystem. Shaping the Future of Finance: By actively participating in the institutional crypto adoption wave, State Street has the opportunity to shape the future of finance and play a leading role in the integration of digital assets into the global financial system. Looking Towards the Future: What Does State Street’s Entry Mean for You? Whether you are a seasoned crypto investor or just starting to explore the world of digital assets, State Street’s entry into digital asset custody has implications for you. It signals a broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system. Here’s what you can expect: Increased Legitimacy and Confidence in Crypto: The involvement of established institutions like State Street can boost overall confidence in the crypto market, potentially attracting more investors, both retail and institutional. Greater Stability and Maturity of the Crypto Market: Institutional crypto adoption can contribute to a more stable and mature crypto market, reducing volatility and fostering long-term growth. More Sophisticated Crypto Investment Products: As institutions become more involved, we can expect to see a wider range of sophisticated and regulated crypto investment products becoming available to both institutional and potentially retail investors. Evolution of the Financial Landscape: The lines between traditional finance and the digital asset world are blurring. State Street’s move is a testament to this evolution, suggesting a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the global financial infrastructure. Conclusion: A Transformative Step Towards Mainstream Crypto State Street’s planned launch of digital asset custody services in 2026 is not just a news item; it’s a powerful signal of the ongoing transformation of the financial landscape. This move by a traditional finance giant underscores the growing importance and inevitability of institutional crypto adoption . While challenges remain, the opportunities are immense, and State Street’s foray into crypto custody paves the way for a more mature, stable, and institutionally driven digital asset market. As we look towards 2026 and beyond, expect to see further integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system, with institutions like State Street playing a pivotal role in shaping this exciting future. This is a seismic shift, and the tremors are just beginning to be felt.

40351985,https://coingape.com/?p=239094,1739609504,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Why Is XRP Price Skyrocketing So Fast In The Last 24 Hours?,https://coingape.com/why-is-xrp-price-skyrocketing-so-fast-in-the-last-24-hours/,"XRP price has continued to stay on the investors’ radar since yesterday, as evidenced by the recent surge in its price. During writing, Ripple’s native asset was up about 8% after consolidating between the $2.3 and $2.5 range over the past few weeks. However, the recent surge has left many speculating over the reasons that might have contributed to the recent gains in it. So, let’s explore some of the key catalysts that may have bolstered the market catalysts. Why Is XRP Price Rising? XRP price delivered 8% gains from yesterday and soared to $2.78, with its trading volume rocketing 63% to $8.79 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a high of $2.83 from a low of $2.58 in just over the last 24 hours, indicating strong market confidence. XRP Price Notably, CoinGlass data showed that XRP Futures Open Interest rose 10%, signaling a strong momentum ahead for the crypto. Besides, the Relative Strength Index of 55 also indicates a buying pressure in the market. Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, the recent surge in XRP price could be attributed to a flurry of reasons including the broader market sentiment, regulatory shift, and others. Let’s take a tour of the key reasons that might have helped gains in crypto and see how it may perform in the near future. XRP ETF Gains Momentum: SEC Approval Soon? Donald Trump’s election win has fueled market sentiment while raising hopes for a pro-crypto regulatory environment in the nation. This is also evident from the recent moves of the US SEC, especially with the formation of the crypto task force. Amid this, speculations are soaring over a potential XRP ETF approval in the US soon. For context, the US SEC has recently acknowledged XRP ETF filings from 21Shares , sparking market discussions. Besides, it also follows a similar move, the SEC acknowledging Grayscale’s Dogecoin and XRP ETF filings earlier this week. This reflects a regulatory shift in the US, especially from what it was under Gary Gensler. Besides, it also fueled market sentiment, with many seeing these advancements as a key step for a likely XRP ETF approval in the US. Meanwhile, if approved, it could significantly boost the crypto’s appeal to investors, while fueling its adoption. Having said that, it appears that these recent developments have acted as major catalysts for boosting the XRP price today. US Reserve Speculation Fuels Market Sentiment The US appears to be considering a Crypto Strategic Reserve instead of its prior commitment to a reserve asset based on only Bitcoin. While these rumors have weighed on the BTC maximalists, it has fueled speculations over a potential XRP Reserve in the US. While there is no confirmation, Donald Trump’s collaboration with Ripple has led many to believe that the US administration might consider Ripple’s native asset for the Reserve asset. In addition, rumors over CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s appointment to Trump’s crypto advisory board have further sparked market discussions. Notably, a renowned lawyer in the XRP community has also said that the crypto must hit $5 to qualify for the US Reserve asset, which has further bolstered market sentiment. Ripple Vs SEC Lawsuit Conclusion: What To Expect? The latest XRP price surge could be also due to the soaring discussions over the Ripple Vs SEC case. According to recent market developments, the US SEC might drop or dismiss the long-running legal battle soon. Notably, legal expert Jeremy Hogan recently said that the Ripple lawsuit might conclude even before the XRP ETF approval, which has further sparked market interest. Simultaneously, the US SEC’s recent stance on the crypto cases has bolstered market confidence. Recently, the US SEC has asked for a 28-day extension period in the Coinbase lawsuit . In a recent filing, the SEC requested this extension while mentioning that the newly formed crypto task force might help in resolving the legal battle. This also led many to speculate a dismissal or settlement in the ongoing XRP lawsuit soon. Besides, top lawyers also hinted that the US SEC might be delaying the cases before it is waiting for the new US SEC chair, likely Paul Atkins, to join. According to the experts, the US SEC might start dropping the crypto cases once Atkins takes the Chair within the first half of the year. What’s Next For XRP Price? The recent surge in XRP price has left many questioning about the future of the coin. Notably, in a recent analysis, a top market expert Dark Defender shared a bullish forecast for Ripple’s native asset, predicting a surge to $5.85. As XRP nears the $2.80 level, Defender expects it to break the $2.90 barrier and proceed to the critical Fibonacci level of $5.85. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a Golden Cross, indicating a bullish trend. The expert has set short-term targets at $2.90, $5.85, and $8.03, with support levels at $2.44 and $2.33. Source: Dark Defender, X Simultaneously, in a recent analysis, another expert EGRAG CRYPTO said that if the crypto records a strong close above $2.75, the next target will be at $2.94. Once these levels are breached, the asset will proceed towards the $3.22 and $3.40 mark. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Echoing a similar sentiment, renowned analyst Ali Martinez said that if XRP price holds above the $2.3 mark, it could eventually hit the $3 mark. Considering these analyses and predictions, it appears that the crypto is likely to hit the $3 mark soon with its long-term target at $8.

40352065,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129106,1739609608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Move: Citigroup Eyes Crypto Custody Services – A New Era for Digital Assets?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/citigroup-exploring-crypto-custody/,"Exciting news is brewing in the crypto world! Imagine one of the world’s leading financial giants stepping further into the digital asset space. Well, it seems like it’s happening! Reports suggest that Citigroup, a household name in global finance, is seriously considering adding cryptocurrency custody services to its portfolio. This is HUGE news, folks, and it signals a potential seismic shift in how institutional players engage with crypto. Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of digital assets and the broader financial landscape. Why is Citigroup Exploring Crypto Custody Services? The move by Citigroup to explore crypto custody services isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors are likely at play, reflecting the increasing maturity and institutional interest in the cryptocurrency market. Here’s a breakdown: Growing Institutional Demand: Large institutional investors, including hedge funds, asset managers, and even corporations, are showing an increasing appetite for cryptocurrencies. However, these institutions require robust and secure custody solutions to manage their digital assets. They can’t just store their Bitcoin on a USB drive! They need institutional-grade security and compliance. Market Evolution and Maturation: The cryptocurrency market is no longer the Wild West it once was. Regulations are becoming clearer (albeit still evolving), and the infrastructure is maturing. This makes it more palatable for traditional financial institutions like Citigroup to enter the space. Competitive Pressure: Other major financial institutions are already dipping their toes, or in some cases, diving headfirst into the crypto space. Fidelity, for example, already offers crypto custody. Banks don’t want to be left behind as this market develops further. Revenue Opportunities: Custody services, especially for large institutions, can be a lucrative business. Citigroup, always looking for growth opportunities, likely sees a significant revenue stream in providing secure crypto custody for its clients. What Exactly are Crypto Custody Services? For those new to the term, crypto custody refers to the secure storage and management of digital assets on behalf of clients. Think of it like a bank vault, but for cryptocurrencies. It’s far more complex than simply holding private keys. Here’s what it typically involves: Secure Storage of Private Keys: The core of custody is keeping the private keys – which control access to the cryptocurrencies – safe from theft, loss, or unauthorized access. This often involves cold storage (offline) and sophisticated security protocols. Transaction Management: Custodians facilitate the secure execution of transactions on behalf of their clients, ensuring proper authorization and recording. Regulatory Compliance: Custody services for institutions must adhere to strict regulatory requirements, including KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations. Reporting and Auditing: Institutions need clear reporting and auditing trails for their digital asset holdings, which custodians provide. Insurance: Reputable custodians often provide insurance to protect against loss of assets due to theft or other unforeseen events. In essence, crypto custody bridges the gap between the complex world of cryptocurrencies and the risk-averse, compliance-focused environment of traditional finance. The Benefits of Citigroup Offering Crypto Custody Citigroup venturing into crypto custody services could bring a wave of positive impacts, not just for the bank itself, but for the entire crypto ecosystem. Let’s explore some key benefits: Increased Institutional Adoption: The entry of a major player like Citigroup can significantly boost institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. It provides a trusted and regulated avenue for institutions to participate in the digital asset market, reducing perceived risk and complexity. Enhanced Market Legitimacy: When established financial institutions embrace crypto, it further legitimizes the asset class in the eyes of the broader public and regulatory bodies. This can lead to increased confidence and investment in the crypto space. Improved Security and Trust: Citigroup brings decades of experience in secure asset management. Their involvement in crypto custody can raise the bar for security standards and build greater trust in the safety of digital assets. Greater Market Liquidity: As more institutions gain secure access to cryptocurrencies through custody services, it can inject more liquidity into the market, potentially leading to more stable and efficient trading. Innovation and Service Development: Competition among custody providers, spurred by Citigroup’s entry, can drive innovation in custody solutions and related services, benefiting the entire crypto ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations for Citigroup While the potential benefits are substantial, Citigroup will also face challenges and considerations as they move into crypto custody : Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Citigroup will need to navigate complex and potentially inconsistent regulations across different jurisdictions. Security Risks: Despite advancements in security, digital assets remain a target for cyberattacks. Citigroup will need to invest heavily in cutting-edge security infrastructure and protocols to protect client assets. Operational Complexity: Custodying cryptocurrencies is operationally different from traditional assets. Citigroup will need to build new systems, processes, and expertise to handle the unique aspects of digital asset management. Integration with Existing Systems: Integrating crypto custody services with Citigroup’s existing banking infrastructure and client services will be a complex undertaking. Client Education and Support: Many institutional clients are still relatively new to cryptocurrencies. Citigroup will need to provide education and support to help clients understand and utilize these services effectively. The Future of Institutional Crypto Adoption Citigroup’s potential foray into crypto custody is a powerful indicator of the direction the financial world is heading. It suggests that institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is not just a trend, but a fundamental shift. As more traditional financial giants like Citigroup embrace digital assets, we can expect to see: Trend Impact Increased Institutional Investment Larger capital inflows into the crypto market, potentially driving price appreciation and market growth. More Sophisticated Crypto Products Development of more complex and institutional-grade crypto financial products, such as derivatives and structured products. Greater Regulatory Clarity Increased pressure on regulators to provide clearer and more consistent rules for digital assets. Mainstream Integration of Crypto Cryptocurrencies becoming more integrated into mainstream financial systems and investment portfolios. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should you take away from this news? Here are some actionable insights: For Crypto Investors: This news is bullish. It signals growing institutional confidence in crypto, which could lead to further price appreciation over the long term. Consider this as another validation point for your crypto investments. For Institutional Investors: If you’ve been on the fence about crypto, Citigroup’s potential move strengthens the case for exploring digital asset allocation. Reliable custody solutions are becoming more readily available. For the Crypto Industry: This is a call to action to continue building robust, secure, and compliant infrastructure to support institutional adoption . Focus on developing solutions that meet the needs of large financial players. For Regulators: The increasing involvement of major institutions underscores the urgency for clear and pragmatic regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Collaboration with the industry is crucial. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Crypto? Citigroup considering crypto custody services is more than just a headline; it’s a potential watershed moment. It reflects the unstoppable march of digital assets into the mainstream financial world. While challenges remain, the direction is clear: institutional adoption is accelerating, and established players like Citigroup are recognizing the immense potential of cryptocurrencies. This could very well be the beginning of a new era for digital finance, one where crypto is not just a niche asset class, but an integral part of the global financial system. The future of finance is being written, and it’s looking increasingly digital.

40352163,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129108,1739609871,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BREAKING: Wisconsin Pension Fund Jumps into Bitcoin ETF with Colossal $321.5M Bet – A Groundbreaking Move?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wisconsin-pension-fund-bitcoin-etf/,"Hold on to your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The world of digital assets just witnessed a seismic shift. In a stunning development that’s sending ripples across the financial landscape, the Wisconsin Investment Board, managing billions in public funds, has boldly announced a massive $321.5 million stake in the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). Yes, you read that right – a major state investment board is now directly exposed to Bitcoin through a spot ETF! This news, initially unfolded by Unfolded on X (formerly Twitter), isn’t just another headline; it’s a powerful signal of mainstream acceptance and the accelerating institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Why is the Wisconsin Investment Board’s Bitcoin ETF Investment a Big Deal? This isn’t your average crypto headline. The Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) manages the assets of the Wisconsin Retirement System, the State Investment Fund, and other state trust funds. We’re talking about safeguarding the financial future of public sector employees in Wisconsin. Their decision to allocate a significant chunk of capital to a Bitcoin ETF speaks volumes about the evolving perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Let’s break down why this move is so monumental: Institutional Validation: SWIB’s investment is a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin from a traditional financial institution. It signifies that sophisticated investors are increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin’s risk-reward profile and see it as a valuable portfolio diversifier. This is a far cry from the days when Bitcoin was dismissed as a fringe asset. Size Matters: $321.5 million is not a trivial amount. This substantial allocation demonstrates serious conviction and commitment, not just a toe-in-the-water approach. It’s a clear indicator that institutional investors are ready to deploy significant capital into the Bitcoin ETF market. Precedent Setting: Wisconsin’s move could pave the way for other public pension funds and institutional investors to follow suit. Pension funds often move cautiously, but once a reputable entity like SWIB makes a move, it can reduce perceived risk for others. This could trigger a domino effect, leading to even greater institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin. Market Impact: Such large investments inject significant liquidity into the Bitcoin market, potentially driving up demand and price. While the immediate price impact might be factored in, the long-term effect of increased institutional participation is overwhelmingly positive for Bitcoin’s price stability and growth. Navigating the World of Crypto Investment: What are Bitcoin ETFs and Why are They Popular? For those new to the crypto space, Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Think of it like investing in gold through a gold ETF – you own shares representing Bitcoin, but you don’t have to worry about private keys, crypto wallets, or exchanges. Their popularity stems from several key advantages: Benefit Description Accessibility Bitcoin ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to retail and institutional investors through brokerage accounts they already use. Regulation & Security ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a level of security and investor protection that is often lacking in the direct cryptocurrency market. Custody of the underlying Bitcoin is handled by reputable institutions. Tax Efficiency (Potentially) Depending on the jurisdiction and individual circumstances, investing through an ETF can sometimes offer tax advantages compared to direct Bitcoin ownership. Diversification Bitcoin ETFs allow for easy portfolio diversification into crypto assets without the complexities of direct crypto management. Institutional Investment in Bitcoin: A Turning Point? The Wisconsin Investment Board’s foray into Bitcoin ETFs is not happening in a vacuum. It’s part of a larger trend of increasing institutional interest in digital assets. Several factors are driving this shift: Maturity of the Market: The cryptocurrency market, while still volatile, is maturing. Infrastructure is improving, regulatory frameworks are becoming clearer (albeit slowly), and established financial institutions are entering the space. Inflation Hedge Narrative: In an era of rising inflation, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Institutional investors are seeking alternative assets to preserve and grow capital. Client Demand: Many institutional investors are responding to growing client demand for exposure to digital assets. High-net-worth individuals and even some retail investors are pushing for crypto options in their portfolios. Performance: Bitcoin’s historical performance, despite its volatility, has been compelling. Institutions cannot ignore the potential returns offered by this emerging asset class. Challenges and Considerations for Institutional Bitcoin ETF Adoption While the Wisconsin news is undeniably positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge that institutional Bitcoin ETF adoption is still in its early stages and faces certain challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Institutional investors, particularly those managing public funds, must carefully consider risk management and portfolio allocation strategies to mitigate potential downside. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Uncertainty can create hesitancy and require careful navigation by institutional investors. Fiduciary Duty: Pension funds and other fiduciaries have a responsibility to act in the best interests of their beneficiaries. Investing in a relatively new and volatile asset class like Bitcoin requires thorough due diligence and a well-defined investment thesis. Education and Expertise: Understanding the nuances of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is crucial. Institutions need to build internal expertise or partner with specialists to effectively manage crypto investments. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The Wisconsin Investment Board’s investment in a Bitcoin ETF offers several key takeaways for both individual and institutional investors: Validation for Crypto: This move reinforces the legitimacy of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market as an investable asset class. It’s a sign that crypto is moving further into the mainstream financial system. Consider Bitcoin ETFs: If you’ve been hesitant about directly buying Bitcoin, ETFs offer a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure. Do your research and consider if a Bitcoin ETF aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Institutional Interest is Growing: Keep an eye on institutional adoption trends. Increased institutional investment can be a significant driver of long-term growth for Bitcoin and the crypto market. Stay Informed: The crypto space is dynamic. Stay updated on regulatory developments, market trends, and institutional activity to make informed investment decisions. A Colossal Leap for Bitcoin: The Future is Now? The Wisconsin Investment Board’s groundbreaking $321.5 million bet on a Bitcoin ETF is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a landmark moment in the history of cryptocurrency. It signals a profound shift in perception, a growing acceptance of Bitcoin by traditional finance, and potentially the beginning of a new era of institutional crypto investment . As more institutions follow suit, the future of Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem looks increasingly bright. This colossal investment serves as a powerful reminder: the crypto revolution is not just coming; it’s already here, and it’s being embraced at the highest levels of finance.

The upcoming Open Network launch is set to make Pi tokens publicly tradable, with major exchanges like Bitget, OKX, and MEXC on board. Pi Network Flips Ethereum on This Front The controversial cryptocurrency project – Pi Network – has been around for almost six years. It claims to allow people to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones, but its open mainnet and native token have yet to see the light of day. Despite the uncertainty, the project has amassed a multi-million community worldwide. In December last year, its application surpassed the major milestone of 100 million downloads, while countries like South Korea, Japan, India, China, Vietnam, and others have become strongholds. Most recently, Pi News (the leading blockchain media platform on Pi Network) revealed that over 3.7 million people now follow the project on X (formerly known as Twitter). Thus, it surpassed Ethereum’s subscriber base, which has a similar count. Moreover, Pi News claimed that the only four cryptocurrencies that have more followers on X than Pi Network are Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). As mentioned above, certain Asian nations have become somewhat of bastions for the project. Not long ago, Wu Blockchain estimated that Pi Network’s users in South Korea exceeded 1.3 million, outpacing the local customer base of major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Recently, there has been a surge of gatherings in different countries, such as India , Nigeria, and China. According to Pi News, the Chinese event happened in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, where “a large number of goods were sold out on site using Pi payment.” Just a Few Days Before the Huge Milestone Earlier this week, Pi Network’s team made the headlines, scheduling the launch of its Open Network for February 20. This development (if it indeed goes live) will make the Pi token publicly accessible by enabling exchanges to list it. Some of the platforms that have revealed their intentions to allow trading services with the asset on launch day include Bitget, OKX, and MEXC. Others, like Bybit , for example , prefer not to interact with the Pi Token. “Stay away from it,” the company’s CEO Ben Zhou warned .

It’s not just you. The landscape of asset allocation is undergoing a significant transformation, and traditional safe havens are no longer holding the same allure. According to a recent statement from Bitwise, a leading crypto asset manager, investors are increasingly turning their backs on government Treasuries, seeking refuge in alternative stores of value like gold and, most notably, Bitcoin. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a potential seismic shift in how investors perceive and protect their wealth. Let’s dive into what’s fueling this fascinating trend and what it means for the future of finance. Why Are Investors Rethinking Treasuries? For decades, U.S. Treasuries have been the gold standard – pun intended – of safe-haven assets. They were considered the bedrock of stability in any portfolio, especially during times of economic uncertainty. However, Bitwise Europe Research Director Andre Dragosch, in a recent interview with The Block, suggests a paradigm shift is underway. But why is this happening? What’s making investors question the once-unquestionable safety of Treasuries? Erosion of ‘Safest Asset’ Status: Dragosch argues that Treasuries are simply not seen as the ‘safest asset class’ anymore. This could be attributed to various factors, including concerns about rising national debt, inflation, and geopolitical instability. The perception of unwavering security is fading. Yield Concerns: While Treasury yields have risen, they may not be keeping pace with inflation or offering the kind of real returns investors are seeking, especially in a potentially inflationary environment. Investors are looking for assets that can preserve and grow their capital in real terms. Diversification Imperative: Modern portfolio theory emphasizes diversification. Relying solely on traditional assets like Treasuries may not be sufficient in today’s complex global economy. Investors are exploring a wider range of asset classes to enhance returns and manage risk. The Rising Appeal of Alternative Investments as Stores of Value As investors re-evaluate Treasuries, where are they turning? The answer, according to Bitwise, lies in alternative investments , particularly gold and Bitcoin. These assets are increasingly being viewed as robust stores of value, capable of weathering economic storms and even acting as hedges against traditional market volatility. Let’s examine why these alternatives are gaining traction. Gold: The Timeless Safe Haven Gold has a long and storied history as a store of value, dating back millennia. Its tangible nature, scarcity, and lack of correlation with traditional financial systems make it an attractive option during economic uncertainty. Dragosch highlighted the surge in gold inventories on the COMEX, indicating a clear increase in demand for the precious metal. Key benefits of gold as a store of value include: Historical Performance: Gold has historically performed well during periods of inflation and economic downturns. It’s often seen as a safe haven when other assets are struggling. Tangible Asset: Unlike digital or fiat currencies, gold is a physical asset. This tangibility provides a sense of security and can be appealing in a world increasingly dominated by digital finance. Limited Supply: The finite supply of gold contributes to its value proposition. This scarcity can make it a hedge against currency debasement and inflation. Bitcoin: The Modern Digital Gold While gold is the traditional safe haven, Bitcoin is emerging as the modern, digital counterpart. Born from the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and scarce digital currency. Its appeal as a store of value has grown exponentially in recent years, particularly among institutional and sophisticated investors. Dragosch’s statement about central banks reaching out to Bitwise U.S. to invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs is particularly noteworthy. The Czech Central Bank, among others, is reportedly considering allocating a portion of their Treasury holdings to Bitcoin ETFs. This is a significant validation of Bitcoin’s legitimacy as an institutional-grade asset. Key advantages of Bitcoin as a store of value include: Scarcity: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, creating inherent scarcity. This scarcity is a fundamental driver of its value proposition. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates outside of traditional financial systems and government control. This decentralization offers protection against censorship and potential manipulation. Accessibility and Portability: Bitcoin is easily accessible globally and can be transferred and stored digitally, offering unparalleled portability compared to physical assets like gold. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, outperforming many traditional asset classes over the past decade. Institutional Investors and the Shift to Bitcoin The involvement of institutional investors , including central banks, is a game-changer for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. These institutions manage vast sums of capital and their entry into the Bitcoin space signals a maturing asset class. Why are these sophisticated players considering Bitcoin? Factor Traditional Treasuries Bitcoin Perceived Safety Decreasing Increasing (as alternative) Yield Potential Limited High (but volatile) Inflation Hedge Questionable Potentially Strong Decentralization Centralized Decentralized Growth Potential Limited Significant (Long-term) The table above highlights some key comparative factors. Institutional interest in Bitcoin is driven by a combination of factors, including: Seeking Higher Returns: In a low-yield environment, institutions are under pressure to find assets that can deliver meaningful returns. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, offers the potential for significant upside. Diversification Benefits: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets makes it an attractive diversifier for institutional portfolios. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance and its price appreciates, institutions risk being left behind if they don’t allocate to this asset class. Technological Innovation: Institutions are recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology and Bitcoin as a leading innovation in finance. Actionable Insights for Investors So, what does this shift mean for individual and institutional investors alike? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Asset Allocation: It’s time to reassess your portfolio’s reliance on traditional safe havens like Treasuries. Consider diversifying into alternative stores of value, including gold and Bitcoin. Understand Bitcoin’s Role: Educate yourself about Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its potential as a store of value, and its role in a modern portfolio. Start Small, Learn, and Adapt: If you’re new to Bitcoin or crypto, start with a small allocation and gradually increase your exposure as you become more comfortable. Consider Bitcoin ETFs: For traditional investors, Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Stay Informed: The financial landscape is constantly evolving. Stay updated on market trends, regulatory developments, and expert opinions to make informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A New Era for Store of Value Assets? The message from Bitwise is clear: the investment world is changing. The traditional dominance of Treasuries as the undisputed safe haven is being challenged, and investors are actively seeking alternative investments that offer better returns, diversification, and protection against economic uncertainties. Bitcoin, alongside gold, is emerging as a leading contender in this new era of store of value assets. The potential involvement of central banks only underscores the magnitude of this shift. Whether this trend continues to accelerate remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the investment landscape is becoming more diverse, dynamic, and decidedly more digital.

This isn’t just another headline; it’s a seismic shift indicating growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Are you ready to dive into the details of this astounding investment and understand what it means for the future of digital finance? What’s the Buzz About Abu Dhabi’s Bitcoin ETF Bet? The news broke via a securities holdings report (13F) and was highlighted by the crypto-savvy X account @tier10k: ADIA, the entity managing Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, disclosed a purchase of a whopping $436 million worth of BlackRock Bitcoin ETF shares in the first quarter of 2025. Let’s break down why this is such a monumental event: Massive Scale: $436 million is not a trivial amount. This substantial investment underscores ADIA’s serious intent and belief in the potential of Bitcoin as an asset class. Institutional Validation: ADIA is not just any investor. As a sovereign wealth fund, it manages the surplus reserves of a nation. Their investment signals a significant step towards mainstream institutional investment in cryptocurrencies. BlackRock Connection: The choice of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is also noteworthy. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, lends further credibility and legitimacy to the crypto ETF market. This move isn’t happening in a vacuum. It reflects a broader trend of institutions gradually warming up to the idea of incorporating digital assets into their portfolios. But why are these behemoths of finance suddenly showing interest in what was once considered a fringe asset? Why is Institutional Investment in Crypto a Game Changer? For years, the cryptocurrency market has been characterized by retail investors and early adopters. The entry of institutional investment marks a pivotal moment, bringing a new level of maturity and stability to the often-volatile crypto landscape. Here’s why institutional participation is a game changer: Increased Liquidity: Large institutional players bring substantial capital, injecting much-needed liquidity into the market. This can lead to more efficient price discovery and reduce price volatility in the long run. Enhanced Legitimacy: When established financial institutions like ADIA invest in crypto assets, it sends a powerful signal to the wider market. It validates cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, moving them further away from the perception of being a risky, niche investment. Wider Adoption: Institutional investment often paves the way for broader adoption. As institutions become comfortable with crypto, it encourages other organizations, including corporations and pension funds, to consider similar allocations. Market Maturation: Institutional involvement brings with it sophisticated trading strategies, risk management frameworks, and compliance standards. This contributes to the overall maturation and professionalization of the cryptocurrency market. To illustrate the impact, consider the difference between retail and institutional investment: Feature Retail Investors Institutional Investors Investment Size Relatively smaller, individual investments Large-scale investments, often in millions or billions Market Impact Individual actions have limited market impact Actions can significantly influence market trends and prices Investment Horizon Can vary widely, often shorter-term focus Typically longer-term investment horizons Risk Appetite Diverse, ranges from risk-averse to highly speculative Generally more risk-averse, with stringent risk management Regulatory Scrutiny Less direct regulatory oversight on individual investors Subject to significant regulatory compliance and reporting requirements Sovereign Wealth Funds and Crypto: A Budding Romance? ADIA’s investment begs the question: Is this the start of a larger trend of sovereign wealth fund s embracing cryptocurrencies? While ADIA’s move is certainly groundbreaking, it’s important to understand the broader context. Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are known for their long-term investment horizons and cautious approach. Their primary goal is to preserve and grow national wealth for future generations. Why might SWFs be attracted to crypto now? Diversification: SWFs are constantly seeking diversification to mitigate risk and enhance returns. Cryptocurrencies, with their low correlation to traditional assets, offer a compelling diversification opportunity. Potential for High Returns: Despite the volatility, cryptocurrencies have demonstrated the potential for significant returns, especially over the long term. This aligns with the growth objectives of many SWFs. Inflation Hedge: Some argue that Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation, a crucial consideration for long-term wealth preservation. Technological Disruption: SWFs are increasingly interested in investing in disruptive technologies. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies represent a significant technological shift with the potential to reshape various industries. While ADIA’s investment is a landmark, it’s crucial to note that SWF involvement in crypto is still in its early stages. Many SWFs are likely taking a ‘wait-and-see’ approach, carefully monitoring the market and regulatory developments before making substantial allocations. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF: The Gateway to Crypto for Institutions? ADIA’s choice of the BlackRock BTC ETF is also strategically significant. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) provide a regulated, familiar, and accessible pathway for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the underlying asset. Why is this important? Regulatory Compliance: ETFs operate within established regulatory frameworks, making them more palatable for institutions that face strict compliance requirements. Ease of Access and Trading: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easy to buy and sell using existing brokerage infrastructure. This is far simpler than setting up custody solutions for direct Bitcoin holdings. Liquidity and Transparency: Crypto ETF s offer intraday liquidity and price transparency, features that are highly valued by institutional investors. Reduced Operational Complexity: Investing in a BTC ETF eliminates the complexities associated with directly managing and securing Bitcoin, such as private key management and custody solutions. BlackRock, as the world’s largest asset manager, brings immense credibility and expertise to the crypto ETF space. Their involvement further legitimizes these products and makes them a more attractive option for risk-averse institutions. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? ADIA’s $436 million investment in a Bitcoin ETF is more than just a large transaction; it’s a bellwether event signaling a potential acceleration in institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. The implications for the broader crypto market are profound: Positive Market Sentiment: This news is likely to boost market sentiment and investor confidence. It reinforces the narrative that cryptocurrencies are maturing and attracting serious institutional capital. Potential Price Appreciation: Increased institutional demand could lead to significant price appreciation for Bitcoin and potentially other cryptocurrencies as well. Further Institutional Inflows: ADIA’s move could encourage other sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and endowments to explore similar investments, leading to a wave of institutional capital entering the crypto market. Mainstream Acceptance: Continued institutional adoption will further solidify cryptocurrencies’ place in the mainstream financial system, reducing regulatory uncertainty and fostering innovation in the space. In conclusion, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund’s bold $436 million investment in a Bitcoin ETF is a landmark moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It signifies a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class by major institutional players and heralds a new era of institutional involvement in the crypto market. This development is not just about one large investment; it’s about the validation, maturation, and future trajectory of the entire digital asset ecosystem.

According to a recent letter from Nasdaq, representatives from the exchange operator met with the SEC’s newly formed crypto task force last week to discuss regulatory parity. The company stated that all trading venues, whether exchanges, broker-dealers or alternative trading systems, should allow trading of both digital asset securities and non-securities digital assets. Nasdaq also called on the SEC to set a clear deadline for any temporary relief it grants to existing crypto trading platforms. Related News: What Does the Recent SEC News About the XRP Spot ETF Mean? Is It Really Approved? The exchange has previously signaled interest in the crypto space, announcing plans to launch a crypto custody platform in 2022. However, that initiative was shelved a year later due to evolving regulatory uncertainties. At the time, Nasdaq also hinted at the possibility of launching a crypto exchange, depending on the regulatory environment and market conditions. Nasdaq is not alone in pushing for regulatory clarity. Other industry representatives, including venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Multicoin Capital, as well as the Blockchain Association, also met with the SEC’s crypto task force last week to discuss the future of digital asset regulation. *This is not investment advice.

Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum MAGACOINOFFICIAL is generating. Don’t Miss Out on MAGACOINOFFICIAL The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but MAGACOINOFFICIAL might just be that opportunity.

One minute, they’re a well-kept secret among insiders and the next, they’re skyrocketing to levels that leave early investors laughing their way to the bank. And right now, there’s a serious shake-up with BTFD Coin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk leading the charge. BTFD Coin’s presale is surging forward, with Stage 14 nearly sold out. Over $6.07 million raised, more than 69 billion coins sold, and 10,700+ Bulls already on board – if that doesn’t scream potential, what does? But beyond its presale success, what’s really turning heads is BTFD Coin’s staking rewards with a jaw-dropping 90% APY. That’s right – holders aren’t just getting in early; they’re earning passive income while waiting for the price explosion. Time to break down why BTFD might soon be named one of the best new meme coins to buy this month . BTFD Coin: Unmatched Staking and Moonshot Potential Imagine this: You buy $BTFD during the presale at $0.00016 per coin. Analysts predict it could hit $0.0006 on launch, and if momentum keeps pushing, it could reach a wild $0.006. That’s a 3650% ROI. Now, throw in 90% APY staking on top of that. You’re not just waiting for gains; you’re stacking more $BTFD on autopilot. Here’s where it gets even crazier – every token you buy in Stage 14 comes DOUBLED thanks to the LAUNCH100 bonus code. That means if you grab 1 million $BTFD, you actually get 2 million. And with only two stages left, this golden opportunity is vanishing fast. However, BTFD Coin is more than just a meme – it’s a community-powered movement . With Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull leading the charge, the Bulls Squad is keeping the hype alive.

40352763,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129123,1739611185,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Shift: US Banks Boldly Enter Crypto Custody Amid Regulatory Easing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-banks-crypto-custody-shift/,"Exciting developments are brewing in the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency! Imagine a future where your trusted U.S. bank not only safeguards your dollars but also your digital assets. Well, that future might be closer than you think. Let’s dive into the intriguing story of how major U.S. banks are now setting their sights on crypto custody services , spurred by a significant regulatory shift. Why Are US Banks Suddenly Eyeing Crypto Custody Services? The winds of change are blowing in the regulatory landscape, and it seems President Trump’s administration is ushering in a more accommodating environment for crypto within traditional finance. According to a recent buzz from Wu Blockchain on X, this easing of regulations is acting as a green light for large U.S. banks to seriously explore offering crypto custody services . But what exactly does this mean, and why is it such a big deal? Regulatory Tailwinds: The perceived shift in regulatory stance is reducing the perceived risk and compliance hurdles for banks venturing into crypto. This makes it more palatable for risk-averse institutions to explore this new asset class. Client Demand is Surging: Institutional investors and even high-net-worth individuals are increasingly interested in gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies. They prefer to do so through established and regulated entities they already trust – their banks. Profit Potential: Custody services, along with potential trading services, represent a significant revenue opportunity for banks in a rapidly growing market. Staying Competitive: As the crypto market matures, banks risk being left behind if they don’t adapt and offer services their clients are demanding. Offering crypto custody services is a strategic move to remain relevant in the evolving financial landscape. Coinbase and Banks: A Strategic Alliance in Crypto Custody? The news gets even more interesting! Industry giant Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is reportedly in discussions with these very banks. The goal? To potentially provide the technological backbone and expertise for these banks to offer crypto custody services and even trading functionalities. This could be a win-win scenario: For Banks: Partnering with Coinbase allows them to leverage existing, proven technology and navigate the complexities of crypto operations without building everything from scratch. For Coinbase: This collaboration opens doors to mainstream finance, expanding their reach and legitimacy by working with established banking institutions. For the Crypto Market: Such partnerships can accelerate institutional crypto adoption by making it easier and more secure for institutions to participate in the crypto market. The Regulatory Roadblocks: Not So Fast on Crypto Trading While crypto custody services seem to be gaining momentum, the path to offering actual crypto trading services by these banks is proving to be more complex. Why the hold-up? Regulatory Hurdle Impact Federal Reserve Approval Banks need the green light from the Fed, which is known for its cautious approach to new financial technologies, especially crypto. NYDFS Approval Banks operating in New York, a major financial hub, require approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, adding another layer of regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory Capital Requirements Holding crypto assets requires banks to meet specific capital requirements to mitigate risks, which can be substantial and impact profitability. These pending approvals and capital requirements are acting as brakes, delaying the immediate launch of crypto trading services by these banks. It’s a reminder that while the regulatory environment might be easing, it’s still a carefully navigated landscape. Citigroup and State Street: Leading the Charge in Institutional Crypto Adoption Despite the regulatory hurdles for trading, major players like Citigroup and State Street are not sitting on the sidelines. Citigroup is actively considering launching its own cryptocurrency regulation compliant custody service, signaling their serious intent in this space. State Street, another financial heavyweight, is anticipated to roll out its crypto custody offering as early as next year. These moves underscore the growing belief within traditional finance that crypto is not a fleeting trend but a significant asset class. These developments are not just about individual banks; they represent a broader trend of institutional crypto adoption . As more established financial institutions enter the crypto arena, it brings: Increased Legitimacy: Mainstream bank involvement adds a layer of credibility and trust to the crypto market. Greater Market Stability: Institutional capital can contribute to a more mature and less volatile crypto market over time. Wider Access to Crypto: Banks offering crypto services can make it easier for a broader range of investors to access and participate in the crypto ecosystem. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should you take away from this evolving landscape of US banks crypto embrace? Keep an Eye on Regulatory Developments: Track announcements from the Federal Reserve and NYDFS, as these will significantly impact the speed and scope of bank involvement in crypto. Watch for Bank-Coinbase Partnerships: Any confirmed collaborations between major banks and Coinbase could be a strong indicator of accelerating institutional crypto adoption . Consider Traditional Banks for Crypto Exposure (Eventually): If you prefer the security and familiarity of traditional banking for your crypto holdings, keep an eye on these developments. Custody services from established banks could offer a regulated and insured option in the future. Understand the Pace is Gradual: While the direction is clear, the full integration of crypto into traditional banking will be a gradual process, influenced by regulatory approvals and technological integrations. The Future is Hybrid: Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto The move by U.S. banks to explore crypto custody services is a pivotal moment. It signifies a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class within mainstream finance. While regulatory hurdles remain, the direction is undeniably towards greater integration. This could pave the way for a future where traditional banks and the crypto world coexist and complement each other, offering a wider range of financial services to a diverse clientele. The journey has just begun, and it promises to be a transformative one for the financial industry and the crypto ecosystem alike.

Specifically, XRP appears to follow a pattern that echoes its historic 2017 rally, which saw the cryptocurrency skyrocket by over 1,300% in multiple phases. Now, if this pattern plays out, it could set the stage for an even larger breakout, potentially pushing XRP’s price to $12.50 in 2025, according to an analysis by TradingShot shared in a TradingView post on February 14. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView According to the analysis, XRP’s rise in 2017 played out in three rallies, each delivering four-digit percentage gains. After surging 600% since November 2024, the token may be gearing up for its next major move, targeting a double-digit figure. At the same time, this bullish projection is backed by key technical indicators . TradingShot’s analysis indicated that the 50-day moving average ( MA ) has crossed above the 200-day MA, which acts as a strong bullish signal, suggesting XRP could mirror its 2017 bull run. The expert noted that XRP could see a 1,300% surge if history repeats, pushing its price to $12.50. If this target is achieved, XRP’s market cap will rise to $722 billion, potentially making it the second-largest cryptocurrency if Ethereum ( ETH ) stagnates. However, insights from Finbold’s artificial intelligence (AI) tool present a more conservative outlook for XRP in 2025. The tool, leveraging several models, set an average XRP price prediction at $3.065, an upside of 9.29%. Among the tools, Claude 3.5 Sonnet projected XRP will hit $3.85, a 37.99% growth, while OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o set a price of $2.80. On the other hand, ChatGPT-4o Mini forecasted a significant drop in XRP’s price by 10.39% to $2.50. Finbold AI XRP price prediction. Source: Finbold Why XRP is surging XRP is gaining in the short term after new developments regarding the asset’s related spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) emerged. On February 14, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) acknowledged the 21Shares application, which opens the door for a review process toward possible approval. Given the new cryptocurrency-friendly administration, there remains optimism that the product will get a nod. Meanwhile, XRP could see further upside if the SEC moves to end the case against Ripple . The XRP community anticipates that with the new administration, the SEC will be able to drop the case or reach a settlement favorable to the blockchain firm. As things stand, XRP is targeting $3, which is the main resistance level to watch. To this end, prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, in an X post on February 14, stated that XRP shows signs of a strong recovery, bouncing from the lower boundary of its ascending channel and now appearing poised for a potential rally toward the $3 mark. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts The analysis noted that XRP remains within a clear ascending channel, finding support at $2.40 and resistance at $2.80 and $3.00. Therefore, a breakout above the midline of this channel could further fuel bullish sentiment, with an ultimate target near the upper boundary at approximately $3.60. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.78, surging over 6% in the last 24 hours. In the past week, the token has been up almost 16%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold In the short term, the overall XRP sentiment remains bullish. The asset is comfortably trading above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $2.62 and 200-day SMA ($1.36), indicating a strong uptrend. With a relative strength index ( RSI ) of 54.81, XRP’s momentum remains neutral, showing no immediate overbought or oversold signals. On the other hand, the market seems to be indecisive, given that the Fear & Greed Index stands at 50.

Are you ready for a potential game-changer in the XRP market? Polymarket, a popular prediction platform, has just dropped a bombshell: they’re forecasting an impressive 81% probability of an XRP ETF approval by 2025. This surge in optimism comes hot on the heels of the SEC’s acknowledgment of Grayscale’s ETF application, injecting a fresh dose of hope into the market. Let’s dive into what this could mean for XRP and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the Market Buzzing About an XRP ETF Approval? The anticipation around a potential XRP ETF approval is palpable, and for good reason. An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) for XRP would be a monumental leap forward for the cryptocurrency. But what exactly makes this such a big deal? Let’s break it down: Increased Accessibility: An XRP ETF would open the doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This means your average investor, who might find navigating crypto exchanges daunting, can easily invest through brokerage accounts they already use. Boosted Liquidity: ETFs typically bring in significant trading volumes, which can drastically improve the liquidity of XRP in the market. Higher liquidity generally leads to more stable and efficient price discovery. Mainstream Validation: Approval from regulatory bodies like the SEC would signal a significant level of mainstream acceptance and legitimacy for XRP. This validation can attract institutional investors and further solidify XRP’s position in the crypto ecosystem. Essentially, an XRP ETF acts as a bridge connecting traditional finance with the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency, potentially unlocking a massive influx of capital and broader adoption for XRP. Polymarket Prediction: Is 81% Odds for XRP ETF Approval Realistic? Polymarket XRP ETF Prediction Polymarket’s prediction of an 81% chance for XRP ETF approval in 2025 is generating considerable excitement, but is it grounded in reality? Polymarket is known for its prediction markets, where users bet on the likelihood of future events. Their prediction reflects the collective sentiment of market participants who are putting their money where their mouth is. This high probability is likely fueled by recent developments, most notably the SEC acknowledging Grayscale’s application to convert its XRP Trust into a spot ETF. This acknowledgment is seen as a crucial step forward, suggesting the SEC is at least considering the possibility of an XRP ETF, a stark contrast to previous regulatory stances on crypto ETFs. However, it’s crucial to remember that 81% is not 100%. Regulatory processes are complex and unpredictable. While the odds are in favor, there are still hurdles to overcome. The SEC’s final decision-making process can be influenced by various factors, including market conditions, ongoing legal battles (like the Ripple case), and evolving regulatory frameworks surrounding digital assets. XRP Price Surge: A Glimpse into the Future? The market reacted swiftly and positively to the XRP ETF approval optimism. XRP witnessed a remarkable surge of over 10%, briefly touching $2.78. This price jump underscores the market’s eagerness for an XRP ETF and its belief in the potential impact of such a financial product. This price action can be viewed as a potential preview of what might happen if an XRP ETF is indeed approved. Increased investor interest, fueled by easier access and mainstream validation, could drive significant demand for XRP, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation. However, it’s important to exercise caution. Market reactions to news, especially in the volatile crypto space, can be short-lived. While the price surge is encouraging, sustained growth will depend on concrete progress towards ETF approval and broader market dynamics. The Timeline: When Could We See an XRP ETF in 2025? While Polymarket predicts 2025, and the SEC has acknowledged Grayscale’s application, the actual timeline for ETF approval remains uncertain. The SEC has a 240-day window to make a final decision on ETF applications. According to Cointelegraph, industry experts suggest the approval process, even under favorable conditions, could still take 8–12 months. Here’s a potential timeline breakdown: Stage Estimated Timeframe Description SEC Application Review Ongoing (within 240 days of filing) The SEC evaluates Grayscale’s application, requests for comments, and conducts due diligence. Public Comment Period Part of SEC Review The public and industry stakeholders can submit comments on the proposed ETF. SEC Decision Within 240 days, potentially earlier The SEC makes a final decision – approval, rejection, or further delay. ETF Launch (if approved) Weeks to Months post-approval Grayscale prepares for ETF launch, including listing on exchanges and marketing. Therefore, while 2025 is a plausible target year, the exact timing will depend on the SEC’s review process and any unforeseen regulatory hurdles. Patience and continued monitoring of regulatory developments will be key. Navigating the Path to XRP ETF Approval: Challenges and Opportunities The journey towards XRP ETF approval is not without its challenges. Regulatory scrutiny of the crypto market remains intense, and the SEC has historically been cautious about approving crypto-based ETFs, particularly those holding spot assets. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally and in the US specifically adds complexity and uncertainty to the approval process. SEC Scrutiny: The SEC will thoroughly examine Grayscale’s application, potentially raising concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and custody solutions. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market could be a point of concern for regulators assessing the risk associated with an XRP ETF. Opportunities: Growing Institutional Interest: Increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and demand for regulated investment vehicles like ETFs are strong tailwinds. Grayscale’s Track Record: Grayscale’s experience in managing crypto trusts and their successful conversion of their Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF provides a positive precedent. Positive Market Sentiment: The current optimistic market sentiment and Polymarket’s prediction reflect a growing belief in the inevitability of crypto ETFs. Actionable Insights: What Should XRP Enthusiasts Do? For those excited about the prospect of an XRP ETF , here are some actionable steps: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on cryptocurrency news, especially regulatory updates from the SEC and developments related to Grayscale’s ETF application. Manage Expectations: While the odds are promising, remember that ETF approval is not guaranteed. Be prepared for potential delays or even rejection. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto investments and consider your risk tolerance. Engage in Community Discussions: Participate in online crypto communities and forums to stay updated and share insights with fellow enthusiasts. Conclusion: The Exciting Horizon of XRP and ETFs The 81% prediction from Polymarket for XRP ETF approval in 2025 paints an exciting picture for the future of XRP and the broader crypto market. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of an XRP ETF – increased accessibility, liquidity, and mainstream validation – are undeniable. The market’s enthusiastic response and the ongoing regulatory developments suggest that we are moving closer to a world where crypto ETFs become a standard part of the financial landscape.

The crypto world is buzzing with anticipation as Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the influential founder and former CEO of Binance, just dropped a major hint about the future of meme coins on the BNB Chain. In a recent BNB Chain X Spaces broadcast, CZ revealed that he and his team are actively hammering out an exciting incentive policy specifically designed for the BNB Chain meme section. And the best part? We’re expecting an official announcement within the next 24 hours! This news has sent ripples of excitement through the crypto community, particularly among individual investors who are keenly interested in the meme coin space. Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the broader crypto market. Why BNB Chain Meme Coins Are About to Get a Boost Meme coins have carved out a unique and often vibrant niche within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They are known for their community-driven nature, viral potential, and ability to generate significant buzz – and sometimes, substantial returns. However, the meme coin landscape can be volatile and often lacks structured support. CZ’s announcement signals a potential shift, indicating that BNB Chain is looking to foster a more supportive environment for these digital assets. But why is this incentive policy such a big deal, especially for BNB Chain meme coins ? Increased Investment & Development: An incentive policy can act as a magnet, attracting more developers and investors to the BNB Chain meme coin ecosystem. This could translate to increased innovation, more robust projects, and a greater variety of meme coins being launched on the network. Enhanced Liquidity: Incentives can stimulate trading activity, leading to improved liquidity for BNB Chain meme coins. This makes it easier for investors to buy and sell these tokens without significant price slippage, creating a healthier market environment. Community Growth: By rewarding participation and investment, the policy can foster stronger and more engaged communities around BNB Chain meme coins. This organic growth is crucial for the long-term sustainability and success of any meme coin project. Legitimizing the Meme Coin Space: Support from a major blockchain like BNB Chain can lend credibility to the meme coin sector. This could attract a broader range of investors who might have previously been hesitant to engage with what is often perceived as a highly speculative market. What Kind of Meme Coin Rewards Can We Expect? While the specifics are still under wraps, CZ’s emphasis on rewarding individual investors gives us clues about the potential nature of these meme coin rewards . Let’s speculate on what form these incentives might take: Type of Incentive Potential Benefits for Investors Examples Liquidity Mining Programs Earn rewards by providing liquidity to meme coin trading pairs on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within the BNB Chain ecosystem. Staking BNB and meme coins in specific pools to earn yield in meme tokens or BNB. Airdrops & Distributions Receive free meme tokens simply by holding BNB or participating in certain BNB Chain activities. Holding a certain amount of BNB in your wallet to qualify for airdrops of newly launched meme coins. Incubation & Grants Support for promising meme coin projects through funding, mentorship, and technical assistance. BNB Chain providing grants to meme coin projects that demonstrate innovation and community engagement. Trading Fee Reductions Lower costs for trading meme coins on BNB Chain-based platforms. Reduced trading fees on DEXs or CEXs for specific BNB Chain meme coin pairs. It’s important to remember that these are just potential scenarios. The actual incentive policy could incorporate a combination of these mechanisms or introduce entirely new approaches. The key takeaway is that BNB Chain appears to be committed to actively supporting and nurturing the growth of its meme coin ecosystem. CZ Binance and the Vision for Meme Coins CZ’s continued involvement and influence in the crypto space, even after stepping down as Binance CEO, remains significant. His endorsement of a meme section incentive policy on BNB Chain underscores his belief in the potential of this sector. Why is someone of CZ’s stature paying attention to meme coins? It boils down to several factors: Community Power: CZ has always emphasized the importance of community in crypto. Meme coins are, by their very nature, community-driven projects. Recognizing and supporting this organic energy aligns with his broader philosophy. Innovation & Experimentation: Meme coins, despite their often lighthearted nature, can be breeding grounds for innovation. They can test new tokenomics, community governance models, and marketing strategies that can be valuable lessons for the wider crypto space. Market Engagement: Meme coins attract a diverse range of participants, including newcomers to crypto. By fostering a healthy meme coin ecosystem, BNB Chain can broaden its reach and engagement within the overall market. Financial Opportunities: While risky, meme coins can offer substantial financial opportunities for both creators and investors. A well-designed incentive policy can channel this potential in a more structured and beneficial way for the BNB Chain ecosystem. Navigating the Crypto Meme Tokens Landscape: Opportunities and Risks The upcoming incentive policy undoubtedly injects fresh excitement into the world of crypto meme tokens on BNB Chain. However, it’s crucial to approach this space with a balanced perspective, understanding both the potential opportunities and inherent risks. Opportunities: Early Adoption Advantage: Being early to recognize and participate in promising BNB Chain meme coin projects could yield significant returns, especially with the added boost from the incentive policy. Community-Driven Growth: Meme coins thrive on community support. Active participation in vibrant communities can provide valuable insights and opportunities. Potential for High Rewards: While high-risk, meme coins have the potential for exponential growth, offering the chance for substantial gains if you choose wisely and manage risk effectively. Risks: Volatility & Speculation: Meme coins are notoriously volatile and driven by hype and speculation. Prices can fluctuate dramatically and rapidly. Rug Pulls & Scams: The meme coin space, like any nascent crypto market, is susceptible to scams and rug pulls. Thorough due diligence is paramount. Lack of Fundamental Value: Many meme coins lack underlying utility or fundamental value. Their price is often solely based on community sentiment and hype. Actionable Insights: Preparing for the BNB Chain Meme Section Incentive Announcement With the announcement just around the corner, here are some actionable steps you can take to prepare and potentially capitalize on the upcoming meme section incentive policy: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official BNB Chain channels, CZ’s social media, and reputable crypto news sources for the official announcement and details of the incentive policy. Research BNB Chain Meme Coins: Start researching existing and emerging meme coins on the BNB Chain ecosystem. Identify projects with strong communities, active development, and potentially promising tokenomics. Understand Incentive Mechanisms: Once the policy is announced, carefully study the incentive mechanisms. Determine how you can participate and what actions are required to earn rewards. Risk Management: Meme coins are high-risk investments. Only invest what you can afford to lose and implement robust risk management strategies, such as diversification and stop-loss orders. Engage with Communities: Join the communities of meme coins you are interested in. Engage in discussions, learn from other members, and stay updated on project developments. Conclusion: A New Era for BNB Chain Meme Coins? CZ’s announcement of a BNB Chain meme section incentive policy is a significant development that could mark a new chapter for meme coins within this blockchain ecosystem. By actively supporting and rewarding participation in the meme coin space, BNB Chain is signaling its commitment to fostering innovation, community growth, and broader market engagement. For individual investors, this presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Staying informed, conducting thorough research, and practicing prudent risk management will be key to navigating this dynamic and potentially lucrative landscape.

This marks a shift from previous years of regulatory friction. Federal agencies, congressional committees, and industry representatives are reportedly working together to build clear regulatory framework for digital assets. In a February 15 X post , Fox Business correspondent Eleanor Terrett reported that several government entities have come together to make the US a global crypto hub. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Presidential Working Group, and a Bicameral Working Group for Digital Assets in Congress, are working together to create a digital currency framework. Despite concerns over regulatory overlap, sources told Terrett that cooperation between these bodies has been surprisingly effective. Terrett described the interagency collaboration as “a lot of cooks, but not enough to spoil the sauce.” Crypto Czar David Sacks unites agencies to work on crypto regulations David Sacks, the President Trump-appointed US Crypto and AI Czar, confirmed the interagency collaboration. He credited his associate Bo Hines, for ensuring smooth coordination among different agencies. “ The inter-agency Working Group on Digital Assets is working well together to implement the President’s agenda ,” Sacks stated in repost to Terret’s update, hinting at upcoming policy announcements. Consensys lawyer and former US Department of Justice official Bill Hughes echoed these sentiments, noting that federal officials were “playing well with each other,” without bureaucratic conflicts. “ SEC and CFTC working together, rather than the SEC giving CFTC the silent treatment, is a great development…Maybe this is a honeymoon and doesn’t last – differences of opinion on policy, personality conflicts, and ambition can all pose challenges. But we are off to a really promising start, ” Hughes said in his X post. On Jan 23, President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology.” It was aimed at improving the development and adoption of blockchain technology in the US. The signed order coined cryptocurrencies as “assets that play a key role in driving innovation and economic growth,” while doubling down on the administration’s commitment to foster a responsible expansion within the sector. As part of the directive, Trump revoked several policies enacted under the Biden administration, formally prohibited federal agencies from pursuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), and established an interagency working group to oversee digital asset markets. A contrast to the Biden administration’s approach Trump’s pro-crypto stance is a sharp departure from the policies under former President Joe Biden, whose administration aggressively pursued regulatory enforcement against the industry. During Biden’s tenure, the SEC and other regulators cracked down on major crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, alleging they were operating in violation of US securities laws. The companies denied the allegations, but the lawsuits created an uncertain regulatory climate. Trump, in contrast, has positioned himself as a “crypto president,” actively courting support from the digital asset industry. Crypto enthusiasts trust that the GOP leaders will help craft new regulations to clarify whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities, commodities, or another financial category. A major development following the US President’s directive was the SEC’s decision to rescind Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which had made it “costly” for public companies to hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of customers. Industry leaders had long argued that SAB 121 discouraged institutional adoption of digital assets, and its removal is seen as a victory for crypto firms. Post-Biden, congressional lawmakers from both the House and Senate have reportedly aligned with the administration’s vision for crypto regulation. Representatives French Hill and Bryan Steil confirmed that the Bicameral Working Group for Digital Assets is in sync with the Presidential Working Group in drafting new legislation.

The ‘Signs’ That Could Confirm It, Basketball Analyst Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-to-3-digits-the-signs-that-could-confirm-it-basketball-analyst-says/,"A lighthearted tweet about Kansas State University’s financial situation has spurred new conversations on XRP’s aspirational pricing goals. Known in sporting circles as “Kelly in Vegas,” Kelly Stewart added comedy into the continuous discussion among the crypto community about XRP surpassing $100. Related Reading: Cardano Price Balloons 107% As Whales Scoop Up 1.41 Billion ADA The analyst wrote on X, “If XRP hits $100, there will be signs.” This was a play on a well-known trend in the crypto world, where investors joke about the expensive purchases they would make if their holdings reached high price goals.

If XRP hits $100 there will be signs https://t.co/fSDrIX0j5M pic.twitter.com/ZQGRw5XsVP — Kelly (@kellyinvegas) February 13, 2025 Kansas State Athletics Approaches Financial Crossroads The joke falls at a time when Kansas State University’s athletic department is facing major financial difficulties. To remain competitive, they must generate another $20.5 million by the 2025–26 school year. Athletic Director Gene Taylor looks at several fundraising avenues as their present budget of $93.251 million is less than the needed $114 million target. Innovative Solutions For Expanding University Revenue The university isn’t leaving any stone unturned in its quest for additional funding. Traditional approaches like alumni donations and corporate sponsorships are being complemented by innovative ideas. Among these include completing naming rights for Bramlage Coliseum and increasing beer sales at Bill Snyder Family Stadium. Even the hallowed football field could soon show commercials, a possibility that motivated Stewart’s lighthearted intervention. Reality Check: The $100 XRP Dream The obsession of the crypto community on XRP approaching $100 exposes both ambition and a disconnection from reality on the market. Although some aficionados cite Ripple’s growing alliances and possible institutional involvement as encouraging signs, the data tell another tale. XRP would need a market capitalization of around $5.78 trillion to hit $100, more than the value of the entire cryptocurrency industry. This astronomical figure raises serious questions about the feasibility of such predictions. The Future: Between Hope And Reality The junction between the financial hardships of college sports with cryptocurrency aspirations exposes a more general story about money, ambition, and reality in contemporary America. While Kansas State looks for workable answers to its financing problems, the crypto community keeps aiming high. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Get $2 Million Boost From National Bank Of Canada The university’s methodical approach to bridging its $20.5 million gap stands in stark contrast to the speculative nature of $100 XRP predictions. Yet both stories share a common thread: the eternal human drive to overcome financial limitations, whether through practical planning or ambitious speculation. Gene Taylor’s plans for the future of Kansas State’s sports department are real steps toward a better future. At the same time, the crypto community’s excitement, which sometimes goes too far, shows how many people see digital assets as having the power to change the world. As these parallel stories progress, they tell us that people’s financial goals still affect how they act and what choices they make, whether they are in traditional institutions or new technologies. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.77, up 7.6% and 16.3% in the daily and weekly frames.

That unmistakable growth suggests something is afoot with the project, positioning Flare Networks as a likely tiled next big thing in DeFi and perhaps a direct rival to service providers like Chainlink and the Graph. What’s most exciting about the project, however, is not just the growth of its TVL, but how this uptick encompasses a giddy user engagement with the platform. The attention of both retail users and institutional players has been captured by Flare Networks. Its growth appears to be increasing even more lately, and it seems to have a user base that is both solid and large. All that leaves us with a DeFi ecosystem that continues to attract new users and new capital in a way that many other DeFi ecosystems can only envy. To those who listened to the Flare Fair space, this is the growth dashboard from @intotheblock I was yapping about Key takeaways ✓ long-term steady growth of DeFi TVL in @FlareNetworks ✓ majority TVL is currently in RWAs and liquid staking ✓ yield segment appears to have… https://t.co/3BEYSdCdtl pic.twitter.com/Njujb24W30 — amiiiii (@_WaterAmi) February 13, 2025 Steady Growth in TVL, with Strong Potential in RWAs and Liquid Staking Flare Networks has one of the most impressive growth stories in decentralized finance over the past year. Not that long ago, people in the space could only look on with envy as total value locked in various DeFi platforms soared. But TVL growth has now more than joined the party, as the key health metric for DeFi protocols has exploded from under $5 million last summer to over $72.6 million today. The coda for this story of robust growth? Flare’s TVL seems to be in no danger of slowing down, as the efficiency, potential, and elsewise health of the platform clearly have more users putting their collateral to use within the ecosystem. With over 400% yearly TVL growth, @FlareNetworks ' DeFi ecosystem is becoming one to watch Our latest free dashboard will help you do so https://t.co/qpXzfbkXsf pic.twitter.com/mkCBTX6HIq — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 13, 2025 At present, most of the total value locked in on Flare Networks is found in real-world assets and liquid staking. These two segments are now part of the rapidly growing DeFi universe. RWAs are the next big thing in DeFi, and at Flare, we are leading the way in AI-regulated RWAs on the blockchain. By minting RWA and liquid staking-enabled smart contracts, we are ramifying DeFi into an even broader dimension. This is doing two things for us: 1. It’s giving us a broader user base in DeFi, including institutional fiat investors who typically don’t deal in crypto. 2. It’s providing use cases for the Flare utility token (FLR). 1…2…3…KABOOM! @FlareNetworks 's metrics have skyrocketed! 50k daily active addresses 1.000.000 daily transactions Compare multiple metrics w/ @routescan_io and follow for more! pic.twitter.com/04dQRvfe6e — Routescan | The Multichain Explorer (@routescan_io) February 13, 2025 A major growth engine for Flare is liquid staking, which allows users to stake tokens without locking them up. Instead, they are free to use their assets while still participating in the staking process. This phenomenon has become increasingly popular, as it allows users to earn staking rewards without losing access to the assets themselves. That being said, Flare does have a non-limited version of liquid staking under which a user could have their staking rewards and tokens staked in DeFi, too, with the latter without access and using the assets. The way TVL is growing in these areas seems to indicate that Flare is trying to become a more sophisticated, advanced hub for DeFi applications. By going after RWAs (real-world assets) and liquid staking, they’re accommodating a huge range of potential users that could build on or use DeFi applications in their everyday lives—everything from retail to institutional customers. And as DeFi matures, you can’t rule out the use cases moving into the mainstream. Yield Opportunities and the Path to Further Expansion Yet another chief engine of growth for Flare Networks is now found in the promising yield segment. Yield farming and staking have become centerpieces of DeFi. They allow users to earn rewards, and by doing so, they have become essential to the functioning of DeFi platforms. These two activities have allowed Flare to capture a tiny bit more liquidity (it was around $80 million in total value locked last I checked), and the firm claims that yield farming and staking activities on its platform will eventually scale up massively. When they do, they will be offering returns that are by design far more attractive and risk-adjusted than what you might find elsewhere in DeFi. Besides the rise in total value locked, Flare’s user activity has been nothing short of astonishing. The platform now finds itself with about 50,000 daily active addresses, a number that prompts much more than a casual fist bump. These users are not just there for show; they partake in the ecosystem in meaningful ways. Staking is one part of it, but if we throw yield farming into the mix, we might have a healthy little ecosystem here. Wait. What? I feel like staking and yield farming are part of the same activity. Still, if Flare were to distinguish between those two things, it mightn’t be a bad sign for the platform. The steady rise in both active users and transactions reveals Flare’s increasing importance in the DeFi space. As the platform keeps innovating and rolling out new features, we should see its daily user metrics continue to rise, fueling further growth in both its TVL (total value locked) and overall ecosystem activity. Flare Networks in 2025 and Beyond When we gaze into the future, Flare Networks appears to be on a seemingly unstoppable path toward upward success in the DeFi sector. The unabated growth in TVL, active users, and daily transactions suggests that the platform is becoming a more prominent cornerstone of the decentralized finance ecosystem. With RWAs and liquid staking as its mainstays and exciting yield opportunities as its main lure, Flare is pushing deeper into the DeFi territory that promises to deliver the further expansion of its platform. Additionally, Flare is channeling an intensifying focus onto the fusion of traditional finance and decentralized applications, deploying the latter in the form of tokenized RWAs. This makes Flare a network that is, in my eyes, thinking about the future—our future—one in which we might want to increasingly interact with the DeFi solutions being built today. As for where Flare’s increasing visibility might take it, I consider the next segment to be a significant one, given how punishing market conditions have been for crypto institutions over the past year. Flare Networks is an event to keep an eye on as we move deeper into 2025. The DeFi ecosystem on Flare is certainly on the upswing, with an increase in total value locked (TVL) of 400% and a rapidly building user base. For anyone closely observing the DeFi landscape, Flare represents a key platform that is in the midst of capturing new opportunity in the decentralized finance sector.

This development suggests that we are moving toward a new era in the gaming industry in which blockchain-based games are a legitimate use case for the technology. That growth is reflected in the headline numbers of Web3 games: Over 7 million UAW are interacting daily with blockchain-based games. This growth is part of a wider trend in the blockchain sector in which decentralized finance (DeFi) commands the majority of blockchain activity but is now only 1% ahead of gaming. This narrowing gap indicates that, at the present growth rate, gaming could soon surpass DeFi as the leading use case for blockchain technology. This is further emphasized by the fact that emerging technologies like AI are now being integrated into gaming mechanics, and this seems to be the vibrant new frontier for blockchain technology. The Rise of AI-Enhanced Gaming and Emerging Blockchains The growth of blockchain gaming is being driven largely by the emergence of AI-powered gaming dApps. Projects that integrate both AI and blockchain technologies are, in fact, offering players something even better than the “richer” and “deeper” experiences that traditional dApp gaming environments already promised. These are the environments within which players have been increasingly interacting and engaging. Multiplayer virtual adventures with greater stakes—directly tied to the project’s tokenomics—can be found in SAND, the “native” currency of the metaverse built by The Sandbox. In this animated world, characters are programmed using the HTML5-compatible software Unity. While blockchain gaming is increasing in popularity, a few particular blockchains are emerging as the best candidates for carrying the Web3 gaming world. They’ve each carved out a space for themselves by offering unique attributes and optimized infrastructures ideal for supporting gaming applications. The leading gaming blockchain, opBNB, continues to blossom, with successful titles like World of Dypians and Seraph in the Darkness driving its growth. Moving quickly to the second spot, Matchain is now also a rapid adopter of gaming blockchain technology, thanks in part to its popular platform gamification. Aptos is broadening its reach with noteworthy gaming titles like Slime Revolution and STAN, while “Polygon has doubled its gaming activity.” Thanks to well-performing titles like QORPO WORLD and Planet IX, other blockchains such as SKALE and ImmutableX are maintaining steady engagement in the Web3 gaming ecosystem. New Web3 Gaming Ecosystems and January’s Top Games Alongside these well-established blockchains, burgeoning gaming ecosystems are coming online at a rapid pace. TCG Verse (Oasys) has seen a massive uptick in its user base and its title OasChoice is being played and talked about across the internet. ZetaChain has emerged as another front-runner among the new kids on the block driven in no small part by the cute canine cast of characters in Token Tails. Other busting-at-the-seams ecosystems like Calypso (SKALE) have gaming dApps that are a blast to engage with— as well as more gaming dApps on the horizon. Yet another new ecosystem, Kroma, is going to offer something similar to what Calypso does, except that it will be doing it with a much bigger bang since Mantle Network will be Kroma’s financial backer. January 2025 showcased some remarkable innovations within the Web3 gaming space, clearly demonstrating the industry’s upward trajectory. The development team behind World of Dypians stirred excitement by unveiling its 2025 roadmap, which includes AI-driven gameplay and player-versus-player (PvP) combat, alongside the establishment of an NFT marketplace. Meanwhile, Age of Dino, which has launched on Google Play, made significant strides in accessibility, welcoming a much larger audience across the dApps on the Ethereum blockchain. SERAPH: In the Darkness deserves some recognition too; this Web3 game launched its SERAPH token in January 2025 and hosted a $2M NFT staking event. Moreover, blockchain-based games like Pixudi, a Web3 racing board game, and KGeN, which uses Proof of Gamer (POG) NFTs and AI avatars, are gradually drawing in players as they introduce new concepts into gaming. Off The Grid has also heightened engagement through exclusive skins, battle pass updates, and esports collaborations. This trend of increasing player engagement speaks to the growing sophistication of blockchain games and their ability to provide players with more stimulating content. BLOCKCHAIN GAMING SEES 386% GROWTH IN ONE YEAR: WHAT WE KNOW – Over 7 million unique active wallets (UAW) interacted with blockchain games daily last month—a 386% jump since January 2024, according to a DappRadar report. Key Details: – While DeFi still leads in blockchain… pic.twitter.com/J9cJJJHrxu — BSCN (@BSCNews) February 14, 2025 Investment and Future Outlook for Blockchain Gaming Though blockchain gaming has demonstrated strong growth, the industry is currently experiencing a shift in funding. After pulling in an eye-popping $1.8 billion in 2024, the sector saw a much more modest $16 million in funding in January 2025. While this dip in funding could simply be a reflection of the natural ups and downs of a market, many observers see the potential of Web3 gaming as something that is still very much alive and a space that increasingly more players and developers are interacting with. The gaming industry looks set to be disrupted by blockchain technology, and the recent incorporation of Web3 principles like decentralized ownership and play-to-earn has a lot of gamers interested. The integration of AI and the continued expansion of Web3 gaming ecosystems means that blockchain games are offering experiences that go beyond traditional gaming—their audience is wider and more diverse than ever. The future of gaming on the blockchain seems brimming with promise. It’s being pushed by some innovative technologies; by strong, burgeoning ecosystems around the blockchain; and by the not-so-quiet influx of both players and developers, whom one can only presume are doing it for the fun of it. Can’t forget that component. The growth is impressive! 386% over a single year! Something to keep an eye on in 2025 and beyond. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Interestingly, a series of events changed this crypto token from trending to a scam after the insiders entered the market, cashing out $107M. This resulted in the collapse of Argentina coin, leaving investors with massive losses. Let’s discuss. LIBRA Token Price Meteoric Rise and Sudden 90% Fall LIBRA was introduced as part of the Viva La Libertad Project, which aims to stimulate Argentina’s economy by funding smaller businesses and startups. Also, Argentina’s president, Milei, publicly endorsed this coin and urged global investors to participate. This private project will be dedicated to encouraging the growth of the Argentine economy by funding small Argentine businesses and startups, says Milei Interestingly, Javier Milei’s endorsement pumped the LIBRA token price by 3000% to an ATH of $4.5. Moreover, within hours of launch, it attained a fully diluted valuation of $4.5 billion. Similar mania, such as the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins, formed around this token and gained global attention. However, like MELANIA and TRUMP’s price crash , LIBRA crashed by 90%. This crash began with the on-chain analytics revealing that insiders or a few whales control 82% of the LIBRA coin supply. Moreover, the LIBRA team pulled $87 million in USDC and SOL from liquidity and crashed the coin price. However, that was not all, as insiders soon entered the picture and cashed out $107 million. Although they made $20 million in profits, the remaining holders bore heavy losses. At present, LIBRA coin trades at $0.2236 after a 90% drop from its prime per Dexscreener. Also, it has a market capitalization and trading volume of $221.3M and $1.13B significantly. This incident has shaped investors’ sentiments around trending cryptos. Argentina’s President’s U-Turn and Political Fallout President Milei has taken a U-turn from his endorsement after this controversy. In an X post, Milei claimed he was unaware of LIBRA’s inner workings before admitting his failure to do due diligence and has deleted his earlier tweet. More importantly, Milei lashed out at his political opponents, indirectly claiming that they manipulated him and pushed him into the scandal. To the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to harm, I want to say that every day they confirm how vile politicians are, and they increase our conviction to kick them in the ass. However, this is not the first Milei controversy. In 2021, he was caught in a similar situation. He endorsed an alleged Ponzi scheme, CoinX, which promised multiple-fold returns with AI-assisted trading. At that time, investors lost millions, and victims filed lawsuits against Milei. Now, investors have also lost millions of dollars due to this LIBRA token price crash. Experts claim that almost 100% of non-insiders have lost money on this crypto project. One trader faced a $2 million loss within two hours after spending $2.85M to buy 1.11M LIBRA. However, the LIBRA coin crash reduced its worth to just $781,000. Is LIBRA Token Price Crash Another Pump-and-Dump? This incident has sparked serious discussion amid this crypto community, where some have commented that they never trust the president-figure endorsement. Investors’ mindset is turning this way because, before this, the Central African Republic’s CAR token crashed despite reaching a billion valuation. Additionally, US President Donald Trump’s TRUMP meme coin struggles present another volatile project, leading to investors’ concerns over such a launch. Although Milei has turned his back on the project, experts believe his endorsement has violated Article 265 of Argentina’s Penal Code. As a result, Milei may be affected legally, as it would be considered market manipulation and the allegedly pump-and-dump scam. Bottom Line The meteoric rise and sudden fall of the LIBRA token price are testaments to the dangers of speculative crypto projects. Moreover, endorsement and support from big profiles could impact investors seriously. More than the crash, Argentina’s president’s involvement has turned this situation more serious, as it brought global investors’ attention to the LIBRA coin. However, this is not the only incident. Other controversial claims revolve around TRUMP, CAR, and Dave Portnoy’s JAILSTOOL crypto coins. Investors must be cautious when trading in the crypto industry, as trends could become disasters.

40353237,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129126,1739612040,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Strategic Hire: Blockchain.com Onboards Goldman Sachs Veteran as CFO for Bold Crypto IPO Push,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blockchain-com-cfo-crypto-ipo/,"In a significant move signaling its ambitious growth trajectory, leading cryptocurrency platform Blockchain.com has announced the appointment of Justin Evans, formerly the Head of Crypto Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs, as its new Chief Financial Officer (CFO). This strategic hire underscores Blockchain.com’s serious intentions to go public and further solidify its position in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Let’s dive into what this exciting development means for Blockchain.com and the broader crypto industry. Why is the appointment of a CFO with a crypto investment banking background significant? Bringing in Justin Evans, who spearheaded Goldman Sachs’ foray into crypto investment banking, is no ordinary hire. It’s a powerful statement from Blockchain.com about its future direction. Here’s why this appointment is making waves: Deep Crypto Expertise: Evans isn’t just a finance professional; he’s a seasoned expert in the nuances of the cryptocurrency market. His experience at Goldman Sachs in establishing their crypto investment banking division provides him with an unparalleled understanding of both traditional finance and the digital asset space. IPO Readiness: Hiring a CFO with a strong investment banking background, especially one from a Wall Street giant like Goldman Sachs, is a clear signal of IPO ambitions. Evans’ expertise in navigating the complexities of public offerings will be invaluable as Blockchain.com prepares for this major step. Institutional Bridge: Evans’ background bridges the gap between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning crypto industry. This connection can be crucial for Blockchain.com as it seeks to attract institutional investors and partners in its journey towards becoming a publicly traded company. Strategic Vision: A CFO from Goldman Sachs, particularly from their crypto division, is likely to bring a strategic vision aligned with growth and innovation within the digital asset space. This suggests Blockchain.com is not just aiming for an IPO but also for sustained growth and leadership in the crypto market. Blockchain.com CFO : More Than Just Numbers While a CFO’s role is traditionally associated with financial management, Evans’ appointment to Blockchain.com CFO role goes beyond balance sheets and financial reports. His responsibilities will likely encompass: Leading IPO Preparation: Spearheading the complex process of taking Blockchain.com public, from regulatory filings to investor roadshows. Financial Strategy & Growth: Developing and implementing financial strategies that align with Blockchain.com’s ambitious growth plans in the crypto market. Investor Relations: Building and maintaining relationships with investors, especially as the company gears up for its IPO and beyond. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape of the cryptocurrency industry, ensuring Blockchain.com remains compliant and ahead of regulatory changes.

Goldman Sachs Crypto Expertise Now at Blockchain.com The move of Justin Evans from Goldman Sachs Crypto division to Blockchain.com is a testament to the growing allure of pure-play crypto companies. Goldman Sachs, while dipping its toes into crypto, is still a traditional financial institution. Blockchain.com, on the other hand, is a crypto-native company at its core. This transition highlights: Shift in Talent: Top talent is increasingly gravitating towards dedicated crypto firms, recognizing the immense potential and innovation happening in this space. Validation of Crypto Industry: Executives from established financial giants like Goldman Sachs joining crypto companies further validates the maturity and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry. Accelerated Institutional Adoption: Individuals with experience in traditional finance, now within crypto firms, can accelerate institutional adoption by building bridges and fostering trust between the two worlds. Preparing for a Crypto IPO : Workforce Expansion Alongside the CFO announcement, Blockchain.com also revealed plans to increase its workforce by a significant 50%. This aggressive hiring spree is directly linked to the company’s long-term objective of a crypto IPO . Expanding the team is crucial for several reasons: Area Reason for Workforce Expansion Engineering & Development To enhance platform capabilities, develop new products and services, and maintain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving crypto technology landscape. Compliance & Legal To navigate the complex regulatory environment and ensure adherence to global compliance standards, particularly crucial for a company aiming for a public listing. Marketing & Business Development To expand market reach, build brand awareness, attract new users, and drive revenue growth, essential for demonstrating strong business metrics to potential IPO investors. Customer Support To provide excellent customer service as the user base grows, ensuring user satisfaction and platform stickiness. Finance & Operations To strengthen internal operations, financial controls, and reporting mechanisms, all vital for operating as a public company. Impact on Crypto Jobs Market Blockchain.com’s planned workforce expansion is a boon for the crypto jobs market. It signals continued growth and investment in the sector, creating numerous opportunities for professionals seeking to enter or advance their careers in cryptocurrency.

40353224,https://nulltx.com/?p=144897,1739612138,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Surge in Sophisticated Scams: How Emerging Fraudulent Tactics Are Exploiting AI Technology,https://nulltx.com/surge-in-sophisticated-scams-how-emerging-fraudulent-tactics-are-exploiting-ai-technology/,"The realm of cryptocurrency fraud has undergone a concerning evolution of late, with the world’s digital con artists engaging in ever-more sophisticated forms of deception. If one is to believe a recent report from the investigative firm Chainalysis, many of today’s crypto scams are built around systems that use artificial intelligence (AI) in some way—shady chatbots that impersonate real people, for instance, or AI-generated images that make scam websites look all the more convincing. Other recent reports have suggested that some digital swindlers may be using AI to analyze social media and other online spaces for potential marks, or (yet another possibility) to generate text and speech that sound more natural when doing phone or Zoom pitches. The Emergence of New Scams: A Closer Look at the Numbers The Chainalysis report underscores the amazing growth in money earned from many different kinds of scams, with some experiencing truly stunning growth rates as high as 15,000%. These scam types are not only exceptionally profitable but are also becoming more frequent in the online space. All of this is happening at a time when consumer trust in the online world has been shaken by data breaches and other incidents of digital life being hacked, with the online fraud landscape now looking more threatening than ever. Pig Butchering (up 40%) One of the most infamous types of scams that continue to dominate the fraud scene is pig butchering. This con, which generally requires long-term engagement with victims, has become geographically more dispersed in recent years. It usually starts as a seemingly harmless online relationship that gradually morphs into a financial scheme. Most often, victims are led to believe that they’re safe to invest significant amounts of money—upwards of tens of thousands of dollars—only to realize they’ve been duped. But in 2024, the model has evolved. Instead of relying solely on the time-honored “long con” method, fraudsters have adapted the model to quicker-turnaround scams that often involve fake work-from-home job offers or employment scams. These new variants yield smaller deposits, but the sheer volume of victims means that fraudsters still rake in huge amounts of revenue. Crypto Drainers (up 170%) Draining cryptocurrencies through scams has gotten way more popular, and in 2024, that number increased by 170%. Why? Because we have more people in the crypto system now, and they are experiencing the so-called “user error” that a lot of us staunch critics of the crypto world warned against for years. They are familiar with it now, but we warned that they might fall for it—that is, get scammed by a fake platform, or a (dubiously) essential app that somehow gained enough trust to get downloaded. Even in a period of purgatory for cryptocurrencies, with many choosing to only hold Bitcoin, we are at more risk of falling for hook, line, and sinker scams than ever before. Address Poisoning (up 15,000%) Scams that involve misleading people into thinking they are dealing with real, untouched cryptocurrency wallet addresses have increased by an astonishing 15,000%. This type of attack works by changing the wallet address that a user means to send funds to, redirecting the funds right into the scammer’s hands. It’s particularly dangerous because the recipients of the scam can go completely unaware, and they appear to be sending and receiving completely fine transactions if one doesn’t go and dig deep into what the transactions are and who they’re actually going to. Livestream Scams (up 60%+) A scam that has experienced considerable growth in 2024 is livestream scams, which have increased by more than 60%. These scams usually occur on social media platforms, where con artists pretend to be celebrities, influencers, or financial gurus. They might tell viewers that they’re about to miss out on a lucrative investment opportunity or that their lives can be changed if they just send in some money. In the moment, when the viewer is seeing the fake personality in real time, it’s a convincing act. (Sag, 2024). Our Scams Report is out just in time for Valentines Day – and unsurprisingly we’re tracking Billions in proceeds for 2024 in what is likely to be a record year. While Investment and Pig Butchering scams continue to dominate, there is a slew of emerging scams to be wary of pic.twitter.com/yOUPIbEPad — J. Burns Koven (@JBurnsKoven) February 13, 2025 Blackmail and Sextortion (up 175%) The report also reveals a worrying 175% increase in blackmail and sextortion schemes. These schemes involve criminals trying to extort money by threatening to release sensitive personal content. The perpetrators are likely to have access to AI-generated drone footage that helps them get the goods on their victims—who, these days, are almost all online. We’re told that social media, dating apps, and the “online life” make people vulnerable to these attacks. The Role of AI in Shaping the Future of Scams The report makes clear that one of the principal forces propelling these scams upward is the increasing role of AI in the criminal world. The technology of AI is being used in numerous ways, such as making phishing emails seem more believable, or producing fake voices or images for scams. These days, if you’re a fraudster, you can do much of your work with the help of a computer, and the work you do with a computer can be much more automated, much more efficient, and—if you can believe it—much easier to scale up when you target victims. Services powered by AI that have been adapted for use in the scam economy are seeing a dramatic increase in demand. In fact, the revenue of scam tech vendors providing AI services, infrastructure, and data management has skyrocketed. Between 2021 and 2024, the revenues of these AI scam service vendors grew by an astounding 1,900%. This trend shows that the bad guys are no longer relying on dumb tactics. Instead, they’re using AI to create harder-to-detect, more sophisticated scams. A major enabler of these scams is Huione Guarantee, a P2P marketplace that allows fraudsters to buy and sell tools that help run these scams. Huione has become a cornerstone of the scam economy, allowing scam vendors to set up shop and contributing to the rapid growth of the scam economy. Conclusion: A Call for Vigilance and Awareness As we progress deeper into the digital era, we can only expect scams to increase in both sophistication and number. Fraudsters are following the money to our increasingly virtual lives and are turning modern technology — not to mention modern psychology — against us. They use every means available to them and some that aren’t really available but are promised in the ads we see, to get us to part with our money, our identities, and our hope of a secure future. Fighting their onslaught online is going to take clear heads, sharp eyes, and some very good tools. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

40353269,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129127,1739612221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hope Ignites as SEC Acknowledges 21Shares Spot XRP ETF Filing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-acknowledges-xrp-etf-filing/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged the filing for a 21Shares Spot XRP ETF. This exciting development, first reported by BecauseBitcoin.com on X, marks a significant step forward in the quest to bring spot crypto exchange-traded funds to the U.S. market, specifically for XRP. For XRP enthusiasts and the broader crypto community, this acknowledgment sparks a renewed sense of hope and raises crucial questions about the future of crypto investment products. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s such a noteworthy event. What Does SEC Acknowledgment of the 21Shares ETF Filing Mean for a Spot XRP ETF? When the SEC acknowledges a filing, it signifies that the application has been formally received and is under review. It’s a crucial procedural step in the ETF approval process. In the case of the 21Shares ETF filing for a Spot XRP ETF , this acknowledgment means the SEC is officially considering the proposal to list and trade an ETF that directly holds spot XRP. It’s not an approval, but it’s the necessary first step towards potential approval. Think of it as the SEC saying, “Okay, we’ve got your application, let’s take a look.” This news is particularly significant given the SEC’s historical stance on cryptocurrency ETFs, especially those holding cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and Ether directly. The SEC has been cautious, primarily approving futures-based crypto ETFs and only recently greenlighting spot Bitcoin ETFs after a long period of resistance. The acknowledgment of a Spot XRP ETF filing suggests a possible shift in approach or at least a willingness to further engage with the evolving crypto investment landscape. Why is a Spot XRP ETF a Big Deal for Crypto Investors? The potential launch of a Spot XRP ETF holds several key benefits for crypto investors and the XRP market: Increased Accessibility: A Spot XRP ETF would make investing in XRP significantly easier for retail and institutional investors. Currently, accessing XRP often involves navigating cryptocurrency exchanges, managing wallets, and understanding the nuances of digital asset custody. An ETF, traded on traditional stock exchanges, simplifies this process considerably. Investors can gain exposure to XRP through their existing brokerage accounts, just like investing in stocks or traditional ETFs. Enhanced Liquidity and Efficiency: ETFs generally offer high liquidity and trading efficiency. A Spot XRP ETF would likely attract substantial trading volume, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery for XRP. This can benefit both large and small investors. Regulatory Clarity and Comfort: An SEC-approved Spot XRP ETF could provide a sense of regulatory clarity and comfort for investors who have been hesitant to invest directly in cryptocurrencies due to regulatory uncertainties. The ETF structure itself brings a layer of regulatory oversight and investor protection. Potential for Institutional Adoption: Many institutional investors are restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies due to regulatory or internal compliance policies. A Spot XRP ETF could open the door for significant institutional capital to flow into the XRP market, potentially driving up demand and price. Spot vs. Futures: Understanding the Difference in Crypto ETFs It’s important to distinguish between spot and futures-based crypto ETFs. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Spot ETF Futures ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds the cryptocurrency (in this case, XRP) Holds futures contracts that bet on the future price of the cryptocurrency Tracking Accuracy Aims to closely track the spot price of the cryptocurrency May experience tracking errors and deviations from the spot price due to futures market dynamics (e.g., contango, backwardation) Cost Structure Potentially lower costs as it directly holds the asset Can have higher costs due to rolling futures contracts and potential contango effects Investor Exposure Provides direct exposure to the price movements of the cryptocurrency Provides indirect exposure through futures contracts A Spot XRP ETF is generally considered more desirable by investors seeking direct exposure to XRP and potentially more accurate price tracking compared to a futures-based ETF. What are the Challenges and Roadblocks Ahead for the 21Shares Spot XRP ETF? While the SEC acknowledgment is positive, the path to approval for a Spot XRP ETF is not guaranteed and faces several potential hurdles: SEC Scrutiny: The SEC will conduct a thorough review of the 21Shares ETF filing. This includes assessing market surveillance mechanisms, custody arrangements for XRP, and the overall robustness of the XRP market to prevent manipulation and protect investors. The SEC has historically been cautious about approving crypto ETFs, and this scrutiny will likely be intense. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving. The SEC’s views on XRP and other cryptocurrencies could influence their decision. The ongoing legal battles involving XRP’s classification may also play a role. Market Volatility and Risk: Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. The SEC will consider the inherent risks associated with XRP and whether the ETF structure adequately mitigates these risks for investors. Timeline for Approval: ETF approval processes can be lengthy and unpredictable. Even with the acknowledgment, it could take months, or even longer, before a final decision is reached on the 21Shares Spot XRP ETF . There’s also no guarantee of approval. Actionable Insights: What Should XRP Investors Watch For? For those following XRP and the potential Spot XRP ETF , here are some actionable insights: Monitor SEC Filings: Keep an eye on official SEC filings and announcements related to the 21Shares ETF and other crypto ETF applications. Public comments and decisions from the SEC will provide valuable clues about the approval process. Track Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Any significant regulatory changes could impact the SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs. Observe Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment surrounding XRP and crypto ETFs in general. Positive market sentiment and increasing institutional interest can strengthen the case for ETF approval. Understand ETF Mechanics: Familiarize yourself with how ETFs work, including their creation and redemption mechanisms, expense ratios, and potential tracking errors. This knowledge will be helpful if and when a Spot XRP ETF becomes available. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for XRP and Crypto ETFs The SEC acknowledging the 21Shares Spot XRP ETF filing is undoubtedly a positive development for the XRP community and the broader cryptocurrency market. It signifies a step forward in the ongoing journey to bring more accessible and regulated crypto investment products to the U.S. market. While approval is not guaranteed and challenges remain, this news injects a fresh dose of hope and optimism. The potential for a Spot XRP ETF to unlock institutional investment and broaden retail access to XRP is significant. Investors should closely monitor the developments as the SEC’s review process unfolds. This could be a pivotal moment in the evolution of crypto ETFs and XRP’s role in the financial landscape.

40353385,https://nulltx.com/?p=144896,1739612395,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Cryptocurrency Trends: Meme Coins, $BNB, and the Growing Influence of CZ’s Dog",https://nulltx.com/cryptocurrency-trends-meme-coins-bnb-and-the-growing-influence-of-czs-dog/,"The cryptocurrency world is an ever-changing environment, with fresh tokens and new trends oscillating at breakneck speed. Discussions have surged in the crypto community this past Thursday around a few key topics that are grabbing investor and enthusiast attention. Much of the crypto social media platform chatter—particularly on X, formerly Twitter—is focusing on the bullish $BNB price action, the community’s growing excitement about the potential of the new $BOMB token, and the rise of meme coins as a vehicle for driving retail investor interest, among other things. Let’s take a closer look at these trending conversations. Broccoli and Dog: The Meme Coin Phenomenon Among the most surprising trends in the crypto industry is the immediate sensation of the Broccoli token. The meme coin, which associates with the pet dog of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, has suddenly become a hot topic in various social media forums, especially on X, where people have been discussing the substantial uptick in purchases, the market cap, and the trading volume of the token. Investor speculation has hit an all-time high, with many claiming that this new meme coin may be the next big thing in a sector that has seen substantial growth both in terms of interest and actual revenue over the last year. Broccoli’s token is associated with a dog owned by CZ, and so its rise now has the appearance of an amorphous force nudging the value of a meme coin higher. It should be said that Broccoli’s token is not large by any measure, and the coin’s low market cap probably means it is not much more than another poor decision waiting to be made by crypto investors. But that is the secret to meme coins, and why they have value. Broccoli is now a topic of conversation, which gives it value. And because it is a topic of conversation, it is being given more and more value. The Broccoli craze has been the impetus for a broader discussion about meme coins in general. This newly minted token has seen a meteoric rise that has caught the eye of not just some of the investors hoping to make a fast buck, but also people in the cryptocurrency community in general. After all, who doesn’t want to hop on the next “viral” crypto trend? However, like many of its meme coin peers, the Broccoli Token’s success seems primarily tied to the hype and enthusiasm of its online community. And that makes it a pretty risky investment. The Influence of CZ and Dog-Themed Tokens Although Broccoli might be the new meme coin on the block, Dog is also riding the trend for a similar reason. CZ’s pet dog, and the meme coin that now exists in its honor, have also become the focus of growing speculation across the crypto ecosystem. The dog’s name, Broccoli, coupled with CZ’s massive pull in the crypto world, has led to nothing short of a wave of attention from both investors and meme coin enthusiasts. The current meme coin trend, typified by Broccoli, is emblematic of the growing influence of meme coins in the cryptocurrency universe. While having and using a dog mimetic coin was previously considered a thing of the past, it seems that in the summer of 2023, the concept of dog-themed meme coins is back in vogue, much to the glee of some in the know. Now, in addition to Broccoli, there is also a meme coin under development featuring “the pie” in association with Gensler. This coin could also one day become a possible instrument of value for our upcoming token economy. In promoting the meme coin, CZ has undeniably made it more visible, and a lot of users are watching very closely to see what happens with it next. Will it keep going or will it subside into nothingness for the umpteenth time a supposed “community” has done so? It’s too close to call at the moment. But right now, Dog and Broccoli were made so clearly visible that they’ve got a lot of people talking. $BNB: The Bullish Performances and What’s Next for Binance Coin While meme coins hold the crypto conversation, another popular topic of discussion among crypto investors has been the recent performance of $BNB, Binance’s native cryptocurrency. After a series of favorable turns in the cryptocurrency market, $BNB has been trending upward and is now one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap. Just the other day, $BNB surpassed Solana ($SOL) to take the number 5 spot in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization. The top trending topics that are circulating across crypto social media Thursday are: Broccoli is trending due to its association with a meme coin linked to the dog owned by @cz_binance . The Broccoli token has gained attention on social media, particularly X, as users… pic.twitter.com/8GY3p5v6dM — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 13, 2025 The renewed enthusiasm around $BNB’s price has led to what feels like a recent revival for the coin. Supporters of the project are particularly bullish on how upgrades to the Binance ecosystem could soon enhance $BNB’s utility. Even after regulatory changes, Binance has remained “at the front” of the crypto industry, fueled by ongoing speculation about the potential for $BNB to keep heading toward higher and higher highs. The introduction of the meme coin associated with CZ and canines has done nothing but stoke the flames of interest around Binance and its ecosystem. Investors look to the hype and see an impending price surge for every crypto within the Binance ecosystem—especially $BNB. And with $BNB currently at bargain basement prices compared to where it should be, that’s a recipe for a profit opportunity in the minds of many. Solana and DeFi: $SOL’s Rising Potential Unlike the meme coin hubbub associated with Broccoli and Dog, the $SOL performance conversation has been climbing steadily. Of course, under the broader Binance discussion, there’s a clear focus on Binance and its native coin. Yet, many users still seem quite interested—perhaps even invested—in Solana’s potential within the crypto ecosystem. Seen often as an Ethereum alternative, Solana seems to be where a lot of DeFi and staking opportunity conversations are happening these days. Even though some people are skeptical about meme coins, the supporters of Solana are promoting its usefulness in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The supporters claim that users are not just interested in staking $SOL but are also using it in decentralized applications (dApps). Moreover, they claim that these users are discovering a plethora of opportunities within the broader Solana ecosystem. And in light of this, the growing interest in Solana, especially in relation to DeFi, seems to imply that $SOL could see renewed favor over these next few months. While $SOL remains a matter of heated debate, a good many from the crypto community are intently observing how it will stack up against other leading cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin and Ethereum among them—as the market makes its various turns. Conclusion: The Crypto Market’s Evolving Landscape The trending topics from Thursday offer a clear view of the still-changing nature of the cryptocurrency market. While meme coins such as Broccoli and Dog may be leading the conversation, traditional cryptocurrencies such as $BNB and $SOL are still very much the topic of serious discussions about futurism, long-term growth, and DeFi potential. As the market changes, it seems increasingly likely that both new trends and established tokens will shape the future of both conversation and the still-nascent crypto space. Right now, though, investors are watching these developments closely, and with good reason. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

40353373,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129129,1739612420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Revival: SafeMoon Launches Solana Memecoin After Massive SFM Burn,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/safemoon-solana-memecoin-launch/,"In a surprising turn of events for the SafeMoon community, the project, now under the wing of the VGX Foundation, is embarking on a new chapter. Following a substantial 2.2 trillion SFM token burn, SafeMoon is set to launch a brand-new memecoin on the Solana blockchain. This strategic move, slated for 1:00 a.m. UTC this Saturday, has sparked considerable discussion and anticipation within the crypto sphere. Will this bold step be the key to SafeMoon’s crypto recovery , or is it another gamble in the volatile world of digital assets? Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing development. Why Solana Memecoin? Exploring SafeMoon’s Strategic Shift Why Solana? This question is likely on the minds of many following the SafeMoon announcement. Choosing Solana for their new memecoin launch isn’t arbitrary; it’s a calculated move with several potential benefits. Solana is renowned for its high throughput and low transaction fees, making it an attractive platform for memecoins that thrive on rapid trading and community engagement. Let’s break down why Solana could be the ideal blockchain for SafeMoon’s new venture: Scalability and Speed: Solana can handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), far exceeding many other blockchains. This scalability is crucial for a memecoin, where transaction volume can spike dramatically during periods of hype or market volatility. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to Ethereum, Solana boasts significantly lower transaction fees. This affordability makes it easier for users to trade and interact with the memecoin, encouraging broader participation. Vibrant Ecosystem: Solana’s ecosystem is burgeoning with decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi projects, and a passionate community. Launching a Solana memecoin taps into this existing network and potentially attracts new users to the SafeMoon ecosystem. Developer-Friendly Environment: Solana’s robust developer tools and supportive community make it easier for projects to build and deploy applications. This likely streamlined SafeMoon’s process of creating and launching their new memecoin. However, the move to Solana also presents challenges. While Solana is technologically advanced, it has faced periods of network congestion and outages in the past. SafeMoon will need to ensure robust infrastructure and smart contract security to avoid potential pitfalls on the Solana network. The SFM Burn: Clearing the Decks for a Fresh Start? Before the Solana memecoin launch, SafeMoon executed a substantial SFM burn of 2.2 trillion tokens. Token burning is a common practice in the crypto world, often used to reduce the circulating supply of a token, potentially increasing scarcity and value for remaining holders. In SafeMoon’s case, this burn can be interpreted as a symbolic and practical step towards a fresh start. Here’s a closer look at the implications of the SFM burn : Aspect Implication of SFM Burn Reduced Supply Decreases the total number of SFM tokens in circulation, potentially leading to increased value for the remaining tokens if demand stays constant or increases. Symbolic Restart Signals a break from the past and a commitment to a new direction under the VGX Foundation’s leadership. It’s a way to symbolically ‘clean house’ after the project’s turbulent history. Attracts New Investors A reduced supply narrative can be appealing to new investors who might perceive it as a sign of future price appreciation. Boosts Confidence Can reassure existing holders that the project is taking proactive steps to improve its tokenomics and long-term prospects. However, it’s crucial to remember that token burning alone doesn’t guarantee success. The fundamental value and utility of the new memecoin, along with the project’s overall strategy, will ultimately determine its fate. VGX Wallet: Your Gateway to the New Memecoin For existing SFM holders, the VGX wallet will be the key to participating in the new Solana memecoin launch. SafeMoon has announced that SFM holders will be able to swap their tokens for the new memecoin directly through the VGX wallet. This process is designed to facilitate a smooth transition and offer a pathway for SFM holders to potentially recover some value. Here’s what SFM holders need to know about the VGX wallet swap: Exclusive Access: The swap is initially intended for existing SFM holders, rewarding community members who have remained loyal to the project. Liquidity Restoration: A primary goal of this swap is to inject liquidity into the new memecoin. By allowing SFM holders to exchange their tokens, SafeMoon aims to create initial trading volume and establish a market for the new asset. Potential Fund Recovery: For SFM holders who may have seen their investments dwindle, this swap offers a chance to potentially recover some of their funds through the new memecoin, assuming it gains traction and value. Wallet Requirement: Users will need to download and use the VGX wallet to participate in the swap. Ensure you download the official VGX wallet from trusted sources to avoid scams. It’s important for users to conduct their own due diligence and understand the terms of the swap before participating. While this initiative aims to benefit SFM holders, the value of the new memecoin will depend on market dynamics and community adoption. Can SafeMoon Achieve Crypto Recovery? Navigating the Road Ahead SafeMoon’s journey has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. From its meteoric rise to its dramatic fall and subsequent bankruptcy filing in 2023, the project has weathered significant storms. The previous leadership faced serious fraud allegations, casting a long shadow over the project’s reputation. Now, under the ownership of the VGX Foundation, SafeMoon is attempting a phoenix-like crypto recovery with this Solana memecoin launch. The path to recovery is fraught with challenges. Rebuilding trust within the crypto community, especially after the project’s past controversies, will be a monumental task. The success of the new memecoin hinges on several factors: Community Engagement: Memecoins thrive on community support and hype. SafeMoon needs to reignite its community and attract new participants to the Solana-based memecoin. Utility and Innovation: While memecoins are often driven by hype, projects with some form of utility or innovative features tend to have greater longevity. SafeMoon will need to articulate the value proposition of this new memecoin beyond just speculation. Transparency and Communication: The VGX Foundation must prioritize transparency and open communication to regain the trust of the community and demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices. Market Conditions: The broader crypto market sentiment will also play a role. A bullish market could provide a tailwind for the new memecoin, while a bearish market could present additional headwinds. Despite the hurdles, SafeMoon’s move to launch a memecoin on Solana is undeniably ambitious and potentially transformative. It’s a high-stakes gamble that could either pave the way for a remarkable comeback or become another chapter in the project’s turbulent saga. The crypto world will be watching closely to see how this unfolds. Conclusion: A New Dawn for SafeMoon? SafeMoon’s decision to launch a memecoin on Solana after a significant SFM burn marks a pivotal moment for the project. This strategic shift represents a bold attempt at crypto recovery and a fresh start under new leadership. By leveraging Solana’s robust blockchain and offering a swap for existing SFM holders via the VGX wallet, SafeMoon is aiming to reignite community interest and restore liquidity. Whether this ambitious endeavor will succeed remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly injects a new dose of intrigue into the SafeMoon narrative. The crypto community now awaits to witness if this is the beginning of a true revival for SafeMoon, or simply another fleeting moment in the ever-evolving world of digital currencies.

40353533,https://nulltx.com/?p=144895,1739612736,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Pumpfun’s Roller Coaster Ride: Trading Volume Declines, But Solana Activity Still Dominates",https://nulltx.com/pumpfuns-roller-coaster-ride-trading-volume-declines-but-solana-activity-still-dominates/,"The cryptocurrency market can shift as dramatically from day to day as the stock market, and for many of the same reasons. One of the more prominent players in the Solana network ecosystem is a company called Pumpfun. Their project has seen a very recently significant increase in trading volume and token issuance, after several decreases late last year and in February. Despite the decreases and apparent calm, Pumpfun remains a major phenom in the Solana SPL token market, making some very substantial deposits, along with a trading appearance that is still worth trading on. Trading Volume and Token Creation Decline On February 13, Pumpfun reported a daily trading volume of $270 million, which was nearly 50% lower than its peak trading volume on January 23. This decline in trading activity is significant, as it might signal a potential reduction in interest in the platform after a period of intense trading. Along with the reduced trading volume, the number of tokens created on the platform also saw a decline, dropping by approximately 30% from its peak. On February 13, 50,371 tokens were issued, reflecting a pronounced drop in the creation of new tokens compared to earlier highs. On February 13, Pumpfun's daily trading volume was $270 million, down about 50% from its peak on January 23; the number of tokens created on that day was 50,371, down about 30% from its peak. However, Pump fun still accounts for 60% of the daily issuance of Solana network SPL… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 14, 2025 Even with these decreases, Pumpfun retains an authoritative status on the Solana network. As stated by @adam_tehc, Pumpfun is responsible for a stunning 60% of the tokens that are issued on a daily basis as Solana SPL tokens. This incredibly high number basically means that, while trading on the Solana network may have slowed down, the Pumpfun platform is still a big part of the Solana ecosystem and is performing a lot of token issuance through its mechanisms. Pumpfun’s Impact on Solana’s Network Information about Pumpfun’s activity sheds light on exactly how influential the platform is in the Solana ecosystem. Despite a trading volume that has dropped on a day-to-day basis, Pumpfun represents a portion of Solana’s total SPL token issuance that is not insignificant. This says a lot about the scale and activity level of the platform within the Solana network. SPL tokens, Solana’s token standard and similar to Ethereum’s ERC-20, are necessary for the functioning of many projects on the Solana blockchain. By accounting for 60% of the daily issuance, Pumpfun continues to influence the Solana token market, which is integral to the blockchain’s attraction, especially in the case of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Until further notice, then, Solana’s status as one of the other blockchain ecosystems enjoying some traction in the world of crypto will also mean that Pumpfun’s reach extends to a significant part of crypto’s appeal. Pumpfun’s Ongoing Transactions and Kraken Deposits Besides holding a market share of token issuance, Pumpfun has been busy banking substantial sums at Kraken, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. Just 30 minutes ago from the time of this writing, it deposited 148,759 SOL (approximately $28.22 million) into its account at the exchange. This transaction marks another in a series of what seem to be the platform’s first banking deposits—at least, its first ones we know about—into an actual regulated financial entity. So far, Pumpfun has sent an impressive 2,280,377 SOL, approximately worth $462 million, to Kraken. But that is not all. The Solana token has also been used to further boost the platform’s bottom line. A figure of 264,373 SOL, to be precise, has been sold off since last December. Pumpfun’s treasury is now laden with 41.64 million in USDC that’s just sitting there. When it comes to movement, that is an almost palpably still state. At least, it would be, if not for the fact that what happens in Solana’s treasury accounts is part of a larger where-next-for-Pumpfun strategy. Pumpfun( @pumpdotfun ) deposited 148,759 $SOL ($28.22M) to #Kraken again 30 mins ago. So far, #Pumpfun has deposited 2,280,377 $SOL ($462M) to #Kraken and sold 264,373 $SOL for 41.64M $USDC . #Pumpfun has earned a total of 2,844,614 $SOL ($540.5M). https://t.co/nV7J1QTdGv pic.twitter.com/oD5Lbv6xld — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 13, 2025 Right now, Pumpfun has an accumulated total of 2,844,614 SOL, which equals a jaw-dropping $540.5 million. These earnings further reinforce Pumpfun’s profile as a major player in the Solana ecosystem, particularly given its sizable contributions to liquidity and transaction volumes in the market. This significant earning power underscores the platform’s ongoing effective operation, despite ups and downs in Solana trading activity. What’s Next for Pumpfun and Solana? The question that remains to be answered as we project forward is this: what’s next for Pumpfun and the Solana ecosystem? Despite the recent downturns in trading volume and in what we might call “tokenic activity,” the recent consistent deposits to Kraken and the dominant position on SPL token issuance suggest that, when it comes to the platform layer, there is a next for Pumpfun. Beyond that, if there is a long-term sustainable and growth-viable programming model for the Solana ecosystem, Pumpfun is certainly part of that potential picture. These developments suggest broader implications: Solana looks to have a pretty good chance of emerging as a strong competitor in the blockchain space, especially with activity on the network ramping up courtesy of platforms like Pumpfun. Going forward, it will be worth watching to see how many more projects build on Solana and whether their performance starts to stabilize or, even better, rebound after what looks to have been an unfortunate few months in the summer of 2023. For investors, traders, and crypto enthusiasts, what Pumpfun does on Solana and Kraken is an important indicator of the health of the ongoing market and the broader crypto ecosystem. Predicting the platform’s future and the impact it will have on Solana’s network is probably best left to the Nostradamuses of the crypto world. But one thing seems certain: Pumpfun is a force contributing to the overall growth of the Solana ecosystem and is a trend-influencer on the growing Solana blockchain.

40353546,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129132,1739612746,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: ParaFi Capital’s Massive $420M Crypto Holdings Spark Institutional Interest,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/parafi-capital-crypto-holdings/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with the latest reveal from ParaFi Capital, a prominent crypto investment firm. A recent 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has unveiled the magnitude of their digital asset portfolio, showcasing a significant $420 million stake in the crypto market. This news not only underscores the continued institutional appetite for cryptocurrencies but also shines a spotlight on the strategic crypto holdings of key players in the financial space. Let’s delve into the details of this noteworthy disclosure and what it signifies for the broader crypto landscape. Decoding ParaFi Capital’s Massive Crypto Holdings ParaFi Capital’s 13F filing offers a fascinating glimpse into the firm’s investment strategy. According to the document, their crypto holdings are primarily concentrated in two leading cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin: A substantial $318.9 million is allocated to Bitcoin, solidifying its position as the king of cryptocurrencies in institutional portfolios. Ethereum: Following closely behind, Ethereum accounts for $43.6 million of ParaFi’s holdings, demonstrating the firm’s belief in the potential of the Ethereum network and its native token. These figures, when combined, bring ParaFi Capital’s total disclosed cryptocurrency investment portfolio to a noteworthy $419 million. This revelation is significant for several reasons, which we’ll explore further. Why is ParaFi Capital’s Disclosure Important for Institutional Crypto? The disclosure of ParaFi Capital’s substantial crypto holdings through an SEC 13F filing is more than just a routine regulatory update. It carries considerable weight and offers valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of institutional crypto adoption. Here’s why this information matters: Transparency and Regulatory Compliance: Filing a 13F with the SEC signals a move towards greater transparency within the cryptocurrency investment space. ParaFi Capital , by adhering to these regulatory requirements, is setting a precedent for other firms and fostering trust within the market. Institutional Confidence Indicator: The sheer size of ParaFi Capital’s investment – nearly half a billion dollars – is a strong indicator of institutional confidence in cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates that sophisticated investment firms are not just dipping their toes into crypto but are making significant allocations. Market Validation: News of such substantial crypto holdings from a reputable firm like ParaFi Capital can act as validation for the broader crypto market. It can encourage other institutions and even retail investors to consider digital assets as part of a diversified investment strategy. Strategic Asset Allocation Insights: The breakdown of ParaFi Capital’s portfolio, with a significant emphasis on Bitcoin and Ethereum, provides insights into current institutional preferences. It highlights the dominance of these two cryptocurrencies in the institutional investment landscape. Bitcoin Investment: ParaFi’s Billion-Dollar Bet The lion’s share of ParaFi Capital’s disclosed crypto holdings is dedicated to Bitcoin investment . With nearly $319 million allocated to Bitcoin, it’s clear that the firm sees significant long-term value in the original cryptocurrency. This massive Bitcoin investment aligns with a broader trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Why are institutions like ParaFi Capital so bullish on Bitcoin? Store of Value Narrative: Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized nature resonate with institutions seeking assets that can preserve value over time, particularly in inflationary environments. Growing Institutional Infrastructure: The development of robust custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and Bitcoin ETFs has made it easier and safer for institutions to invest in Bitcoin. Mainstream Adoption: As Bitcoin gains wider acceptance from corporations, governments, and the general public, its long-term prospects as a mainstream asset class improve. Diversification Benefits: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversification tool for institutional portfolios. ParaFi Capital’s Bitcoin investment is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its role as a cornerstone of the digital asset market. Ethereum Investment: Betting on the Future of Decentralized Applications While Bitcoin investment dominates ParaFi Capital’s portfolio, their $43.6 million allocation to Ethereum investment is also noteworthy. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is more than just a digital currency; it’s a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and the burgeoning world of DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Why is Ethereum attracting institutional investment alongside Bitcoin? Smart Contract Functionality: Ethereum’s ability to execute smart contracts opens up a vast range of applications, from DeFi protocols to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and beyond. This versatility makes it attractive for investors looking beyond simple store-of-value assets. DeFi Ecosystem Growth: The rapid growth of the DeFi ecosystem, largely built on Ethereum, presents significant investment opportunities in lending, borrowing, decentralized exchanges, and other financial services. Technological Innovation: Ethereum is constantly evolving and innovating, with ongoing upgrades like the transition to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge) aimed at improving scalability, security, and sustainability. Web3 Foundation: Ethereum is seen as a foundational layer for Web3, the next iteration of the internet focused on decentralization and user ownership, further enhancing its long-term potential. ParaFi Capital’s Ethereum investment signifies a strategic bet on the future of decentralized applications and the transformative potential of the Ethereum network. ParaFi Capital: Who are They and Why Does Their Investment Matter? Understanding ParaFi Capital is crucial to grasping the significance of their disclosed crypto holdings . ParaFi Capital is a leading alternative investment firm focused on decentralized finance and Web3 technologies. They are known for their deep understanding of the crypto space and their strategic investments in promising blockchain projects and digital assets. Key Aspects of ParaFi Capital: Aspect Description Focus Area Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Web3 Technologies Investment Strategy Early-stage investments in blockchain projects and strategic holdings in established cryptocurrencies. Reputation Highly respected within the crypto industry for their expertise and insightful investment decisions. Impact on Market Their investment decisions are closely watched and can influence market sentiment and trends. Given ParaFi Capital’s expertise and reputation, their substantial crypto holdings carry significant weight. Their investment decisions are often seen as a bellwether for broader institutional trends in the crypto market. The Future of Institutional Crypto: What Does ParaFi’s Filing Tell Us? ParaFi Capital’s 13F filing, revealing their impressive crypto holdings , paints a clear picture of the growing integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. This disclosure, alongside similar filings from other institutional investors, suggests that institutional crypto adoption is not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in the investment landscape. Key Takeaways for the Future of Institutional Crypto: Continued Growth: We can expect to see continued growth in institutional crypto investment as regulatory clarity improves and the market matures. Diversification Across Crypto Assets: While Bitcoin and Ethereum currently dominate institutional portfolios, we may see diversification into other cryptocurrencies and digital assets as the market evolves. Integration with Traditional Finance: The lines between traditional finance and the crypto market are blurring, with increasing integration and collaboration between the two sectors. Focus on DeFi and Web3: Institutions are likely to increase their exposure to DeFi and Web3 technologies, recognizing their potential to disrupt traditional industries and create new investment opportunities. ParaFi Capital’s disclosed crypto holdings serve as a powerful signal that institutional crypto is here to stay and is poised for further expansion in the years to come. Conclusion: ParaFi Capital’s Bold Crypto Move Signals a New Era for Digital Assets The revelation of ParaFi Capital’s $420 million crypto holdings is a landmark moment for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets within institutional investment portfolios. Their significant Bitcoin investment and strategic Ethereum investment highlight the continued dominance of these two cryptocurrencies while also signaling a broader trend of institutional interest in the crypto space. As more institutional players like ParaFi Capital make substantial allocations to crypto holdings , the market is likely to experience increased stability, maturity, and further innovation. This is undoubtedly a pivotal time for the crypto industry, and ParaFi Capital’s bold move serves as a compelling indicator of the exciting future that lies ahead for digital assets.

The former Speaker of the House quietly purchased 50 call options in the AI healthcare company, and since that disclosure on January 25, the stock has more than tripled in value. Nancy’s trade was valued between $50,000 and $100,000. By Friday’s market close, Tempus AI was up by 183%, adding to its 13% surge post-market. Though even before this, the stock was already climbing after the company announced a collaboration with the Institute for Follicular Lymphoma Innovation, which will allegedly bring Tempus AI’s data analytics platform, Lens, into the fight against follicular lymphoma (FL), a type of blood cancer. The FL treatment market is projected to grow from $2.77 billion in 2023 to nearly $4.65 billion by 2030. Nancy consistently outperforms the stock market According to the SEC disclosures, Nancy bought the Tempus contracts with a strike price of $20, expiring January 16, 2026. That detail alone was enough for investors to start buying up the stock. Nancy’s history with outrageously well-timed stock trades is well-documented. According to Unusual Whales, her 2024 returns hit 70.9%, blowing past the S&P 500’s 24.9% gain. Her trades consistently outperform the market, which has raised questions about how politicians manage to make such profitable bets while holding key positions in government. Anyway, Tempus is going to report its Q4 earnings on February 24, and all the 12 analysts from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs that cover the stock predict a loss of $0.15 per share on $202.8 million in revenue as of February 14. Despite the stock’s explosive rise, their one-year price target is $58.55 per share, which implies a 30% downside risk from current levels. Jonathan Krinsky, BTIG’s chief market technician, predicts that AI and tech stocks are approaching levels not seen in nearly two months, pointing to the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq-100. The QQQ hit its highest level since December 18, the same day the Federal Reserve announced fewer rate cuts in 2025. Markets sold off immediately after that meeting, and the QQQ has mostly stayed within a 4% range since then. Krinsky says this return to the “scene of the crime” could mean a pullback is coming. Meta, which has a 4% weight in the QQQ, has been leading the index’s recent push higher, climbing 6.4% in February alone. But Krinsky warned that if Meta corrects, it could drag the entire QQQ down with it. He added that while fading Nasdaq strength hasn’t worked for the last few years, there are now enough warning signs to suggest caution.

40353640,https://nulltx.com/?p=144894,1739612919,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Whale Offloads $1.27 Million Worth of LINK — Is a Dump Coming?,https://nulltx.com/whale-offloads-1-27-million-worth-of-link-is-a-dump-coming/,"The current cryptocurrency market cannot escape the effects of large transactions, especially when they involve the sizeable holdings of investors we call whales. Right now, the latest move in the Chainlink ($LINK) market by a large-scale investor is attracting a lot of attention. An address known to hold a massive amount of LINK token has just unloaded 70,000 of the tokens in a sale whose total value is approximately $1.27 million, and that was done in USDC. The sale happened just 10 hours ago, and the individual we now suspect to be a whale went ahead and moved the tokens at an average price of about $18.143 per token. And now we are left to wonder what this means for the future of LINK. Whale Activity: A Sign of Profit-Taking or Bearish Sentiment? For numerous persons, the offloading of such a large amount of LINK raises worries about possible downward pressure on the price. Large transactions like these often signal sentiment changes, and whales can influence the market—particularly in the short term. Yet, when you look a little deeper into this whale’s trading history, the story becomes more interesting. This specific whale has been steadily accumulating LINK tokens since November 2023. He or she has made purchases from an array of platforms, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), Kraken, KuCoin, and BitMEX. From November to now, this whale has secured a total of 150,473 LINK tokens, at an average price of $15.855 per token, which amounts to a total investment of $2.386 million. It has now offloaded 70,000 LINK for $1.27 million. This is part of a strategy—why not sell some after 16.6% profit—to take some gains and still hold a good chunk (80,473 LINK, $1.5 million) in the “LINK-ing” whale game. Another weird thing about this play is that while the whale still holds 80,473 LINK, it all now seems to be in for this weird silent heist to keep growing the whales’ offshore bank vault. Whale Offloading $LINK —Is It Dump Time? Looks like it's LINK’s turn to hit the sell button! 10 hours ago, whale 0x137 offloaded 70,000 LINK for $1.27M USDC at $18.143 per token. pic.twitter.com/j9SEJzrgVo — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) February 14, 2025 Even though the immediate offloading might appear like a bearish signal to some, the whale’s actions could be more strategic than they seem. Taking profits after a 16.6% upswing is an often-seen tactic, especially among traders of volatile assets. The whale still holds a substantial amount of LINK tokens, which makes a scenario of being bearish in the long term unlikely. Instead, this trader is perhaps setting up a more complex, less-than-obvious plan to trade LINK with greater frequency. What Does This Mean for LINK’s Price? The question on everybody’s lips nowadays is: Will LINK take a nosedive after the whale’s sale? The short answer is that it’s no easier to predict this with any degree of certainty than it is to predict any other phase of the cryptocurrency market. But large sell-offs often lead to price drops, and even though we at Chainlink aren’t proponents of the whale in question, and even though we think that he or she presumably has a somewhat paltry view of the project’s long-term outlook if he or she thinks it’s time to sell a large chunk of LINK, we cannot help but serve up an easy-to-fall-for narrative of impending price doom. In addition, LINK’s basic market principles are quite sturdy, with the token being one of the most extensively utilized in the crypto sphere for external data integration and smart contract automation. Consequently, even though a price dip in the short term is possible, the long-term price outlook for Chainlink shouldn’t see much impairment, if any, from one big whale’s sell-off. If traders who know about the whale’s movements utilize the price dip for stabilization, the market could get even more stabilized. The Bigger Picture: Whale Behavior and Market Sentiment Investor activity among the large players is watched closely because these market-movers tend to have a better sense of when and how to take action and are more often right than wrong in setting the kind of market-timed trends that we then all follow. Whales are unquestionably a leading indicator in that respect. But that doesn’t give us cause to overreact to any one particular move that our friendly whale makes. And in this case, for sure, our whale friend here already appears to be pretty well positioned with a far-from-insignificant profit on their LINK holdings and is likely gearing up for some more action. It’s also important to point out that even though selling off 70,000 LINK appears to be a sizable divestiture, this figure constitutes only a tiny fraction of the total circulating supply of LINK. And while we have no crystal ball for how these events will affect the price in the immediate future, we do have some idea of what is likely to have a greater influence on the price of LINK in the medium to long term. These are: (1) overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, (2) adoption of decentralized oracles, and (3) Chainlink’s partnerships. Conclusion: Should Traders Be Concerned? The sale of 70,000 LINK by whale 0x137 might have seemed like a worrying development to some traders, but a closer look shows the situation is probably not as alarming as it looks. For one, the same whale still holds 80,473 LINK tokens, so it’s not as if 0x137 is bailing on LINK altogether. Furthermore, the trade netted the seller a nice little bundle of cash, given that they seemed to have sold at a point where LINK was still above a dollar. In any event, the situation is likely to be more of a non-issue than anything else, so don’t read too much into it. In the next few days, it will be imperative for traders and investors to keep an eye on any further developments by the large players in the Chainlink market and to be vigilant for any shifts in overall market sentiment. Should the whale choose to keep dumping or other large holders in Chainlink follow his lead, then the price of Chainlink, aka LINK, may experience even more downward pressure. Conversely, if LINK remains a high-profile and highly useful key asset in the DeFi (decentralized finance) ecosystem, then it may also experience a quick recovery and continue on the nice upward trajectory it has been on for much of 2020.

But instead of excitement, his post on X caused concern, with many suspecting a possible scam. Seeing the backlash, Milei quickly deleted his post , insisting he had no financial gain from the project. Milei has been trying to fix Argentina’s struggling economy, but foreign investors remain hesitant. While inflation is cooling and reforms are underway, businesses are still leaving. The country also faces challenges like U.S. trade tariffs and problems with key industries, making economic recovery uncertain. From a $4.5 Billion Hype to a Sudden Collapse LIBRA looked promising at first, hitting a massive $4.5 billion valuation within hours. But the excitement didn’t last. Soon after launch, developers reportedly withdrew $87 million in USDC and SOL from the project, causing the token’s price to drop 85%. Investors panicked, and those who bought in early saw huge losses—on average, over 56% of their initial investment. Another big red flag? Blockchain analysts quickly noticed some unusual activity. On-chain expert EmberCN found that certain wallets had withdrawn funds from exchanges before Milei’s post, bought LIBRA right after the promotion, and then sold once the price spiked. These insiders reportedly made around $20 million in profit. About 82% of LIBRA’s supply is controlled by just a few connected wallets. This means a small group of people have too much power over the token’s price, which could be used to manipulate the market.

Works. Every. Time. — Cryptaveli (@cryptaveli) February 15, 2025 Who’s Backing LIBRA? LIBRA is connected to KIP Network Inc., the company behind the KIP Protocol, a Web3 project backed by Animoca Ventures. KIP Network has been involved in Argentina’s crypto space and even worked with the Buenos Aires government. However, their role in the LIBRA sell-off is unclear, leaving many investors feeling uneasy. Coinbase’s head of product, Conor Grogan, commented on the situation. He said that major token launches like this are usually planned long before they go public. His comment suggests that LIBRA may have been designed to grab quick cash from the start. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : President Trump’s Crypto Czar Teases Big Announcement Coming Soon! , Another Political Crypto Failure?

40353685,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129134,1739613041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Visionary West Virginia Senator Introduces Bold Crypto Reserve Bill: A Strategic Leap into Digital Assets?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/west-virginia-crypto-reserve-bill/,"Is West Virginia about to make a groundbreaking move into the world of cryptocurrency? State Senator Chris Rose has ignited a spark of innovation by proposing a bill that could see the state treasury holding cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset. This isn’t just another piece of legislation; it’s a potentially transformative step that could redefine how states manage their finances and engage with the burgeoning digital economy. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it could mean for West Virginia and the broader crypto landscape. What is the West Virginia Crypto Reserve Bill Proposing? At its core, the proposed bill is remarkably straightforward yet potentially revolutionary. Senator Rose’s initiative, as reported by Cointelegraph, suggests that West Virginia should allocate a portion of its treasury assets to cryptocurrency reserve and precious metals. The bill sets a clear limit, proposing that investments in these alternative assets should not exceed 10% of the state’s total assets. This cautious approach acknowledges both the potential upside and the inherent volatility associated with digital currencies. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects of the proposed crypto reserve bill : Asset Allocation: Up to 10% of the state treasury’s assets can be invested in cryptocurrencies or precious metals. Holding Methods: The state would have the flexibility to hold these digital assets either directly on-chain (managing their own private keys and blockchain interactions) or through regulated exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs offer a more traditional investment vehicle, providing exposure to crypto without the complexities of direct custody. Strategic Reserve: The bill frames cryptocurrency not just as an investment, but as a ‘strategic reserve asset,’ suggesting a long-term view and recognition of its potential value beyond short-term gains. Why is West Virginia Considering a State Crypto Investment? The question naturally arises: why would a state government consider investing in something as volatile and relatively new as cryptocurrency? Several compelling reasons could be driving this initiative for state crypto investment : Diversification: Traditional state treasury reserves are often heavily weighted in government bonds and cash. Adding cryptocurrency can diversify the portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk and enhancing returns, especially in times of inflation or economic uncertainty. Future-Proofing Finances: Embracing digital assets can position West Virginia at the forefront of financial innovation. As the world becomes increasingly digital, holding cryptocurrency could be seen as a forward-thinking strategy to participate in and benefit from the growth of the digital economy. Attracting Innovation and Talent: A state that is crypto-friendly and invests in digital assets might attract blockchain companies, tech talent, and younger demographics who are more inclined towards digital finance. This could boost the state’s economy and create new opportunities. Hedge Against Inflation: Some argue that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, can act as a hedge against inflation due to their limited supply and decentralized nature. In an environment where inflation is a concern, this could be an attractive attribute for a state treasury. What are the Potential Benefits of Holding a Cryptocurrency Reserve? The potential benefits of West Virginia venturing into cryptocurrency reserve are multifaceted and could have a significant impact on the state’s financial health and economic outlook. Benefit Description Enhanced Returns Cryptocurrencies, while volatile, have historically offered significant returns compared to traditional assets. Even a small allocation could boost overall portfolio performance. Reduced Reliance on Traditional Markets Diversifying into crypto can reduce dependence on traditional stock and bond markets, providing a buffer against economic downturns in those sectors. Technological Leadership Being an early adopter of cryptocurrency as a reserve asset can position West Virginia as a leader in technological innovation among states, attracting positive attention and investment. Increased Transparency Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies, offers unparalleled transparency. On-chain holdings can be publicly auditable, potentially increasing trust and accountability in state finances. What Challenges Might West Virginia Face? While the potential benefits are enticing, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks associated with a West Virginia crypto reserve. Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its extreme price swings. A significant downturn could lead to substantial losses in the state treasury’s holdings, raising concerns from taxpayers and critics. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in federal or state regulations could impact the legality or practicality of holding crypto reserves. Security Risks: Holding cryptocurrencies, especially on-chain, requires robust security measures to protect against hacking and theft. The state would need to invest in expertise and infrastructure to manage these risks effectively. Public Perception and Education: Cryptocurrency is still not fully understood by the general public. West Virginia would need to engage in public education to explain the rationale behind this move and address potential concerns. Examples of Crypto Adoption in Government and Finance West Virginia wouldn’t be entirely alone in exploring cryptocurrency adoption, although state-level treasury reserves are still a relatively novel concept. However, there are growing examples of governments and financial institutions engaging with digital assets: Miami and Bitcoin: Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, exploring initiatives like paying city employees in Bitcoin and holding Bitcoin on the city’s balance sheet. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Adoption: El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, though this move has faced both praise and criticism. It demonstrates a nation-state taking a bold step into the crypto world. Corporate Treasuries: Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have allocated portions of their corporate treasuries to Bitcoin, viewing it as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Institutional Investment: Major financial institutions, including asset managers and banks, are increasingly offering cryptocurrency investment products and services to their clients, indicating growing institutional acceptance. Actionable Insights: What’s Next for the Crypto Reserve Bill? For those following this development, here are some actionable insights and points to consider: Track the Bill’s Progress: Keep an eye on the West Virginia legislature’s website to follow the progress of Senator Rose’s bill. Public hearings, committee votes, and floor debates will provide crucial updates. Engage with Representatives: If you are a West Virginia resident, consider contacting your state representatives to express your views on the bill. Public opinion can influence legislative outcomes. Educate Yourself: Regardless of your location, this bill highlights the growing importance of understanding cryptocurrency and its potential impact on finance and governance. Continue to learn about digital assets and blockchain technology. Monitor Other States: West Virginia’s initiative could set a precedent. Watch if other states begin to consider similar legislation. State-level adoption could be a significant catalyst for broader crypto acceptance. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future? Senator Chris Rose’s crypto reserve bill in West Virginia is undoubtedly a bold and potentially transformative proposal. It reflects a growing recognition of the significance of digital assets and their potential role in the future of finance. While challenges and risks exist, the potential benefits of diversification, innovation, and future-proofing state finances are compelling. Whether this bill becomes law remains to be seen, but it has already sparked an important conversation about the role of cryptocurrency in government and the strategic management of public funds. West Virginia’s exploration of a state crypto investment could be a bellwether, signaling a new era of engagement between state governments and the world of digital currency. This move, if successful, could position West Virginia as a forward-thinking state ready to embrace the financial innovations of the 21st century.

But even with the recent pullbacks in the price of Bitcoin ($BTC), the leading cryptocurrency shows some impressive resilience, particularly when you consider that its market cap just hit an all-time high (ATH) of $857 billion. This new milestone emphasizes the ongoing bull cycle’s strength and suggests that, even with market corrections, Bitcoin remains in a growth trajectory that could be called solid, if not stellar.

Reaching a new all-time high in the last week of June, this metric indicates that Bitcoin holders are loving life, for the most part, as the price climbs even with some price action seen over the last couple of weeks that’s not so sweet. But like anything that’s not so sweet, it reeks of opportunity, and more and more Bitcoin holders appear to be finding it, cashing out at favorably higher levels than we seemed to be encountering even a month ago. While long-term holders are cashing out, new investors are stepping in and absorbing the selling pressure. Consequently, they are helping to sustain and maintain Bitcoin’s price. The influx of this new capital into Bitcoin serves as a critical support factor in maintaining upward price momentum in the cryptocurrency markets, as some high-net-worth individuals (referred to colloquially as “whales”) choose to take profits. New investor interest certainly bodes well for the price of Bitcoin in the short term. This report is just from one of the Sovereign Wealth Funds (Mubadala) in AD.

For instance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO of Binance, recently verified that numerous wealth funds and other institutional players, well-established in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere, are very much in the Bitcoin buying scene. This move marks a notable transition in the asset class judgment of Bitcoin. Institutional investors seem to be taking a shine to the idea of holding Bitcoin as a store of wealth and a portfolio diversifier. The consumption by wealth funds of “up to 500” BTC at a time is a pretty big deal, and could, if it keeps up, serve to make the Bitcoin market a bit more stable without losing its edge as a risk asset. A primary force behind the growing institutional interest appears to be the Bitcoin Spot ETF. It offers a mechanism for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the actual asset. However, on February 13, Bitcoin Spot ETFs experienced their fourth consecutive day of outflows—this time totaling $157 million. If you ask me, this is obviously not a good look for the funds trying to track the price of Bitcoin. And though it is undoubtedly part of a broader market cycle when money flows into and out of various investment vehicles, it caught my eye because I am trying to keep a pulse on how these ETFs are being received by the investing public. On February 13, Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net outflow of $157 million yesterday, continuing the net outflow for 4 consecutive days. HODL conducted a 1-for-4 stock split after the market yesterday. Ethereum spot ETF had a total net inflow of $12.9192 million.… pic.twitter.com/bsSR6JOPXG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 14, 2025 HODL’s Stock Split and Its Market Implications On the same day as the ETF outflows, a prominent Bitcoin-focused investment firm, HODL, conducted a 1-for-4 stock split after the market closed on February 13. Stock splits are often seen as a positive sign, indicating that the company is confident in its future growth prospects. This split also aligns with another positive Bitcoin indicator: accessibility. A share price that is roughly half what it was before the split makes shares more accessible. To potential investors, investing in an asset whose price is relatively low suggests that the asset itself is either at a discount or is set to appreciate significantly. In the Bitcoin market, that kind of confidence should not be taken lightly. Net outflows from Bitcoin ETFs might appear, on the surface, to be a potential short-term bearish sign. But when you dig into the numbers, there’s a lot more going on beneath the surface. For one thing, even with these ETF outflows, CME Bitcoin futures (which are used to price the ETFs) have seen record open interest. As such, there are actual, real-world Bitcoin stakeholders who are fortifying Bitcoin’s fundamentals. These stakeholders are steadfast. Conclusion: The Bull Cycle Continues To sum up, the ongoing bull cycle clearly remains intact, with Bitcoin’s realized market cap recently hitting a new ATH of $857 billion, despite some short-term price corrections and ETF outflows. Gains are being realized by long-term holders, and the market is being bolstered by the entry of new investors. The picture of Bitcoin’s Momentum Pricing remains largely intact, and the appearance of institutional interest in wealth funds, among others, adds another layer of strength to its Momentum Price and brings Bitcoin even further into the mainstream financial landscape. Despite experiencing short-term volatility and outflows, Bitcoin is steadily building momentum. Accumulation by both retail and institutional investors signals the kind of sustained growth that serious assets tend to demonstrate. When one looks at Bitcoin’s pricing through the lens of its realized market capitalization, however, it becomes clear that Bitcoin is doing something rare these days—namely, it’s in the process of becoming, if not a “safe haven,” then at least a haven.

Might have been a bigger potential but it’s unlikely that it will be listed in top tier exchanges like Binance. However, Pepeto, following the same path as Pepe token especially in its story and tokenomics, and the rumours of its creator being an ex-founder of Pepe team, got much more Binance and top tier listing potential in the making, leading analysts to predict a X100. Pepito’s value and ongoing hype With its presale still live, PepetoSwap Beta launch and its proper exchange set to adopt all memecoins in the next 2025 bull run , presale price stated at 1 $Pepeto = $0.000000110 and massive ongoing hype across social media: Over 31,3 K on Instagram, 18,1K in X (Twitter), and 30,8K in Telegram, Pepeto is truly set for at least X100 potential. $PEPETO: The God of Frogs with 100X Potential Revolutionizing Crypto Transfers with PepetoSwap Technology Pepeto leverages advanced bridge technology to drive crypto adoption, enabling smooth asset and data transfers across multiple blockchain networks for efficient cross-chain transactions. https://youtu.be/Hzox6f-w384?si=6b-vGdD0fyWqqwth Key Highlights Driving Pepeto’s Appeal: 1. Lucrative Staking Rewards : Offering a remarkable 387% annual APY for long-term holders. 2. Presale Success : Raised over $4 million, with the presale price set at $0.00000011 per $PEPETO. 3. Robust Utility-Driven Ecosystem : PepetoSwap : A zero-fee exchange designed for meme coin trading. PepetoBridge : Cross-chain technology enabling smooth asset transfers with minimal fees. DAO Governance : Providing the community with voting power to influence project decisions. Is a Top-Tier Listing on the Horizon? While Wall Street Pepe targets listings on platforms like BingX, Gate.io, and MEXC, Pepeto is capturing attention with whispers of an even bigger debut. Market speculation suggests Pepeto may be aiming for a Binance listing, a move that could significantly boost its growth trajectory. Historically, listings by major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase has allowed multiple cryptos to flourish. In fact, many of them have achieved new highs because of Binance listing. This excitement is driven not only by Pepeto’s $4 million+ presale success, but also by rumors linking an ex-founder of the Pepe project to the initiative. As Pepeto’s community expands and its ecosystem matures, anticipation continues to build that $PEPETO could soon land on a top-tier exchange , solidifying its position as a 100x contender in the upcoming bull market.

Of widespread interest is a marked decrease in transaction fees—over 70%—that have come about because of a gas limit increase. Lowering the barriers to the purchase and use of $ETH will, in all likelihood, result in an uptick in adoption and, thus, trading activity. Adding to the many reasons to be optimistic about $ETH’s near-term price performance is the appearance of several bullish technical signals. To be clear, when we refer to “Ethereum,” we are referencing the Ethereum network and its myriad applications as much as the $ETH token itself. Ethereum fees dropped by over 70% this week, largely due to the gas limit increase that was implemented, making transactions cheaper. pic.twitter.com/DrBA0KLyU6 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 14, 2025 Lower Gas Fees and Technical Indicators Point to Rebound A positive development for the network is the sharp decline in transaction fees. Ethereum has long suffered from the albatross of being not only a “high” fee network but also a “congested” one. The recent implementation of a gas limit increase, however, has allowed users to instead see significantly lower transaction costs. Coupled with the network’s burgeoning attraction for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Ethereum’s total smart contract experience may now, at long last, be one of consolidated user friendliness. #Ethereum $ETH is showing signs of a potential rebound as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal on the weekly chart! pic.twitter.com/fDs1PRvNOA — Ali (@ali_charts) February 14, 2025 Besides the lowered fee, Ethereum’s technical chart is revealing some alluring prospects. The TD Sequential indicator, a well-known signaling device for the timing of buy and sell decisions, has just issued a buy signal on Ethereum’s weekly chart. This sort of event often occurs in the vicinity of major price reversals and commonly is associated with the early stages of a new trending move. Once again, it might be a good idea to keep an eye on Ethereum. Ethereum has succeeded in holding well above the $2,380–$2,460 demand zone, which is an important area of support that has kept the price from falling further. “It holding above this critical support means strong buying interest in the asset, and no significant supply barriers ahead,” said a trader who follows Ethereum closely. #Ethereum $ETH successfully held above the $2,380–$2,460 demand zone, and with no major supply barriers ahead, it could be on track for a surge toward $3,000! pic.twitter.com/osGLtWCqHo — Ali (@ali_charts) February 14, 2025 Ethereum’s Growing Institutional Interest Institutional investors are also taking notice of Ethereum. An inflow of $12.92 million into Ethereum spot ETFs on February 13 brings to light that institutional investors and large capital allocators are sharpening their focus on the asset. This net inflow from institutions into places like spot ETFs and other vehicles brings with it a potential for increased stability in Ethereum price action, as well as a hope for further demand for the asset. On February 13, Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net outflow of $157 million yesterday, continuing the net outflow for 4 consecutive days. HODL conducted a 1-for-4 stock split after the market yesterday. Ethereum spot ETF had a total net inflow of $12.9192 million.… pic.twitter.com/bsSR6JOPXG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 14, 2025 The institutional interest in Ethereum is not surprising because the network serves as the backbone of decentralized finance and is steadily transitioning to Ethereum 2.0, an upgrade that promises to improve scalability and energy efficiency. Institutions that want exposure to the blockchain space increasingly view Ethereum as an attractive investment. Lower transaction fees, positive technical indicators, and inflows from institutions give Ethereum a pretty good shot at continued growth. In fact, these developments are collectively positioning the cryptocurrency for a potential breakout, with a whole lot of not only retail, but also institutional investors watching closely for signs of upward momentum. What Could Drive Ethereum Toward $3,000? Should Ethereum manage to hold its present support levels and maintain a trend of increased demand, several elements could be at play that would drive its price toward $3,000 in the not-too-distant future. One of the most significant is the long-expected upgrade to Ethereum 2.0. This isn’t so much a “change” to the network as it is an “improvement.” Any cryptocurrency, and certainly one with as much activity as Ethereum, stands to benefit from an increase in security and order. Moreover, Ethereum is one of the main beneficial smart contract platforms. It will also benefit from the construction and use of decentralized applications. Even if Bitcoin dominates the market, Ethereum remains the go-to platform for most blockchain-related developments. New technology built on the Ethereum platform tends to draw in investors as well. Another factor that could push Ethereum toward the $3,000 mark is the larger market cycle. If the crypto market keeps building momentum, Ethereum will likely be part of that movement. The larger market is showing strength, with Bitcoin and other leading digital assets posting solid gains, and that bodes well for Ethereum. If the market keeps accelerating, there’s no reason to think Ethereum won’t take a shot at $3,000. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Bullish Outlook To wrap it up, Ethereum looks to be on the rebound, with clear technical and fundamental indicators showing it could be set for some serious growth. For one, the asset’s network conditions have improved quite significantly, which, in our view, is one of the main prerequisites for any crypto asset to move up. Another thing is that transaction costs are way down now, and that’s a good sign for ETH price appreciation because Ethereum is an asset that requires the payment of gas fees to operate. As we move further along and see more inflows into DeFi and ETH staking, the moves on the price chart look to be translating into actual token use cases, which in and of itself is bullish for Ethereum. Proving to be a critical support level, the demand zone of $2,380–$2,460 is where Ethereum needs to hold its price; if it does so, we could potentially witness the next leg of the bull market. This ascent, on the heels of the recent market recovery, could be facilitated by the impending Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. With both the retail and institutional sides of the investment community finding Ethereum to be a basic building block of the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, it looks as if both groups plan to hold and even increase their positions in this digital asset. The growing acceptance, reduced costs, and fundamental factors indicating an uptrend, Ethereum is ripe for future expansion. Investors should monitor pivotal support and resistance levels because the digital asset looks primed for a major breakout. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

40353899,https://nulltx.com/?p=144891,1739613526,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,The Surge in Blockchain Development: What’s Driving Growth in Emerging Ecosystems?,https://nulltx.com/the-surge-in-blockchain-development-whats-driving-growth-in-emerging-ecosystems/,"The cryptocurrency and blockchain environment is always changing. Developers are incessantly searching for new innovation and improvement opportunities in decentralized applications. But ended-up projects and partially-completed ambitions sometimes cast shadows over the development landscape. What’s more, when developers do choose to pursue certain blockchains, it doesn’t always make sense. For instance, why would developers choose to build on the BNB Chain instead of Bitcoin? This report takes a closer look at the development activity of various blockchain ecosystems and what it could mean for their long-term viability and success. Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon: The Giants of Development Activity Ethereum has long been the blockchain ecosystem development activity frontrunner. With its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, Ethereum continues to be the decentralized application (dApp) development hub across an array of sectors. You might expect the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade to result in an ecosystem slowdown as development efforts pivot to the new infrastructure. Instead, DeFi development on top of Ethereum surged in 2021, resulting in the appearance of DeFi protocols on the “Top 10” lists of many blockchain ecosystem analysts. Besides Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon have also established themselves as blockchain ecosystems with substantial development activity. Both chains are enjoying greater adoption of their platforms, with BNB Chain receiving accolades for its compatibility with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and its position as a facilitator of decentralized finance projects and cross-chain interoperability. Meanwhile, Polygon, which is known for offering layer-2 scaling solutions on Ethereum, continues to make strides as a provider of faster and cheaper transaction speeds for decentralized applications. For a long time, these three ecosystems have formed the backbone of blockchain development, with thousands of projects operating on their individual networks. When developers select these blockchains to construct their applications, it becomes even more vital for these ecosystems to swell and thrive. Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon are the current leaders among such decentralized networks, and their influence is likely to extend well into 2025 and beyond. Surprising Growth in Emerging Blockchains: Avalanche, Harmony, and Solana Even though Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon remain at the top, a few remarkable trends over the last six months could alter the crypto landscape shortly. One of the most astonishing has been the burgeoning developer interest in some Layer 1 blockchains. These three—Avalanche, Harmony, and Solana—each have their own features and strengths that are increasingly captivating not just developers, but the whole crypto community, as well. The past six months have seen a strong growth in development activity on Avalanche, marked by a 10.0% increase in developer contributions. ConsenSys and Inc. was in charge of an audit of the Avalanche code. Not surprisingly, they found no major problems. That is another technical advantage that should, in principle, attract more developers to Avalanche and lead to substantial growth in its ecosystem. Why? Because, in the words of Avalanche’s chief marketing officer, “DeFi is a code problem.” If you have a good enough code base, decentralized finance will function. If we look at it from that perspective, Avalanche has a chance to become a major player in the DeFi space. – Harmony, a blockchain designed to offer fast and secure consensus through sharding, has also experienced a surge in development activity, with a 9.6% rise in contributions over the last six months. Harmony’s focus on scalability and interoperability has made it an attractive option for developers looking to build cross-chain dApps. The network’s ability to support a range of tokens and applications from different ecosystems positions it as a key player in the burgeoning world of multichain blockchain infrastructure. This uptick in developer activity may mean that Harmony is carving out a niche for itself in the rapidly expanding blockchain space. Despite earlier challenges, Solana is now capturing attention and interest. In the last six months, development activity on the Solana blockchain has even picked up a little speed, increasing 7.4%. With activity genuinely picking up, Solana has stamped itself as a real actor in the Web3 space. Its lightning-fast transaction speeds, ability to handle thousands of transactions per second, and low fees have made it a darling of decentralized applications in gaming, NFTs, and DeFi. Meanwhile, the decidedly positive tone of Solana’s nearly 40,000-person Discord suggests the developer ecosystem is healthy and steadily growing. When accounting for entire crypto ecosystems (all projects that currently run on a respective blockchain), Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon are seeing the most development activity. But it may surprise you to see dev. activity rate ascensions over the past 6 months from… pic.twitter.com/6c25jV1G0D — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 14, 2025 What Does This Mean for the Future? Development activity is picking up on newer Layer 1 blockchains like Avalanche, Harmony, and Solana, and this is part of a larger trend we’re seeing in the crypto ecosystem: increased competition among blockchain networks. As more and more developers dig into the nitty-gritty of these newer networks, we in the blockchain space could very well see further fragmentation of the market, with these different ecosystems serving different (and to some extent, special-purpose) applications. An essential aspect to think about is the potential market cap growth for these Layer 1 blockchains as they amass momentum. Developers are gravitating toward ecosystems that promise more scalability, lower fees, and greater interoperability. This “demand” for such networks is starting to work its way into their market capitalizations. What’s more, the blockchain ecosystems with the most active development communities also tend to post the most significant price increases, as they draw in prospective developers and investors eager to get in on the action. Looking ahead to 2025, it could be a watershed year for the adoption of blockchain technology. The layer 1 chains that have captured developers’ attention are starting to see some real-world, mainstream application. Chains like Avalanche, Harmony, and Solana seem set to increase their market capitalizations, while Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon show no signs of stopping and continue to lead in maturation and development of their ecosystems. Conclusion: The Future Is Layered As development activity increases in the blockchain, the ecosystems that experience the most development will likely lead blockchain innovation. Even though Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon are still the main go-to platforms for most developers, this is not the whole story. In fact, if you consider the increased development activity among some of these “emerging” ecosystems, a more diverse, and perhaps “layered,” blockchain future unfolds before our eyes. If you take Solana as an example, its total market cap nearly tripled from the end of 2020 to the end of 2021. For developers, investors, and users alike, the blockchain future looks vibrant, with many opportunities layered within these ecosystems. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Meanwhile, Chainlink’s LINK token shows resilience as its oracle networks log record adoption, defying a 7% monthly drop. In contrast, a hybrid trading platform presale has surged to $14.6 million. With uncertainty surrounding regulations, experts focus on projects that offer practical utility, scalability, and reliable infrastructure. As Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC continues, investors explore hybrid trading platforms like DTX Exchange as part of their diversification strategy. Projects mixing innovation with real-world utility, could dominate the next bull run—making now a critical moment to evaluate emerging opportunities. Driven by exceptional demand, DTX Exchange has introduced a bonus round offering a final buying chance. XRP Price Stability at $2.6 Sparks Speculation About Ripple’s Legal Progress Recent movements in XRP prices have drawn attention. The token is holding near $2.7 despite a 9.05% drop over the past month. Ripple continues to fight its legal battles with the SEC, which makes investors cautiously optimistic. Could a favorable final decision potentially improve XRP’s position among leading cryptocurrencies? Source: XRP Price, CoinMarketCap Ripple’s ongoing developments and partnerships in cross-border payments suggest long-term potential. The rising XRP transaction volume of 12% this week signals renewed interest. However, holders are cautious because of the lingering legal risks. Meanwhile, newer platforms like DTX Exchange focus on hybrid models and diversification, attracting investors looking for alternatives to traditional crypto investments. Compared to established tokens like XRP, newer platforms like DTX Exchange are gaining traction by offering innovative solutions without regulatory overhangs. This could position DTX as a breakout project in the coming months. Chainlink’s LINK Network Activity Grows Despite Short-Term Market Challenges Chainlink’s LINK has faced a rough period, with its price dipping 7.9% over the past month. Despite this, on-chain data shows a 20% increase in network usage, particularly in decentralized oracle integrations with TradFi institutions. This growth in real-world utility might counterbalance short-term price pressures, making LINK a top altcoin to monitor. The LINK token’s role in powering smart contracts across blockchains keeps it relevant, even during market corrections. Some stakeholders argue that Chainlink’s expanding partnerships could drive demand, but its $19 price level reflects cautious sentiment. Source: Chainlink Price, CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is emerging as a compelling alternative, combining DeFi innovation with a research-driven approach. Its hybrid platform could appeal to investors seeking assets with both utility and growth potential. Massive Demand Pushes DTX Exchange Into Bonus Stage As the crypto market searches for the next big thing, DTX Exchange is making waves with its $14.6 million pre-sale achievement. Priced at $0.18 per token, DTX has surged 700% from its initial offering, drawing comparisons to early-stage rallies of major alts like XRP and Chainlink. Experts consider its hybrid model—unifying stocks, crypto, and forex—a game-changer for retail and institutional traders. Security remains a priority, with audits like SolidProof boosting confidence. The platform’s upcoming launch in Q2 is seen as a pivotal moment, with listing prices expected at $0.20. This rapid escalation has led some to call DTX one of the best new cryptos to invest in. While projects like Chainlink focus on niche utility, DTX Exchange aims for broader market impact, potentially altering how traders interact with multiple asset classes. In Summary Ripple’s legal clarity is crucial for XRP holders. As they await the final outcome, Ripple’s ongoing partnerships in cross-border payments still demonstrate its global influence. As Chainlink’s LINK eyes recover, the explosive rise of hybrid platforms offers a fresh narrative. Early participants in DTX Exchange’s bonus pre-sale have already seen gains, with its $0.18 token positioned for growth ahead of the Q2 launch. Experts suggest timing matters—projects blending innovation and accessibility could lead the next cycle.

According to recent data, wallets holding over 1M ADA have grown significantly since November 2023, amassing an extra 1.41B ADA tokens. This accumulation, which accounts for 2.35% of ADA’s total supply, conveys a clear statement regarding the project’s institutional support while contributing to the Cardano price rally. Similarly, the Shiba Inu price movement also suggests a potential sign of recovery. The weekly chart for Shiba Inu price actions indicates an increasing buying signal through the TD Sequential indicator, suggesting an incoming trend change. Moreover, with its unique hybrid trading model, innovative features like 1000x leverage, and access to 120,000-plus assets, DTX Exchange (DTX) is emerging as one of the best altcoins to watch. This has seen the DTX token attract major investors as its presale hits over $14.3M with a price rally of 800% to hit $0.18. Cardano Price Balloons As Whales Scoop Up 1.41B ADA Whale movements have had nothing less than outstanding outcomes. Sentiment research reveals a significant 107% price rally since the wallets’ accumulation. Market watchers also believe that this isn’t only another pump-and-dump situation, rather it marks a basic change in the way big investors view Cardano’s long-term possibilities within the broader crypto scene. The increase points to a maturing market in which investors choose steady expansion over short gains. Short-term traders have shifted away from speculative trading by cutting their exposure by 11.75%. technical indicators for the Cardano price also point to a possible price recovery. Key support for the Cardano price lies in the 62% and 78% Fib retracement level giving the ADA token a strong base for an eventual rise. Even though the Cardano price hasn’t regained its $1.32 high of December 2024, Yoel Jr, stresses the importance of the $0.81 level as a stopping point for confirming positive progress. Jonathan Carter’s previous Cardano price chart study suggests the ADA token bull flag formation could trigger a rally toward $0.845, $1.000, and $1.325. Shiba Inu Price Eyes A Rebound As Key Support Holds Strong Ali Martinez pointed out that the Shiba Inu price recently bounced off a strong historical support level. This suggests that buyers are stepping in to prevent further dipping trends. The next challenge for the Shiba Inu price lies at the $0.000020 level where the 50-day EMA acts as resistance. If the Shiba Inu price maintains its position above this support level, it could rally toward a resistance range of $0.000019 to $0.000020. A successful breakout above these levels might also pave the way for more gains. Contrary, failure to hold above $0.000016 could see the Shiba Inu price retest lower support zones around $0.000014. A key development in Shiba Inu’s price action is the breakout above the downward-sloping trendline that previously capped upward movement. While the breakout is encouraging, it requires confirmation through a sustained price action above the level. However, the MACD and RSI also support a bullish trend in the coming days. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Hybrid Altcoin Paving The Way For Future Trading DTX Exchange (DTX) aims to simplify traders’ lives by giving them access to over 120K commodities through a unified interface. This will include cryptos, equities, forex, and CFDs.

The bill seeks to allow the state’s treasury to allocate a portion of its holdings into digital assets and precious metals as a hedge against inflation. Under the proposed legislation, the West Virginia Treasury would have the authority to invest in digital assets with a market capitalization exceeding $750 billion. Currently, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that meets this threshold. The bill limits such investments to 10% of the state’s total funds and allows holdings to be managed either onchain or through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This proposal aligns with a broader national conversation on Bitcoin reserves, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump commissioned a working group in January to assess the feasibility of a federal digital asset reserve. West Virginia Joins the Growing List West Virginia is the latest in a series of U.S. states introducing legislation to integrate Bitcoin into government financial strategies. On Feb. 6, Utah’s House of Representatives passed a bill permitting the state treasury to invest in Bitcoin, high-value altcoins, and stablecoins. The bill now moves to the Utah Senate for further consideration. Kentucky also introduced a digital asset reserve bill on the same day, proposing an allocation of up to 10% of state funds into cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Michigan lawmakers Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson proposed similar legislation on Feb. 13, though their bill does not restrict the type of digital assets the state can invest in. These legislative moves suggest a growing recognition among state governments of Bitcoin’s potential role as a store of value, especially in response to concerns over inflation and deficit spending. A shifting landscape As more states consider adding Bitcoin to their reserves, the momentum behind such proposals is accelerating. While most bills emphasize limited allocations to digital assets, the trend indicates an increasing willingness to integrate crypto into state-level financial planning. With the West Virginia bill now in the legislative pipeline, the discussion over Bitcoin as a reserve asset is expected to intensify, both at the state and federal levels.

The SEC argues that its newly established crypto task force could play a key role in resolving the nearly two-year dispute. In a filing on February 14 , the SEC stated that the task force’s work “may affect and could facilitate the potential resolution of both the underlying district court proceeding and potential appellate review.” SEC Says Review of Crypto-Related Matters Still Ongoing The agency emphasized that its review of crypto-related matters is still ongoing, necessitating more time to finalize its response to Coinbase’s petition. Coinbase has agreed to the extension, moving the SEC’s deadline from February 14 to March 14. The request follows a similar move made just days earlier when the SEC and Binance jointly asked a judge to pause their lawsuit for 60 days, citing the task force’s work in shaping a regulatory framework for the crypto industry. Coinbase initially appealed to a U.S. court on January 21, seeking a ruling that crypto transactions on its platform do not constitute securities. The exchange argued that clarifying whether secondary market crypto transactions qualify as investment contracts under securities laws is crucial for the industry. NEW: The filing is in and the @SECGov has requested a 28-day extension (until March 14, 2025) to file its answer to a petition from @coinbase to leave to file an interlocutory appeal.

Judge Failla also ordered a pause on all proceedings in the case until the Second Circuit Court reviews the appeal. The legal battle dates back to June 2023, when the SEC sued Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities. The regulator claims the exchange failed to register as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thereby avoiding the required disclosure obligations for securities markets. Meanwhile, the SEC’s recently announced crypto task force has sparked speculation that long-running lawsuits against major crypto firms could be nearing resolution. The task force is led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her pro-crypto stance, and was introduced by acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda. Coinbase Holds Over $420 Billion in Digital Assets for Users Earlier this month, Coinbase announced that it now holds over $420 billion in digital assets on behalf of its users, surpassing the 21st largest bank in the United States in terms of assets under management (AUM). At the time, Armstrong said the exchange’s AUM would position it as the 21st largest U.S. bank if it were classified as a traditional financial institution. Armstrong also said that if Coinbase were categorized as a brokerage firm, it would rank as the 8th largest brokerage by AUM. Coinbase’s $420 billion in AUM is over three times larger than the $112.9 billion managed by New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), which holds the 21st spot among U.S. banks. More recently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto agenda has become a central topic of discussion across the crypto industry, financial markets, and the tech world. Reflecting on his recent time at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Armstrong revealed that conversations with major market leaders were dominated by Trump’s plans for digital assets.

Institutional giants are making waves, and this time it’s Millennium Management, a global asset management behemoth, stepping into the spotlight. They’ve just unveiled a staggering $2.6 billion stake in Bitcoin ETFs , sending ripples of excitement and speculation through the market. But that’s not all – they’re also holding a significant $182 million in ETH ETF shares. Let’s dive into what this colossal investment means for the future of crypto and what you need to know. Why is Millennium Management’s $2.6B Bitcoin ETF Investment a Big Deal? This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a massive injection of institutional capital into the Bitcoin ETF market. Millennium Management managing billions in assets, isn’t just dipping their toes in – they’re diving headfirst! Here’s why this news is sending shockwaves: Validation of Crypto as an Asset Class: When a firm of Millennium Management’s scale allocates such a substantial amount to Bitcoin ETFs , it’s a resounding endorsement of cryptocurrency as a legitimate and investable asset class. This move can further legitimize crypto in the eyes of other institutional investors who might have been hesitant. Increased Market Liquidity and Stability: Large institutional investments like this significantly boost the liquidity of Bitcoin ETFs . Higher liquidity generally leads to more stable and efficient markets, reducing volatility and making it more attractive for both retail and institutional investors. Potential for Further Institutional Adoption: Millennium Management’s bold move could trigger a domino effect. Other major institutional players, watching from the sidelines, might now feel more confident in allocating capital to Crypto ETF Holdings . This could lead to a surge in demand and further price appreciation for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Accessibility for Traditional Investors: Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated and accessible gateway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the digital asset. Millennium Management ‘s investment underscores the growing appeal of this investment vehicle. Breaking Down the Crypto ETF Holdings : What Does $2.6 Billion in BTC ETF and $182 Million in ETH ETF Mean? Let’s put these numbers into perspective. $2.6 billion is not just a large number; it’s a statement. It reflects a significant conviction in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. The $182 million in ETH ETF holdings, while smaller, is also noteworthy, indicating a diversified approach to crypto investment. Here’s a quick breakdown: ETF Type Investment Amount Significance Bitcoin ETF $2.6 Billion Demonstrates strong institutional belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and potential as a store of value and growth asset. Ether ETF $182 Million Indicates growing institutional interest in Ethereum and its ecosystem, recognizing its role in decentralized applications and smart contracts. These substantial investments from Millennium Management highlight a broader trend: institutions are no longer just experimenting with crypto; they are making strategic allocations. This shift represents a maturing market and a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within mainstream finance. What are the Potential Benefits of Increased Institutional Investment in Crypto? The influx of Institutional Investment into the crypto space brings a plethora of potential benefits. It’s not just about price pumps; it’s about long-term growth and stability. Consider these advantages: Price Stability and Reduced Volatility: While crypto is known for its volatility, increased institutional participation can help to dampen price swings over time. Large institutional investors often have longer investment horizons and employ more sophisticated trading strategies, contributing to market stability. Enhanced Market Infrastructure: As institutions get more involved, there’s a greater demand for robust and regulated market infrastructure. This includes better custody solutions, trading platforms, and compliance frameworks, benefiting the entire crypto ecosystem. Innovation and Development: Institutional Investment can fuel innovation and development within the crypto space. Increased capital can be directed towards building new projects, improving existing technologies, and expanding the use cases of cryptocurrencies. Mainstream Adoption: Ultimately, greater Institutional Investment paves the way for wider mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. As traditional financial institutions embrace crypto, it becomes more accessible and accepted by the general public. Are There Any Challenges to Consider with Institutional Investment in Bitcoin ETFs? While the news of Millennium Management ‘s investment is overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional involvement will likely lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of the crypto market. While regulation can provide much-needed clarity and protection, overly strict regulations could stifle innovation and growth. Market Manipulation Concerns: With large players entering the market, concerns about market manipulation might arise. However, regulated Bitcoin ETFs and increased institutional oversight can also help to mitigate these risks compared to unregulated crypto exchanges. Centralization Risks: If a few large institutions dominate the Crypto ETF Holdings market, it could lead to centralization risks. It’s important to ensure a diverse and competitive landscape to avoid undue influence by a handful of players. Impact on Retail Investors: While institutional investment is generally positive, it’s essential to ensure that the benefits are shared across the board and that retail investors are not disadvantaged in any way. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should you take away from this monumental Institutional Investment news? Bullish Signal for Crypto: Millennium Management ‘s $2.6 billion Bitcoin ETF investment is a strong bullish signal for the crypto market. It reinforces the narrative that crypto is here to stay and is attracting serious institutional capital. Consider Bitcoin and ETH ETFs: If you’ve been considering investing in crypto but are hesitant about direct ownership, Bitcoin ETFs and ETH ETFs offer a regulated and accessible alternative. This news further strengthens their appeal. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on further developments in Institutional Investment in crypto. Follow news and analysis to understand how these trends are shaping the market and potentially impacting your investment decisions. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the outlook for crypto is promising, diversification remains key. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to crypto, but always within your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Conclusion: A New Era of Institutional Crypto Adoption is Dawning Millennium Management ‘s massive $2.6 billion Bitcoin ETF investment is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful indicator of a paradigm shift. Institutional Investment is no longer a trickle; it’s becoming a substantial flow. This bold move signifies growing confidence in the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it sets the stage for a new era of mainstream crypto adoption. As more institutions follow suit, we can expect increased stability, innovation, and broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a vital part of the global financial landscape. The message is clear: institutional crypto adoption is not just coming – it’s here, and it’s BIG.

If approved, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) would be able to participate in Ethereum’s staking mechanism, potentially allowing the funds to generate additional yield from staked Ether . The filing, submitted on Feb. 14, aligns with a broader shift toward integrating staking into regulated investment products. Grayscale emphasized that while the funds may earn staking rewards, it will not market or guarantee any fixed return to investors. The company clarified that staking will be managed directly by the fund and not through a third-party “staking as a service” provider. According to Grayscale, integrating staking could enhance the efficiency of its spot Ethereum ETFs by improving the creation and redemption process, tracking Ether’s returns more accurately, and benefiting investors through passive income from staking rewards. Estimates from Coinbase suggest that Ethereum staking currently offers an approximate annual yield of 2.06%. Growing interest in staking within ETFs Grayscale’s move follows a similar proposal from asset manager 21Shares, which recently filed for permission to stake Ether within its spot Ethereum ETF. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE BZX) applied to the SEC on behalf of 21Shares, marking the first attempt to introduce staking into a U.S.-regulated spot Ether ETF. Before the SEC approved spot Ether ETFs in mid-2024, issuers were required to remove staking provisions from their proposals . 21Shares, for example, had initially included staking in its filing but was forced to drop the feature in May 2024 to gain regulatory approval. However, with the SEC’s leadership shifting under the Trump administration, the agency appears more open to revisiting staking within exchange-traded products. A potential shift in SEC policy Market participants speculate that the SEC’s stance on staking could evolve under new leadership, potentially opening the door for other crypto asset ETFs, including those based on Solana (SOL), to incorporate staking mechanisms. According to investment firm Jito and crypto-focused VC Multicoin Capital, there are signs that the SEC is reconsidering its previous restrictions on staking within ETFs. If approved, Grayscale’s proposal could set a precedent for broader adoption of staking across regulated investment funds, offering investors an additional source of yield in the evolving crypto ETF landscape.

Besides, the flagship crypto has touched a weekly high in the last 24 hours, nearing the $99K mark. Amid this renewed interest in the market, several experts hint at a breakout for BTC ahead. Despite that, veteran trader Peter Brandt has shared a contradicting statement recently, casting doubt over BTC hitting $200K anytime soon. Why Peter Brandt Doubts Bitcoin Price’s Potential To $200K? Renowned veteran trader Peter Brandt recently expressed skepticism about Bitcoin price reaching $200K by the end of the “decade”. Sharing a BTC price chart on X, he stated that BTC would need to break through key resistance to achieve such levels. Brandt explained: “Unless Bitcoin has escape velocity through upper parabolic resistance line it’s very unlikely that BTC will be trading above $200k at the end of this decade.” Source: Peter Brandt, X Meanwhile, his statement contradicts the growing optimism among crypto analysts who predict a significant Bitcoin surge in the coming years. While some foresee BTC hitting a six-figure valuation, Brandt suggests that a major resistance barrier could limit its upside potential. Brandt Remains Open To Different Approaches Despite his skepticism, Peter Brandt acknowledged another market analysis that supports a bullish outlook for BTC. Crypto analyst ‘dave the wave’ shared a Bitcoin price projection, highlighting a pattern that suggests BTC could cross the $200K mark within this cycle. Sharing the post, Brandt praised the analysis, calling it a “mathematically supported narrative.” This indicates he remains open to different perspectives, even if he personally questions BTC’s ability to sustain a parabolic rise beyond the resistance levels. Source: dave the wave, X Bitcoin Market Sentiment Remains Divided The crypto community remains divided on Bitcoin’s long-term potential. While some analysts foresee BTC soaring past $200K due to increasing institutional adoption, others argue that market cycles may not support such extreme growth within this decade. The ongoing BTC recovery has reignited debates over its next move. As Bitcoin hovers near the $100K mark, investors watch closely to see if it will break resistance or face a prolonged consolidation phase. What’s Next For BTC Price? Bitcoin price today was up over 0.4% and exchanged hands at $97,521, while its trading volume fell 2% to $30.5 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $98,819.47, while noting a weekly surge of around 1.5%. Besides, BTC Futures Open Interest rose 0.6%, indicating renewed market sentiment towards the asset. Notably, a BTC price prediction hints that the crypto might hover around the $97.5K level through this month. Despite that, a flurry of analysts remains bullish, hinting towards a potential rally to $106k in the near term. Besides, a recent report highlights that BTC might target the $103K level , as retail investors are looking beyond the recent set of hotter-than-expected inflation data. Source: Ali Martinez, X For instance, top market expert Ali Martinez said that Bitcoin price is gearing up for a bullish breakout ahead, hinting at a surge to $106k soon. Echoing similar sentiment, another expert Rekt Capital also noted that if the crypto holds strong above the $97,700 level, it could extend the rally ahead.

At the forefront is Lightchain AI, available for just $0.006. It provides AI-enhanced blockchain solutions that tackle scalability, security, and decentralization. In addition to Lightchain AI , Tron (TRX) enhances Ethereum's scalability, Hedera(HBAR) focuses on supply chain solutions, Stellar (XLM) leads in cross-border payments, and POL (formerly MATIC) ensures fast, affordable transactions. These undervalued cryptocurrencies are set for expansion, offering high-growth potential for investors eager to capitalize on the dynamic crypto market. 5 Cryptos Under 50 Cents Ready to Transform Spare Change into $100,000 Investing in low-cost cryptocurrencies can lead to notable returns. Here are five standout coins currently priced under 50 cents. Tron (TRX) - With a price close to $0.24, Tron aims to decentralize the web, allowing content distribution without middlemen. Lightchain AI (LCAI) - Priced at around $0.006 during its presale, Lightchain AI merges artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, introducing features like the Proof of Intelligence consensus. Stellar (XLM) - Trading for about $0.33, Stellar is focused on facilitating smooth cross-border payments, collaborating with financial institutions to improve global transactions. Hedera (HBAR) - Near $0.23, Hedera delivers a high-capacity public ledger, supporting various applications in finance, supply chain, and more. POL (formerly MATIC) - At approximately $0.32, POL boosts Ethereum's scalability, enabling faster and cheaper transactions for decentralized applications.

This mix of performance, community-focused development, and decentralized governance sets Lightchain AI apart as a high-potential candidate in the blockchain arena, making it an appealing investment. Transform Spare Coins Into Earnings with Budget-Friendly Cryptos Cryptocurrencies are famously volatile, with prices that can swing wildly. Still, investing in budget-friendly cryptos might reduce risks and lead to substantial rewards. With the potential of the five coins listed above, turning spare change into $100,000 by the next year is within the realm of possibility. However, investing early in the Lightchain AI presale presents the best chance for significant returns, supported by its cutting-edge technology and solid fundamentals. As always, conducting thorough research and understanding the risks is crucial before investing in any cryptocurrency. Yet, these five options under 50 cents could be worth considering for their long-term growth potential. So don't let your spare change sit idle—invest in affordable cryptocurrencies and potentially transform it into earnings by next year!

In a startling development, a Las Vegas man has been indicted for allegedly orchestrating a massive $24 million crypto Ponzi scheme . This news serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in the digital asset space and the importance of vigilance. Let’s delve into the details of this shocking case and understand what it means for investors. What Exactly is a Crypto Ponzi Scheme and How Did This One Work? A Ponzi scheme , in essence, is a fraudulent investment operation where returns are paid to earlier investors using funds from more recent investors, rather than from actual profits earned. It’s a deceptive cycle that inevitably collapses when the inflow of new money dries up. In the context of cryptocurrency, these schemes often leverage the hype and complexity of digital assets to lure unsuspecting individuals with promises of high returns and seemingly innovative technologies. In this particular case, Brent Kovar, a 58-year-old resident of Las Vegas, stands accused of running such a scheme through his company, Profit Connect. Here’s a breakdown of how the alleged cryptocurrency fraud unfolded: The Promise: Kovar allegedly enticed over 400 investors with the promise of a staggering 30% annual percentage rate (APR). This incredibly high return should have been the first red flag for potential investors. The Technology Bluff: To add a layer of legitimacy and tap into the crypto buzzwords, Kovar claimed Profit Connect utilized “AI-powered supercomputers” for cryptocurrency mining. This sophisticated-sounding technology was presented as the engine driving the promised high returns. The Guarantee: Adding to the allure, Kovar offered a “100% money-back guarantee.” This seemingly risk-free proposition likely further convinced investors to part with their funds. The Reality: Instead of investing in actual crypto mining operations, Kovar allegedly misused the investor funds. Reports indicate that the money was diverted for personal expenses and, crucially, to pay off earlier investors – the classic hallmark of a Ponzi scheme. The Indictment and Legal Repercussions for the Las Vegas Crypto Scam The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Nevada has officially indicted Brent Kovar on multiple serious charges, including: Wire Fraud: This charge relates to fraudulent schemes conducted using electronic communications, such as the internet or telephones. Mail Fraud: This charge pertains to fraudulent schemes carried out using the postal service. Money Laundering: This involves concealing the origins of illegally obtained money, in this case, the investor funds allegedly acquired through fraud. If convicted on all counts, Kovar faces a maximum sentence of a staggering 330 years in prison, according to reports from The Block. His trial is currently scheduled for April 8, 2025. This case underscores the severity with which authorities are beginning to treat cryptocurrency fraud and related financial crimes. Impact on Investors and the Wider Crypto Community The fallout from this Las Vegas crypto scam is significant. Over 400 investors are believed to have been affected, potentially losing a substantial portion, if not all, of their invested capital. The emotional and financial toll on these individuals can be devastating. Beyond the direct victims, incidents like this erode trust in the cryptocurrency market as a whole. While the vast majority of crypto projects and participants are legitimate, scams like this fuel skepticism and can deter newcomers from entering the space. This is a challenge the crypto community needs to actively address by promoting education, due diligence, and responsible investment practices. How to Spot and Avoid Crypto Ponzi Schemes: Actionable Insights Protecting yourself from Ponzi schemes and other cryptocurrency fraud requires vigilance and a healthy dose of skepticism. Here are some key red flags and actionable steps to take: Unrealistically High Returns: Promises of guaranteed, sky-high returns, like the 30% APR in this case, are almost always a sign of a scam. Legitimate investments carry risk, and exceptionally high returns are rarely sustainable. Pressure to Invest Quickly: Scammers often use high-pressure tactics to rush you into investing before you have time to do proper research. Be wary of phrases like “limited-time offer” or “exclusive opportunity.” Lack of Transparency: Legitimate investment projects are typically transparent about their operations, team, and technology. Be suspicious if information is vague or difficult to verify. Ask detailed questions and demand clear answers. Overly Complex Explanations: While crypto can be complex, scammers sometimes use jargon and overly technical language to confuse and intimidate potential investors, masking the fact that there’s no real underlying business model. No Registered Investment: In many jurisdictions, companies offering investment products must be registered with financial regulatory bodies. Verify if the company and the investment are properly registered. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This is the golden rule in crypto. Before investing in any project, conduct thorough research. Look into the team, technology, whitepaper, community, and any available audits. Seek Independent Advice: If you are unsure, consult with a qualified financial advisor who is knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies. A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Investors The indictment of Brent Kovar in the Las Vegas crypto scam serves as a crucial wake-up call. It highlights the ongoing risks within the cryptocurrency market and the importance of investor education and due diligence. While the promise of high returns in crypto is enticing, it’s essential to approach every investment opportunity with caution and critical thinking. Remember, if something sounds too good to be true, it very likely is. This case is a stark reminder that in the exciting world of digital assets, safeguarding your investments requires constant vigilance and a commitment to informed decision-making.

While $59 million represents a 9 billion yen investment as of February 13, the company has hinted at sticking to its 10-billion-yen purchase plan. The effort was decided in a bid to help the company gain wide access to the crypto market. According to its latest report, the company now holds a lion’s share of Bitcoin in its reserves, with Ethereum following up closely. Remixpoint also holds a commendable share of Solana, with the new report now confirming that the company holds new additions, XRP and Dogecoin. Remixpoint continues to stack up digital assets According to its document, Remixpoint has Bitcoin worth 7.4 billion yen (approximately $48.6 million), Ethereum worth 600 million yen (approximately $3.94 million), Solana worth 400 million yen ($2.63 million), XRP worth 400 million yen (approximately $2.63 million), with Dogecoin worth 200 million yen ($1.31 million). The total worth of the total stash is about 9 billion yen, bringing it a little bit shy of the company’s 10 billion yen investment goal. It also represents an increase of over 13,000% compared to its holdings nearly a year ago. As of March 2024, the company only had about 68 million yen (approximately $446,5000) worth of digital assets. The company had initially made the purchase of several digital assets, including Solana, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Avalanche, to hedge against the devaluation of the yen and diversify its assets. In October, the company increased its Bitcoin stash, taking the cumulative balance to 125 BTC. The company made further expansions in November and December, increasing its Bitcoin holding to 299 BTC by the end of the year. Early January 2025, Remixpoint increased its Bitcoin holding by 33 BTC, taking the total to 500 million yen ($3.2 million). The total stash was about 333 BTC, worth $31.7 million in the market. The firm also announced the commitment of 2 billion yen ($12.89 million) to its crypto investments. By the beginning of February, the total Bitcoin holding had reached 5.6 billion yen ($38 million), signifying a big 8,000% increase over nine months. XRP and Dogecoin enjoy institutional interests With Remixpoint’s current digital assets holdings at 9 billion yen, a little shy of its 10 billion yen goal, it underscores the wide appetite of these firms in the crypto industry. There has also been a huge accumulation of Bitcoin and other assets by firms globally, showing that the crypto market may soon become the go-to place for the top firms. While Strategy has already taken the initiative to push for the adoption of Bitcoin through its investments, firms are now seeing the beauty in accumulating the asset that was previously called speculative some years after it burst into the limelight. With Bitcoin seeing a wide range of support from institutional players and corporate firms, XRP and Dogecoin are also seeing their fair share of institutional interest, with Remixpoint’s $3.9 million allocation to the two assets showing the much-needed belief by another corporate entity. The investment is coming after both assets enjoyed a boost in their prices from November 2024 to January 2025, with XRP seeing a rise of 336% over the period. In addition, the institutional interest has led to the filing of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of both XRP and Dogecoin, with the investment products tipped to make it easier for these players to gain exposure to the assets. A previous SEC publication acknowledged the 19b-4 filings for both Dogecoin and XRP. While XRP has continued to fight off the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a never-ending legal battle, the token has been doing well to the appreciation of the ‘XRP Army’, the legion of supporters who have always backed the token, even through tough times. With Trump’s re-election, there has been chatter that the case may likely have a favorable end.

The traditional world of finance is inching closer to embracing crypto staking, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is leading the charge. A recent proposal submitted by the NYSE could pave the way for staking on Grayscale’s highly anticipated Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto investments and why this development is generating significant buzz in the digital asset space. NYSE Steps Up for Crypto Staking with Grayscale Ethereum ETF Proposal In a move that signals growing institutional acceptance of crypto assets, the NYSE has officially filed paperwork with regulatory authorities seeking approval to enable staking for Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF. This proposal, first reported by Unfolded on X, is a significant step towards integrating the lucrative world of crypto staking into traditional investment vehicles. But what exactly does this mean? Essentially, if approved, investors holding shares of the Grayscale Ethereum ETF on the NYSE could potentially earn staking rewards. Staking, in the context of proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum, involves locking up a portion of your crypto holdings to support the network’s operations and security. In return, stakers earn rewards, often in the form of additional crypto tokens. This mechanism has become a popular way for crypto holders to generate passive income, and its potential integration into a mainstream ETF is a game-changer. [img]Image of NYSE building with Ethereum logo overlayed[/img] Decoding the Grayscale ETH ETF and its Staking Potential Grayscale Investments is a well-known name in the crypto investment world, particularly for its crypto trusts. The Grayscale ETH ETF is their attempt to convert their existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF. Spot ETFs directly hold the underlying asset, in this case, Ethereum, offering investors direct exposure to ETH price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. The addition of staking to this ETF could make it even more attractive to investors. Here’s a breakdown of why this is noteworthy: Accessibility: An Ethereum ETF listed on the NYSE makes ETH investments accessible to a much broader range of investors, including institutional investors and retail investors who prefer traditional investment avenues. Regulation: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection and familiarity that might be lacking in direct crypto investments. Staking Rewards: The NYSE proposal to enable staking within the Grayscale ETH ETF adds another layer of potential return for investors beyond just price appreciation of Ethereum. Why is Crypto Staking in an ETF a Big Deal? The integration of crypto staking into a traditional financial product like an ETF is a landmark development. It bridges the gap between the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies and the established infrastructure of traditional finance. Here’s why this is a monumental step: Mainstream Adoption: It signals a significant leap towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. By offering staking rewards within an ETF structure, it demystifies and simplifies a key aspect of crypto economics for traditional investors. Increased ETF Appeal: Staking can enhance the yield of an Ethereum ETF , making it more competitive compared to other investment products. This could attract more capital into the crypto space. Validation of Crypto: The NYSE, a symbol of traditional finance, considering and proposing crypto staking further validates cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. Potential Benefits of ETH Staking in Grayscale ETF Let’s explore the potential advantages of allowing ETH staking within the Grayscale Ethereum ETF: Benefit Description Enhanced Returns Staking rewards provide an additional source of income for ETF holders, potentially boosting overall returns beyond ETH price appreciation. Passive Income Investors can earn rewards passively simply by holding shares of the ETF, without needing to actively manage staking infrastructure themselves. Network Security Staking contributes to the security and efficiency of the Ethereum network, aligning investor incentives with the health of the blockchain. Competitive Edge Staking-enabled ETFs could be more attractive than non-staking crypto investment products, potentially drawing in more investors. Challenges and Considerations for NYSE Crypto Staking Proposal While the NYSE’s proposal is exciting, there are challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Regulatory Hurdles: The proposal still needs regulatory approval. Securities regulators will need to assess the implications of staking within an ETF structure. Operational Complexity: Implementing staking within an ETF involves operational complexities, including managing staking infrastructure, reward distribution, and potential tax implications. Custodial Risks: Ensuring the secure custody of staked ETH and the generated rewards is crucial. Robust security measures will be paramount. Transparency: Clear and transparent reporting of staking activities and reward distribution will be essential for investor confidence. The Future of Crypto ETFs and Staking The NYSE’s move to propose staking for the Grayscale Ethereum ETF could set a precedent for future crypto ETFs. If successful, we could see more ETFs incorporating staking mechanisms for various proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. This could further fuel the growth of the crypto market and attract even more institutional capital. This development is a testament to the evolving landscape of finance, where traditional institutions are increasingly recognizing the potential of cryptocurrencies and exploring innovative ways to integrate them into mainstream investment products. The fusion of ETFs and staking represents a significant step towards a more inclusive and accessible crypto investment ecosystem. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Crypto Mainstream The NYSE’s proposal to enable staking for Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF is more than just a regulatory filing; it’s a powerful signal that the crypto industry is maturing and gaining acceptance within the traditional financial world. This move could unlock new opportunities for investors to earn passive income from their crypto staking investments through a regulated and familiar ETF structure. While regulatory approvals and operational details still need to be ironed out, the direction is clear: crypto is becoming increasingly intertwined with mainstream finance, and this proposal is a significant leap forward in that journey. Keep an eye on this space, as the outcome could reshape the future of crypto ETFs and investment strategies.

As the market waits for a stronger push, several altcoins are emerging as potential leaders. This scenario has left many investors wondering which coins might rise first and reap the greatest benefits in the months ahead. The market’s excitement is somewhat directed towards altcoins like SUI, SEI, HBAR, and ONDO. Additionally, a promising project, Mission Briefing: Agent A.I., is gaining attention. This playful memecoin aims to capture imaginations and potentially deliver significant returns. Its strategy and unique appeal make it one to watch closely. Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount SUI Token Soars Amid DeFi Boom: A Look at Its Rise and Future Potential SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain, made significant strides in late 2023 and early 2024. Surpassing the $1 mark, it reached a notable high of $2.18 by March 27. This surge captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, marking SUI as a token to watch. Despite a dip following this peak, SUI demonstrated resilience by rebounding in the autumn. On October 14, it achieved a new all-time high of $2.36. This comeback showcased the token’s strength and the growing confidence in the Sui blockchain’s capabilities. By the end of the year, SUI had soared to $5.35. This impressive peak was driven by a substantial increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) within the system, which surpassed $2 billion. Christian Williams, managing director of the Sui Foundation, expressed pride in the ecosystem’s growth, highlighting the remarkable organic development from the community, developers, and DeFi activity. As we move through 2025, SUI’s potential continues to intrigue market participants. Its innovative technology focuses on flexibility and efficiency, aiming to shape the Web3 landscape. Founded by former Meta developers, the Sui platform utilizes horizontal scaling and asset storage on the blockchain to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs. Looking ahead, price predictions suggest varying trajectories for SUI. While past movements have shown significant growth, future performance will depend on market adoption and technological advancements. With a predicted range between $25 and $37 by 2030, SUI presents an interesting prospect for those following the evolution of blockchain technology. From Peaks to Predictions: The Future of Sei (SEI) in 2025 and Beyond Launched in August 2023, Sei (SEI) burst onto the crypto scene with a focus on speed and low transaction costs. Its integration with Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) in November enhanced its utility and appeal. By March 2024, SEI reached an all-time high, capturing the attention of traders and enthusiasts alike. However, despite the thriving market, SEI entered a downtrend after its peak. Even the launch of its V2 upgrade in May 2024 couldn’t reverse the slide. The coin has faced challenges regaining momentum, prompting curiosity about its future direction. Sei aims to revolutionize trading by offering one of the fastest blockchains in the industry, with transaction speeds as low as 250 milliseconds. Using a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, it allows holders to participate in validating transactions. This technology positions Sei as a potential game-changer for decentralized exchanges. Price predictions for SEI indicate a potential recovery. By the end of 2025, forecasts suggest an average price of $0.75, with possibilities ranging from $0.45 to $1. In 2026, the average could rise to $1.10, reaching up to $1.50. Looking ahead to 2030, projections estimate an average of $2.50, possibly hitting $4. The future of SEI depends on its adoption and the growth of its ecosystem. Its commitment to speed and efficiency may attract more users and developers. While past price movements have shown volatility, Sei’s innovative approach could pave the way for long-term growth. Unlocking Hedera Hashgraph: The Future of Decentralized Networks Hedera Hashgraph, known by its cryptocurrency symbol HBAR, is making waves in the world of blockchain technology. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera operates on a unique consensus mechanism called hashgraph, promising faster transactions and enhanced security. HBAR serves as the native token, crucial for securing and governing the network. A vibrant ecosystem is blossoming on Hedera, with notable applications like SaucerSwap, a decentralized exchange offering a suite of finance solutions, and Hashport, enabling interoperability of digital assets across networks. Since its inception, HBAR has seen significant price movements. In September 2021, it reached an all-time high of $0.5701. The crypto market downturn in 2022 impacted HBAR, mirroring industry-wide trends. Despite fluctuations, HBAR has maintained a strong position, ranking among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. With a substantial portion of its total supply in circulation, investor interest remains high. Analysts have offered mixed sentiments on HBAR’s trajectory. Some highlight positive investor sentiment and recent price movements as signs of bullish momentum. They point to the active development within the Hedera ecosystem as a catalyst for potential growth. Others express caution, noting that broader economic factors like inflation and geopolitical tensions can introduce volatility to the crypto markets, possibly affecting HBAR’s performance. The long-term success of Hedera Hashgraph may depend on its ability to foster adoption and expand its network. As developers continue to build innovative applications and improve the platform, HBAR could see increased utility and demand. The focus on scalability, speed, and security positions Hedera as a competitive player in the decentralized space. In summary, HBAR represents a promising yet volatile asset in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Its unique technology and growing ecosystem offer potential for future growth. Investors and enthusiasts alike are watching closely as Hedera Hashgraph strives to make its mark. As always, staying informed and understanding the dynamic nature of the market are key when considering involvement with HBAR. ONDO: Bridging Real-World Assets with DeFi Innovation Ondo Finance is making waves in decentralized finance (DeFi). Launched on January 18, 2024, its token ONDO quickly gained traction. The price surged between March and June, reaching impressive heights before experiencing a dip. Despite volatility, ONDO showed resilience in the crypto market. Later in 2024, interest in real-world asset (RWA) cryptocurrencies reignited ONDO’s momentum. The token hit an all-time high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, ONDO was valued at about $1.45, reflecting steady growth and investor confidence. Ondo Finance aims to bridge traditional finance with the crypto world by tokenizing real-world assets like US Treasuries. Investors can connect their wallets, deposit funds, and mint ONDO tokens. These tokens can be redeemed anytime or used across DeFi platforms, offering transparency and flexibility. Price predictions for ONDO are optimistic. For 2025, forecasts suggest a range from $1.50 to $3.50. Looking ahead to 2026, estimates stretch from $2 to $6, and by 2030, from $5 to $12. These projections highlight ONDO’s potential as it gains broader adoption. With its innovative approach and strong vision, ONDO stands out in the current market cycle. By integrating real-world assets into DeFi, it positions itself as a promising player in the future of finance. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent stagnation has led to uncertainty among altcoins, impacting short-term prospects for cryptocurrencies like SUI, SEI, HBAR, and ONDO. These coins may experience limited growth in the immediate future due to the current market conditions. Amid this backdrop, Agent A.I. emerges as a unique contender in the crypto arena. As a memecoin inspired by the remarkable rise of PEPE coin, Agent A.I. combines humor with the potential for significant gains. With its community-driven presale strategy and capped token supply, it aims to engage supporters early on. The project’s focus on transparent token distribution and plans for post-presale expansion position Agent A.I. as a promising opportunity in the revitalizing market.

While meme coin enthusiasm continues to drive trading volume, a new player in the crypto space – BitLemons ($BLEM) – is capturing attention with its innovative GambleFi platform and impressive presale momentum. Can BitLemons Revolutionize the $450B Casino Industry? BitLemons is making waves in the crypto world by transforming the traditional casino industry through blockchain technology. Their platform features over 8,000 games from industry leaders like Evolution and Pragmatic, bringing legitimate, transparent gaming to the crypto space. The project’s growth metrics are turning heads. Having already secured $1 million in their private seed round, BitLemons is demonstrating strong market confidence. Their innovative tokenomics model allocates 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) to support the ecosystem – with 15% dedicated to token buyback and burn operations, and another 15% distributed as staking rewards. Currently in its presale phase with tokens priced at $0.01, BitLemons is offering early investors an attractive entry point. With each subsequent stage increasing by $0.01 and rumors of a potential listing price between $0.17-0.18, the growth potential is significant. Is PEPE’s Recent Price Action a Sign of Things to Come? PEPE’s performance has been characterized by extreme volatility, as shown in recent market data. While maintaining a market cap of $4.08B, the token has seen significant volume fluctuations, with a 39.07% decrease in 24-hour trading volume to $612.51M. The technical analysis reveals multiple support and resistance levels being tested, with the price finding stability around the $0.059 mark after several sharp movements. The meme coin’s trading patterns demonstrate the market’s continued interest in speculative assets, though sustainability concerns remain due to limited fundamental use cases. Why Are Analysts Backing BitLemons Over PEPE for 2025? While PEPE continues to capture speculative interest, BitLemons presents a more fundamentally sound investment proposition. Unlike purely speculation-driven tokens, BitLemons backs its value with real revenue from its fully functional crypto casino platform, combining the excitement of gambling with the innovation of DeFi. Is it time to look beyond meme coins and invest in platforms with genuine utility? BitLemons offers a compelling case with its revenue-sharing model, deflationary tokenomics, and established gaming partnerships.

40356209,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129141,1739618235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary LIBRA Token: Milei’s Bold Crypto Plan to Revitalize Argentina Economy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/libra-token-argentina-economy/,"Argentina is taking a daring leap into the future of finance! President Javier Milei, known for his unconventional approach, has ignited excitement in the crypto world by announcing the launch of the LIBRA token. This isn’t just another digital currency; it’s a privately driven initiative under the ‘Viva La Libertad Project’ designed to inject energy into the struggling Argentina economy . Could this be the economic spark Argentina desperately needs? Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking project and explore what it means for the nation and the crypto landscape. What is the LIBRA Token and Why is it Important for the Argentina Economy? The LIBRA token isn’t a state-issued cryptocurrency but rather a project born from the ‘Viva La Libertad Project,’ a private endeavor championed by President Milei. This distinction is crucial. Unlike government-backed digital currencies, LIBRA operates independently, aiming to foster economic growth from the ground up. But how exactly does it intend to achieve this? Focus on Small-Scale Projects: LIBRA is specifically designed to support small-scale projects and local businesses across Argentina. These are the backbone of any economy, and providing them with a new avenue for funding and growth could be transformative. Decentralized Economic Empowerment: By utilizing blockchain technology, LIBRA aims to offer a decentralized and transparent system. This can reduce bureaucratic hurdles and provide quicker access to capital for entrepreneurs. Boosting Local Commerce: The initiative hopes to encourage the use of the LIBRA token within local communities, fostering a circular economy where value is generated and retained locally. Think of it as a digital tool empowering Argentinians at the grassroots level. Instead of relying solely on traditional financial systems, small businesses can potentially leverage LIBRA to access funding, conduct transactions, and expand their operations. In a country grappling with economic challenges, this bottom-up approach could be a game-changer. How Does Crypto Argentina Fit into Milei’s Economic Vision? President Milei’s administration has shown a notable openness to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The launch of the LIBRA token aligns with this broader vision of embracing innovation to tackle economic woes. Crypto Argentina is increasingly becoming a space of interest and potential growth, and Milei seems keen on tapping into this potential. But what are the underlying motivations and the bigger picture? Aspect Traditional Economy Crypto Economy (with LIBRA) Access to Capital for Small Businesses Often limited by bureaucracy and traditional lending criteria. Potentially easier access through decentralized systems and token-based funding. Transaction Efficiency Can be slow and costly, especially for cross-border transactions. Faster and potentially cheaper transactions using cryptocurrency. Transparency Financial systems can lack transparency, leading to trust issues. Blockchain technology offers greater transparency and traceability. Inflation Hedge Traditional currency in Argentina faces significant inflation challenges. Cryptocurrencies, although volatile, are sometimes seen as a potential hedge against inflation (though this is debated and not guaranteed). Milei’s approach could be interpreted as a bet on the future – a belief that embracing digital currencies and decentralized finance can offer solutions to long-standing economic problems. By supporting initiatives like the LIBRA token, the government might be signaling a willingness to explore unconventional paths to economic recovery . Milei Crypto Strategy: A Pathway to Economic Recovery or a Risky Bet? The introduction of the LIBRA token under President Milei crypto -friendly stance is undoubtedly a bold move. But is it a strategic masterstroke for economic recovery , or a high-stakes gamble? Let’s consider both the potential benefits and the inherent challenges. Potential Benefits: Stimulating Innovation: The LIBRA token could foster innovation within the Argentine economy by encouraging the adoption of blockchain technology and digital finance solutions. Attracting Investment: A pro-crypto stance could attract foreign investment into Argentina’s tech and financial sectors. Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can offer financial services to underserved populations who may lack access to traditional banking. Reduced Reliance on Traditional Systems: In a country with a history of economic instability, diversifying away from solely relying on traditional financial systems could be seen as a prudent step. Potential Challenges: Volatility and Risk: Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. The value of the LIBRA token could fluctuate significantly, posing risks to users and businesses. Regulation and Oversight: The regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in Argentina is still evolving. Clear and effective regulations are crucial to protect consumers and prevent illicit activities. Adoption Hurdles: Widespread adoption of the LIBRA token will require overcoming technological literacy barriers and building trust among the general population. Economic Instability: While intended to aid economic recovery, the LIBRA token’s success is not guaranteed and depends on various factors, including broader economic conditions and public acceptance. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are a crypto enthusiast, an Argentine citizen, or an observer of global economic trends, the LIBRA token initiative offers several key takeaways: Watch Argentina Closely: Argentina is becoming an interesting case study in how a nation can attempt to leverage cryptocurrency for economic revitalization. Keep an eye on the progress of the LIBRA token and its impact on the Argentina economy . Understand the Risks and Opportunities: Cryptocurrencies present both significant opportunities and inherent risks. Educate yourself about blockchain technology and digital currencies to make informed decisions. Support Local Initiatives: If you are in Argentina, consider how initiatives like the LIBRA token can support local businesses and contribute to community growth. Engage in the Conversation: The future of finance is being shaped now. Participate in discussions about cryptocurrency regulation, adoption, and its potential to address economic challenges. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a Leap of Faith? President Javier Milei’s announcement of the LIBRA token marks a fascinating and potentially transformative moment for Argentina. It’s a bold experiment in using cryptocurrency to stimulate the Argentina economy from the ground up. Whether it proves to be a resounding success or faces significant hurdles remains to be seen. However, it undeniably signals a shift in thinking and a willingness to explore innovative solutions in the face of economic adversity. The world will be watching to see if this revolutionary approach can indeed pave the way for economic recovery and a brighter future for Argentina. The LIBRA token, born from the ‘Viva La Libertad Project,’ embodies a spirit of optimism and a belief in the power of decentralized solutions. It’s a story of hope, innovation, and the evolving relationship between nations and the world of cryptocurrency.

Investors are eagerly scouting for the next big break. Promising meme coins like WIF, BONK, FLOKI, and BRETT are capturing attention. These coins are making waves with potential for massive gains. They are considered hidden gems in the fast-paced digital currency space. A new contender, Mission Briefing: Agent A.I., emerges with a unique narrative. This meme coin, disguised as a stealthy operative, seeks to debunk fake AI agents. It offers a community-driven approach and a presale that hints at substantial growth. The mission is to engage users and unleash its full potential in the crypto arena. Agent A.I. Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Agent A.I. is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins , two of the most prominent trends today . Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use “AI” as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Agent A.I. Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Agent A.I. aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Agent A.I. stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Agent A.I. is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform . According to its developers, the project’s AI framework can: Analyze massive datasets in milliseconds to improve decision-making Scale up processing power to match top cloud platforms Continuously refine its performance, learning and adapting over time. The development team behind Agent A.I. is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Agent A.I. has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices . The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token costs $0.003333333. It will go through 28 stages and reach $0.151515152 by the end of the presale. Those who buy at the first stage get a huge 98% discount . This pricing strategy means that the earlier you invest, the bigger the discount . Secure Your $AGNT Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Agent A.I. combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market : AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Agent A.I. Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Dogwifhat (WIF): The Meme Coin Turning Heads in 2025 Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, it doesn’t have a specific function or utility. Its value comes from community interest, trading activity, and overall market sentiment. With a limited supply of just over 998 million tokens, WIF thrives on enthusiasm and social media buzz. Despite lacking practical uses, WIF has captured significant attention. It’s similar to rare collectibles or viral art pieces that people trade based on popularity. The strong community behind WIF drives its price movements, making it a unique player in the crypto space. In early 2024, WIF soared to an all-time high of $4.85. Later that year, it dipped to an all-time low of $0.0677. Throughout 2025, WIF has experienced fluctuations but shows signs of resilience. Analysts are divided, but some predict it could reach between $4.71 and $7.64 by 2030, suggesting potential for growth. The current market cycle presents both challenges and opportunities for WIF. Without inherent utility, its value is highly speculative. Some experts are optimistic due to its strong community support. Others caution that sustained growth may be difficult without real-world applications. Looking ahead, long-term predictions vary widely. Some forecasts suggest WIF could climb to $8.85 or even $16.65 in the coming years. As with any meme coin, its future depends on market trends and the enthusiasm of its community. Bonk (BONK): The Meme Coin Energizing Solana’s Ecosystem Bonk (BONK) made waves when it launched in December 2022, bringing the meme coin phenomenon to Solana. As a community-driven token, BONK aims to boost liquidity and user engagement within Solana’s network. While many meme coins are on Ethereum, BONK leverages Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions. It serves as a payment method between users, offering an alternative to SOL for everyday transactions without governance features. After its launch, BONK’s price surged alongside SOL, capturing attention. By 2025, BONK had shown remarkable growth. Its market capitalization, once behind competitors like SHIB and DOGE, has steadily increased, reflecting strong community support. In the current market cycle, BONK stands out for those interested in meme coins with utility. Its alignment with Solana’s technology and ongoing community efforts suggest potential for further adoption and growth. Looking ahead, price predictions for BONK are optimistic. Analysts foresee the coin reaching new milestones by 2030 and beyond. While the future is uncertain, BONK’s trajectory points to promising developments. FLOKI: The Meme Coin Aiming for the Moon in 2025 Floki Inu (FLOKI) is an Ethereum-based token inspired by popular meme coins like Dogecoin. It offers NFTs and physical goods like clothing and a prepaid card. With unique projects, FLOKI aims to stand out in the crowded meme coin space. FLOKI has a total supply of 10 trillion tokens. An 8% transaction tax on buys and sells reduces supply through burning and funds marketing efforts. Half the tax goes to holders and the burn wallet; the other half supports promotions. FLOKI’s burning program decreases supply, which might boost prices. It reached an all-time high of $0.0003462 in June 2024. Predictions for 2025 suggest prices between $0.000196 and $0.000925, indicating potential growth despite past volatility. The coin’s future depends on increasing demand. New use cases or effective marketing could attract investors. While some forecasts are bullish, others doubt its longevity, viewing FLOKI as a fleeting trend without lasting value. Long-term predictions vary. By 2030, some expect prices up to $0.00203, while others are less optimistic. FLOKI’s small market cap means greater price swings. Its success will rely on innovation and community support in a competitive market. BRETT: The Rising Star of Base Chain’s Expanding Ecosystem BRETT, known as Pepe’s best friend, has emerged as one of crypto’s most significant cultural icons and the beloved mascot of Base Chain. This charming character has captured the hearts of the crypto community, symbolizing the fun and vibrant spirit of the Base Chain network. The Base Chain ecosystem is booming, with numerous projects and applications springing up on the platform. This rapid expansion provides a solid foundation for BRETT’s success. By tapping into the resources and expertise of other projects within the ecosystem, BRETT is well-positioned to grow and extend its offerings. BRETT leverages innovative technology to provide unique experiences to its users. Its integration within the Base Chain allows for seamless interaction with other applications, enhancing its utility and appeal. As Base Chain continues to evolve, BRETT is expected to adopt new features and technologies that further its development. Considering the current market cycle, BRETT presents an intriguing opportunity. Its close ties to the thriving Base Chain ecosystem and its cultural significance in the crypto space contribute to its potential appeal among investors and users alike. Historically, BRETT has shown impressive growth since its inception. From humble beginnings, it has witnessed substantial increases in adoption and community engagement over the past years. As we look to the future, BRETT’s continued alignment with the expanding Base Chain ecosystem suggests that it may have promising prospects ahead. Conclusion As the current market surges, coins like WIF, BONK, FLOKI, and BRETT may offer limited short-term potential. In contrast, Agent A.I. emerges as a unique memecoin that stands against fake AI tokens, bringing both humor and the promise of significant gains. Agent A.I. draws inspiration from the success of PEPE coin, aiming to replicate its remarkable rise. With an entry price of $0.003333333 during the presale and a 98% discount for early buyers, it offers an attractive opportunity. The tokenomics are straightforward, with a capped supply of 5 billion tokens and allocations for staking and rewards. The mission is active, and the presale is live—now is the time to consider joining this ambitious venture.

40356314,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129142,1739618436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tether’s Bold Move: Influencing US Stablecoin Regulations for a Secure Crypto Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-usdt-stablecoin-regulation/,"In a significant development for the cryptocurrency world, Tether, the powerhouse behind the USDT stablecoin, is stepping into the regulatory arena. Recognizing the growing scrutiny around stablecoins, Tether is proactively engaging with U.S. lawmakers to play a pivotal role in shaping the upcoming regulations. This bold move, first reported by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, signals a crucial juncture for the future of fiat-backed cryptocurrencies and the broader digital asset landscape. Let’s delve into what this engagement means for the crypto industry and, specifically, for USDT and its users. Why is Tether Engaging with Lawmakers on Stablecoin Regulations? The increasing popularity and systemic importance of stablecoins have placed them squarely under the regulatory microscope. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to oversee these digital assets, which are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. For Tether, the issuer of the world’s most widely used stablecoin, USDT , proactive engagement is not just a strategic choice but a necessity. Here’s why Tether’s engagement is noteworthy: Proactive Approach: Instead of waiting for regulations to be imposed, Tether is taking a proactive stance by directly communicating with lawmakers. This allows them to present their perspective and potentially influence the regulatory framework in a way that is both compliant and conducive to innovation. Addressing Scrutiny: Tether has faced criticism and regulatory questions in the past, particularly regarding the backing of USDT and the transparency of its reserves. Engaging with lawmakers is a public demonstration of their commitment to addressing these concerns and working towards a regulated environment. Shaping the Future of Stablecoins: The regulations being discussed will significantly impact the operational landscape for all stablecoin issuers, including Tether. By participating in these discussions, Tether aims to ensure that the regulations are practical, workable, and foster responsible growth within the stablecoin ecosystem. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has publicly emphasized the company’s dedication to compliance. This engagement with U.S. lawmakers underscores this commitment and signals a willingness to adapt to evolving regulatory expectations. Decoding the Proposed Stablecoin Regulations: What’s on the Table? The specifics of the proposed stablecoin regulations are still evolving, but key elements are emerging from discussions and reports. According to Eleanor Terrett’s report, if these regulations are enacted, Tether would face significant changes to its operational framework, primarily focusing on transparency and reserve backing. Here’s a breakdown of the potential regulatory requirements: Mandatory Monthly Audits: One of the most significant potential changes is the requirement for full monthly audits conducted by a U.S. accounting firm. This would represent a substantial increase in the frequency and rigor of financial assessments for Tether. Full Reserve Backing by Approved Assets: The regulations are likely to mandate that stablecoin issuers, including Tether, must ensure their reserves are fully backed by approved assets. This aims to guarantee that stablecoins are truly backed 1:1 by stable and liquid assets, providing greater security to users. Currently, Tether conducts quarterly financial assessments through BDO, a global accounting firm. While these assessments provide some level of transparency, they fall short of a full audit and are conducted less frequently than what the proposed regulations might require. Critics have long called for more comprehensive and frequent audits to verify Tether’s claims about its reserves. Why Full Monthly Audits Could Be a Game Changer for USDT and User Trust The potential shift to mandatory full monthly audits is a critical aspect of the proposed regulations. For Tether and the broader stablecoin market, this could be a game changer in terms of transparency and user trust. Consider these points: Enhanced Transparency: Monthly audits would provide a much higher degree of transparency into Tether’s reserves. Regular, independent verification by a U.S. accounting firm would offer users and regulators a clearer and more up-to-date picture of the assets backing USDT. Increased User Confidence: Consistent, verifiable audits can significantly boost user confidence in USDT. Concerns about the actual backing of stablecoins have been a persistent issue in the crypto space. Monthly audits can help alleviate these fears and foster greater trust in USDT’s stability. Regulatory Approval and Legitimacy: Complying with stringent audit requirements can pave the way for greater regulatory acceptance and legitimacy for Tether and the stablecoin sector as a whole. Meeting U.S. regulatory standards can also set a benchmark for global stablecoin regulations. Market Stability: Increased transparency and trust can contribute to greater stability in the crypto market. Stablecoins play a crucial role in facilitating trading and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. Ensuring their soundness is vital for overall market health. However, implementing monthly audits also presents challenges. It would require significant operational adjustments and increased costs for Tether. The scope and methodology of these audits would also need to be clearly defined to ensure they are effective and provide meaningful assurance. Navigating the Complex Landscape of Crypto Regulation The move by Tether to engage with U.S. lawmakers highlights the increasingly complex landscape of crypto regulation . Governments worldwide are at different stages of developing regulatory frameworks for digital assets. The U.S., being a major financial hub, holds significant influence in shaping global regulatory trends. Key challenges in regulating cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, include: Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulations need to strike a balance between fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving crypto space and mitigating potential risks to consumers and the financial system. Overly restrictive regulations could stifle innovation, while lax oversight could lead to instability and harm. Defining Regulatory Perimeters: Determining which agencies should regulate different aspects of the crypto market and defining the scope of their authority is a complex task. Coordination between different regulatory bodies is crucial. Global Coordination: Cryptocurrencies operate globally, making international regulatory coordination essential. Disparate regulations across jurisdictions can create arbitrage opportunities and regulatory gaps. Technological Understanding: Regulators need to develop a deep understanding of the underlying technologies and business models in the crypto space to create effective and informed regulations. Tether’s engagement is a positive step towards fostering dialogue and collaboration between the crypto industry and regulators. It underscores the importance of industry stakeholders actively participating in the regulatory process to ensure that regulations are both robust and practical. What Does This Mean for the Future of USDT and the Stablecoin Market? Tether’s proactive engagement with U.S. lawmakers and the potential implementation of stricter stablecoin regulations signal a maturing phase for the crypto market. While the specific outcomes are yet to unfold, several potential implications are worth considering: Increased Legitimacy for USDT: If Tether successfully navigates these regulatory changes and implements monthly audits and full reserve backing, it could significantly enhance the legitimacy and credibility of USDT. This could solidify its position as the leading stablecoin. Higher Standards for Stablecoin Issuers: The U.S. regulations could set a new, higher standard for stablecoin issuers globally. Other jurisdictions may follow suit, leading to a more regulated and transparent stablecoin market worldwide. Potential Market Consolidation: The increased compliance costs associated with stricter regulations could lead to market consolidation, potentially favoring larger, well-resourced stablecoin issuers like Tether. Smaller players might find it challenging to meet the new requirements. Evolution of Stablecoin Models: The regulatory environment could drive innovation in stablecoin models. We might see the emergence of new types of stablecoins designed to meet specific regulatory requirements and cater to different risk appetites. Ultimately, the developments surrounding Tether and stablecoin regulations are pivotal for the crypto industry. They represent a move towards greater regulatory clarity and oversight, which, while potentially adding compliance burdens, can also foster long-term stability, trust, and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, Tether’s engagement with U.S. lawmakers is a landmark event, reflecting the growing importance of stablecoin regulation. The potential for monthly audits and stricter reserve requirements signals a push for greater transparency and security in the stablecoin market. While challenges remain, these developments are crucial for building a more robust, reliable, and trustworthy crypto ecosystem.

The collapse wiped out $4.4 billion in market capitalization and affected the overall meme coin market. The incident began with Milei’s social media post at 5:01 PM ET, promoting a token purportedly aimed at “boosting the Argentine economy by funding small projects.” The project’s website, created just hours before launch, included a Google Form for funding applications but lacked detailed tokenomics or transparent ownership information. It all began with this post at 5:01 PM ET from Javier Milei. As seen during President Trump's memecoin launch, the first hour was full of speculation: Was this a hack or a real launch? It turned out to be real as multiple other Argentinian politicians posted the news. pic.twitter.com/cL0ZQgxtCB — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 15, 2025 On-chain analysis revealed concentrated insider activity, with 82% of LIBRA tokens held in a single cluster. According to Bubblemaps data, insiders extracted $87.4 million within the first three hours through strategic liquidity manipulation.

Over 50,000 wallets acquired LIBRA tokens within two hours of launch, while total market losses exceeded $6 billion during the three-hour downturn. Milei later distanced himself from the project, deleting his initial post and claiming he “was not aware of the details.” He characterized the incident as an attempt by “filthy rats of the political caste” to discredit him.

OFFICIAL TRUMP price surged by 26% in the last 7 days reaching $23 which is just shy of its February peak. The meme crypto category printed green indexes when the biggest digital assets like Ethereum (ETH) and BNB recorded a marginal decline. The cumulative meme crypto market cap surged by 4% over the last day to stand at $75 billion. Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE are managing to keep up the momentum as traders’ sentiments turn “Neutral”. $TRUMP trading vol up by 297% OFFICIAL TRUMP turned out to be one of the biggest gainers among the top 100 cryptos and led the meme coins’ upward rally. TRUMP price jumped by 25% in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by a massive 297% to stand at $7.35 billion. It is trading at an average price of $21.12 at press time. As per the data shared by CoinGlass, $19 million worth of long and short bets set on TRUMP price action liquidated in the past 24 hours. More than $12.4 million worth of liquidated positions (65%) turns out to be short bets. This suggests that traders were expecting the official meme coin of Donald Trump price decline to continue. However, This rally follows weeks of decline since it went on to hit its all-time high of $75 on January 19. It is down by 71% from its ATH. Source: CoinGlass The massive surge comes in when the Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial bought another 52.07 Wrapped Bitcoin (approx. worth $5 million) and 2.53 million MOVE (approx. worth $1.4 million). Since November 30, World Liberty Fi has accumulated 63,030 Ether (approx. worth $210 million), 699 WBTC ($73.5 million), 40.72 million TRX ($10 million), and more. DOGE and WIF show strength The biggest meme crypto, Dogecoin has been dealing with the selling pressure over the past month. DOGE price dropped by 25% in the past 30 days, however, it gained 13% in the past 7 days. Its price surged by another 4% over the last 24 hours.

There’s a $0.05 PropFi coin that is poised to deliver huge market gains this year. With a unique blend of decentralized finance and proprietary trading tools, the new crypto project offers you a chance to access significant capital and earn rewards through its Trade2Earn program, all while capitalizing on the growing confidence in its potential for 100x growth. Thus, the new PropFi coin is a good crypto to buy! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys: A Crypto Trading Platform With Trader Funding and Trade2Earn Programs Are you looking to invest your money in one of the top crypto trading performers that may deliver the best market gains in 2025? FXGuys ($FXG) is a great option for you. The new crypto project integrates decentralized finance and proprietary trading, enabling you to access multiple tools that increase returns and reduce risks. FX Guys features a Trader Funding Program that offers retail traders a huge opportunity to access $200,000 to $500,000 in trading capital after completing the evaluation process. With this program, designed with an 80/20 profit-sharing model that favors the trader, the FX Guys platform has set the standards in the online trading sector. Another significant feature that makes FX Guys a good crypto to buy is its Trade2Earn program. The FXGuys Trade2Earn program rewards you with $FXG tokens for every trade you execute, regardless of the trade outcome. The investment concept incentivizes crypto trading activity, enhancing volume and engagement on the platform. Blending DeFi principles with groundbreaking trading mechanics puts FXGuys among the top DeFi coins available for the best market gains of the year. The rising influx of investors into the PropFi coin’s market reflects growing confidence in its potential for massive growth. With a projected 100x token price pump, the project stands out as a promising investment option with the possibility of significant price surges this year. A major factor fueling the increased adoption is the staking feature that allows $FXG holders to earn a 20% profit and revenue from broker trading volumes. This investment model incentivizes holding $FXG. Whale Accumulation Signals an Impending AAVE Price Pump AAVE surged 9.6% in a day after hitting $274.91 on February 5, 2025, driven by community excitement over its potential launch on Sonic blockchain and increased whale accumulation. The token’s market cap surpassed $4.1 billion, with a daily trading volume of $853 million. AAVE’s rally was fueled by three key factors: the community’s approval of AAVE V3 on Sonic, resilience in processing $210 million in liquidations without bad debt, and strong whale accumulation . Over 102,259 AAVE tokens were recently bought by whales, boosting investor confidence and increasing demand. FXGuys outshines AAVE by offering unique tools for retail traders, such as access to significant capital, an 80/20 profit-sharing model, and a Trade2Earn program. These features fuel 100x growth potential, unlike AAVE’s reliance on whale accumulation. Meanwhile, AAVE was valued at $263.13 on February 6, down 12.82% in the last week. FXGuys Offers Greater Growth Potential Amid Jupiter’s Uncertainty Jupiter’s token is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, showing indecision after peaking at $1.851 in March 2023. Elliott Wave analysis identifies a corrective WXY pattern, with resistance at $1.162 aligning with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. The RSI remains neutral, indicating balanced buying and selling pressure. A breakout above the triangle could push JUP toward $1.421, while failure to hold $0.912 may lead to a drop to $0.732. If wave (v) unfolds, JUP could surpass $1.005, but a break below support would invalidate the bullish outlook. FXGuys outperforms Jupiter by offering tangible benefits like access to substantial capital, staking rewards, and a Trade2Earn program, which boost engagement and growth, unlike Jupiter’s uncertain price action and consolidation. Nevertheless, JUP traded at $0.897 on February 6, down 19.27% in the past week. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG is Considered a Good Crypto to Buy For Massive Gains! FXGuys ($FXG), a PropFi coin, offers an exciting opportunity for investors looking for high market gains in 2025. With its exclusive combination of decentralized finance and innovative trading tools, FXGuys is well-positioned for substantial growth. The project’s impressive funding programs, rewards system, and staking feature make it a standout investment option ahead of Aave (AAVE) and Jupiter (JUP), potentially delivering returns far exceeding expectations in 2025. The $FXG public presale has attracted many investors, raising over $3.85 million. The public presale is now in Stage 3, and each $FXG token is valued at $0.05. Those who join the presale now will secure a 100% profit by launch at $0.10. What’s more, experts hint at a 100x price surge post-launch.

Converse to the Fed Chair’s previous hostile approach to the flagship cryptocurrency, a recent interview revealed that Powell sees the digital asset as parallel to gold, although there is a catch. Binance Founder CZ Calls Jerome Powell’s Shifting Stance ‘An Improvement’ In an X post on February 15, Binance founder CZ called Jerome Powell’s optimistically shifting approach towards BTC “an improvement to the previous narrative.” Notably, the U.S. Fed Chair reflected a highly optimistic approach to Bitcoin, speaking with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook Summit. Powell stated that “people use BTC as a speculative asset.” Further, he added that the asset is “just like gold, only it’s virtual.” This statement, underscoring the Fed Chair’s recognition of the crypto as an asset class, has raised eyebrows across the broader market. However, it’s worth mentioning that the Chair still believes BTC to be of no comparison to the U.S. dollar, given its high volatility and lack of use as a payment method. Nevertheless, Powell’s comparison of BTC to gold is what the Binance founder is optimistic about. CZ’s New Entry Into The Crypto Market? Meanwhile, following CZ’s prison saga, a new endeavor in the crypto market has echoed a buzz among investors. Changpeng Zhao recently caught the market’s attention with his new dog, Broccoli, and the meme coin sector witnessed more than 20K token launches inspired by this event. A recent CoinGape report revealed that a crypto whale bet hugely on CZ’s Dog (BROCCOLI) token amid this frenzy. Traders and investors continue to navigate the meme coin sector, filtering among these same themed tokens for profit-booking motives. U.S. Fed’s Stace Still Not Optimistic? Simultaneously, it’s also worth mentioning that despite Powell’s shifting approach to Bitcoin, the U.S. Fed’s recent monetary decisions have presented risk assets with pressure. The latest U.S. CPI data came in hotter than expected at 3% for January. Whereas, the PPI also came in hot at 3.5%, the highest since February 2023. With rising inflation and no rate cuts by the Fed, the crypto market’s much-awaited bull-cycle appears to have halted. Nevertheless, crypto prices showed signs of recovery as the week came to an end, sparking discussions over future movements. Also, CZ’s comments regarding an optimistic shift in Powell’s approach towards BTC sparked discussions over a loosened grip on risk assets by the U.S. Fed moving ahead.

Decentralized AI | Opinion,https://crypto.news/big-techs-biggest-nightmare-decentralized-ai-opinion/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Today, consumers have grown accustomed to instant gratification. They expect to get what they want and when they want it. With the rise of on-demand services, convenience has become a non-negligible expectation, and the notion of waiting or being restricted by outdated systems is becoming a thing of the past. In 2025, flexibility and immediacy are non-negotiables. You might also like: Decentralized AI is the only path to ethical and transparent data collection | Opinion However, organizations and individuals leveraging artificial intelligence find themselves at the mercy of centralized providers, mainly the “magnificent seven,” that dominate the market. These include major players like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, who provide critical infrastructure and resources to power AI operations. Just this week, these same companies announced plans to invest $320 billion in AI, a 28 percent increase over last year’s spending. While many might have expected China’s DeepSeek, an AI platform that rose to fame after proving to cost a fraction of what its competitors charge, to prompt CEOs to rethink their budgets, the opposite has happened. As Big Tech continues to make significant financial investments, smaller businesses still remain dependent on a few centralized providers. They have little to no choice but to rely on a handful of companies that dominate access to these essential resources needed to power their operations. One of the most pressing concerns when depending on Big Tech is the potential for providers to restrict access to services or, worse, shut down operations without notice. For instance, a quick search for “ Azure down ” brings up thousands of results, like countless Reddit pages highlighting how often users encounter disruption. Microsoft even dedicated a page on its site to provide real-time service status updates. Such a lack of control over critical infrastructure can be devastating. In these situations, businesses are left vulnerable without access to essential systems, which could result in operational disruptions and possibly financial implications. As companies consolidate power over AI, the risk of data breaches and geographical tensions rises. A company relying solely on a US provider for its AI needs may be vulnerable to tensions between the US and other countries like China. A sudden shift in foreign policy could restrict access to AI tools, services, or even data. These disruptions could leave businesses scrambling to adapt to new compliance requirements, potentially impeding their operations with only a moment’s notice. While some projects dream of being able to invest in the computing power that runs advanced AI models, the reality is the price tag for hardware, like advanced graphic processing units, can run into millions of dollars. This growing reliance on centralized infrastructure has prompted a search for alternatives that can break down the monopoly of cloud giants. Just as decentralized finance has opened access to investing outside traditional financial services, decentralized technologies can give businesses more control over the tools and services needed to power AI. One solution is Exabits, a company that has introduced the concept of decentralized AI. The project is focused on democratizing access to AI by supplying computing power and resources to projects throughout the growing ecosystem. After raising $15 million in seed funding, Exabits has integrated 4,000 NVIDIA H200 GPUs into its network with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) capabilities. This integration guarantees the highest level of security, ensuring that computations remain tamper-proof and sensitive data is protected. These high-performance, AI-ready GPUs allow Exabits to address the growing demand for some of the most ambitious projects in the market. The company has already established strategic partnerships with numerous projects across sectors, solidifying its position as a key player in the AI space. As AI grows, projects can no longer afford to be at the mercy of the world’s largest tech giants. The future of AI depends on expanding access, and without this shift, we risk remaining reliant on a handful of dominant players, leaving projects confined and vulnerable to their control. Only by decentralizing AI can we break free from monopolistic control and create an inclusive future where opportunities are within everyone’s reach.

The nation’s financial institutions, particularly those associated with SBI Holdings, have been exploring the use of XRP for cross-border payments and remittance solutions. SBI Holdings has been one of the most vocal supporters of XRP, integrating it into various financial products and services over the years. A recent report by Times Tabloid highlighted another significant development in Japan’s XRP adoption. According to the publication , SBI Shinsei Bank recently announced a strategic partnership to enhance international money transfers using the XRP Ledger. This partnership signifies continued confidence in XRP’s ability to facilitate efficient, cost-effective cross-border transactions. Ripple’s Growing Presence in Japan Ripple’s presence in Japan has grown steadily due to its collaboration with SBI Holdings and the broader financial sector. Ripple’s technology enables faster and cheaper cross-border transactions compared to traditional banking methods, making it an attractive solution for banks and financial institutions seeking to enhance their international payment capabilities. The statement from Jevans further reinforces the notion that Japanese banks are increasingly adopting XRP for their financial infrastructure. This aligns with Ripple’s broader mission of transforming global payments through blockchain technology. As more financial institutions recognize the benefits of blockchain-based payment solutions, XRP’s role in the global financial ecosystem is expected to expand. The latest developments in Japan suggest that the country remains at the forefront of this transformation, positioning XRP as a key player in the future of digital finance.

This development has sparked optimism within the XRP community as many deem it a sign that a green light is imminent. XRP ETF One Step Closer After SEC’s Inital Nod Ripple’s XRP recently made waves as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged Grayscale’s proposal for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. In a 19b-4 form posted on Thursday acknowledging NYSE Arca’s application on behalf of crypto giant Grayscale, the SEC asked the public to file comments within 21 days of the proposal’s publication in the Federal Register. A day later, the regulator also acknowledged the XRP ETF filing from asset manager 21Shares. A 19b-4 filing is the second part of a two-step process for proposing a spot crypto ETF. Publication in the SEC’s Federal Register kicks off the agency’s approval process. If approved, it would represent huge validation of XRP as an investable asset, potentially widening institutional participation and boosting market liquidity. An XRP ETF would also set the altcoin up for a parabolic rally. XRP traded higher at $2.80 at publication time, up 2.9% on a 24-hour basis. It was one of the best-performing top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. XRP is the third largest cryptocurrency by market value, according to CoinGecko . 2025 XRP ETF Approval Odds Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented on the SEC’s decision to acknowledge the XRP ETFs. Garlinghouse believes such a development was “inevitable” even though there were “some vocal assertions to the contrary.” He has frequently predicted that American spot XRP ETF would be approved even though it seemed highly unlikely given the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding the underlying asset. The SEC lodged a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020 for allegedly breaking federal securities laws by raising $1.3 billion in an unregistered securities offering to raise funds. Ripple partially won the court case in August 2023 and XRP was declared a non-security when sold to institutional investors by a federal judge. The SEC appealed the case on Jan. 15 — just five days before Donald Trump was sworn into office as the U.S. President — claiming that Ripple’s sale of XRP to retail investors satisfied the Howey Test. Ripple President Monica Long has also voiced confidence that the XRP token is next in line to get spot ETF approval. As ZyCrypto recently reported , Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimated a 65% chance for an XRP ETF to be greenlit by the SEC in 2025. However, these odds are likely to skyrocket after the agency’s recent acknowledgment. The SEC, of course, could still reject a spot XRP ETF, but many are pinning their hopes on the new pro-crypto administration of Donald Trump.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-15 12:07:19

The agency stated that its newly established crypto task force could play a key role in facilitating a resolution. In a Feb. 14 filing, the SEC said its ongoing evaluation of crypto-related issues required additional time to prepare a response to Coinbase’s petition. The regulator’s request, if granted, would push its deadline to respond from Feb. 14 to March 14. Coinbase agreed to the extension, marking another delay in the legal standoff that has lasted nearly two years. This comes just days after the SEC and Binance filed a joint motion to pause their case for 60 days, also citing the crypto task force’s role in developing a regulatory framework. Coinbase SEC Legal Battle Continues The SEC originally sued Coinbase in June 2023, accusing the exchange of offering unregistered securities and operating without proper regulatory approvals. Coinbase has repeatedly argued that crypto assets do not fall under securities laws and has been pushing for clarity on how digital assets should be classified. On Jan. 21, Coinbase filed an appeal asking the U.S. court to rule that crypto trades on its platform are not securities. The exchange emphasized that the classification of secondary market crypto transactions is critical to the industry’s future. The case took a notable turn in March 2024 when Judge Katherine Failla granted an appeal request to review her earlier order denying Coinbase’s motion for judgment. The judge also stayed all proceedings until the Second Circuit rules on an interlocutory appeal. Optimism for Regulatory Clarity The SEC’s announcement of a dedicated crypto task force has raised expectations that long-standing lawsuits involving major exchanges may be resolved sooner rather than later. The task force is being led by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, a known advocate for balanced crypto regulations. Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda , who announced the initiative, has also expressed openness to a more structured regulatory framework for digital assets. As the SEC’s stance on crypto appears to be shifting under the new administration, industry participants are closely watching whether the agency will drop cases against Coinbase and other firms—or move toward a clearer, more favorable regulatory approach.

Data collected by blockchain researcher Aylo shows Solana-based apps pulled in ten times more revenue than their Ethereum-based counterparts. Speculation as an Economic Backbone Aylo’s figures revealed Solana’s stronghold is on-chain activity. In the last 24 hours, apps on the network generated $8.4 million in revenue, nearly 10x more than Ethereum’s $875,613 in the same period. This trend also extended to trading volumes, with Solana doubling Ethereum’s numbers. Trading on the world’s second-largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL) hit $5.39 billion, more than twice the $2.14 billion recorded on its much larger rival. It was the same with perpetual trading volumes, with Solana registering $1.09 billion compared to Ethereum’s $470 million. According to Aylo, this surge is largely fueled by retail speculation and high-frequency trading on Solana-based apps. Platforms such as Pump.fun and Bonkbot have contributed hugely to this revenue, creating a relatively stable financial base for the network. The researcher argued that the foundation of Solana’s economic security is mainly built on speculative activity, adding that he does not see such activity ending any time soon: “Just like online gambling never ceases, neither will this gambling/speculation, whether you like it or not (people like to play unwinnable lotteries). Solana has captured one of crypto’s biggest use cases.” However, some critics questioned Aylo’s numbers, arguing that app revenue metrics from DefiLlama, which the analyst seemingly relied on, might not be entirely accurate. According to them, some major Ethereum apps, such as Uniswap, are not included in the dataset. Despite the inroads Solana is making, Ethereum has maintained its dominance in large trade volumes and liquidity pools. A recent report by OKX revealed that most high-value trades, especially those larger than $50,000, still occur on the network and its layer-2 chains. It also boasts a better quality of liquidity pools, holding ten of the top 20 positions, with Base hosting five and Arbitrum and Binance Smart Chain having two each. This leaves Solana with just one liquidity pool representing the network on the list. Growth and Future Outlook Ultimately, while Ethereum has a historical lead, with its $74.3 billion TVL dwarfing Solana’s $9.5 billion, the latter’s momentum is undeniable. Long-term institutional adoption of the network’s native SOL token could be useful, especially with observers asking what non-speculative use cases will solidify Solana’s place in the industry. Recently, the CBOE filed a flurry of proposals for Solana exchange-traded products on behalf of several crypto investment firms, including VanEck, Bitwise, and 21Shares. While the odds of such a product getting approved may currently be low, given the SEC’s past categorization of SOL as a security, the appointment of more crypto-friendly agency leadership offers a sliver of hope for the applicants.

Discover Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is All The Rave Right Now,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/worlds-largest-meme-wall-at-100-million-market-cap-discover-why-floppypepe-fppe-is-all-the-rave-right-now,"Most meme coins come with little or no utility. They are created for fun with the usually unrealistic hopes of becoming viral. However, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is different. It is an AI meme coin platform packed with so much utility that it has become the token on everyone’s lips. One such utility is its proposed $100 million physical meme wall. Let’s dive into this concept and see how to use it to create a lasting legacy. Introducing FloppyPepe (FPPE), A Meme Coin Platform Set To Break New Ground FloppyPepe (FPPE) is an advanced AI meme coin platform that allows users to create, share, manage, and monetize internet memes uniquely. It is the third meme coin [after Pepe (PEPE) and Brett (BRETT)] made on the legacy of Matt Furie, a cultural icon in the meme coin world. Therefore, FloppyPepe (FPPE) does not start from scratch; instead, it benefits from a rich heritage that brings it cultural relevance and credibility. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) platform differentiates itself from other meme coin platforms by introducing practical and much-needed utilities. Apart from the $100 million meme wall, which this article will cover, it also has the Meme-o-matic machine (an AI-powered meme-creating product), FloppyX (a video-generating tool), the Meme DAO protocol (a community voting platform), and many others. For now, though, let’s take a look at what the $100 million meme wall entails. An In-depth Look At FloppyPepe’s $100 Million Meme Wall Concept FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) $100 million meme wall is a unique concept the team will implement when FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) market capitalization reaches one hundred million dollars. It involves creating a physical meme wall, the largest of its kind, to symbolize the unstoppable meme coin revolution led by FloppyPepe (FPPE). While the $100 million meme wall is in itself a unique concept, it will be accompanied by various highlights that will further cement FloppyPepe’s status as the most distinctive of all meme coins. These include: A Shout-out To Every FloppyPepe (FPPE) Investor During the event, every FloppyPepe (FPPE) investor who has staked the token will win a spot for their meme on this special wall. It’s a way of immortalizing their creativity for the entire world to see. Also, the community will decide on the specific location for the $100 million meme wall event by voting. A Cameo By Matt Furie Himself Who better to inaugurate this monumental landmark than Matt Furie himself, the creator of the meme that eventually gave rise to FloppyPepe (FPPE)? He will be there on that day to celebrate his legacy. There will also be mascot versions of all Matt Furie meme characters, including Pepe and Brett. Mouth-watering Prizes Up For Grabs Fourteen attendees will walk away with cash prizes on that day. They will be selected during a special airdrop that will see them share from a pool of $20,000. To qualify, however, these must be FloppyPepe (FPPE) holders who have staked their tokens. The event will also feature the release of a limited edition meme wall NFT series to commemorate the $100 million market capitalization milestone. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Presale - An Opportunity To Be A Part Of This Monumental Legacy All who have bought and staked Floppy(FPPE) before it crosses the $100 million mark will share in this history by seeing their memes featured on the wall. To be a part of this legacy, users must get their hands on some FloppyPepe (FPPE) tokens, especially when they are still cheap. They can do so now by joining the fast-selling presale that everyone is talking about. The presale is currently in its first stage, selling each token at $0.0000002. Before this, the team had successfully sold 5.04 trillion FloppyPepe (FPPE) tokens during its private sale. The tokens sold out in under 24 hours, generating over $900,000 in revenue. Those who buy now will also get a generous 40% bonus alongside their initial allocation. By the time FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) $100 million market cap milestone is reached, early buyers will have gained multiples upon multiples on their initial investment. Even a $100 investment now could grow into $1 million or more. The risk is very minimal, especially as FloppyPepe (FPPE) recently completed a thorough audit of its token’s smart contract. With low risk, high reward potential, and the opportunity to be part of a big community, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the next best chance of creating generational wealth.

Litecoin’s Potential Surge: Will LTC Break Resistance? Litecoin is riding a wave of potential growth. The price is currently between $88.93 to $117.50. It’s close to the nearest resistance at $127.86. With a weekly price change of over 26% and a monthly increase of over 24%, bullish momentum is strong. The 6-month growth of nearly 89% signals robust upward movement. The current RSI of 54.57 suggests it’s not overbought. If momentum continues, LTC could reach the second resistance at $156.43, a potential surge of around 35% from current levels. Keep an eye on this altcoin as it may lead the charge in the next bull run. Helium’s Potential Soars with Bulls Set to Charge Helium (HNT) is experiencing some exciting movement. Currently, the price ranges from $3.04 to $3.77. It’s approaching a resistance at $4.12, with signs pointing to a potential breakout. The 10-day moving average is at $3.90, slightly above the 100-day mark of $3.80, indicating possible upward momentum. With an RSI of 60.47, the coin isn’t overbought yet, hinting at room for growth. Recent data shows a weekly surge of over 24%. If the bulls maintain control, Helium could aim for the next resistance at $4.85, potentially rising by over 20%. Keep an eye on market movements; this could be a thrilling rise. Kaspa Could Spark Major Altcoin Rally: Price Surge on the Horizon Kaspa is on the move, trading between $0.0688 and $0.1111. The coin’s recent performance shows a 27.56% weekly increase. However, it’s still down by over 22% for the month. Strong support at around $0.0512 suggests a foundation for recovery. If it breaks the resistance at approximately $0.1358, it could rally towards $0.1781. The Relative Strength Index at 59.15 and a 10-day SMA of $0.1059 show positive momentum. The MACD level is in bullish territory, indicating potential growth. With a possible upward movement of 90% from its current range, Kaspa might be gearing up for significant gains in the coming weeks. Conclusion LTC, HNT, and KAS are showing gains but may offer less short-term potential.

Rollblock is revolutionizing the Web3 gaming scene with an astounding 600% increase in users in December, and analysts foresee a potential 50x surge this year. Here’s why RBLK is a better choice compared to more stagnant assets like Cardano. The Emergence of Rollblock’s (RBLK) Web3 Gaming Phenomenon Rollblock ( RBLK ) is transforming the online gaming sector through its blockchain-driven Web3 platform, offering a completely crypto-native, decentralized option to conventional casinos. December marked a significant milestone for Rollblock, with a 600% rise in new users, drawing in a fresh wave of gaming enthusiasts. This growth was mirrored by an impressive $1.75 million in placed wagers . With a vast library of over 7000 games and a flourishing sports prediction league, Rollblock is poised to capture a substantial portion of the $500 billion gaming market. Unlike centralized casinos that require users to trust the house blindly, Rollblock uses Ethereum blockchain technology to provide complete transparency, addressing the trust issues that have deterred gamers in the past. Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing model greatly enhances long-term value for token holders. Thirty percent of the platform’s profits are used for buybacks, with 60% of these buybacks being consistently burned to decrease the circulating supply. The remaining 40% is allocated as staking rewards, offering a seamless passive income of up to 30% APY for those who stake their $RBLK. As Stage 10 tokens are rapidly being sold at $0.055, prices are expected to skyrocket, making this an opportune moment to invest in this promising low-cap asset. Cardano (ADA): ETF Rumors Fuel Price Surge Cardano has been experiencing a surge in positive sentiment recently due to mounting speculation about a potential ADA ETF. Although no official confirmation has been issued, talks about Cardano’s regulatory approval have been increasing over the past weeks. Currently, ADA is priced at $0.80, reflecting a 12% increase this week. However, the monthly trend is still declining after a 22% fall from $1.04. Daily trading volume remains low, with $830 million of Cardano exchanged in the past 24 hours. Analysts believe Cardano could possibly break out towards $2 if the ETF rumors prove true. Grayscale has recently submitted the necessary documents for a dedicated spot Cardano ETF to the SEC. This would allow institutional investors access to the Cardano ecosystem and further solidify Cardano's status in the market. If approved, Cardano might soon reach new price levels above $3 in 2025. Rollblock Continues to Shine While Cardano’s ETF speculation could lead to short-term profits for those trading quickly, Rollblock emerges as the top investment choice for 2025. Its growing popularity and deflationary tokenomics make RBLK extremely appealing to investors at the current price.

Rollblock’s Web3 gaming revolution is making waves with 600% user growth in December, and analysts predicting a rally of up to 50x this year. Here’s why RBLK is superior to slower-moving assets like Cardano. Rollblock’s (RBLK) Web3 Gaming Boom Is Just Beginning Rollblock ( RBLK ) is massively changing up the online gaming industry with its blockchain-powered Web3 platform. This offers players a fully crypto-native, decentralized alternative to traditional casinos. December was a remarkable month for Rollblock as it saw a 600% surge in new users, sweeping a whole new wave of gamers into the Rollblock revolution. This influx was accompanied by an impressive $1.75 million in wagered bids being placed . With an extensive catalog of 7000+ games and a thriving sports prediction league, Rollblock is set to command a significant slice of the hugely lucrative $500 billion gaming industry. Unlike centralized casinos that require users to blindly place their trust in the house, Rollblock leverages Ethereum blockchain technology to ensure full transparency, eliminating the ongoing trust concerns that have long put gamers off. Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing scheme adds immense long-term value for its token holders. 30% of the platform’s profits are allocated to buybacks, with 60% of these buybacks consistently burned to reduce the supply in circulation. The remaining 40% is distributed as staking rewards, offering a hassle-free passive income of up to 30% APY for holders who stake their $RBLK. With Stage 10 tokens selling at a rapid pace for $0.055, prices are set to rise exponentially, making now the ideal time to accumulate this low-cap gem. Cardano (ADA): ETF Speculation Boosts Price Action Cardano has been experiencing massively bullish sentiment recently as a result of growing speculation around a potential ADA ETF. While no official announcement has been made, discussions surrounding Cardano’s regulatory approval have been rising in recent weeks. ADA is currently trading at $0.80, up 12% this week. The monthly candle, however, is still very much in decline after a 22% drop from $1.04. Daily trading volume has been quite muted as well, as only $830 million of Cardano was traded across exchanges in the last 24 hours. Analysts are confident that Cardano could see a potential breakout toward $2 if the ETF rumors are confirmed. Grayscale recently filed the necessary paperwork for a dedicated spot Cardano ETF with the SEC. This would give institutional capital access to the Cardano ecosystem and further establish Cardano as a force to be reckoned with. If approved, it is very possible that Cardano could soon enter price discovery above $3 during 2025. Rollblock Continues To Impress While Cardano’s ETF speculation could provide short-term gains for swing traders, Rollblock stands out as the best investment for 2025. Its surging popularity and deflationary tokenomics make RBLK hugely attractive to investors at the current price. With Stage 10 tokens already 30% sold out at $0.055, investors should secure their position now before the upcoming parabolic run.

Synthetic is a decentralized protocol that allows you to create and transact synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Is SNX a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in five years? Let’s get into the SNX price prediction and technical analysis.

It lost 1.65% of its value today. SNX coin prices target the next support at $0.974. On February 15, 2025, Synthetix’s price analysis revealed a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency. The SNX/USD value has dropped to a low of $1.014 over the last 24 hours. The overall market sentiment has remained bearish since yesterday, as the bears secured the lead, which resulted in SNX shedding another 1.65% of its value. SNX/USD 1-day chart: Cryptocurrency devalues to $0.971 The one-day price chart of Synthetix coin confirmed a downtrend for the currency. Coin value receded to a $1.014 low during the day. Despite the earlier bullish attempts for recovery, today the bearish strength remained high. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. The Bollinger bands are widening, resulting in increasing volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $1.64. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.730. SNX/USD 1-day Chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region. The indicator’s value deteriorated to an index of 32.22 in the last 24 hours. This puts SNX in a high probability of reversing as it nears the oversold range. The selling pressure remains high, as signified by the descending curve. SNX/USD 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of the Synthetix coin referred to a downward swing in the market. The SNX/USD value fell to a low of $1.014 in the past few hours. However, a green candlestick has appeared, which is small in size, and no notable increase has yet been observed, but it indicates the presence of support at the current price level. The Bollinger bands are converging, leading to receding volatility levels. This reduction in volatility marks lower chances of a reversal in the upcoming hours. Moreover, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $1.066, hinting at the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $1.012, signaling the availability of support. SNX/USD 4-hour Chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is at the center of the neutral region. Currently at 50.26 and moving horizontally, signaling an undecided trend. The selling pressure decreased in the last four hours, leading to a balanced market and a flattened curve. This balanced market condition is also shown by the straightening slope on the RSI graph.

Synthetix coin price analysis shows a bearish outlook of market conditions. The SNX/USD value has depreciated to a low of $1.014 in the day. The overall market sentiment remains largely bearish. Cryptocurrency also fell by 1.65% over the last 24 hours. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to support the sellers. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $7.56 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is under bearish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024. The SNX price has decreased to $1.014 as it depreciated 1.65% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $2 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2028. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2029. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $8.67, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $8.67 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-15 13:10:00

If hype returns in line with the 4-year cycle, Pepe exudes strong potential to challenge Shiba Inu’s dominance as the second biggest meme coin, though iGaming is yet to rally significantly in this cycle. In this sector, Rollblock is gaining significant traction, with its presale offering a rare early entry before wider adoption. Here’s the scoop on RBLK’s unwavering bullish potential. Discover Rollblock’s Unwavering Bullish Potential Rollblock is revolutionizing the iGaming industry with its cutting-edge play-to-earn ecosystem, blending traditional casino games with blockchain technology to create an immersive and rewarding experience for various demographics. Audited by SolidProof and licensed by Anjouan Gaming, Rollblock is building a foundation of trust and security as it positions itself for explosive growth. With gaming tokens likely to regain traction in the 2025 bull run, Rollblock is well-poised to capitalize on the renewed interest, mirroring the success of blockchain gaming in 2021. Boasting a vast selection of over 7,000 games, Rollblock caters to both casual and high-stakes players. From timeless classics like poker, blackjack, and roulette to blockchain-exclusive games, the platform offers unparalleled variety seldom seen elsewhere. The addition of sports betting has further enhanced its appeal, allowing users to wager on major sporting events such as the Premier League and the UFC, while leveraging RBLK tokens for rewards and bonuses. Beyond gaming and entertainment, Rollblock’s innovative revenue-sharing model reinforces long-term growth by ensuring consistent token demand and scarcity. The platform allocates 30% of its profits to RBLK buybacks, with 60% burned to reduce supply and 40% distributed as staking rewards, creating a sustainable ecosystem. With a rapidly expanding community now exceeding 50,000 members, Rollblock is poised to lead the next era of blockchain-powered iGaming. Short Term Turbulence For Pepe Fails To Reflect Long-Term Prospects Amid Increasing Competition Pepe has suffered significant losses over the past few months, crashing 60% from its December peak and currently trading at $0.00001043. Broader market trends have played a major role in Pepe’s downturn, as sentiment remains unstable following a shift in liquidity towards TRUMP, MELANIA, and even newer tokens like Fartcoin. Despite this volatility, meme coins such as Pepe will likely continue dominating speculative trading cycles in this cycle. With a potential resurgence brewing as Ethereum regains momentum and retailers buy back into the market after caving into FUD and being shaken out in typical fashion, Pepe may be one of the best buys in today’s turbulent market. Another major factor that could propel Pepe back into the spotlight is its robust exchange presence. Pepe’s listings on Coinbase and Robinhood, two of the most notable crypto exchanges in the USA, have significantly boosted Pepe’s accessibility, allowing both retail and institutional investors to trade Pepe tokens with ease. This strategic positioning gives Pepe an advantage over less widely available meme coins, increasing its potential for mainstream adoption and accumulation from “no-coiners” who will inevitably buy at the peak of market mania. If momentum returns to the meme sector, Pepe’s established liquidity and accessibility could make it one of the biggest beneficiaries of renewed momentum as a simple and iconic meme. With meme coin speculation likely to heat up as the year progresses, Pepe is emerging as a serious contender for the number two spot behind Dogecoin, competing directly with Shiba Inu, TRUMP, SPX6900, and Fartcoin. Recent surges in trading volume, which spiked 237% in just 24 hours, indicate growing investor interest, and if Pepe can break key resistance levels and capitalize on renewed hype, it has the potential to reclaim its position as a dominant force in the meme coin sector, with 10-25x returns a major possibility from the prices of today to the market’s peak. Secure A Position In RBLK Today! As the crypto market follows an unconventional path in 2025, a significant altcoin surge could be approaching as soon as the end of February.

If enthusiasm aligns with the usual 4-year cycle, Pepe could strongly compete with Shiba Inu for the title of the second-largest meme coin, despite iGaming not yet seeing a significant surge in this cycle. Within this sector, Rollblock is rapidly gaining momentum, offering a unique early entry opportunity through its presale before it reaches mainstream adoption. Here’s the lowdown on RBLK’s promising bullish potential.

Pepe's Short-Term Volatility Doesn't Diminish Its Long-Term Promise Amid Growing Competition Pepe has experienced significant setbacks in recent months, falling 60% from its December high and currently trading at $0.00001043. Broader market trends have significantly influenced Pepe's decline, as investor sentiment remains unstable with liquidity shifting toward TRUMP, MELANIA, and even newer tokens like Fartcoin. Despite this volatility, meme coins like Pepe are expected to continue dominating speculative trading cycles. With a potential revival on the horizon as Ethereum regains strength and retail investors return to the market after succumbing to FUD, Pepe could be a prime choice in today's challenging market. A major factor that could bring Pepe back into focus is its strong presence on major exchanges. With listings on Coinbase and Robinhood, two prominent crypto exchanges in the USA, Pepe's accessibility has been greatly enhanced, allowing both retail and institutional investors to trade the token with ease. This strategic positioning gives Pepe an edge over less accessible meme coins, increasing the likelihood of mainstream adoption and accumulation from ""no-coiners"" who often buy at market peaks. If momentum returns to the meme sector, Pepe's established liquidity and accessibility could make it a major beneficiary of renewed interest, as a straightforward and iconic meme. As meme coin speculation is expected to intensify throughout the year, Pepe is emerging as a strong contender for the second spot behind Dogecoin, directly competing with Shiba Inu, TRUMP, SPX6900, and Fartcoin. Recent trading volume spikes, which soared 237% within just 24 hours, reflect growing investor interest.

Dogecoin, OFFICIAL TRUMP, or dogwifhat?",https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/which-memecoins-should-you-trust-ahead-of-the-bull-run-dogecoin-official-trump-or-dogwifhat/,"The post Which Memecoins Should You Trust Ahead of the Bull Run? Dogecoin, OFFICIAL TRUMP, or dogwifhat? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The market dynamics for memecoins appear to have changed to a large extent as they are displaying a vibrant price action. While some manifested a monstrous rally like TRUMP, others like WIF maintain a calm upswing, and memecoins like Dogecoin are stuck within a range waiting for the right time to trigger a breakout. In the times when the Bitcoin price is stuck within a range, which memecoin will attract huge gains? OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) or Dogecoin (DOGE) or dogwifhat (WIF)? Let’s analyze all of them! Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin has survived multiple bullish and bearish markets; hence, it is the top memecoin but has been closely consolidating and failing to revive a strong upswing. Despite this, the market participants continue to remain bullish on DOGE as the price is holding within a bullish range. Therefore, the token is believed to trigger a breakout after a U-shaped recovery. The daily chart of DOGE appears to be extremely bullish, as the token has initiated a recovery from the local bottoms. The rally is accumulating strength every day and as a result, the price is maintaining a slow yet steady ascending trend. The DMI levels are heading towards a bullish crossover, hinting towards a change in the prevailing trend, while the CMF being in the positive range suggests the buyers becoming stronger than sellers. Hence, the Dogecoin price is expected to achieve 0.5 FIB at $0.2932 and enter the resistance zone between $.3 and $0.31. Therefore, the price is expected to breach above the zone to trigger a strong rise towards higer targets at $0.4, if it surpasses 0.618 FIB at $0.33. dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Since the beginning, dogwifhat price has displayed notable strength and sustained above the crucial support. Meanwhile, these levels were broken in the first few days of the month, which triggered more than a 45% downswing, forming lows below $0.6. The token has triggered a strong rebound, flipping lower highs & lows into higher highs & lows, hence suggesting a rise in the bullish strength. Hence, the WIF price is believed to maintain a consolidated ascending trend and reclaim the pivotal zone. The WIF price dropped below the neckline of the double-top pattern and after reaching the bottoms, it has rebounded finely. However, a rise above the bearish influence is yet to be validated, but the rise in the volume suggests a rise in the trading activity. Besides, the RSI has rebounded after entering the oversold zone for the first time, along with OBV, which flashes bullish signals for the crypto. Therefore, the WIF price is believed to maintain a consolidated ascending trend and enter the pivotal support-turned-resistance between $1.051 and $1.11. OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) Price Analysis After monstrous inception, the TRUMP price has failed to recover the incurred losses. The price is forming constant lower highs and lows regardless of volume remaining within an average range, which suggests the sellers were more active than buyers. Although the bulls tried to elevate the range above bearish captivity, they fell short of strength, resulting in a rejection from the monthly highs. As seen in the above chart, there are fewer chances of a bullish reversal as the resistance has been defended well. The bearish divergence in the OBV and a bearish continuation with the STOCHRSI hint towards the price continuing a bearish action. Therefore, the TRUMP price, which just faced a rejection from $20, is expected to test the lower support at $16.5 and remain consolidated within the range for more time than expected. Dogecoin is slowly consolidating but showing huge chances of a bullish breakout, while TRUMP has fewer chances of a rebound. Meanwhile, the dogwifhat price rally continues to remain uncertain, carrying both bullish and bearish possibilities.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|MARKET|WIF|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-15 13:20:40

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Nevada, Brent Kovar allegedly misled investors into believing his company, Profit Connect, was a legitimate AI-driven crypto mining operation. Kovar is accused of promising annual returns of 15% to 30% while assuring investors that their money was safe with a 100% money-back guarantee. Some victims were reportedly led to believe their investments were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), further adding credibility to the scheme. However, authorities claim that instead of generating profits through AI and crypto mining, Kovar used investor funds to finance his personal expenses, purchase real estate, and make payments to earlier investors under the guise of returns. FBI Crackdown on Crypto Fraud Intensifies Kovar faces 12 counts of wire fraud, three counts of mail fraud, and three counts of money laundering. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of 330 years in prison and fines of up to $4.5 million. His fraudulent operations reportedly ran from late 2017 until July 2021, during which he used a combination of websites, YouTube videos, and PowerPoint presentations to convince investors of Profit Connect’s legitimacy. Kovar’s case is just the latest in a string of high-profile crypto-related frauds that regulators are cracking down on. Earlier this year, Antonia Perez Hernandez, a promoter of the Ponzi scheme Forcount, was sentenced to more than two years in prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud conspiracy. Similarly, in October 2024, David Carmona, the founder of the fraudulent crypto scheme IcomTech , was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of operating a multimillion-dollar crypto Ponzi scheme. Operation Level Up Aims to Protect Crypto Investors The FBI has been stepping up its efforts to combat cryptocurrency fraud, particularly targeting Ponzi schemes and deceptive investment platforms . The agency’s “Operation Level Up” initiative has reportedly prevented around $285 million in potential crypto fraud losses between January 2024 and January 2025. With scams becoming more sophisticated and exploiting emerging technologies like AI, regulators continue to warn investors to remain cautious and conduct thorough due diligence before committing funds to crypto-related ventures.

However, according to the person, the endpoint of the whole discussion could see TSMC, one of the largest chipmakers in the world, using Intel’s semiconductor factories in the United States. The conversations are still private and will address Intel ‘s financial position, which has forced the company to cut some of its employees and cancel its global expansion plans. According to the source, the deal may see major chip designers in America take equity stakes, with the US government also providing support. This means that the company will not be fully under the control of TSMC, a foreign company. TSMC is quite popular in the semiconductor market, providing chips to companies like Apple, Nvidia, and others dealing with semiconductors that power AI algorithms. Despite the idea coming from a member of Trump’s team, the deal could still run into a political hurdle, the same one that has prevented Japanese company Nippon Steel Corp. from acquiring United States Steel Corp. According to an official in the White House, it is unlikely that President Donald Trump supports a foreign entity operating Intel’s factories. Intel’s performance and the potential of a partnership Intel posted losses on Friday after the Bloomberg report on the discussions. The stock closed at $23.60, dropping by 2.2% at the close of the market in New York, combining it with a previous drop of 5.3% in an earlier session. The company has dropped significantly over the last five years despite manufacturing the most used components in PCs and server industries. Intel, under its former CEO Pat Gelsinger, embarked on an ambitious move to restore its lead in the chipmaking sector, winning $7.9 billion in government funding to support several projects in four states. The company also secured a $3 billion deal to provide chips for the United States military, and it has already received $2 billion from the entire funds as of January. However, the effort has failed to translate into patronage outside America, especially at a new site in Ohio. The company’s products are also dropping in market shares, compounding its financial woes at a time when it needs to spend heavily. Gelsinger was forced to leave his role in December after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn things around. Although Intel has shown interest in investing in factories in the United States, contingency plans have been discussed by officials in Washington. According to a previous Bloomberg report, a possible plan under the Biden administration was a deal between GlobalFoundries and Intel. The deal could have seen the merger of both companies, but GlobalFoundries said it didn’t have the funds for an acquisition, with the company walking away from the conversation at the time. Another idea was for TSMC to license its manufacturing technology at Intel’s facilities. However, TSMC backed away from the discussion, as it felt it would lead to the benefit of a direct competitor in the industry. That exact conversation was doomed since Biden’s team was reluctant to be active in the conversation. Meanwhile, Trump will not be shy about making a deal, with TSMC looking to be in his good graces after having their meeting in the United States for the first time. While Trump has accused Taiwan of stealing US chips in the past, even threatening tariffs on semiconductors produced by foreign firms, he could have a change of heart.

Perhaps, other several factors are aligning in favor of a potential price surge, suggesting Bitcoin could soon reach a new all-time high (ATH). Dropping Oil Prices Tends To Raise BTC According to Matthew Dixon, a veteran financial trader, the recent decline in oil aligns perfectly with expectations and may serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s next big rally. Crude oil prices have been steadily descending, approaching key support levels. This drop comes at a crucial time when inflation has been a major concern for economies worldwide. #OIL price descending to the support below as expected. This is a +ve for #Inflation and risk assets #BTC etc and may be the fuel required to give the impetus to new ATHs All going according to plan! pic.twitter.com/KYXpVUYYtQ — Matthew Dixon – Veteran Financial Trader (@mdtrade) February 15, 2025 Dixon pointed out that the falling oil prices are a positive development for Bitcoin and other risk assets. Historically, when inflation fears ease, investors tend to take on more risk, increasing interest in digital assets and stocks. If inflation slows, investors might turn to Bitcoin as an alternative investment, potentially pushing its price to new highs. Retail Demand See Strong Comeback Apart from Bitcoin’s retail demand is showing a strong recovery after a short slowdown. Meanwhile, recent data reveals that retail activity dropped by just 2% in the last 30 days, a much better than the 20% decline seen in January. Market analysis also suggests that demand is holding up well. Even though Bitcoin is moving within a set price range, retail investors are still actively engaged. Bitcoin Price Analysis As per the Bitcoin technical analysis, the 1-hour chart signals a short-term bullish trend, with Bitcoin climbing to $98,784 after rebounding from $94,091. Bullish candlestick patterns indicate growing momentum, but the price remains close to key resistance. A breakout above $99,200 could open the door for a push toward the $100,000 mark. Additionally, strong support from multiple moving averages and sustained bullish momentum on shorter timeframes suggest that surpassing $100,000 could drive Bitcoin even higher, potentially reaching previous highs near $109,356. With Bitcoin eyeing new all-time highs, the current market setup might provide the necessary momentum to fuel further gains.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|COMMODITY|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-15 13:33:34

XRP Eyes New Highs Despite Strong Resistance XRP has been showing strong momentum with its price sitting between $1.86 and $2.86. This growth is evident with a weekly increase of over 16%. If it breaks through the $3.32 resistance, it could aim for the $4.32 level, representing significant potential gains. Its RSI is in the high 60s, indicating buying interest. The MACD remains positive, which suggests continued strength. The 6-month price jump of nearly 379% reflects strong upward momentum. However, the challenge remains to breach immediate resistance. If the price holds above the $2.69 ten-day moving average, it maintains a bullish outlook. Watch out for the support at $1.33 in case of a retracement. Mantle (MNT) Eyes Potential Breakout Mantle’s price dances between $0.77 and $1.31, holding steady despite recent dips. With a 6-month uptick of almost 71%, signs point to potential growth. A key resistance at $1.59 could spark a new rally if breached. However, its RSI of 47.38 and Stochastic of 46.07 suggest it’s neither overbought nor oversold, hinting at stability. Eyes are on whether MNT can regain momentum above $1.03, its 10-day and 100-day moving average level. If it pierces $1.59, it could aim further to the $2.12 mark, offering over a 50% increase from its upper current range. It’s a waiting game for bulls as the crypto market aligns for an altseason push. Sonic Set to Soar with Positive Momentum Sonic (S) is generating excitement with its current rally. Currently, Sonic (S) hovers around its upper price range and shows promise for the future. The nearest resistance level is within a reachable distance, suggesting bullish momentum. The coin’s recent price patterns, combined with rising market interest and favorable indicators, point towards potential growth. Its 10-day simple moving average is above the 100-day average, which could lead to more buying interest. The RSI, nearing an overbought zone, further indicates growing demand. If the momentum continues, Sonic (S) could see a rise of over 20% in the short term, breaking past its current resistance levels and further igniting the crypto market.

But while Ripple continues to pull back, a new player is also emerging: DTX Exchange (DTX) . This upcoming utility altcoin is already generating buzz, especially after raising almost $14 million during its presale. With the presale almost sold out, DTX has entered the bonus stage, which could offer the last opportunity to buy tokens at $0.18 before they hit major exchanges. As demand continues to rise, DTX is quickly becoming a hot topic for investors looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto world. Let’s find out more. XRP: A Roller Coaster Ride In The Crypto Market On 14th February 2025, the XRP price was approximately $2.7. Ripple has experienced a turbulent phase with its price facing fluctuations. Following regulatory challenges, especially with the SEC, XRP has experienced a comeback, gaining over 400% in value over the past year. Nevertheless, the XRP price is still very volatile, frequently fluctuating significantly because of overall market conditions and legal uncertainties. The future of the XRP price, especially the trajectory for March 2025, remains speculative. Some experts predict it could surge to $3.4, fueled by market optimism and Ripple’s strong partnerships. Yet, the XRP price could face volatility depending on new regulatory decisions or shifts in investor sentiment. RLUSD: Ripple’s Stablecoin and Its Speculative Potential Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. Dollar, has raised speculation about its potential. RLUSD promises to provide fast, low-cost transactions while bringing stability. This could make it a reliable choice over volatile crypto assets. However, the success of RLUSD is subject to its adoption and approval by regulators. With Ripple’s history of regulatory issues, doubts exist over the stability of RLUSD in a potentially harsh regulatory environment. Though some believe that RLUSD might encourage liquidity and increased institutional adoption of Ripple’s platform, its success in the long term will rely on its acceptance and the reaction of regulators. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is gaining traction due to its innovative features. DTX Exchange: A Promising DeFi Token for Early Investors DTX Exchange is quickly positioning itself as a game-changer. Having raised nearly $14 million during its presale, at a token value of $0.18, shows that DTX has massive demand. The platform plans to bring together the centralized and decentralized exchange features. It aims to offer users access to several assets, including cryptocurrencies, equities, ETFs, and commodities, that can potentially make investors diversify their portfolios. DTX Exchange will offer leverage options of up to 1000x, which may help traders multiply their profits. Although it is still in the presale phase, the hype about DTX is building up, and the possibility of its listing on prominent exchanges might lead to major price jumps. DTX Exchange: Entering the Listing Mania with Big Potential The platform is entering the “listing mania,” where new cryptocurrencies are being rapidly listed on top exchanges. If DTX successfully lists on these platforms, its value could potentially rise, offering huge returns for early investors. DTX Exchange runs on the VulcanX Blockchain, which promises rapid transaction processing. This is essential for users aiming to execute fast and effective trades without interruptions. The platform supports staking, which would allow users to earn passive rewards by holding their tokens. Cross-chain compatibility is another feature that will be a great advantage as it will support the transfer of assets across different blockchains, potentially reducing transaction delays and costs. Since it has already achieved presale success and immense interest in its token, DTX is set to make a huge mark in the cryptocurrency space. Conclusion The XRP price gradually builds momentum and sparks hope for March 2025, and DTX Exchange is entering its bonus stage. Both assets are attracting the attention of crypto investors. However, DTX Exchange aims to transform the exchange environment through its innovative features. For users eager to take advantage of these advancements, the present moment is ideal to focus on DTX, given its promising growth potential in the upcoming months.

TL; DR Breakdown Optimism (OP) records 13% gains over the past 7 days. Support holds at $1.02. OP resistance stands at $1.2. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP coin sees some gains The 1-day OP price analysis for February 15 shows mild recovery after an extended downward trend. The digital asset exhibits a series of red candlesticks, indicating strong selling pressure over the past few days, but now, buyers are beginning to pump in some cash. OP has recorded gains of about 13% over the past few days. Despite the resurfacing green candles, a stronger momentum is still needed to confirm the bullish reversal. OP coin sees some gains OP faces resistance at $1.199; a break above this level could open the way to $1.37. The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) and the MFI both indicate price recovery for the OP token, supporting the recent momentum. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP is consolidating The 4-hour chart of Optimism (OP) shows consolidation with the price holding between $1.08 and $1.21. OP is trading around $1.14, having experienced a slight pullback after testing higher price levels. OP is consolidating The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 57.41, indicating that OP is within the neutral region and could breakout in either direction. Meanwhile, the reddish MACD histogram bars are reappearing, and the MACD line has crossed below the signal line, indicating a weak bullish momentum. However, a sustained bullish move would require OP to break past and hold the $1.2 level. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 1.364 SELL SMA 5 $ 1.251 SELL SMA 10 $ 1.214 SELL SMA 21 $ 1.271 SELL SMA 50 $ 1.610 SELL SMA 100 $ 1.850 SELL SMA 200 $ 1.733 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 1.330 SELL EMA 5 $ 1.457 SELL EMA 10 $ 1.619 SELL EMA 21 $ 1.773 SELL EMA 50 $ 1.909 SELL EMA 100 $ 1.908 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.936 SELL What to expect from Optimism The Optimism (OP) price analysis shows signs of potential recovery. The price is consolidating between $1.08 and $1.2. However, for a sustained recovery, OP needs to break above the $1.2 resistance level; otherwise, a drop toward $1.08 and lower remains likely. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up on $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and would require an unprecedented level of growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook. Recent news/opinion on Optimism Optimism Superchain Support goes live!

Analysts suggest DOGE could see a 600% rally in 2025, potentially turning a $500 investment into $3,500. However, while Dogecoin remains a popular choice, a new contender is gaining traction with far greater upside potential. Lightchain AI, currently in its presale phase, has already raised $16.1 million, attracting investors looking for the next major breakout in the crypto market. Dogecoin’s Potential for a 600% Surge in 2025 Analyst Javon Marks predicts that Dogecoin (DOGE) could surge by 600%, potentially reaching $2.28, based on historical price patterns and Fibonacci extension analysis. This bullish forecast is further supported by a sharp rise in whale accumulation, with large holder inflows increasing by over 3,700% in the past 90 days, signaling strong investor interest. Market optimism has also been fueled by the recent filing of a Dogecoin ETF, which could improve accessibility for a wider range of investors. Currently, Dogecoin is trading at $0.281685, reflecting a modest 0.07256% increase from its previous closing value. These developments suggest that DOGE could be primed for significant growth, driven by both technical and market-driven factors. Why Lightchain AI Could Deliver a 13,400% ROI in the Future While Dogecoin could see a notable rally in 2025, emerging cryptocurrencies like Lightchain AI may offer even greater growth potential. Lightchain AI is a decentralized blockchain platform that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance performance and efficiency. Its parallelized architecture allows the simultaneous execution of multiple AI tasks, reducing latency and boosting throughput. The platform integrates off-chain systems such as IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave to securely store datasets and AI models, while the blockchain itself manages metadata, cryptographic proofs, and access controls to ensure traceability and data integrity. With its innovative approach to combining AI and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI positions itself as a promising contender in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Dogecoin vs. Lightchain AI in 2025 - Which One to Watch? While both Dogecoin and Lightchain AI have potential for significant growth in the coming years, it's important to note that investing in any cryptocurrency carries a level of risk. But Lightchain AI may offer a more diverse and innovative platform for investors looking beyond the hype of meme coins. As the crypto market continues to evolve, it's essential to stay informed and educated about emerging technologies like Lightchain AI that could potentially deliver significant returns in the future. Don't miss out on the potential gains of Lightchain AI - invest wisely and stay ahead of the curve in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency.

Polkadot’s ( DOT ) price action has seen it drop in crypto rankings, moving from a top ten coin in 2021 to the 22nd biggest one. It has been overtaken by newer cryptocurrencies like Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), Sui ( SUI ), and Toncoin ( TON ). Still, there are three key reasons why the DOT price may exit the three-year consolidation soon just like Ripple ( XRP ) did. Spot Polkadot ETF approval potential One potential reason why the Polkadot price may soon surge is that the Securities and Exchange Commission may soon approve a spot DOT ETF. 21Shares filed for that fund earlier this month The SEC has hinted that it will be a more friendly agency to the cryptocurrency industry under Donald Trump. One way it could demonstrate this is to allow spot ETFs faster, which will expose them to Wall Street investors. Most cryptocurrencies, like XRP and Litecoin, which have higher odds of ETF approval , have surged in the past few weeks. Polkadot could join the rally as it remains near its all-time low. Polkadot JAM upgrade The other reason why the Polkadot price could surge is the migration to the Joint-Accumulate Machine or JAM, which is part of the Polkadot 2.0. JAM hopes to combine the existing strengths of Polkadot and those of Ethereum, and then replace the Relay Chain in the future. You might also like: Polkadot launches JAM course to empower web3 developers JAM also hopes to solve the challenges that have affected Polkadot in the past. The notable ones are the high costs of making a parachain, the fact that these parachains are isolated and that joining parachain auctions is limited and expensive. Pokadot 2.0 will allow developers to build applications directly without going through the parachain process. These developers will also take advantage of the existing Polkadot features like high bandwidth, its resilience as measures by the Nakamoto coefficient, and its speed. Polkadot can handle over 140,000 transactions per second, much higher than Solana’s 3,000. somethin' to Yapp about ⤵️ https://t.co/xJolAIdWZD — Polkadot (@Polkadot) February 14, 2025 Polkadot price has strong technicals DOT price chart | Source: crypto.news Polkadot also has strong technicals that may push its price higher over time. The chart above shows that DOT has remained between the support at $3.85 and resistance at $11.71 in the last three years. It recently retested the lowest side of this channel. This consolidation mirrors what happened to XRP, a token that has surged lately. It is also a sign of accumulation, the initial stage of the Wyckoff Theory. Accumulation is usually followed by the markup phase, which is characterized by higher demand than supply. A strong breakout above the upper side of the channel will signal more gains ahead, with the initial target being at $23.5, the 38.2% retracement level that is about 365% above the current level.

40360981,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=697295,1739627636,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,4 Best Meme Coins Poised for Explosive Gains After Solana Bridges Reach Record $10.1B Volume,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/4-best-meme-coins-poised-for-explosive-gains-after-solana-bridges-reach-record-10-1b-volume/,"Solana’s bridges have recorded insane volumes ($10B+) since 2021, but their performance over the last 3-4 months has been particularly breathtaking. Although the total volume increased by a massive 114% in the last year (i.e., since February 2024, when it was just $4.7B), the months of November, December, and January recorded $6B in inbound volume just between them. The most bridged asset in the Solana ecosystem was $USDC, with an all-time inbound volume of $3.9B. It was followed by $ETH, which registered nearly $2B. It’s worth noting, however, that it’s not just the Solana ecosystem that’s screaming bullishness. The meme coin market overall, whether that’s political coins, pet coins (much thanks to CZ’s Broccoli uproar ), or Pump.fun, is looking really good. So, for those of you keen on getting behind the upcoming bull run, here are some of the best meme coins to include in your 2025 crypto portfolio. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Meme Coin to Follow Solana’s Growth Solaxy ($SOLX) is going to be the reason Solana continues its upward trajectory and reaches new highs. Ever since the successful launch of $TRUMP, $MELANIA, and Pump.fun, Solana has been dealing with network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability due to the massive influx of new traders in the network. To solve these problems, Solaxy has planned to build the first-ever Layer 2 solution for Solana. $SOLX , Solaxy’s native currency, will be a multi-chain token that will offer a brilliant combination of Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s efficiency. By executing a sizable portion of Solana’s transactions off-chain, it will reduce the load on the network and speed up transactions. Additionally, it will also lower the overall costs involved. Considering its unique mission to improve one of the best cryptocurrencies in the world, the $SOLX presale has been a massive success. It has raised over $21M so far, and each token is currently priced at $0.001636. Here’s how to buy $SOLX . 2. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) – Unique Meme Coin to Rally Behind Bitcoin’s Rally BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is unlike any other new meme coin on the market, seeing as it supports and celebrates $BTC’s journey by giving away free $BTC as rewards to token holders. All you need to do is buy and HODL $BTCBULL in Best Wallet , and you’ll automatically receive $BTC airdrops as and when the original crypto reaches $150K, $200K, and $250K. Additionally, the developers plan to follow a deflationary model in that they’ll burn a part of the total token supply when Bitcoin crosses $125K, $175K, and $225K. This will induce scarcity and therefore boost the token’s price. BTC Bull ’s fresh approach to meme coins has echoed with the masses right away, which is why its presale funding just a week into its launch sits at a whopping $1.6M. 1 $BTCBULL is currently priced at $0.002365, but hurry up because the price increases in the next 48 hours. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Self-Evolving AI Agent Offering Investment Advice With the next altcoin season right around the corner, you’d surely benefit from a project like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) that wants to bring every single token holder’s crypto portfolio in green. A self-evolving and autonomous AI agent coin , $MIND will interact with crypto influencers and communities on dApps and social media platforms like X, analyze everything that’s being said about crypto and all the coins therein, and finally filter out profitable trade ideas for its token holders. Simply put, $MIND is an AI-powered crypto investment buddy, which is why it doesn’t suffer from the same drawbacks as human advisors, namely lack of comprehensive research and delay in grasping market hype. MIND of Pepe is currently in presale, where it has already amassed over $6.2M. Poised for fabulous growth , it currently offers an entry into the project for just $0.003332 per token. Here’s how to buy it . 4. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Pro-crypto Trump to Take the Market to New Highs OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) is the official meme coin of the new (and by far the most pro-crypto) president of the United States, which makes it one of the best cryptos to watch for the next 4-5 years. After a mind-blowing debut in January when it surged over 12,000% in a single night, $TRUMP saw a steady and long-drawn decline. Well, good news for both Trump and crypto enthusiasts, as the token is back in the top gainers list. With a jump of over 16% in just the last 7 days , a fresh breakout is alive and kicking, offering ‘buy the dip’ investors the opportunity to potentially 100x their investment and become a crypto millionaire . Conclusion Having mentioned the very best meme coins to buy right now, we’d also like to point you towards the volatile nature of the crypto market overall. That’s why we recommend only investing an amount you’re comfortable losing. Also, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice, and we urge you to do your own research before investing your hard-earned money.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,SOL|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-15 13:53:56

A remarkable project in this field is Ozak AI, a decentralized AI-driven blockchain solution currently priced at just $0.003. Experts in the industry anticipate that early investors could potentially see returns of up to 2000% by 2025. Understanding Ozak AI Ozak AI is an innovative blockchain initiative that combines artificial intelligence with decentralized systems. Its main goal is to improve automation, security, and efficiency across various sectors such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.

Why Ozak AI Stands Out 1. AI-Enhanced Blockchain Innovation: Ozak AI harnesses the power of blockchain to develop tamper-resistant smart contracts capable of automating decision-making and data handling.

Vast Market Potential: The AI and blockchain sectors are witnessing extraordinary growth. With AI expected to become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030 and the global increase in blockchain adoption, Ozak AI is strategically positioned at the crossroads of these two pioneering fields. This gives it a notable advantage over conventional blockchain projects. 3. Affordable Entry, High Growth Potential: With the token priced at just $0.003 , Ozak AI offers investors a chance to enter the market with minimal cost while maximizing their potential gains. Analysts predict that as adoption and demand rise, the token's value could soar, reaching impressive levels by 2025. 4.

Ozak AI is supported by a team of seasoned blockchain developers, AI engineers, and industry experts focused on driving innovation. Additionally, collaborations with leading tech companies and industries further solidify its market credibility and growth potential. 5. Practical Applications: Unlike many speculative blockchain projects, Ozak AI is already showing real-world applications. Its AI-powered decentralized solutions are being tested in areas such as fraud detection, automated trading, medical diagnostics, and logistics optimization. These practical use cases increase the likelihood of widespread adoption, further driving up the token’s value. Investing in Ozak AI Investing in Ozak AI is straightforward. The token is accessible on major cryptocurrency exchanges, and investors can acquire it using popular digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins. Given the potential for significant returns, early adoption is crucial for maximizing profits before its value potentially skyrockets. Ozak AI offers a unique opportunity for investors looking to benefit from the convergence of AI and blockchain. With its current price at just $0.003 and the potential for 2000% returns by 2025, it stands out as one of the most promising investments in the crypto market. As the industry continues to grow, those who seize the opportunity early could see substantial gains in the coming years.

Namely, it can’t be done with top 10 cryptos like TRON (TRX). Even lower market cap options like Stellar (XLM) can’t help. However, there’s a new crypto trading platform that can! This new crypto trading platform is called FXGuys ($FXG) and is set to launch soon. Since it hasn’t even launched yet, it has what it takes to rise exponentially in token price. Also, FXGuys comes with a very beneficial utility for traders. So, this new crypto trading platform has both the room and potential to turn $100 into $10,000. Here’s more on these trending altcoins! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The TRX Price Finally Recovers as More USDT Gets Minted Things are finally starting to look up for TRX. The main reason behind this is the activity on the TRON network. Namely, USDT minting on TRON has increased recently, pushing total USDT supply to new heights. And this has affected the TRX price positively. More specifically, the TRX price increased by 7% over the past week. Even though it can’t compare with the activity on TRON, it’s still a good sign. Also, the TRX chart shows that a bullish pattern is forming, which can push its price even higher. With this in mind, experts expect the TRON price to rise by 40% soon. So, they see TRX as a solid investment option. However, TRX can’t possibly turn $100 into $10,000, not even if you hold for years. That’s because TRON’s market cap is too big to make such a move. If it did, it would have to surge to a market cap of $38.7 billion. It seems achievable, but experts don’t think it's possible. Instead, they see FXGuys as the only option to turn $100 into $10,000. This new cryptocurrency has a significantly smaller market cap than TRON, and it hasn’t even launched. The XLM Price Might Be in for a 35% Drop Based on Its Chart Stellar is not doing as well as TRON is. Namely, Stellar’s XLM is decreasing in value as we speak, coming closer to its previous low. One of the reasons behind XLM’s price dip is declining interest among investors. Namely, Stellar investors aren’t as fired up to invest as they were last year. And this can be traced back to Stellar’s lousy performance this year. During the recent market crash, Stellar didn’t hold up well at all. The XLM price went down to $0.27 but recovered a bit soon after. However, the XLM price didn’t hold up the recovery, and it started decreasing again. Now, the XLM price stands at $0.32 after plunging 21% over the past month. Also, the XLM chart shows a head and shoulders pattern. According to experts, this indicates that XLM’s price can fall toward $0.22 soon. So, with this in mind, they don’t see Stellar as a good investment option right now. It also stands to reason why XLM won’t help you turn $100 into $10,000, but FXGuys will. FXGuys: An Incredibly Promising New Crypto Trading Platform As it stands, FXGuys is the market’s most promising new crypto trading platform. The reason why FXGuys is so highly praised is that it offers very attractive benefits to traders. Also, it offers a great utility that will be useful in all market conditions. As such, experts see this new crypto trading platform as one of the best investments you can make right now. So, what will traders get out of FXGuys? First off, they’ll get peace of mind as FXGuys finally solves the payout delay issues traders have been facing for years. Namely, many traders have complained about their payouts being delayed or even nonexistent lately. However, FXGuys is here to fix all of that, and experts believe that this amazing offer will prompt traders to flock to this new crypto trading platform in droves. To solve all this, FXGuys offers same-day payouts. So, traders will get their money within 24 hours of their withdrawal. Speaking of withdrawals, FXGuys has no withdrawal limits, giving traders incredible flexibility. Furthermore, traders who lack funding will benefit greatly from FXGuys. This new crypto trading platform comes with an 80/20 profit split. It also provides access to up to $500,000 in funded accounts. This allows funded traders to make life-changing profits with just one FXGuys account. All FXGuys users will also get great rewards using the platform. Namely, they’ll be able to earn $FXG tokens via the FX Guys Trade2Earn program. All they need to do is make trades on this new crypto trading platform. Then, they can leverage the FXGuys staking rewards program for even more rewards. More specifically, they’ll receive a share of the FX Guys trading fees and volume in return for staking their $FXG tokens. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Turn $100 Into $10,000: Only With $FXG! When you take all the utility and perks FXGuys offers into consideration, it’s clear why experts believe it can help you turn $100 into $10,000 this year. So far, the FX Guys presale has raised over $4 million in its presale, thanks to its rising popularity and unmatched profit prospects. $FXG is currently available in Stage 3 of its public presale, giving you the chance to get in early and profit. At this stage, you can purchase your $FXG tokens at just $0.05 each and catch the whole 100x ride after the launch.

Specifically, it's not something you can accomplish with major cryptos like TRON (TRX). Even smaller market cap options such as Stellar (XLM) fall short. However, there is a new crypto trading platform that holds promise! This promising platform is FXGuys ($FXG), which is on the brink of launching. Since it hasn't been officially released yet, it holds potential for a significant increase in token value. Additionally, FXGuys offers a highly advantageous utility for traders. This combination of potential and utility makes it a contender for turning $100 into $10,000. Let's delve into these exciting altcoins! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE TRX's Price Bounces Back as USDT Production Increases TRX is finally seeing some positive movement. The primary driver is the uptick in activity on the TRON network, particularly with the increase in USDT minting, which has pushed the total supply of USDT to new levels, positively influencing TRX's price. In detail, the TRX price rose by 7% over the last week. While it doesn't match TRON's overall activities, it's a promising sign. Moreover, the TRX chart suggests a bullish trend is emerging, which could push its price even higher. Considering this, experts anticipate TRON's price could see a 40% increase soon, making TRX a viable investment. However, TRX is unlikely to transform $100 into $10,000, even over an extended period. This is because TRON's market cap is too large to facilitate such a dramatic rise. For it to happen, TRON would need to reach a market cap of $38.7 billion. Although it seems possible, experts remain skeptical. Instead, they suggest FXGuys as the best option for turning $100 into $10,000. This new cryptocurrency has a much smaller market cap than TRON and hasn't even launched yet. XLM's Price Could Plummet 35% According to Its Chart Stellar isn't faring as well as TRON. At present, Stellar's XLM is losing value, nearing its previous lows. One factor contributing to XLM's decline is waning investor interest. In particular, investors in Stellar are not as eager to inject funds as they were last year. This can be attributed to Stellar's poor performance throughout the year. During the last market downturn, Stellar struggled significantly. The XLM price dipped to $0.27 but managed a brief recovery shortly after. However, XLM's price couldn't sustain the rebound and is on the decline again. Currently, the XLM price is at $0.32 after tumbling 21% over the past month. Furthermore, the XLM chart reveals a head and shoulders pattern, which experts interpret as a signal that XLM's price may soon fall to $0.22. Given this outlook, experts do not consider Stellar a favorable investment at the moment. This also explains why XLM isn't expected to turn $100 into $10,000, whereas FXGuys is. FXGuys: A Promising New Crypto Trading Platform FXGuys stands out as the most promising new player in the world of crypto trading platforms. It receives high praise due to the impressive benefits it offers traders, along with a utility that proves useful in all market conditions. Experts regard this platform as one of the top investment opportunities currently available. So, what advantages does FXGuys offer traders? Firstly, it provides peace of mind by resolving the long-standing payout delay issues traders have faced. Many traders have complained about delayed or missing payouts recently. FXGuys aims to address these concerns, with experts believing this appealing offer will attract a large number of traders to this new platform. To resolve these issues, FXGuys guarantees same-day payouts, ensuring traders receive their funds within 24 hours of withdrawal. Furthermore, FXGuys imposes no withdrawal limits, granting traders remarkable flexibility. Additionally, FXGuys is highly beneficial for traders lacking capital.

Table of Contents XRP magnanimous jump vs. Bitcoin’s dominance The P2E revival: How YETIO is integrating meme mania with web3 gaming Best in class game development team Bitcoin, despite landing right among the stars, has bled excessively lately. It hasn’t been able to push above the $100k mark. While DeepSeek’s arrival had a setback for the crypto market in general, the overall sentiment remains optimistic. The biggest surprise came with XRP’s massive rally, which helped it reach $2.45 after years of slowdown. Amidst all the big talks and controversies, a few tokens are attempting a change. One of them is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a Play-to-Earn (P2E) meme utility token entering Stage 3 of its development after the weekend. The development team behind Yeti Ouro is currently offering a limited-time 25% bonus on all purchases as Stage 2 nears its final countdown. This exclusive offer runs until midnight on Sunday, giving investors a prime chance to maximize their returns before the next price increase. XRP magnanimous jump vs. Bitcoin’s dominance While Bitcoin is witnessing a slowdown, the other blue chip tokens are under pressure due to their matters, further delaying the altcoin season. Ethereum’s restructuring woes are never-ending. Though hopes are on the upcoming Pectra upgrade, Ethereum price has remained stagnant for a long time now. Another big contender, Ripple, saw its prices shoot up by over 300% in the past 3 months, leaving behind Bitcoin’s 41% gains. However, Ripple has had a setback after BetterMarkets, a non-profit organization, favored the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. The lawsuit, as we know, calls out XRP as an unregistered Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, discussed ongoing inflation, which has set the stage for interest rate cuts. The announcement has changed the sentiment from optimism to that of careful consideration of the current market conditions. Another worrying point is Bitcoin’s dominance. Despite the meltdown, Bitcoin’s dominance is at 60%. A mature market cannot rely on a single coin to move prices. There’s a need for stronger narratives and utility-driven tokens to overtake the BTC maximalist sentiments. In that way, tokens like Yeti Ouro play a major role. The P2E revival: How YETIO is integrating meme mania with web3 gaming Yeti Ouro is a meme coin planning to enter the Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming space with its high-octane game Yeti Go. Yeti Go is built on Unreal Engine 5. YETIO token will be a currency for entry fees and rewards within the game. Best in class game development team Yeti Ouro has strategically partnered with a distinguished game asset company renowned for its contributions to acclaimed titles such as Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space. This collaboration ensures that Yeti Go delivers top-tier visuals and professional game design, setting a new benchmark in the Play-to-Earn gaming sector. In addition to visual excellence, Yeti Ouro has enlisted Grammy-nominated audio professionals, known for their work with Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, to craft an immersive auditory experience for Yeti Go. This collaboration ensures that players enjoy a rich and engaging soundscape, enhancing the overall gaming experience. Talking of Yeti Ouro’s tokenomics as a project–it has a hard cap of 1 billion on its supply with a burn mechanism to keep the supply deflationary and the token valuable in the long run. The team has unveiled a 25% bonus offer until Sunday midnight for investors on all purchases before the presale goes into the next stage on Monday with a significant price increase. 1 YETIO is worth $0.017 today. This price only applies during the presale, which ends after the weekend. With over 177,000,000 tokens sold already, this indicates strong investor demand. It’s a now-or-never opportunity for investors who can claim a 25% bonus on all purchases. Yeti Go may become the defining moment of the crypto market struggling to find footing beyond the meme coin mania and launch a successful web3 game that truly delivers.

Despite a strong balance sheet, RIOT's reliance on dilution and speculative BTC holdings raises concerns about long-term shareholder value. I expect Q4 earnings to be lackluster due in part to minimal power credits and no realized revenue from BTC sales. However, BTC per share has increased year over year. Given the dilution concerns, RIOT shares are probably best used as a trading vehicle. But valuation multiples over BTC stack should guide entry and exit points. In late October, I reiterated a 'hold' call on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner Riot Platforms ( RIOT ). In the closing summary of that article, I left readers with the following: I'm struggling to see the bull case for RIOT relative to other opportunities. Perhaps the best thing RIOT has going for it is balance sheet strength with a large cash position and no debt. But the company now seems pot-committed to holding Bitfarms stock, which is eating up a considerable portion of Riot's capital. In the time since that note was published, RIOT has actually out-performed most mining stock peers: Data by YCharts Though it should be noted that this out-performance started in January rather than November, I still have to wear it here. RIOT has beat miners I myself am currently holding but has trailed spot ETFs so far this year. Following yet another serving of 'humble pie' from a market that occasionally makes my calls look bad, I am forced to reconcile how RIOT could be beating peers and only slightly losing against the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ) over the last three and a half months. I have three theories. In this upstate, we'll look at what, I think, might be driving RIOT's recent out-performance and preview what, I believe, will be a lackluster quarterly report for Q4 later this month. Why The Recent Out-performance? As I said above, I have three theories regarding RIOT's performance so far this year. Each of which could be contributing to RIOT beating peers to begin 2025. The first is fairly simple; tax loss harvesting is over. RIOT's share price fell by over 30% in 2024. 2025 brings a clean slate and a new wave of speculation. Second, Riot has joined the bandwagon in using convertibles to buy Bitcoin . Show me on the chart below where RIOT started buying BTC: Company Filings, Author's Chart December resulted in an enormous spike in BTC held on the balance sheet from 11,425 BTC up to 17,722 BTC in just one month. Stripping out the 516 BTC that Riot mined in the month, the remaining Bitcoin was purchased with $579.2 million in net proceeds from a senior convertible note offering in December. By my math, Riot paid around $100k per coin for a little over 5.7k BTC, which though currently underwater, is actually cheaper than Riot's true break-even cost which was approaching $130k in Q3 by CoinShares estimates: CoinShares Regardless, at the end of December RIOT was able to grow its BTC stack by 70% quarter over quarter, and it did so mainly from convertible note issuance rather than hitting the common stock ATM. The third theory is excitement about potential HPC developments. If we look at RIOT against Bitcoin mining peers over the last year, it's very clear to me what had been driving the out-performance, high performance computing commitments during the AI hype cycle: Data by YCharts The chart above shows three obvious standouts in 12 month mining returns; Core Scientific ( CORZ ), TeraWulf ( WULF ), and IREN Limited ( IREN ). These happen to also be the three public BTC miners that, I think, have leaned the hardest into AI/HPC revenue as secondary or tertiary revenue streams. Following an announcement in January that Riot Platforms would begin evaluating the potential for 600 MW of AI/HPC power at Corsicana, the company has essentially confirmed these efforts will move forward by bringing three new faces to the board of directors who have experience in AI/HPC conversion, data centers, and real estate. Specifically regarding BTC mining to AI/HPC infrastructure conversion, joining the board would be Jamie Leverton. If that name seems familiar, Leverton was formerly the CEO of Hut 8 ( HUT ) when the company purchased TeraGo in an effort to bring HPC revenue into Hut 8 well before it was fashionable in the mining space. Q4 Earnings Preview Company Filings, Author's Chart During the three months ended December, Riot Platforms mined 1,516 BTC and held all mined-BTC for the company's HODL. A segment that had been a significant driver of top line revenue during the summer of 2023 - power credits - has come nowhere close to achieving those mid-2023 highs: Company Filings, Author's Chart With just $3.5 million in combined power/DR credits, HPC still being in an exploratory phase, and revenue from selling BTC effectively being zero since February 2024, Riot is essentially a BTC HODL play with stock performance likely being reliant on two things; the price of BTC and how much BTC each RIOT share represents. In the company's December production update, Riot shared a BTC per 1 million fully diluted shares outstanding figure of 44.3. I find this metric to be quite helpful. That said, it was not included in the January update and as far as I can tell it hasn't been featured before the December production release. Still, it allows us to assess RIOT's dilution expectations for the Q4 report: BTC Holdings BTC per 1 million FD Shares FD Shares (millions) Closing Share Price Closing BTC Price December 2023 7,362 31.8 231.5 $15.47 $42,241 November 2024 11,425 31.6 361.6 $12.65 $96,456 December 2024 17,722 44.3 400.0 $10.21 $93,371 QoQ 55.1% 40.2% 10.6% -19.3% -3.2% YoY 140.7% 39.3% 72.8% -34.0% 121.0% Source: Riot Platforms, TrendSpider, Author's Calculations At 17,722 BTC held on the balance sheet and 44.3 BTC per every million fully diluted shares outstanding, we get 400 million shares outstanding at the end of December. In my view, this number is probably more important than something like revenue or even net income because it's quite clear that Riot is funding operations through dilution rather than sales. The question is whether or not this will ultimately be beneficial to common stock shareholders over time and I think the verdict is still unclear on that. Take for instance the 140.7% year-over-year growth in BTC holdings against just 72.8% growth in fully diluted shares. Considering BTC has more than doubled in price over that same time frame, one would expect the price of RIOT to have increased year over year but it actually fell by 34%. Why? Multiples are important. Even if one takes the view that RIOT is a great asset, investors should still aim to buy great assets at decent prices. Data by YCharts While RIOT is far from the worst multiple expansion offender in the Bitcoin mining stocks, the 2.5 price to book ratio at the end of 2023 was elevated compared to how the market was willing to value RIOT shares over the last year. Furthermore, the current 1.5 price to book reading is indeed far from the infotech sector median. But RIOT is not a cheap stock based on earnings and sales multiples: Seeking Alpha We can reasonably deduce that this overvaluation picture won't change as a result of earnings later this month because we know the company didn't sell Bitcoin, didn't produce meaningful power credits, and is pre-revenue in an AI/HPC segment that may already be an uphill climb if DeepSeek has indeed changed the capex needs for AI and LLM training. Riot Platforms And remember, Riot Platforms is planning for expansion to 46.3 EH/s by the end of this year and 65 EH/s next year despite open market purchases seemingly being the more economical way for the company to acquire BTC given historical COGS and opex. At 18,221 BTC at the end of January and a $98k BTC price, Riot's Bitcoin is worth approximately $1.7 billion effectively backing a $4 billion market capitalization. Closing Summary Data by YCharts I'll reiterate something that I've said about Bitcoin mining stocks for quite a while; my view is that these are probably not great long-term investments and I think the long-term performance against Bitcoin shows that simple and clear. Since Riot first entered the cryptocurrency business back in September 2017, the stock has benefited from large booms and busts in line with Bitcoin's price gains. That is no longer the case if this halving cycle is an indication and I suspect ETFs are a big catalyst here. That said, RIOT shares can still be used as a trading vehicle. It is up to each individual trader or speculator to assess why they'd entertain a position in the stock should they choose to do so. For me, the only real fundamental reason to go long RIOT is because the company has a large stack of Bitcoin. Thus, if you're considering the trade, I'd be mindful of valuation multiples over that stack and time entries and exits based on those trends.",BTC-USD|RIOT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MINING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-15 14:00:00

This phase of indecision has divided market sentiment, with many leaning toward a bullish trend that could result in an aggressive move in the coming days. While uncertainty lingers, analysts are optimistic that Bitcoin is preparing for its next significant price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On The Weekly Chart – Potential For A Rebound? Renowned analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Bitcoin is still building a 4-hour rounding bottom, a bullish pattern that often precedes a breakout. Jelle highlighted that a new higher high was set on Friday, signaling potential momentum in favor of the bulls. This formation suggests that Bitcoin could be gearing up for a move toward reclaiming key levels, including the much-anticipated $100K mark. Despite the recent sideways price action, Bitcoin’s resilience above crucial demand zones reflects underlying strength. Many traders and investors are keeping a close watch, as this consolidation could soon come to an end. Whether BTC breaks above its supply zone or retraces to retest lower levels, the next move is expected to set the tone for short-term market direction. All eyes remain on Bitcoin as the market awaits confirmation. Bitcoin Prepares For A Massive Move Bitcoin’s price remains driven by speculation and uncertainty as short-term price action continues to be unpredictable. The price has struggled to reclaim the $100K mark, leaving analysts divided over its next move. Some are calling for a cycle top at $109K, while others believe that Bitcoin is setting the stage for a massive rally once it consolidates and establishes strong demand at current levels. Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that Bitcoin is still forming a rounding bottom pattern above the $94K level—a bullish structure that signals accumulation and potential upward momentum. He pointed out that a new higher high was set on Friday, strengthening the case for a possible breakout. According to Jelle, if Bitcoin can hold for another higher low over the weekend, bulls could push the price toward the critical $100K mark next week. Despite the ongoing uncertainty, the rounding bottom pattern offers a glimmer of optimism for the market. Bitcoin’s ability to stay above the $94K level reflects its resilience, even amid volatility. Traders and investors are closely monitoring this consolidation phase, as it could determine the next significant trend for BTC.

If the price successfully reclaims the $100K mark, a rally toward the $109K cycle top becomes increasingly likely. Conversely, failing to hold current levels could lead to a deeper correction. The coming days will be crucial for Bitcoin’s short-term direction, with both bulls and bears battling for control. BTC Price Struggles With Short-Term Direction Bitcoin is trading at $97,700 after briefly tagging the 4-hour 200 EMA near $98,800, sitting less than 3% below the crucial $100K level. Bulls are striving to reclaim the $98K level and push the price above the psychological $100K mark, a critical resistance zone that has kept BTC in a consolidation phase. Breaking above $100K would signal renewed momentum and could set the stage for a strong uptrend. The $98K and $100K levels are key short-term hurdles for bulls, as reclaiming these zones would restore confidence and likely attract more buyers. A successful breakout above the $100K mark could ignite a rally, taking Bitcoin into higher territory and possibly testing all-time highs.

Losing the $94K support level could trigger a correction into lower demand zones around $89K, where buyers might step in to prevent further declines. Such a move would signal continued market indecision and could lead to extended consolidation or even bearish pressure.

Following a sell-off and subsequent recovery, Ethereum is trading sideways, trading below key resistance levels. Recent analysis from MakroVision reveals several critical factors that could determine Ethereum’s next move: The slight downward movement over the last 10 days appears to be corrective rather than impulsive, which could be a bullish indicator. Ethereum price held the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $2,520, indicating short-term stabilization. $2,850: A key resistance level with significant liquidity. A break here could signal the first bullish move. $3,273: Critical breakout level. A move above it could send Ethereum back into a medium-term uptrend. $2,520 (0.5 Fibonacci retracement): It remains a key short-term support. $2,360 – $2,410: A strong support zone and Golden Pocket area with high liquidity. This level should be held to prevent further declines. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,710. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Founder Charles Hoskinson Makes Big Bullish Statements and Bitcoin Price Prediction According to the analyst firm, Ethereum is showing signs of stabilization, but a break above $2,850 is necessary to unlock further upside potential.

The cryptocurrency recently rebounded from the $190 support level, hinting at potential recovery. However, market sentiment remains uncertain as SOL records losses on weekly charts. Analysts anticipate a rebound toward $300. Investors are closely watching for signals of a trend reversal in the coming days. Analyst Eyes Solana Price Break Out: $300 Next? Crypto analyst has identified a key technical breakout in the Solana price movement. The Layer 1 crypto has surged past a descending trendline, a significant resistance that previously suppressed its price. This breakout hints at a possible bullish reversal, raising speculation about a potential rally. Technical indicators suggest the Solana breakout could pave the way for a strong upward move. If momentum continues, analysts believe the price could eye $300 as the next major target. Solana Price Analysis As of Saturday, the SOL price hovers at $195 with slight surge of 0.8%, showing resilience amid market fluctuations. The top altcoin trades between the $190 support and $200 resistance level, maintaining a tight range over the past few sessions. During the weekend the crypto market holds steady while principal assets face difficulty in building any sign of upward movement. Bitcoin maintains its transaction value at approximately $97,000 without signs of increasing or decreasing. Ethereum, Solana (SOL), and XRP also follow a similar pattern, lacking any significant price surges. Despite brief upticks, their overall trend remains sideways, reflecting broader market uncertainty. Key Levels To Watch Technical indicators suggest a potential breakout. If SOL surpasses the $200 resistance, it could target the next key level at $220. A move beyond this point may pave the way for a rally toward $250. The ultimate bullish scenario would see SOL reaching $300, marking a significant 54% gain from current levels. The price support at $190 plays a vital role as a bearish indicator for Solana. If support at $190 fails, Solana price forecast could start an upward decline toward its next support level found at $180. If the Price of Solana drops further it will reach the $160 level which would signal heavy selling activity. The current momentum stays neutral as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) maintains a value of 46. Solana price chart A bullish breakout may occur when Solana surpasses its crucial resistance levels according to its current price movement. The price has potential to move toward $300 but any failure to sustain current levels might result in negative market reactions.

One technical expert predicts that the Bitcoin price will soon reach $180K, propelling RCO Finance (RCOF) to new heights. RCO Finance has become a darling of growth-driven investors due to its AI features and unlimited upside potential. The strong demand for the altcoin is echoed in over $12 million in funding raised during the ongoing presale. Will the Bitcoin Price Reach $180K in Q1? An analyst has suggested that the Bitcoin price will reach $180,000 by March 2025, driven by the completion of sub-wave 4 in the Elliott Wave structure. At $96,988, the Bitcoin price has failed to hold the $100K level but has turned $90,000 into support. Per the analyst, the Bitcoin price could surge by over 80% to hit its new target. The analyst further predicted that the Bitcoin price would skyrocket to $307K by October 2025, marking a historical high for the leading blockchain asset. Experts say BTC still has room for growth as market sentiment improves. RCO Finance to Exceed Expectations, Skyrocket in Q2 RCO Finance is set to skyrocket by 33,000% in Q2 and exceed the expectations of analysts and early investors. The AI altcoin is regarded as undervalued at only $0.1, with investors scooping the RCOF token before its public launch on the open markets. It has raised over $12 million due to its innovative features, starting with the Robo Advisor. The Robo Advisor offers AI-powered personalized investments and trading recommendations that consistently outperform the market. It uses machine learning to adjust its recommendations in asset allocation and portfolio management based on real time financial updates from reputable sources such as Bloomberg. With its fast execution engine, the Robo Advisor can quickly enter or exit positions, reducing risk and maximizing profits for users. By using the Robo Advisor tool, investors would have been recommended the Bee (BEE) meme coin before it rose 1,045% in a week. With this potential to help users conquer the markets and become financially independent, RCO Finance launched its beta platform for public testing. The platform’s development team is already adding new features and tools on the beta platform and the Robo Advisor before the official rollout of the alpha version. Additionally, RCO Finance supports tokenization, allowing users to buy real-world assets such as real estate with crypto. The platform also gives users access to over 120,000 assets. RCO Finance’s 10,000 users have been impressed by the lack of KYC requirements. Experts have also lauded the DeFi platform for maintaining user privacy and anonymity while serving the underserved. RCO Finance Takes Security Seriously RCO Finance has shown its commitment to military-grade security that protects user assets through a thorough smart contract audit with SolidProof, a leading security auditing firm in the crypto industry. The third-party audit ensures that the platform’s code is free from vulnerabilities that pose data and financial risks. This commitment to security cements RCO Finance’s reputation as a trustworthy, reliable, and secure DeFi trading platform for investors. RCOF is an Altcoin Gem Attracting Savvy Crypto Investors RCO Finance is predicted to surge 33,000% by Q2, with many investors flocking to its for gains. The DeFi trading platform is set to grow the portfolios of users with its high leverage of up to 1,000X. The altcoin has released its beta platform, which alongside the Robo Advisor tool, is getting major upgrades under the hood. The platform’s over 10,000 users have also been impressed by its potential to earn them consistent gains in 2025 through its Robo Advisor.

But what if you could lock in a presale price that practically hands you the dip on a silver platter? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin (BTFD) is offering right now, and smart investors are rushing in to claim the 100% bonus using the code LAUNCH100. With over 69 billion BTFD tokens already sold and $6.07 million raised, this presale is rapidly gaining momentum among the best coin presales to buy in 2025. While established meme coins like Bonk (BONK) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) continue to dominate the space, BTFD Coin is breaking new ground with massive staking rewards, an active Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and a limited-time presale deal that doubles your tokens. Let’s break it down and see why this could be the next 550% ROI moonshot for those who act fast to grab this best coin presale right now. BTFD Coin: The Next-Gen Meme Coin Powerhouse with a 100% Bonus for Early Investors Meme coins have always thrived on community engagement, viral trends, and FOMO-driven rallies—but BTFD Coin is taking it to another level. The project isn’t just about capitalizing on the “ Buy The Dip ” movement; it’s backing up the hype with real utility and a presale structure designed to reward early adopters handsomely. The 14th stage of the BTFD presale is currently live, with tokens priced at just $0.00016. But here’s the kicker—every purchase made using the code LAUNCH100 gets a 100% bonus, doubling your holdings instantly. The next price hike is around the corner, so investors who lock in now stand to gain a 550% ROI when the presale ends at $0.0006 per token. To put that into perspective, a $2,500 investment today would fetch you 15.6 million BTFD tokens. Apply the LAUNCH100 code, and you’ll get an additional 15.6 million BTFD for free—a total of 31.2 million tokens. At the presale’s final price of $0.0006, that stack would be worth $18,720, marking a 7.5x increase in value. Major Announcement: Stage 13 Tokens Burned! The team has just burned all unsold tokens from Stage 13, reducing the circulating supply and tightening market demand. This means every remaining presale token is now even more valuable—and the clock is ticking before the next stage price increase. Staking Rewards: Passive Income at 90% APY While most meme coins are all hype, BTFD backs it up with solid incentives. Early adopters can stake their tokens and earn a staggering 90% APY .

With an active community, strong developer backing, and deep integration into Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, BONK has carved out a strong position in the market. While BTFD Coin is in early-stage presale mode with huge upside potential, Bonk remains a go-to option for traders looking for volatility and liquidity on Solana. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The OG Meme Coin Inspired by Internet Culture Pepe Coin (PEPE) took the meme coin craze to a new level with its nostalgic branding and explosive market performance. Known for its legendary pump in early trading days, PEPE continues to be a top choice for those who enjoy meme-driven momentum.

40364763,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675385,1739632584,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40364763.jpeg,Anthropic warns Google search proposal will harm US AI investment,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/anthropic-google-proposal-will-harm-us-ai/,"Anthropic, the AI company that has received $3 billion from Google, filed a legal challenge against a US government proposal for a rule that would ban Google from investing in AI startups on Friday, arguing that it would disrupt competition and cripple AI innovation in the country. The proposal is part of the Justice Department’s antitrust case against Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., which a federal judge found guilty of illegally monopolizing online search and digital advertising markets. Regulators now want to force Google to sell its Chrome web browser and prohibit it from funding or partnering with companies that manage search data, including AI companies like Anthropic. Anthropic says Google ban will benefit its biggest rivals In the court filing, Anthropic argued that cutting Google out of AI investments would create an “unjustified windfall” for larger competitors like OpenAI and Meta, the two most powerful players in artificial intelligence. “A remedy that requires Google to terminate its relationship with Anthropic would harm both Anthropic and competition more generally,” Anthropic said in its filing. It pointed out a glaring contradiction in the proposal: Google’s own AI division, DeepMind, would remain untouched. While regulators want to curb Google’s power, the rule doesn’t stop DeepMind from continuing to develop its own AI models, like Gemini, effectively leaving Google’s AI footprint intact while severing its financial ties to outside startups. Anthropic is one of the few companies directly competing against OpenAI , which dominates the industry with ChatGPT. Anthropic’s own model, Claude, has been gaining traction, but training large-scale AI systems requires billions in funding. The company has been aggressively raising capital to stay in the race, securing investments from Amazon alongside Google. But if Google is forced to pull out, Anthropic warned it could lose critical funding needed to expand computing power, train better models, and remain competitive. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has already expressed concerns over the power that Big Tech companies have in AI. In a January report, the agency said that companies like Microsoft and Google often tie their AI investments to the use of their own cloud services and hardware, creating a closed-loop ecosystem that makes it even harder for smaller AI companies to compete. Google executives address DeepSeek challenge and AI policy changes While Google battles in court, its executives are also dealing with the new challenges from China’s AI industry. During an all-hands meeting in Paris on Wednesday, Google ’s chief AI scientist, Demis Hassabis, told employees he was not concerned about the rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that recently overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT on Apple’s App Store rankings. Hassabis dismissed claims that DeepSeek had trained its AI at a fraction of the cost of leading Western models, calling the numbers “exaggerated.” He added that the company had likely spent far more on hardware than it disclosed and relied on Western AI models to develop its own systems. “We actually have more efficient, more performant models than DeepSeek,” Hassabis told employees. “So we’re very calm and confident in our strategy.” But Hassabis did acknowledge DeepSeek’s potential, calling it “the best team I’ve seen come out of China.” He also flagged security and geopolitical risks, noting that several US agencies have already banned employees from using DeepSeek’s technology due to national security concerns. Meanwhile, Google is also facing backlash over its decision to quietly change its AI policy. Employees grilled CEO Sundar Pichai on why the company removed a key section of its AI Principles, which previously banned the use of AI for weapons and surveillance. Pichai passed the question to Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs, who revealed that Google executives had worked together to revise the rules in early 2024. “Some of the strict prohibitions that were in v1 of the AI principles don’t jibe well with the more nuanced conversations we’re having now,” Walker explained, referring to the original 2018 guidelines that were implemented after public outrage over Google’s involvement in Project Maven, a controversial military AI project. Walker defended the decision, telling the crowd in Paris that: “An awful lot has changed in those seven years.” He argued that as AI technology changes and grows, it is now being deployed in “far more nuanced scenarios” that don’t fit the original restrictions.

The crypto market is buzzing with activity as Grayscale, a major player in the digital asset management space, has made significant movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). In a jaw-dropping series of transactions, over $126 million worth of crypto assets were shifted from wallets associated with Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts. Let’s dive into the details of these intriguing transactions and explore what they might signify for the market. Unpacking the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Transfer Around 11 hours ago, eagle-eyed blockchain observers at Arkham Intelligence spotted some substantial activity linked to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). Data reveals that two addresses associated with GBTC transferred a whopping 1,250 BTC. At current prices, this equates to approximately $123 million! These Bitcoins were moved to two separate, unknown wallets. Here’s a quick breakdown of the Bitcoin ETF transfer: Origin: Addresses linked to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF Amount: 1,250 BTC Value: Approximately $123 million Destination: Two unknown wallets Source: Data from Arkham Intelligence Why are these crypto whale movements important? Transfers of this magnitude by institutional players like Grayscale often catch the attention of the market. They can indicate portfolio rebalancing, shifts in investment strategy, or even responses to market volatility. Understanding these on-chain signals can provide valuable insights into the broader crypto landscape. Analyzing the Grayscale Ethereum Trust Transactions Simultaneously, while the Bitcoin transfers were unfolding, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) also saw notable activity. An address linked to ETHE sent 1177.8 ETH to a Coinbase Prime custody address. Coinbase Prime is a popular institutional platform for crypto custody and trading, suggesting a move towards institutional-grade storage or potential trading activities. This ETH transfer is valued at around $3.28 million. Adding to the Ethereum movements, another address associated with the Ethereum ETF sent 179.1 ETH to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. This transaction is worth approximately $498,920. Both Ethereum transactions to Coinbase Prime indicate a similar pattern – movement towards a known institutional platform. Let’s summarize the Ethereum ETF transactions in a table for clarity: Transaction Type Amount (ETH) Approximate Value Destination Transfer 1 1177.8 ETH $3.28 million Coinbase Prime custody address Transfer 2 179.1 ETH $498,920 Coinbase Prime deposit address Decoding the Crypto Whale Moves: What Could Be Happening? So, what can we infer from these substantial crypto shifts by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ? Here are a few potential interpretations: Portfolio Rebalancing: Grayscale might be rebalancing its portfolios. This could involve adjusting holdings of BTC and ETH based on market conditions or investor demand. Custody Adjustments: Moving assets to Coinbase Prime could be related to custody adjustments. Institutions often use specialized custody solutions for enhanced security and compliance. OTC Trading Preparation: Coinbase Prime is also used for over-the-counter (OTC) trading. These transfers might be preparation for large OTC trades, either buying or selling. ETF Dynamics: With the evolving landscape of crypto ETFs, these movements could be linked to internal ETF operational needs or adjustments in response to market flows. It’s important to note that without official confirmation from Grayscale, these interpretations are speculative. However, analyzing on-chain data like this provides valuable clues into the activities of major crypto players and potential market trends. The fact that both Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF associated wallets are moving assets simultaneously suggests a coordinated strategy rather than isolated incidents. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Grayscale’s Moves? Grayscale is a behemoth in the crypto investment world. Its Bitcoin Trust, in particular, holds a significant amount of BTC. Movements of this scale can potentially impact market sentiment and even price action, although the immediate market reaction to these specific transfers appears to be muted so far. However, monitoring these crypto whale activities is crucial for several reasons: Market Indicator: Large institutional transfers can serve as indicators of broader market trends and institutional sentiment. Volatility Signal: Significant movements might precede periods of increased market volatility, although this is not always the case. Transparency: On-chain data provides a level of transparency into institutional crypto holdings and activities, which is valuable for market participants. Investment Strategy Insights: Observing patterns in institutional movements can offer insights into how sophisticated investors are managing their crypto portfolios. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts While these Grayscale transfers might seem like just on-chain noise to some, they offer valuable learning opportunities and actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data and news sources like Arkham Intelligence to track large crypto movements. Diversify Information Sources: Don’t rely solely on price charts. On-chain analytics provide a different perspective on market dynamics. Understand Institutional Activity: Pay attention to what institutional players like Grayscale are doing, as their actions can have market-wide implications. Manage Risk: Be prepared for potential market volatility that can sometimes follow significant crypto transfers, although direct causality is not guaranteed. Conclusion: Grayscale’s Crypto Shuffle – A Sign of Things to Come? The recent $126 million crypto shuffle by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust is undoubtedly a noteworthy event. Whether it’s routine portfolio rebalancing, strategic custody adjustments, or preparation for larger market moves, these transactions underscore the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the significant role institutional players like Grayscale play. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, keeping a close watch on these on-chain signals will be crucial for navigating the exciting, and sometimes shocking , world of digital assets.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have bounced back, recording a significant $70.6 million in net inflows on February 14th. This injection of capital marks a reversal from four consecutive days of net outflows, injecting a dose of optimism into the market. Let’s dive into the details of this encouraging development and what it might mean for the future of Bitcoin and crypto investments. What Sparked the Bitcoin ETF Inflow Recovery? The recent rebound in Bitcoin ETF inflows is a welcome change for investors who have been closely watching market movements. After a period of net outflows, which can sometimes indicate investor hesitancy or profit-taking, the tide has turned. On Valentine’s Day, while many were focused on matters of the heart, crypto markets saw a different kind of love – a renewed interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. This inflow suggests a potential resurgence of confidence in Bitcoin and its associated investment vehicles. Several factors could be contributing to this positive shift: Market Sentiment Shift: Overall market sentiment in the crypto space can be volatile. A shift towards a more bullish outlook, possibly influenced by broader economic indicators or positive news, could encourage investors to re-enter the market. Attractive Entry Points: Periods of outflow can sometimes create attractive entry points for investors who believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. A dip in price or a perceived correction might be seen as an opportunity to buy. Institutional Accumulation: Institutional investment plays a crucial role in the ETF market. These inflows could indicate renewed accumulation from institutional players, signaling their continued belief in Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Key Players Driving the Bitcoin ETF Inflows Let’s break down which ETFs are leading this inflow surge. Data from Farside Investors provides a clear picture of individual ETF performance on February 14th: ETF Provider ETF Ticker Net Inflow (USD Millions) Fidelity FBTC $94.0 BlackRock IBIT $22.3 Bitwise BITB $8.0 Grayscale (Spot) BTC $6.5 Grayscale (GBTC) GBTC -$47.0 ARK Invest ARKB -$13.2 VanEck HODL Data N/A As the table illustrates, Fidelity’s FBTC ETF is leading the charge with a robust $94 million inflow. BlackRock’s IBIT and Bitwise’s BITB also saw significant positive inflows, contributing to the overall positive net figure. Notably, even Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF (BTC) experienced a net inflow, albeit smaller. However, it’s important to acknowledge the continued outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB, indicating a mixed picture within the ETF landscape. Understanding the Benefits of Spot Bitcoin ETFs for Crypto Investment Spot Bitcoin ETFs have revolutionized the way investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin. Here are some key benefits that make them an attractive option for both seasoned and new crypto investors: Accessibility: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making crypto investment accessible to a broader range of investors, including those who may be hesitant to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a layer of security and compliance that traditional crypto exchanges may not always provide. This can be particularly appealing to institutional investors and those concerned about security risks in the crypto space. Diversification: Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to diversify their portfolios with exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This can be a strategic advantage for portfolio management and risk mitigation. Liquidity: ETFs are highly liquid assets, meaning they can be easily bought and sold on exchanges. This liquidity is beneficial for investors who need to quickly adjust their positions based on market conditions. Navigating Challenges and Outflows in Bitcoin ETFs While the recent inflows are encouraging, it’s crucial to remember that the spot Bitcoin ETF market is still relatively new and subject to volatility. The outflows experienced in the days leading up to February 14th highlight some of the challenges and factors that can influence ETF performance: Market Volatility: Bitcoin itself is known for its price volatility. This inherent volatility can directly impact the performance of Bitcoin ETFs, leading to potential outflows during periods of market downturn or uncertainty. Fee Structures: Different ETFs have varying fee structures, which can impact investor returns over time. Investors need to carefully consider these fees when choosing a Bitcoin ETF. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and crypto ETFs is still evolving. Changes in regulations can create uncertainty and potentially impact investor sentiment and fund flows. Competition and ETF Differentiation: With multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs now available, competition is increasing. The ability of each ETF to attract and retain assets will depend on factors like brand reputation, marketing efforts, and perceived value proposition. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors The latest data on Bitcoin ETF inflows offers several actionable insights for crypto investors: Monitor ETF Flows: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF flow data as an indicator of market sentiment and institutional interest in Bitcoin. Significant inflows can suggest growing confidence, while sustained outflows may signal caution. Diversify ETF Holdings: Consider diversifying your ETF holdings across different providers to mitigate risk and potentially benefit from the strengths of various ETF offerings. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that crypto investment , including Bitcoin ETFs, is often best approached with a long-term perspective. Short-term market fluctuations are common, and focusing on the long-term potential of Bitcoin can help navigate volatility. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, market news, and ETF-specific information to make informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Bitcoin ETFs? The $70.6 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on February 14th is undoubtedly a positive development. It suggests a potential shift in market sentiment and a renewed appetite for Bitcoin exposure through these investment vehicles. While challenges and volatility remain inherent in the crypto market, this inflow provides a glimmer of hope and could signal the beginning of a more sustained period of growth for Bitcoin ETFs and the broader crypto space. Investors should continue to monitor market trends and ETF performance to navigate this exciting and evolving asset class effectively.

AI Predicts the Best Altcoin Pick Now",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/1000-in-xrp-or-chow-ai-predicts-the-best-altcoin-pick-now/,"The post $1,000 in XRP or CHOW? AI Predicts the Best Altcoin Pick Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ask almost any crypto veteran what they think of the current bull run, and most will tell you this one is different from the previous ones. Thousands of new altcoins launch every day and it’s hard for traders to pick the best crypto to buy now. This is why most investors are now divided between investing in established high-cap altcoins such as XRP or new cryptos. One of those new ones is ChowWow , a new meme coin on Solana that just launched its highly-anticipated presale. We decided to ask GPT whether it’s smarter to invest $1,000 in XRP or CHOW and, of course, get price predictions for both coins. XRP Price Prediction The XRP price has been hovering around $2.50 recently. The coin went on a run last year, jumping from $0.50 to $3.30 in just November and December. There’s a lot of buzz around XRP lately – word is the SEC might back off under the new leadership. This could pave the way for regulatory clarity and possibly lead to the approval of XRP-spot ETFs. Although the current market has been sluggish, many analysts believe the bull run will continue. Source: ChatGPT Price-wise, XRP could take several paths. A conservative estimate puts XRP trading between $2.00 and $2.50, accounting for potential market corrections. A more balanced outlook suggests the token could reach between $5.00 and $7.00 by mid-2025, especially if regulatory clarity improves. The most optimistic predictions see XRP potentially reaching $10 or higher, particularly if it achieves widespread adoption and favorable regulatory treatment. ChowWow: The New Solana Altcoin Sensation ChowWow is Solana’s newest meme coin. It’s in presale now at $0.008, and they’re planning to launch at $0.0288 – that’s a 260% jump right out of the gate if all goes to plan. This isn’t just another dog coin. ChowWow’s got a whole play-to-earn game where you can raise virtual pets in some kind of digital kingdom. Plus, you can stake your CHOW tokens for monthly rewards, and they’re doing regular token burns to keep the supply in check. Source: ChatGPT What about the price? Post-launch, price predictions for CHOW vary based on different market scenarios. A conservative estimate suggests the token might reach $0.03 to $0.05 post-launch before finding its stability. More balanced projections indicate an 8-10x increase could be possible, potentially pushing the price to $0.064-$0.08. The most optimistic outlooks suggest a 50-100x surge, which would place CHOW between $0.4 and $0.8. Is ChowWow the Best Altcoin to Buy Now? ChowWow’s presale is live at $0.008, with plans to launch at $0.0288. They’ve built it on Solana, taking inspiration from those fluffy Chow Chow dogs – you know, the ones that look like tiny lions. The team picked an interesting mascot too – in Chinese culture, Chow Chow dogs are seen as symbols of guardianship, prosperity, and good fortune. That’s probably not going to affect the price, but it adds a nice touch to the whole project story. The team’s gone all-in on making this more than just another meme coin. As mentioned, there’s this whole game system where you can earn while playing with virtual pets, plus staking for those who prefer to HODL. The community stuff is pretty cool too – they’re running meme contests with $1,000 prizes each season. With all these Solana meme coins pumping lately, CHOW might be next in line for a decent run. What’s the Smarter $1,000 Play? If you’re looking at where to put that $1,000, here’s what it comes down to: XRP is your established player – it’s been around the block and has proven it can deliver. You’re looking at steady gains, nothing crazy, but probably safer than most crypto bets out there. CHOW is the new kid on the block. It’s riskier for sure, but it’s got that potential for much bigger returns that gets traders excited. The game features and strong community they’re building could help pump the price, and we’ve seen how fast these new meme coins can take off. Bottom line? If you’re after those massive gains and can handle the risk, CHOW might be your best altcoin play right now.

A New Crypto Coin Sparks Investor Excitement Thanks to AI Market Ties,https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-ada-and-shiba-inu-shib-fading-a-new-crypto-coin-sparks-investor-excitement-thanks-to-ai-market-ties/,"While Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) strive to make a comeback, a new cryptocurrency seems to have caught the eye of investors— IntelMarkets (INTL) . This crypto coin is making headlines as its presale has rewarded early buyers with an 811% return. It will also be tied to the AI market, projected to be worth $826B by 2030, as per Statista. Thus, traders rush to stock up on this crypto coin before a potential price pump comes. Meanwhile, the ADA price on the monthly chart has fallen by double digits. Likewise, the SHIB price has also faced some challenges. However, market analysts like Ali and Shib Spain have made bullish price predictions for these top crypto coins. Nevertheless, many investors are turning to INTL instead as it could have higher upside potential. IntelMarkets (INTL) Skyrockets 811% in Ongoing Presale While Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are showing red price charts, IntelMarkets (INTL) is making waves in the crypto space. IntelMarkets is set to initiate the introduction of crypto trading powered by AI technology. It is currently developing an AI-powered smart trading platform unlike any other on the market. IntelMarkets is different from other platforms in that it will provide users with self-improving trading robots. AI-powered trade signals will also allow users to trade on multiple markets simultaneously, enabling them to take advantage of profitable trading opportunities instantly. With anticipation of the platform’s launch, traders are feeling FOMO in record numbers. The platform’s native token, INTL, may surge in value with the launch and investors are scooping them up as fast as possible. Holding INTL during its current presale phase nine makes the most sense, with the price sitting at just $0.082, an 811% increase from its initial price of $0.009. As phase ten begins, the price will rise to $0.091. A Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.11 – a 34% growth. Ali: The Price of Cardano (ADA) May Hit $15 Soon Cardano (ADA) is one of the top 10 altcoins, but it has seen some volatility recently. CoinMarketCap data shows that the ADA price fell from around $1 to below $0.80 in the past 30 days—nearly a 20% drop in just a few short weeks for Cardano. Noting the decline, Cardano (ADA) supporters are still hopeful due to the positive predictions made by analysts like Ali. He recently posted on X that the ADA price seems to behave similarly to how it did in 2020-2021 but slower. This could mean a massive price surge soon. Ali pointed to the $15 level as a Cardano price prediction. However, it is worth noting that the ADA price has already skyrocketed nearly 50% on the YTD chart. This could mean its highest upswings have passed. Because of this, many traders are looking at INTL instead. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price May Bounce Hard, Expert Predicts Like the ADA price, Shiba Inu (SHIB) also sees red price charts. On the one-month chart, its value has fallen nearly 25%, as per CoinMarketCap. During that time, the SHIB price fluctuated between $0.000021 and almost $0.000016. But, experts like Shib Spain remain optimistic about Shiba Inu (SHIB). In a recent X post, Shib Spain said that this meme coin is about to bounce hard. He foresaw the SHIB price soaring to $0.000036 soon. This Shiba Inu price prediction has turned some heads, but many investors are choosing INTL instead. The SHIB price may have difficulty rising as its market cap now sits at around $10B. In other words, it will need much new money to pump its price. What Gives IntelMarkets (INTL) the Upper Hand Over Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)? While Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggle to regain their momentum, IntelMarkets (INTL) looks poised to grow. This project will change crypto trading forever with its innovative use of AI technology. This connection may improve its long-term growth potential and stability compared to ADA and SHIB. In addition, INTL’s low market cap means faster price growth than that of the ADA and SHIB prices. Because of this, experts forecast INTL to possibly become the next 5x crypto coin in 2025.

Currently, the Ethereum token is approaching the $3K test and analysts believe a successful breakout could push the altcoin to new highs. Also, Ripple is about to surpass the $3 resistance. But the most promising cryptocurrency in the market is IntelMarkets (INTL) . Its AI trading bots have attracted a lot of interest, pushing its value by 810%. Its price could skyrocket to $1 soon if the uptrend continues. Analyst Cites Bullish Indicator On Ethereum (ETH) Price Chart According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Ethereum price has been trading sideways in the past few days. The Ethereum price has been consolidating between $2,561 and $2,779, making it one of the poorest-performing altcoins. Ali Martinez has sighted a bullish indicator on the Ethereum price chart. According to him, the TD Sequential flashes a buy signal which could mean the Ethereum price might break out of its sideways movement soon. CryptoFaibik told his followers to accumulate the coin now that the Ethereum price is low. The analyst forecasts the Ethereum price could skyrocket in the coming weeks if it crosses past the resistance around the $3k level. Surpassing this resistance could push the Ethereum price to a new all-time high of $5k. Another analyst called Saitama says the Ethereum price might surge to $15k in the coming months. In other news, whales have been accumulating large numbers of ETH tokens in the past few days. Trump bought 5 million ETH recently. Ripple (XRP) Could Rally To $3 On One Condition Ali Martinez, an on-chain analyst, the Ripple coin has been trading in an ascending channel in the past few months. Ali believes the XRP price is about to hit the $3k mark. However, he notes the XRP price must remain above the $2.30 mark. In a follow-up tweet, Ali stated the XRP price is rebounding from the lower part of the channel. If the uptrend lingers, the XRP price might surpass the middle part of the channel which is at $3. Another analyst called MikybullCrypto posted a similar prediction. He says the XRP price could rally to $4 soon after a recent rebound. At the moment, the XRP price is up 16.0% on the weekly timeframe. The altcoin price has been consolidating between $2.6 and $2.7. Meanwhile, technical analysis shows the sentiment surrounding the Ripple crypto is bullish. The Average Directional Index (14) and Hull Moving Average (9) indicators flash buy signs which point to an XRP price surge.

U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a delightful surge of positive sentiment, recording a total net inflow of $11.7 million on February 14. This injection of capital signals growing investor interest in Ethereum ETF products and the broader crypto market. But what does this inflow really mean, and why is it noteworthy? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. What’s Behind the Buzz Around Spot Ethereum ETFs? Before we get into the specifics of the recent inflow, let’s quickly recap what Spot Ethereum ETFs are and why they are generating so much buzz. A Spot Ethereum ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is an investment vehicle that allows investors to gain exposure to the price of Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Think of it like investing in gold through a gold ETF instead of buying physical gold bars. Benefits of Spot Ethereum ETFs: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible to a wide range of investors through traditional brokerage accounts. This simplifies the process of investing in Ethereum, eliminating the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Regulation and Security: Being regulated financial products, ETFs offer a level of security and investor protection that is often lacking in the direct crypto market. This regulated environment can attract institutional investors and those wary of the unregulated nature of crypto exchanges. Diversification: ETFs can be used to diversify investment portfolios, allowing investors to add crypto exposure without significant direct risk management of digital assets. Tax Advantages (potentially): Depending on the jurisdiction and individual circumstances, ETFs might offer certain tax advantages compared to direct crypto ownership. Challenges and Considerations: Management Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can eat into returns over time. Investors need to consider these fees when evaluating the overall profitability. Tracking Error: While designed to track the price of Ethereum, ETFs may not perfectly mirror its performance due to factors like fund management and market fluctuations. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact these investment products. The recent approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market was a monumental event, paving the way for greater institutional and retail participation in the Ethereum ecosystem. This inflow data is among the first real-world indicators of investor appetite for these new financial products. Decoding the $11.7M ETF Inflow: Fidelity Leads the Charge Now, let’s break down the numbers. According to data from Farside Investors, the total net inflow into U.S. Crypto ETF products focused on Ethereum reached $11.7 million on February 14. Interestingly, this entire amount was attributed solely to Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF , known as FETH. This means that while FETH saw a positive inflow, all other listed Investment funds in the same category reported no change in their holdings. Key Takeaways from the Inflow Data: Fidelity’s FETH is a Strong Performer: The data clearly indicates that Fidelity’s FETH is attracting significant investor interest right out of the gate. This could be due to Fidelity’s established reputation in the financial world, its marketing efforts, or the specific structure and features of the FETH ETF. Cautious Optimism in the Market: While a net inflow is undoubtedly positive, the fact that only one ETF saw inflows and others remained flat suggests a degree of cautious optimism rather than a full-blown rush into Ethereum ETF investments. Investors may be taking a wait-and-see approach, observing the performance of these ETFs before committing larger sums. Early Days for Spot Ethereum ETFs: It’s crucial to remember that Spot Ethereum ETFs are still in their early stages. Market adoption and understanding of these products will take time. This initial inflow, even if concentrated in one fund, is a promising sign for future growth. Source: Farside Investors Note: This table is for illustrative purposes and may not reflect real-time data. Always refer to official sources for the most up-to-date information. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum and Crypto Investments? The $11.7 million ETF inflow , spearheaded by Fidelity, is more than just a number; it’s a potential indicator of things to come. It suggests that: Institutional Adoption is Gaining Momentum: Inflows into ETFs, particularly those from a major player like Fidelity, often signal institutional interest. Institutions are increasingly looking for regulated and accessible ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, and Spot Ethereum ETFs fit the bill perfectly. Positive Sentiment Towards Ethereum: The inflow reflects a positive market sentiment towards Ethereum itself. Investors are showing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and its role in the evolving crypto landscape. Broader Market Impact: The success of Spot Ethereum ETFs can have a ripple effect across the entire crypto market. Increased institutional and retail participation can lead to greater liquidity, price stability, and overall market maturity. Actionable Insights for Investors So, what can investors take away from this news? Monitor ETF Performance: Keep an eye on the performance of Spot Ethereum ETFs , particularly FETH and others as they gain traction. Track their inflows, trading volumes, and how well they track the price of Ethereum. Consider Diversification: If you are interested in crypto exposure, consider whether Ethereum ETF products align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. They can be a valuable tool for diversification. Stay Informed: The crypto and ETF markets are dynamic. Stay updated on regulatory developments, market trends, and news related to Crypto ETF products to make informed investment decisions. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing in any financial product, especially in the crypto space, conduct thorough research. Understand the risks and potential rewards associated with Investment funds like Spot Ethereum ETFs. A Promising Start for Ethereum ETFs The $11.7 million net inflow into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs on February 14, driven entirely by Fidelity’s FETH, marks a significant and positive development. While it’s still early days, this inflow suggests a growing appetite for these investment vehicles and a promising future for Ethereum in the mainstream financial world. As the market matures and more investors become familiar with Ethereum ETF products, we can expect to see further developments and potentially larger inflows, solidifying Ethereum’s position in the investment landscape.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin moved between $95,000 – $98,000, forming a strong consolidation zone. However, popular crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci states the critical levels for the premier cryptocurrency lie outside this price range. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk? Analyst Says Breaking This Price Level Could Spark Significant Volatility Bitcoin Key Levels To Watch – $94,000 Support Vs. $117,000 Resistance In an X post on February 14, Burak Kesmeci shared an interesting technical analysis on the BTC market highlighting two key zones that could decide the short-term price direction. One of these critical zones is the 1.6 Gold Ratio Multiplier which currently stands at $117,000. The 1.6 Golden Ratio Multiplier is a valuation tool used to identify vital resistance zones in a bull market. Therefore, Kesmeci postulates that if the Bitcoin Futures market closes above $117,000, spot traders can anticipate the bull rally to rediscover its form leading to an immediate uptrend. The second important price zone identified by Burak Kesmeci is the 111-day Moving Average (111DMA) which is presently at $94,000. The 111DMA is a commonly used moving price average indicator that often acts as a key dynamic support level during the bull run. Consequently, a weekly or daily price close below $94,000 in the Futures market will invite a strong bearish pressure on Bitcoin translating into an immediate price dip. Based on Kesmeci’s postulation, Bitcoin will likely soon break out of its current consolidation zone to register any significant price movement. Bullish factors that may support a price breakout include an increase in ETF inflows and corporate crypto interest, as well as substantial progress in the US’s new pro-crypto agenda. On the other hand, investors should fear variables such as negative macroeconomic developments e.g. a hike in Fed interest rate especially considering the recent rise in US inflation.

In other news, analytics site IntoTheBlock reports the Bitcoin market recorded an inflow of over $1.3 billion resulting in a net inflow of $1.04 billion. Generally, massive exchange inflows are interpreted as a bearish signal as investors are likely moving their assets in preparation to sell on the exchange. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency continues to trade at $97,653 reflecting a 0.50% gain in the past 24 hours. However, its daily trading volume crashed by 12.80% and is presently valued at $32.29 billion. With a market cap of $1.93 trillion, BTC continues to rank as the largest digital asset.

Over the last few months, the crypto industry has been celebrating an evident pro-crypto shift in the US regulatory space. The optimism is well founded—the US president has his own memecoin , the SEC has already vowed to lower crypto enforcements, and earlier last month, the White House released its crypto executive order to establish regulatory clarity. You might also like: The focus is on strengthening US leadership in crypto tech | Opinion Under Trump’s term, the Securities Exchange Commission has also implemented SAB 122 —which is said to pave the way for crypto adoption . There’s also a strong push towards a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve—not just in the US but globally. Despite this optimism, the past week has made it abundantly clear that crypto is now more vulnerable to macroeconomic factors than ever before. On the day that President Trump announced tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, the crypto market lost $2 billion, according to Coinglass data . Some experts indicate that original liquidations exceeded $10 billion—far worse than the liquidations during the FTX fallout. Factors including “buy the rumor, sell the news” might have been at play for the crypto market, according to the Nansen report . At the moment, there is a brief pause on the tariff implementation, as Trump has agreed to postpone Canada and Mexico tariffs by a month. If implemented, these tariffs may heighten the risk of a recession by constricting consumer spending and increasing economic uncertainty. Tariffs as a catalyst for economic contraction Tariffs function as a tax on imported goods. Their intended purpose is to protect domestic industries by making foreign products relatively more expensive. However, this protectionism comes at a cost. When tariffs drive up the prices of goods, consumers tend to reduce their spending. Consumer spending drives approximately 68% of the US GDP, so any sustained reduction in consumption can push overall economic activity below the threshold necessary to avoid a recession. Also, employment on all sides would take a big hit. The 25% tariffs discussed could result in a 0.25% job loss in the US. The impact would be much bigger for the other sides, with both Canada and Mexico projected to see up to 3% job losses. The imposition of these tariffs could have severe spillover effects. Deutsche Bank analysts have also argued that sustained tariffs against Canada and Mexico—two of the United States’ largest trading partners—will be “far larger in economic magnitude” than the repercussions of Brexit on the United Kingdom. Given the weight of consumer spending in the US and the sensitivity of these neighboring economies to shifts in trade volumes, it is not an overstatement to predict that Canada and Mexico could tip into recession in the coming months if the 25% tariffs are implemented. The trade war escalation and its broader impact Many stakeholders anticipated that these moves would hurt international trade flows, increase production costs, and drive up prices across the board. As domestic and international companies scramble to adjust supply chains, the uncertainty that accompanies such policy shifts can further depress economic activity. Last week, crypto markets witnessed the volatility induced by these policies. When Trump agreed to postpone Canada and Mexico tariffs by a month. Bitcoin’s price recovered from $92,000 to over $100,000. However, the relief was short-lived when China retaliated with its own set of tariffs, and the cryptocurrency’s price retracted to around $96,000 within hours. This rapid on-off dynamic highlights how sensitive markets have become to tariff-related news. Inflation risks and Federal Reserve dilemma Federal Reserve officials have also voiced concerns about the inflationary potential of large-scale tariffs. While they have stopped short of explicitly linking these policies to their forthcoming monetary policy decisions, the warnings are significant. Earlier, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee voiced a number of supply chain threats regarding the implementation of tariffs. Tariffs raise import costs, and as these costs are passed on to consumers, inflation then accelerates. This scenario is worrisome, given that inflation erodes real incomes and can exacerbate recessionary pressures by reducing overall consumer spending. The Fed’s dilemma is acute. On one hand, the central bank seeks to control inflation by tightening monetary policy. However, an overly aggressive stance on interest rates could compound the negative effects of tariff-induced economic slowdowns. Gold remains the primary safe-haven asset While digital assets like Bitcoin have struggled to maintain stability amid rising trade tensions, traditional safe-haven assets have experienced a renewed surge in demand. According to data from The Kobeissi Letter, gold reached an all-time high on February 3. The rally in gold prices reflects investors’ instinct to seek refuge amid heightened market volatility and inflationary pressures. The dynamics behind this shift are rather simple. As tariffs push up consumer prices and undermine global trade, investors have become wary of the long-term economic outlook. With the risk of recession and the possibility of further monetary tightening, gold’s relative stability makes it an attractive asset. Conclusion The coming weeks will prove decisive. If the US continues down this path of aggressive tariff imposition without achieving meaningful trade concessions, we may very well see heightened inflation and sustained market volatility. At the same time, we could anticipate the onset of recession in key partner economies. Policymakers—and investors alike—must recognize that the costs of trade protectionism extend far beyond the immediate sphere of international commerce. Ultimately, while some may argue that these tariffs could eventually force a renegotiation of trade terms, the evidence suggests that the risk of recession—and the attendant damage to consumer confidence and global liquidity—is too great to ignore.

Get ready, because recent signals from Washington suggest some significant developments are brewing in the realm of digital assets. If you’ve been closely following the regulatory landscape, you know it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. But hold tight, because it sounds like we’re gearing up for some clarity, and maybe even some positive shifts, thanks to the efforts within the U.S. government. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what these hints might mean for the future of crypto. What’s the Buzz About Crypto Czar and Digital Assets? The spotlight is currently on David Sacks, often referred to as the White House AI and Crypto Czar . In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Sacks indicated that the inter-agency working group focused on digital assets is working diligently to push forward President Trump’s agenda. The key takeaway? We should expect some “important announcements” in the near future. This is exciting news for anyone invested in or following the crypto space, as it suggests a proactive approach from the administration regarding crypto policy and regulation. This buzz started after a post from Eleanor Terrett, a journalist from Fox Business. She raised a valid point about potential “overcrowding” in crypto policy development, suggesting that multiple agencies might be working on similar issues, potentially leading to confusion or conflicting approaches. It’s a legitimate concern – too many cooks in the kitchen, as they say. However, Terrett’s subsequent reporting paints a more optimistic picture. According to her conversations with sources, there seems to be a strong level of coordination among these various groups. Instead of chaos, it appears there’s active communication and cooperation. While there are indeed many players involved, the current sentiment is that their collaboration is, for now, contributing to progress rather than hindering it. This is crucial because a unified and coordinated approach is essential for effective and sensible crypto policy . Decoding the Signals: What Could These Announcements Mean? So, what kind of “important announcements” are we potentially looking at? While Sacks’s statement is deliberately vague, we can speculate based on the current context and President Trump’s known stance on digital assets . Here are a few possibilities: Regulatory Clarity: One of the biggest hurdles for the crypto industry has been the lack of clear regulatory guidelines. Announcements could provide more defined rules around cryptocurrency operations, taxation, and compliance. This clarity would be a huge win, fostering innovation and attracting more institutional investment. Policy Framework for Innovation: The announcements might outline a broader policy framework designed to encourage innovation in the blockchain and crypto space within the U.S. This could include initiatives to support crypto businesses, attract talent, and position the U.S. as a leader in the digital economy. Updates on Inter-Agency Collaboration: Perhaps the announcements will detail how different government agencies are working together on crypto-related matters. This could provide transparency and reassure the industry that there’s a cohesive strategy in place. Potential Legislative Push: While less likely to be an “announcement,” these signals could be a precursor to legislative efforts aimed at establishing a more comprehensive legal framework for digital assets . Trump’s Agenda and Crypto: A Closer Look Understanding these potential announcements requires considering President Trump’s agenda concerning technology and finance. While his previous administration’s stance on crypto was somewhat mixed, recent rhetoric suggests a potentially more favorable approach. Here’s what we know and can infer: Pro-Business Stance: President Trump’s general economic philosophy is often characterized as pro-business and focused on deregulation. This could translate to a desire to create a more business-friendly environment for the crypto industry, reducing regulatory burdens and fostering growth. Economic Competitiveness: There’s growing recognition that the U.S. needs to remain competitive in the global digital economy. A supportive stance on digital assets and blockchain technology could be seen as crucial for maintaining this competitiveness, especially as other countries are actively developing their own crypto strategies. Decentralization and Financial Innovation: The underlying principles of decentralization and financial innovation, which are core to the crypto ethos, might resonate with certain aspects of a conservative or libertarian leaning political philosophy. This could create common ground and support for certain crypto-friendly policies within the Trump agenda . Benefits of Clear Crypto Policy Why are these potential announcements and a clearer crypto policy so important? The benefits are far-reaching and can positively impact various sectors: Market Stability and Growth: Regulatory clarity can reduce uncertainty in the crypto market, leading to greater stability and attracting more significant investment. This can fuel growth and innovation within the industry. Investor Protection: Well-defined regulations can also enhance investor protection, reducing the risks associated with scams and fraudulent activities in the crypto space. Innovation and Job Creation: A supportive regulatory environment can encourage innovation, leading to the development of new crypto-based products and services, and creating new jobs in the technology and finance sectors. Global Competitiveness: A clear and progressive crypto policy can position the U.S. as a leader in the digital economy, attracting crypto businesses and talent from around the world. Mainstream Adoption: Clear rules and regulations can foster trust and confidence in cryptocurrencies, paving the way for wider mainstream adoption by individuals and institutions. Challenges and Considerations While the signals are encouraging, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and complexities involved in formulating effective crypto policy : Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The key challenge is to create regulations that provide necessary oversight and protection without stifling innovation and hindering the growth of the crypto industry. Finding this balance is crucial. Inter-Agency Coordination: Even with reported collaboration, coordinating multiple government agencies with potentially different priorities can be complex. Ensuring effective communication and alignment is essential. Evolving Technology: The crypto space is rapidly evolving, and regulations need to be adaptable and forward-looking to remain relevant and effective as technology advances. Global Landscape: Crypto is a global phenomenon, and U.S. policy needs to consider the international regulatory landscape to ensure consistency and avoid creating barriers to cross-border crypto activities. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For So, what should you be paying attention to in the coming days and weeks? Official Announcements: Keep a close eye on official channels from the White House, relevant government agencies, and figures like David Sacks for any formal announcements regarding digital assets policy. Media Coverage: Follow reputable financial news outlets and crypto-specific media for in-depth analysis and reporting on these developments. Journalists like Eleanor Terrett are key sources of information. Market Reactions: Monitor how the crypto market reacts to any news or signals related to U.S. regulatory developments. Market movements can often provide insights into investor sentiment and expectations. Community Discussions: Engage in discussions within the crypto community on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram to gauge the broader sentiment and understand different perspectives on these potential announcements. Conclusion: A Hopeful Glimpse into Crypto’s Future? The recent signals from the U.S. Crypto Czar and reports of inter-agency collaboration offer a potentially urgent and important glimpse into the future of crypto policy in the United States. While details remain scarce, the indication of forthcoming announcements is a positive sign. For an industry often navigating murky regulatory waters, the prospect of clearer guidelines and a more supportive policy framework is undoubtedly welcome. Whether these announcements will fully meet the industry’s needs and expectations remains to be seen, but the direction seems to be leaning towards a more defined and potentially more favorable environment for digital assets . Keep your eyes peeled – the crypto landscape in the U.S. could be on the verge of significant shifts.

40364280,https://coingape.com/?p=239197,1739633576,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Analyst Predicts Cardano Price To Hit $20, Here’s Why",https://coingape.com/analyst-predicts-cardano-price-to-hit-20-heres-why/,"Following a severe market crash, the crypto space is now ascending to new heights, reaching $3.25 trillion, up 0.89%. Despite a marginal daily decline, the Cardano price is reclaiming lost ground amid expectations of ADA ETF approval and Microsoft partnership. Cardano Price Targets $20: What’s Behind the Bullish Prediction? While the Cardano price is hovering below the significant $1 level, analysts and traders remain optimistic that the token could retest its previous all-time high of $3. Many believe that a breakout above $1 could push ADA to new highs, hitting $3 and beyond. However, analyst Sssebi has made an even more ambitious forecast, predicting a staggering 2,757% surge that would catapult Cardano to unprecedented levels. In a recent X post , an ADA enthusiast known as Sssebi, shared their bullish prediction of Cardano hitting $20, citing four compelling reasons. One of the prominent factors pinpointed by Sssebi was the potential interaction between Cardano and Bitcoin. In a groundbreaking revelation at the October 2024 Cardano Summit in Dubai, Cardano was unveiled as Bitcoin’s upcoming DeFi layer, sending shockwaves to the Cardano community. Sssebi believes that the development could significantly impact ADA, pushing its price to $20. Cardano ETF Speculations Spark ADA Rally Another important reason highlighted by Sssebi was the potential approval of Grayscale’s Cardano ETF. In a recent development, Grayscale Investments filed for a Cardano ETF with the NYSE. As this filing came amid the increasing demand for Cardano, investors expect an ADA rally following the ETF approval. While asset managers compete to launch altcoin ETFs tracking assets like XRP, ADA, LTC, and SOL, Grayscale’s initiative may inspire others to follow. If Grayscale launches its ADA ETF, it will enable investors to further diversify their portfolios by incorporating ADA. In reaction to Grayscale’s move, the Cardano price surged by more than 14% to $0.8068, signaling a positive sentiment. The trading volume also rose by 11%, reflecting increased investor interest. Microsoft Partnership and Hoskinson’s Crypto Advisory Role Fuel Optimism Further, Sssebi underscored the significance of Cardano’s potential collaboration with Microsoft in ADA’s bullish rally. During a YouTube live on February 10, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed that the blockchain platform may enter into a strategic alliance with tech giant Microsoft. Although specifics were undisclosed, the community rejoiced, recognizing the far-reaching implications for both the blockchain and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Moreover, the analyst highlighted that Hoskinson’s crypto advisor role in the Trump administration could be another major catalyst for Cardano’s price rally toward $20. In November, Hoskinson confirmed his support of Trump’s crypto plans, in a bid to reshape the US crypto legislation. Cardano’s Bullish Breakout: What’s Next for ADA Price? Currently, the Cardano token is trading at $0.7949, down by 1.28% in a day. However, the Cardano price has experienced a surge of 13.46% over the past seven days despite a massive 26% monthly dip. The token’s trading volume has also seen a significant plummet of 21%, currently at $659.16 million. In addition to Sssebi’s analysis, other analysts like TapTools also remain bullish about Cardano’s future trends. According to TapTools, the Cardano price is ready to retest its previous all-time high of $3, targeting a new ATH. While forecasts suggest a bullish trend, the actual outcome remains uncertain. So, investors should proceed with caution before making any investment decisions regarding ADA.

Outlook is bearish as MVRV, fear and greed index fall",https://crypto.news/bitcoin-price-at-risk-mvrv-fear-and-greed-index-falls/,"Bitcoin price continued its consolidation as the fear and greed index remained at the neutral point and the Z score of the market value and realized value fell to a three-month low. Bitcoin ( BTC ), the largest cryptocurrency by volume, remains in a tight range. At last check Saturday, the price hovered $97,600 — up 1.2%. Why Bitcoin price has stalled This price action is happening as investors remain on the sidelines as they wait for the next catalyst. SoSoValue data shows that American investors’ demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has waned . The funds had net outflows worth over $650 million in the last four days. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez commented on the trend on Saturday, #Bitcoin Spot ETFs have offloaded nearly 7,437 $BTC in the past week! pic.twitter.com/8eIFBCzic7 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 15, 2025 When spot Bitcoin ETFs offload BTC, it means they are selling Bitcoin from their holdings, which can create downward price pressure, signal investor outflows, and increase market volatility. Redemptions, institutional portfolio shifts, or fund rebalancing are likely driving the sales. If multiple ETFs sell simultaneously, it can amplify price swings, especially in low-liquidity periods. Additionally, arbitrage traders may exploit discrepancies between ETF prices and Bitcoin’s spot price. Who’s to blame? Bitcoin stalled amid the ongoing geopolitical risks and potential for high interest rates for longer. Investors anticipate President Donald Trump’s tariffs will spark a trade war and cause market volatility. It will also lead to higher inflation as companies boost prices in the U.S. Inflation data released this week showed that the headline consumer inflation data rose from 2.9% in December to 3% in January, while the core CPI moved from 3.2% to 3.3%. Bitcoin and other risky assets underperform the market when the Federal Reserve is hawkish. In his testimony to Congress this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank would hold steady until inflation starts falling.

Further, the Z score of the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) indicator has dropped to 2.49, from the year-to-date high of 3. The MVRV indicator is a popular tool used to measure the valuation of a crypto coin. It does that by subtracting the realized market value from the circulating market value and then standardizing it. An MVRV figure of less than 3.5 indicates that a crypto coin is undervalued. Historically, a drop in the fear and greed index, MVRV, and futures open interest signals potential accumulation by smart money investors. BTC price technical analysis: Bitcoin needs to clear $108,440 Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the price of Bitcoin has remained below $100,000 in the past few days. It has also remained in a tight range in the past two months. Bitcoin has dropped below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a bearish sign. Additionally, it has formed a double-top chart pattern at $108,440. Therefore, Bitcoin’s outlook is bearish as long as it is below the double-top level. The bearish outlook will become invalid if it moves above $108,440, as this will invalidate the double-top point. A drop below the neckline point at $89,055 will point to more downside, with the next support level being at $73,613. Ethereum, meanwhile, is currently trading at $2,693.91 — down 0.3%.

According to some crypto analysts, the lack of investor liquidity is worrying, highlighting the new feat that occurred in January. According to Gecko terminal data shared by co-founder and chief operating officer of CoinGecko, Bobby Ong, there were over 600,000 new digital assets launched in January. According to Ong’s post, the feat represents a 12-fold rise from the same period in 2024. In his post, Ong mentioned that in 2022-2023, about 50,000 new tokens were being minted every month, with Q4 2024 seeing a rapid increase with 400,000 new tokens per month. However, it is looking like 2025 will be the year of new tokens, with January seeing 600,000 new tokens created. CoinGecko’s Ong discusses the surge in crypto issuance According to Ong’s post , most of the new tokens created in the market were a result of platforms like Pump.fun. The Solana-based platform provided traders, even inexperienced ones, with an avenue to create their tokens. This way, the platform takes away the technical and complex aspects, opening users up to a world where they can create their tokens and launch them in minutes. 1/ The token explosion is real. 🚀 On @GeckoTerminal , we now track 209 chains, 1,450 DEXes, and nearly 5.5 million tokens. But the real shocker? The rate at which new tokens are being created. 👇 — Bobby Ong (@bobbyong) February 14, 2025 Ong mentioned that at this rate, the market should be prepared to have about one billion tokens in the next five years. In addition, he also added that the boom is resonating across other sectors, with the decentralized exchange (DEX) boom still going strong. For instance, he mentioned that about five new chains, which are mostly EVMs, are launched every month, with May 2024 seeing a monthly high of 17 new chain launches. According to Gabriel Halm, a research analyst at crypto platform IntoTheBlock, the growing crypto issuance is natural proof of the bullish sentiment in the crypto market. This means that there is a natural perception that most tokens will thrive upon creation before they settle at a price range. Liquidity concerns trail the increase in new token issuance According to Halm, most of these new tokens show disjointed price actions, which happens as a result of the spread of investor attention and liquidity. The thin liquidity is also reflected in the wider crypto market, with more established altcoins failing to see the momentum to propel them back to the highs they last saw in 2021. Analysts have also predicted that the altcoins season may encounter a delay due to the dispersion created by the increase in digital assets. In previous bull markets, profits from Bitcoin’s rally often flowed into Ethereum propelling it to rally, before moving into smaller cap tokens, leading them to follow the leading cryptocurrency’s price action. However, Halm mentioned that the growing appetite from institutional players is changing the way that the market operates. “Alongside the near exponential growth of new crypto assets, the emergence of traditional finance institutions as an actor in the space will inevitably alter the liquidity rotations seen in previous cycles, reforming how capital flows in the crypto space,” Halm said. In response to a user who cited the dangers of liquidity fragmentation, Ong mentioned the fragmentation of liquidity as the leading cause of issues related to the lack of momentum in the crypto market. “Too many tokens, each spreading the limited attention and liquidity of traders even thinner. That’s why we don’t see the great alt pumps of previous cycles,” he added.

The analyst argued in his assessment shared today that this is an “average scenario.” According to the analyst, in such scenarios, Bitcoin price would be the asset that experiences the least decline and is usually around 15% and the target price in the current situation could be around $80,000 to $85,000.

Interestingly, il Capo argued that memecoins would be the hardest hit in such a scenario, witnessing a 50% to 60% decline. il Capo said that no one wants such a scenario to happen, but the issue is not what people want, but what the market will give people. *This is not investment advice.

While many have been focusing on Cardano (ADA) and Binance Coin (BNB) for gains, one project has quietly gained momentum. The analyst identifies the project as FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a viral meme coin infused with AI technology and real-world utility that offers investors the high-reward potential seen in past crypto bull runs. Cardano (ADA): Strong Fundamentals, But Can It Deliver Explosive Gains? Cardano (ADA) is one of the most promising Layer-1 blockchains. However, while Cardano (ADA) has a dedicated community, its price growth has been relatively slow. Cardano (ADA) remains a solid long-term investment, but many traders, keeping up with the crypto market, are shifting their focus from Cardano (ADA) to FloppyPepe (FPPE) due to its 3,200% price potential. Unlike Cardano (ADA), which requires years of adoption and development, this new meme coin is positioned for rapid adoption and set to the next big crypto breakout. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Coin Set for a 3,200% Rally FloppyPepe (FPPE), a new meme coin inspired by the legendary Matt Furie, has already captured the attention of the crypto analyst community, who are comparing its early-stage momentum to Shiba Inu’s breakout. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) private round sold out in just 24 hours, raising an astonishing $907,200, proving the immense demand for this next-generation meme coin. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is built with full DeFi functionality and can be traded across multi-chain This interoperability creates optimal liquidity and accessibility, making the meme coin one of the most flexible assets in the crypto market. A key factor driving FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) surge is an AI-powered tool that enables users to monetize viral memes. By transforming them into NFTs, this meme coin enables content creators to earn passive income . The crypto analyst has predicted a 3,200% price explosion; this hint can be calculated to mean that investing in FloppyPepe (FPPE) today could turn a modest $1,000 into $32,000, and a $5,000 investment could bring in $160,000 in profits. FloppyPepe (FPPE) provides a guarantee of a safe and credible investment environment with an audit of its smart contract by SolidProof. The project has also implemented multi-signature wallets to boost its strong security measures. For investors looking to maximize their ROI, this valuable meme coin offers impressive staking rewards , referral bonuses, and a token burn mechanism to retain long-term value appreciation. With 3% of every transaction redistributed to holders, investors can generate passive income just by holding the token. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale is moving quickly at $ 0.0000002 , with the crypto analyst and various whales entering early to secure their positions and repeat their success from a similar opportunity in 2021. Binance Coin (BNB): A Blue-Chip Crypto, But Can It 32x? Binance Coin (BNB) is another major player in the crypto space. It is the native token of Binance, the world’s largest exchange. While Binance Coin (BNB) offers strong utility and exchange-driven demand, its growth potential is limited compared to meme coins. Currently Binance Coin (BNB) is trading at $647.6, reflecting a 12% increase over the past week. Binance Coin (BNB) holders are already established, and while their holdings may appreciate over time, it is unlikely to deliver the kind of exponential returns that meme coins like FloppyPepe (FPPE) are capable of. This is why many Binance Coin (BNB) investors are diversifying into this new meme coin, recognizing its early-stage value and massive growth potential. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is the Best Investment for 2025 The crypto analyst community is buzzing with excitement, and for good reason, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is shaping up to be the most explosive meme coin of the next bull run. A crypto analyst is highlighting the meme coin’s AI-powered meme generation, and burgeoning NFT marketplace as strong incentives that make it a complete ecosystem. The crypto analyst has projected a 3,200% price surge for FloppyPepe (FPPE), making it the most promising investment of 2025. Unlike Cardano (ADA) and Binance Coin (BNB), which have already seen most of their significant price moves, this meme coin is still in its early stages, meaning the potential for exponential growth is far greater. Now is the ideal time to secure tokens now ahead of the life-altering financial gains in 2025.

Blockchain.com hired Justin Evans, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs, as its new chief financial officer, Bloomberg reported . It also appointed Mike Wilcox, previously CFO of Velocity Global and former Point72 portfolio manager, as its chief operating officer. Evans said that the exchange is “taking the steps necessary to be a public company, if and when the public markets are available.” The move comes amid a flurry of other cryptocurrency firms reported to be considering going public, including Circle, Kraken, Bullish Global (Parent company of CoinDesk), Gemini, Ripple and BitGo. Growing institutional adoption after major firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, launched exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings in the cryptocurrency space and the more balanced approach the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to take toward digital assets are creating a potentially more favorable environment for these firms to go public.

Experts Weigh In,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-the-crypto-market-crash-before-the-next-altcoin-season-experts-weigh-in/,"The post Will the Crypto Market Crash Before the Next Altcoin Season? Experts Weigh In appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto traders are eagerly anticipating the next altcoin season, but before that happens, the market could see a major correction. The market is not in favor of altcoins and ,any analyst have predicted that altcoin season is delayed due to multiple factors like less retail interest, memecoin frenzy and Trump’s tariff war . At present altcoins outside the top 10 are struggling, with their total market cap hitting a three-month low of $277 billion, per TradingView. That’s a steep 77% drop from their $492 billion peak in November 2021. Looking at the current scenario, Crypto analyst Il Capo, said that altcoins may drop by 20%-40% before the real rally begins, with meme coins facing even bigger losses. A Sharp Correction Before Altseason? Il Capo believes the market isn’t ready for a full-fledged altcoin rally just yet. Based on his analysis, Bitcoin could experience a 15%-20% dip, targeting levels around $80K-$85K. Altcoins, however, are expected to suffer more, with stronger projects correcting by 20%-30% and weaker ones plunging by 30%-40%. Meme coins , known for their extreme volatility, might see losses as deep as 50%-60%. For example recently, a trader made $28 million on February 14 by trading the “ Broccoli” memecoin , inspired by CZ’s dog. Speculation hints at insider trading, exposing memecoins’ risky nature. Analyst Nicolai Sondergaard notes that altcoins are seeing mixed performances, with some sectors outperforming others. This speculation and over hyped coins like TRUMP is creating a problem for established coins. Despite traders hoping for a smooth ride, Capo warns that markets don’t move based on expectations—they follow their cycle. While painful, this shakeout could be a necessary step before the market enters the next explosive phase. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : LIBRA Token Crashes 85% After Milei’s Promotion – $20M Insider Profits Exposed , Any Hope of Altseason? Historical data suggests that altcoin seasons usually kick off around 6-9 months after Bitcoin reaches its peak. In 2017 and 2021, major altcoin rallies occurred after Bitcoin’s price stabilized post-halving. With the next Bitcoin halving set for April 2024, analysts expect a similar timeline: a strong Bitcoin run through late 2024, followed by a shift into altcoins in early 2025. Bitcoin dominance, which measures its share of the total crypto market , is another key indicator. When BTC dominance drops below 50%, it signals that capital is moving into altcoins. Currently, BTC dominance is around 60.6%, meaning the transition hasn’t started yet. For altcoins to take off, a few things need to align. Bitcoin must first peak and enter a stabilization phase, allowing traders to rotate funds into alternative assets. Ethereum is often the first to lead, so an ETH/BTC surge could indicate that the broader market is shifting. Retail hype, particularly around meme coins and emerging narratives, will also play a role in driving prices higher. While Raoul Pal , CEO of Real Vision said that Altcoin’s can take off soon as the market is heading towards“Banana Zone” which means the altcoin’s can take a lead. But he also warns that investors need patience as it may not be that quick. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Investors searching for the next big opportunity should focus on emerging and altcoins with strong potential. Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), ChowWow ($CHOW) , Solana (SOL), and Pepe (PEPE) are five top altcoins that could see explosive growth by 2030. Whether through technological innovation, strategic adoption, or community-driven momentum, these coins have the potential to surge in value. Let’s explore why these top altcoins might be the next crypto millionaire-makers. Cardano (ADA): A Leading Force in Smart Contracts Cardano's emphasis on interoperability, scalability, and sustainability has won it a spot among the leading cryptocurrencies. Its strong research-based approach guarantees its blockchain technology will always be at the forefront of development. Recent developments on Cardano, like improved smart contract capabilities, have accelerated the expansion of its ecosystem. Adoption is accelerated by projects leveraging Cardano's scalable and secure infrastructure. Cardano is expected to provide substantial profits in the future due to its emphasis on addressing practical issues and promoting financial inclusivity. Pepe (PEPE): The Meme Coin Revolutionizing Crypto Top memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way for newer, community-driven initiatives like Pepe. Pepe began as a meme token but has since grown in popularity and utility to become a symbol of crypto culture. The Pepe community has elevated the token above its meme origins by demonstrating resilience and inventiveness. Pepe could emerge as a surprising contender in the altcoin industry if its ecosystem evolves, generating returns that turn investors into millionaires. Solana (SOL): The High-Speed Blockchain Powering Web3 Developers and investors continue to use Solana because of its fast and affordable blockchain network. Due to its fast transaction rates and low fees, it is the go-to crypto trading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The quick growth of Solana's ecosystem is drawing in projects and developers looking for scalability. Solana is anticipated to generate more millionaires by 2030 due to its remarkable history and expanding user base, particularly if it continues to gain traction in the NFT and DeFi markets. Ripple (XRP): Transforming Global Payments with Blockchain One of the leading cross-border payment systems is still Ripple's XRP. It differs from most cryptocurrencies in its ability to facilitate quick and affordable international transactions. As the ongoing legal disputes come to a close, XRP is recovering investors' trust. If Ripple can obtain legal clarification, financial institutions may quickly embrace XRP, making it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. It has an advantage in terms of utility and expansion potential because of its capacity to disrupt traditional payment systems. ChowWow ($CHOW): The MemeCoin with Real Utility ChowWow is a fantastic community project and meme-crypto coin connected to the Chow Chowdog breed. Chow Chow is a popular dog breed that originated in China and is considered a good omen by the Chinese, who view them as friends and watchdogs for tombs. It is one of the best cryptos to buy, and investors are utilizing the early opportunities offered by the ongoing presale. Since the price of the $CHOW token is $0.008, early adopters have the opportunity to double their investment before launch, indicating an extremely low barrier to entry. Its play-to-earn game is one of the fascinating features propelling its rise as one of the top memecoins to add to your portfolio. Everyone is welcome to play these games in the ChowWow kingdom. The game also pays its players, but you have to own $CHOW tokens to be eligible. Players get a regular distribution of the reward pool, which is augmented by a portion of in-game sales. ChowWow is the most promising crypto trading platform since it offers a staking strategy that allows users to stake their tokens and receive monthly rewards. Given its well-laid roadmap, analysts predict it has the potential to turn early investors into millionaires by 2030. Conclusion These five projects have the potential to create new millionaires by 2030. Whether through technological advancements, adoption, or community-driven growth, they could be the next big winners in the crypto market.

Investors on the hunt for the next lucrative opportunity should keep an eye on emerging altcoins that show strong promise. Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), ChowWow ($CHOW) , Solana (SOL), and Pepe (PEPE) are five leading altcoins that could potentially experience significant growth by 2030. Through technological breakthroughs, widespread adoption, or community support, these coins could see a substantial increase in value. Let’s delve into what makes these leading altcoins potential catalysts for creating new crypto millionaires. Cardano (ADA): A Major Player in Smart Contracts Cardano has carved out a niche for itself among top cryptocurrencies due to its focus on interoperability, scalability, and sustainability. With a strong foundation in research, its blockchain technology remains on the cutting edge of development. Recent enhancements to Cardano, such as upgraded smart contract functionalities, have fueled the growth of its ecosystem. Various projects are quickly adopting Cardano's robust and secure framework. Given its dedication to solving real-world challenges and enhancing financial inclusion, Cardano is poised to offer considerable returns in the future. Pepe (PEPE): Changing the Game with Meme Coins Popular memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have opened the door for new, community-focused projects like Pepe. Initially launched as a meme token, Pepe has evolved into a significant emblem of crypto culture, gaining both popularity and utility. The Pepe community has pushed the token beyond its meme beginnings, showcasing creativity and determination. If its ecosystem continues to develop, Pepe could become an unexpected frontrunner in the altcoin market, potentially yielding millionaire-level returns for investors. Solana (SOL): Powering Web3 with Lightning Speed Solana remains a favorite among developers and investors due to its rapid and cost-effective blockchain network. With its swift transaction speeds and minimal fees, it is a preferred crypto trading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The rapid expansion of Solana's ecosystem is attracting projects and developers seeking scalability. With its impressive track record and growing user base, Solana is expected to create more millionaires by 2030, particularly if it continues to gain momentum in the NFT and DeFi sectors. Ripple (XRP): Revolutionizing Global Transactions Ripple's XRP continues to stand out as a leading solution for cross-border payments. Its ability to enable fast and cost-efficient international transactions sets it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. As legal battles come to a close, XRP is regaining the trust of investors. Should Ripple secure legal clarity, XRP could see swift adoption by financial institutions, making it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Its potential to disrupt traditional payment systems gives it a competitive edge in terms of utility and growth potential. ChowWow ($CHOW): A MemeCoin with Practical Value ChowWow is an exciting community-driven project and meme cryptocurrency linked to the Chow Chow dog breed. Originating from China, Chow Chow dogs are seen as good luck symbols and guardians of tombs by the Chinese. As one of the best cryptos to buy, investors are seizing early opportunities through the ongoing presale. Priced at $0.008, the $CHOW token presents early adopters with a chance to double their investment before its official launch, thanks to the low entry barrier. Its play-to-earn game is a standout feature, driving its rise as one of the top memecoins to consider adding to your portfolio. Everyone can enjoy these games in the ChowWow realm. Players are rewarded, but owning $CHOW tokens is necessary to qualify. Regular distributions from the reward pool, supplemented by a share of in-game sales, are provided to players. ChowWow stands out as a leading crypto trading platform with a staking strategy that enables users to stake their tokens and earn monthly rewards. With its strategic roadmap, analysts foresee it having the potential to turn early backers into millionaires by 2030. Conclusion By 2030, these five projects could be pivotal in creating new millionaires. Through a combination of technological innovations, adoption, and community-driven growth, they hold the potential to be the next big winners in the crypto world. In particular, ChowWow, a rising memecoin, offers promising prospects for wealth creation. As the tokens remain highly affordable, visit the website to acquire $CHOW tokens.

The Argentinian president announced the launch of a memecoin LIBRA similar to that of U.S. President Donald Trump’s OFFICIAL TRUMP. Soon after the announcement, both the tokens witnessed a huge influx of liquidity, elevating the tokens by a huge margin. Soon after the LIBRA initiated its trade with the levels above $1, the insiders cashed out, dragging the levels by over 90% within 3 hours of the launch. While TRUMP faces a similar consequence in a couple of days, LIBRA dumped in just a few hours. The TRUMP team liquidated their holding with over 70% of tokens being locked and LIBRA’s insiders cashed out where tokenomics was not shared with the traders. Does this suggest the ‘Celebrity Coins’ are lowering the credibility of the memecoins? Or is this because the Bitcoin dominance has not raised enough? Will the Traders Gain Back Confidence Over the Memecoins? In the past 30 days, the memecoin market capitalization has witnessed a 30% pullback, while a notable rise of over 68% was recorded in the volume. The top gainers in the same period failed to record the popular and the largest ones like Dogecoin, Pepe, or the newly launched like WIF, BONK, or POPCAT. This suggests the traders are no longer attracted towards the utility or use cases of memecoin but just as a quick profit-gaining tool. With the rise in such types of tokens, a popular analyst anonymously called Seth called out for stronger crypto regulations. He says, Crypto needs regulations. This ruins the reputation for Crypto While some refused, some believed regulations could help not only the memecoins but may save the reputation of the entire cryptos. The crypto space is comprised of many gems that can address many real-world issues. Hence, when these fail to gain the required buying volume and all the volumes are poured into these scam coins, it is not a good signal for the crypto space. Besides, the influential people should also hold some accountable for the losses incurred by the retail traders due to the collapse initiated by their team. However, as long as the market participants continue to dream of a quick profit or becoming overnight millionaires, many other pump & dump tokens will continue to squeeze millions in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,MARKET|ALTCOIN|REGULATION|BONK|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-15 15:49:41

But in a market going toward actual utility, hype by itself might not be sufficient. The question is not only how high Dogecoin may go but also whether it can stay up with the next great thing as investors search beyond speculation into ventures with real-world impact, fast, low-cost transactions, financial accessibility and long-term stability. Is Dogecoin about ready for a comeback? Having dropped more than 24% in value since January 18, 2025, Dogecoin has been suffering. This drop began when a new meme-based cryptocurrency known as ""Trump"" became well-known and attracted investors, therefore draining funds from Dogecoin. But as Trump's price fell, it set off a domino effect that toppled the whole meme coin market including Dogecoin. According to @ali_charts , Dogecoin ($DOGE) whale activity has remained flat this past week, with no major buying or selling pressure. Currently, Dogecoin is displaying steadiness since the recent price rise gives the crypto industry fresh hope. Still, from November 2024 Dogecoin has been caught between $0.25 and $0.40. Trading at roughly $0.26 right now, its entire market value is $39.9 billion. While some experts think Dogecoin might climb once again, its present situation makes a breakout above $0.50 improbable in the near future impossible. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which gauges whether an item is overbought or oversold, is one main determinant of Dogecoin's price. The RSI currently speculates that the price of Dogecoin might fluctuate, but a significant increase is not anticipated just yet. Bitcoin could be one item driving Dogecoin higher. Though Dogecoin hasn't yet shown the similar trend, Bitcoin is nearing its all-time high. Should Bitcoin surpass its past record, it might draw fresh Dogecoin investors, therefore bringing the coin closer to its 2024 highs. To that end, though, the price of Dogecoin would have to climb by roughly 46%. Although Dogecoin is steady right now, bigger market dynamics will define its destiny. Should Bitcoin keep doing well, Dogecoin might find increasing appeal. For now, though, it is in a waiting phase while investors dream of a breakout. Remittix (RTX): The Hidden Gem That Could Beat Dogecoin! By bridging the gap between fiat and cryptocurrencies, Remittix (RTX) is creating waves in the crypto space by lowering the cost of international money transfers and accelerating speed. Unlike meme coins, which fluctuate depending on buzz, RTX aims for actual use and provides a workable answer to excessive wire transfer costs. Remittix might take front stage in the crypto market by cutting expenses for freelancers and households. Many analysts think Remittix could possibly outperform Dogecoin. While jokes and celebrity sponsors helped Dogecoin become well-known, Remittix is meant for long-term success. One of the best coins to buy right now since some investors are looking at under-five-cent coins like RTX for higher returns. Targeting the billion-dollar remittance business, where millions of people daily transmit money across borders, Remittix has room to develop steadily since demand for reasonably priced money transfers never stops. Remittix might leave many meme coins behind if the market moves toward coins offering actual savings. Should this occur, Dogecoin would find it difficult to stay up. Changing digital money into real-world cash is one of the main issues in cryptocurrencies. Though many people all around have cryptocurrency, they lack access to conventional banking facilities. RTX addresses this by letting consumers send money overseas and withdraw it in local currencies via banks, automated tell-through systems and payment apps. For those looking for long-term possibilities, this useful use case makes this coin the best coin to invest now. RTX also provides great degrees of transparency and security. The development team has locked its tokens to maintain stability and liquidity for three years, which decreases the possibility of unexpected price crashes. Dogecoin has never provided this degree of protection, hence Remittix has a great advantage in the crypto market. RTX's straightforward flat-fee mechanism is another great advantage since it guarantees that the whole amount sent gets to the recipient. RTX is a game-changer in the payments business since it provides a fair and open substitute for conventional banks that impose hidden costs. At $0.0599 right now, RTX is seen as one of the greatest cryptocurrencies to purchase right now; analysts estimate a 25x increase during presale and a 1,500% jump following launch. RTX is the best coin to invest today as demand for quick, cheap payments rises. With actual worth and great promise, this might be the next major crypto trend!

33767162,[object Object],1739635023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Arthur Hayes: Meme Coins Will Dominate Political Campaigns in 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/arthur-hayes-meme-coins-will-dominate-political-campaigns-in-2026/,"Arthur Hayes, former BitMEX CEO, has made an audacious prediction: by 2026, meme coins will dominate political advertising. It sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi film, but Hayes believes that meme coins and blockchain-based assets will become central to how politicians engage with voters. If his forecast is correct, we could see the rise of “PolitiFi” coins — cryptocurrencies tailored to political campaigns — as a new era of digital engagement begins to unfold. The Political Meme Coin Revolution Hayes’ bold statement might seem far-fetched at first, but there’s an underlying logic to it. The world is becoming increasingly digital, and politicians are under growing pressure to connect with younger, tech-savvy voters. Traditional media ads are becoming less effective, and the younger generation is spending more time in the world of memes and digital assets. Hayes isn’t the only one who sees the potential of meme coins in political campaigns . The success of decentralized prediction markets, like Polymarket, is a clear indication that blockchain technology is gaining traction in the political space. These platforms allow users to wager on the outcomes of political events, which shows the growing interest in blockchain-based political predictions. The real kicker is that the future of political campaigning might not just be about using meme coins — it could be about depending on them. Imagine a world where meme coins like $DOGE or a new “PolitiFi” coin are used to fund campaigns, gather support, and even help voters interact with candidates. Politicians could issue their own digital tokens, and voters could send tokens as a form of political contribution or even to vote on policy proposals. A Look at Polymarket’s Growth Polymarket’s rise is a testament to the increasing interest in blockchain-based political platforms. Since its launch, the platform has provided a transparent, decentralized way for people to wager on political events. It’s no wonder that experts like Hayes are betting on the integration of meme coins into political campaigns, especially as blockchain technology continues to evolve. If you’re wondering how well Polymarket has been doing, consider looking at its performance over time. The platform has seen consistent growth, which points to the increasing demand for decentralized political forecasting. $MEMEX: The First Meme Coin Index So, how do you make sense of this? Enter the Meme Index ( $MEMEX ) — a new and innovative concept that might just be the way to play the meme coin market while minimizing risks. $MEMEX is designed to track the performance of meme coins, and it could include PolitiFi coins if they ever become a thing. Currently, 1 $MEMEX costs $0.0162284, and the presale has already raised an impressive $3.6M, reflecting strong investor interest in this new asset. $MEMEX is more than just an index. It’s a way for investors to spread their risk by buying into a basket of meme coins, including those that might eventually be tied to political campaigns. The cool thing about $MEMEX is that holders of the token can vote on which meme coins get added to the index. This gives you, as an investor, a direct influence on the market and a chance to participate in shaping the future of meme-based politics. The meme coin market is a wild ride. One minute you’re seeing a dog-inspired coin soar to the moon, and the next, a new project hits the scene with massive potential. By investing in $MEMEX , you’re not just betting on individual coins. You’re betting on the entire ecosystem of meme coins — and that includes potential political coins that may dominate in the future. The Role of Meme Coins in Politics Meme coins could soon play a key role in political campaigns as politicians aim to engage younger, tech-savvy voters. Blockchain-based assets like meme coins may become the new go-to tool for digital campaigns. $MEMEX is paving the way as a potential index for these coins and political tokens. As the trend grows, blockchain-powered political campaigns may become the norm by 2026. Whether or not Politify coins take off, investing in one of the best presales —$MEMEX—could be a smart move.

The main forces for this optimistic outlook are the blockchain's quick adoption and institutional interest. Meanwhile, Panshibi’s presale stage is generating massive hype, with early investors seeing it as a potential goldmine. As Solana continues its climb, Panshibi’s unique tokenomics and viral momentum could position it as the next big winner in the crypto space. This article explores both assets’ growth potential and why investors are paying close attention. Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Hit $500? The Solana price prediction highlights one of the cryptocurrency market's top achievers because it offers remarkable scalability with low transaction fees while extending its DeFi and NFT projects. Several experts on Solana price prediction will reach an ultimate value of $500 by the future. Bloomberg analysts predict a probable rate of 70% for a Solana ETF approval during this current year. If this materializes, institutional investors could pour billions into SOL, pushing prices significantly higher. However, Solana has faced challenges, including large sell-offs from whale wallets. Recently, Pump.fun offloaded $28 million worth of SOL to Kraken, causing short-term price fluctuations. Despite this, long-term investors remain optimistic, citing Solana’s unmatched transaction speeds and strong developer support as reasons why the $500 price target is achievable.The bullish prediction gains additional evidence from Solana network data which shows rising standards for active wallets and daily transaction figures. Market conditions coupled with ongoing growth in adoption makes it feasible for SOL to reach $500 during its next market cycle. Panshibi Presale Stage: A Viral Meme Coin with Massive Potential While Solana captures institutional attention, retail investors are turning their eyes to Panshibi, a meme coin merging Asian culture, AI and Social-Fi. Panshibi’s presale stage has already raised over $850,000 toward its $10 million goal, signaling strong demand from early adopters. Unlike traditional meme coins, Panshibi offers utility through staking and NFT integration, making it more than just a speculative asset . One of Panshibi’s key advantages is its limited token supply, with 60% of the total supply allocated to presale investors. This ensures a fair distribution while also creating scarcity, which could drive significant price appreciation upon launch. Analysts predict a post-launch surge of 145,000%, making Panshibi one of the most anticipated meme coins in recent history. Security and transparency are also major selling points for Panshibi. Coinsult conducted a complete blockchain audit of the project to establish its genuineness while investors feel reassured. The 10-year lock on Panshibi’s liquidity protects investors by ensuring an anti-rug pull environment while building trust within the project’s sustained roadmap. Why Panshibi is More Than Just a Meme Coin Beyond its viral appeal, Panshibi offers a robust staking mechanism with APYs reaching up to 1,200%. Token holders acquire passive income through this system which at the same time sustains the ecosystem community. Users within the Panshibi project possess AI-based capabilities that enable them to vote on essential protocol upgrades along with key developmental decisions. The model differentiates Panshibi from traditional meme coins since Dogecoin and Shiba Inu lack these features. Furthermore, Panshibi’s roadmap includes listings on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) following the presale stage. It is anticipated that this greater accessibility would encourage widespread adoption and raise its market worth even further. Panshibi has all it takes to become the next major success story in the meme coin space: a solid foundation, viral traction and creative tokenomics. With institutional investment and network expansion driving a possible spike to $500, Solana's price prediction is still optimistic. In addition, Panshibi's presale phase offers early investors a unique chance to profit from its cutting-edge features and viral momentum. The combination of high-yield staking and a locked liquidity structure makes Panshibi a standout project in the meme coin sector. As both assets gain traction, investors looking for the next big opportunity should consider the advantages of adding Panshibi to their portfolios.

Key drivers behind this positive sentiment include the blockchain's rapid adoption and growing interest from institutional investors. Meanwhile, Panshibi’s presale phase is attracting significant buzz, with early backers viewing it as a potential jackpot. As Solana continues its upward trajectory, Panshibi’s distinctive tokenomics and viral momentum could establish it as a major contender in the crypto world. This article delves into the growth potential of both assets and explains why investors are watching closely. Solana Price Forecast: Will SOL Reach $500? The Solana price forecast shines a light on one of the cryptocurrency market's leading performers due to its impressive scalability, low transaction costs, and expanding DeFi and NFT initiatives. Many specialists on Solana price forecasts foresee the currency reaching a peak value of $500 in the future. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 70% chance of a Solana ETF being approved this year. Should this occur, institutional investors might inject billions into SOL, driving prices considerably upward. Nonetheless, Solana has encountered hurdles, such as substantial sell-offs from major wallets. Recently, Pump.fun sold $28 million worth of SOL to Kraken, causing short-term price volatility. Despite this, long-term investors remain confident, pointing to Solana’s unmatched transaction speeds and robust developer backing as reasons for the $500 target being within reach. The optimistic forecast is further supported by Solana network data, which reveals increasing standards for active wallets and daily transactions. Market conditions, together with ongoing adoption, make it plausible for SOL to hit $500 in its next market cycle. Panshibi Presale Phase: The Next Big Meme Coin with Tremendous Potential While Solana garners institutional interest, retail investors are focusing on Panshibi, a meme coin that blends Asian culture, AI, and Social-Fi. Panshibi’s presale phase has already amassed over $850,000 toward its $10 million target, reflecting strong demand from early adopters. Unlike conventional meme coins, Panshibi provides utility through staking and NFT integration, positioning it as more than a mere speculative asset . A significant advantage of Panshibi is its limited token supply, with 60% of the total allocated to presale investors, ensuring fair distribution and creating scarcity, potentially leading to significant price increases upon launch. Analysts predict a post-launch surge of 145,000%, making Panshibi one of the most eagerly anticipated meme coins in recent times. Security and transparency are also key selling points for Panshibi. Coinsult has conducted a comprehensive blockchain audit to verify its authenticity, providing investors with reassurance. The 10-year lock on Panshibi’s liquidity offers investor protection by ensuring a rug pull-free environment, fostering trust in the project's long-term roadmap. What Sets Panshibi Apart from Other Meme Coins Beyond its viral charm, Panshibi boasts a strong staking mechanism with APYs reaching up to 1,200%. This system allows token holders to earn passive income while supporting the ecosystem. Participants in the Panshibi project benefit from AI-powered features enabling them to vote on essential protocol upgrades and development decisions. This approach sets Panshibi apart from traditional meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which lack such capabilities. Furthermore, Panshibi’s roadmap plans for listings on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) after the presale, which could enhance accessibility and drive further adoption, increasing its market value. Panshibi is poised to be a major success in the meme coin arena with a solid foundation, viral traction, and innovative tokenomics. As institutional investments and network growth potentially propel Solana's price towards $500, the outlook remains positive. Additionally, Panshibi's presale offers early investors a chance to capitalize on its innovative features and viral momentum. The combination of high-yield staking and secure liquidity structure makes Panshibi a standout project in the meme coin market. As both assets gain momentum, investors seeking the next big opportunity should consider adding Panshibi to their portfolios.

However, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been experiencing sharp declines, leaving investors puzzled and wondering if it can stage a turnaround or continue its downward spiral. For those who regret missing the Dogecoin (DOGE) November rally or got burned by its recent downturn, a new opportunity has arrived. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a promising new meme coin, has caught the attention of the Goldman Sachs analyst. It boasts an astonishing 5,697% return on investment, and as a result, many are flocking to its presale, eager to capitalize on the attractive selling price of $0.0000002 . Goldman Sachs’ Analyst Take: Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Overcome Current Challenges? While FloppyPepe (FPPE) is generating buzz with its presale and potential 5,697% rally, Dogecoin (DOGE) faces challenges as investors increasingly focus on utility tokens. This shift, combined with Dogecoin (DOGE) shedding a staggering 34.7% of its market cap value over the past months, has cast doubt on the optimistic prediction by the Goldman Sachs analyst. Recent data from Santiment reveals a significant decline in large Dogecoin (DOGE) transactions. As of February 7, 2025, whale transactions (transfers over $100,000) dropped to less than a third of what they were in early November 2024. This decrease in whale activity has also led to a notable drop in its 24-hour trading volume, with its price falling from a high of $0.4 to a low of $0.2 within a month. The remarkable 2021 rally that catapulted Dogecoin (DOGE) to a top meme coin status seems like a distant memory. Consequently, many investors are now increasingly worried about Dogecoin (DOGE) prospects in 2025. The Potential For 5,697% Returns: Is FloppyPepe (FPPE) The Next Big Thing? Following the massive success of its private presale, which generated a staggering $907,200 in just 24 hours, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is stealing the spotlight as the next big thing. But what’s got investors and this Goldman Sachs analyst excited is the potential for massive returns of 5,697%, which this new meme coin will offer. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly gaining traction as a viable alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE), backed by bullish sentiments from the Goldman Sachs analyst. Matt Furie’s creative genius, combined with the power of AI, has given rise to something remarkable that’s sending shockwaves through the crypto community. This AI meme coin is the ultimate showstopper, combining the enigmatic charm of a fortune-teller hippo with Pepe the Frog’s irreverent humor. Redefining what a meme coin can achieve, this new meme sensation brings together a vibrant community united by humor, rewards, and a shared passion for driving positive change. FloppyPepe (FPPE) uses AI to simplify meme creation, making it easy for users to turn their ideas into viral content and launch promising memes as unique NFTs on top marketplaces like OpenSea. This meme coin also features a Meme-o-Matic AI-powered technology, which creates memes from user-submitted content such as text, videos, and images. The deflationary tokenomics of FloppyPepe (FPPE) burns 1% of every transaction, increasing token scarcity while rewarding long-term holders through redistribution incentives . This strategic approach has led the Goldman Sachs analyst to believe that this innovative meme coin is well-positioned for long-term growth and potentially increasing value. Not only does the forecasted rally of 5,697% make this token an attractive investment, but investors can also buy with confidence, knowing that SolidProof has successfully audited the FloppyPepe (FPPE) smart contract. Don’t Miss Out: Secure A Spot In The Presale Before It’s Too Late! Securing a spot in the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale, while the current price is still remarkably low, maximizes investors’ returns when it launches. It also creates a chance to earn additional tokens through loyalty-based airdrops, staking, and referral rewards. With a forecasted rally of 5,697%, the Goldman Sachs analyst suggests that buying this meme coin now at $0.0000002 could yield massive profits beyond investors’ imagination. When the FloppyPepe (FPPE) token’s market cap reaches $100 million, the largest meme wall will be built, potentially generating more life-changing gains for early adopters.

However, a new contender is emerging, capturing the attention of savvy investors: Web3Bay . This blockchain-based e-commerce platform has achieved a presale milestone of $1.2 million, selling 300 million tokens, and is projecting a 50X growth potential for 2025. With its innovative approach to online retail, Web3Bay is asking a crucial question: Could this be the best crypto project to buy now? Bitcoin at $100,000: A Milestone, But What Lies Beyond? Bitcoin’s climb to $100,000 is a significant event, validating its position as a leading digital asset. Increased institutional adoption and growing acceptance of crypto as a hedge against traditional financial uncertainties have contributed to this surge. Yet, the question remains: Can Bitcoin still deliver the life-changing returns that early adopters experienced? While analysts project further growth, potentially reaching $150,000 or even $200,000, achieving 50X or 100X gains from its current valuation is highly unlikely. The sheer size of Bitcoin’s market capitalization makes such exponential growth a statistical improbability. For investors seeking substantial returns, exploring promising altcoins like Web3Bay, one of the best crypto projects, becomes a compelling strategy. Web3Bay: Redefining E-commerce Through Decentralization Web3Bay presents a unique value proposition: the integration of blockchain technology into the vast world of e-commerce. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a store of value, Web3Bay offers real-world utility. It aims to disrupt the $5 trillion e-commerce industry by creating a decentralized marketplace. Current e-commerce giants, despite their success, suffer from centralized control, high fees, and concerns about data privacy. Web3Bay offers an alternative, one of the best crypto projects, where transactions are secure, fees are minimal, and users control their data. The platform’s dual payment system, supporting both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies (including PayPal), bridges the gap between traditional finance and the world of blockchain. The best crypto projects address real-world problems, and Web3Bay does exactly that. The Power of Community: Web3Bay’s DAO Governance Web3Bay’s commitment to decentralization extends to its governance model. A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) empowers the community to make decisions about the platform’s future. This approach aligns with the core principles of blockchain technology, ensuring that the platform remains true to its decentralized ethos. In a world where centralized control is increasingly questioned, Web3Bay’s DAO structure offers a refreshing alternative, cementing its place among the best crypto projects. Web3Bay’s Presale Success: A Glimpse into the Future Web3Bay’s presale success, exceeding $1 million, underscores investor confidence in its potential. With the current presale price at $0.004562, the potential for early investors is substantial. The launch price is set at $0.1959, representing a potential 4,193% return on investment for early backers. If Web3Bay reaches a valuation of $0.50 in 2025, a $1,000 investment today could grow to $10,960. This level of potential return makes Web3Bay a compelling choice for investors searching for the best crypto projects. Web3Bay vs. Bitcoin: A Comparative Perspective While Bitcoin’s influence on the crypto market is undeniable, its potential for exponential growth is now limited. Web3Bay, being in its early stages, offers the possibility of the type of returns that Bitcoin generated in its nascent years. For investors seeking substantial gains, Web3Bay presents a more attractive opportunity. Moreover, Web3Bay’s focus on real-world utility within a massive industry sets it apart from Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital store of value. The Verdict: Web3Bay as a Top Crypto Investment in 2025 Bitcoin’s recent price surge is undoubtedly noteworthy. However, the most significant opportunities in the crypto market often lie with projects that are still in their early stages. Web3Bay, with its presale success, its focus on disrupting the e-commerce industry, and its potential for substantial growth, is a prime example. For investors seeking the best crypto projects to invest in, Web3Bay deserves serious consideration. It’s not just a good investment; it could be the best investment right now. The future of e-commerce is decentralized, and Web3Bay is at the forefront of this transformation.

Grayscale’s push to list a spot Dogecoin ETF on the NYSE shows the growing mainstream adoption of the memecoin sector, while Rollblock’s (RBLK) Web3 gaming platform is on track to revolutionize the $500 billion gambling industry. Here’s why experts believe RBLK could rally up to 50x in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK): Web3 Revolution Has Massive Upside Rollblock ( RBLK ) continues to impress the market with its constant innovation as its provably fair blockchain-backed betting platform recently saw a 600% surge in new users. December also saw $1.75 million in wagered bids across the platform, as momentum has been steadily rising over the past few months. This is largely down to the phenomenal range of gaming experiences available on the platform, from 7000 classic games like poker and Monopoly to a sports prediction league that has resulted in massive inflows recently. Each game is powered by the latest AI tech and allows gamers to instantly verify that everything is fully above board, thanks to all transactions finding a home on the immutable Ethereum blockchain. This ends years of suspected manipulation from traditional gaming providers. The RBLK token has been seeing extraordinary buying pressure in recent days and is currently racing through Stage 10 of its early fundraising journey. One of the most innovative features of the RBLK token is its deflationary revenue-sharing model. Rollblock allocates 30% of its profits to buy back RBLK tokens, with 60% of these buybacks burned to reduce supply and increase scarcity. The remaining 40% funds staking rewards, offering up to 30% APY to holders. Prices are expected to climb soon from $0.055, making RBLK a hugely bullish token to keep an eye on in its very first bull run. Dogecoin (DOGE): Grayscale’s ETF Could Spark Meme Mania The NYSE looks to be preparing to list and trade Grayscale’s spot Dogecoin ETF, marking a major milestone for the buoyant memecoin market. If approved, this would be the first Dogecoin spot ETF, opening the doors to massive institutional investment and paving the way for further altcoins to follow in Dogecoin’s footsteps. DOGE has recently been showing strength, gaining 5% in the last seven days to reach $0.27. However, the monthly time frame paints a bleak picture, as Dogecoin has been trending downward after facing rejection above $0.40. In fact, the Dogecoin price has lost more than 26% in the last 30 days, despite the good news from Grayscale. There is every chance that an approved spot ETF for Dogecoin would send its price to $1 in weeks. Trading volume is still fairly low at just $1.8 billion – only 4.5% of the total Dogecoin market cap. If this rises as buyers return, then key resistance levels could break, igniting a major bull run across the wider market. Rollblock’s Potential Can’t Be Beaten While Dogecoin’s ETF listing would be a huge step for memecoin adoption, Rollblock remains the more bullish bet at this point in the cycle due to its rapidly booming user base and comparatively smaller market cap. Analysts are confident that RBLK could deliver 50x returns to early adopters in 2025, as Stage 10 demand has been relentless at $0.055.

Several experts doubt PEPE meme coin's ability to defeat Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB) in market performance. Investors now have a promising option through Remittix(RTX) which shows both practical functionality and detailed expansion plans. PEPE Price Prediction: Can It Sustain a Breakout? Crypto price models indicate that PEPE might bounce back shortly because of energetic community support and speculative price swings in the market . Any boost in trading volumes might help PEPE reach its assessed resistance points according to market analysts. The long-term survival of PEPE faces challenges because it serves no practical purpose other than being traded as a speculation tool. PEPE encounters obstacles for broad adoption because it fails to benefit from the brand recognition and exchange listings which DOGE and SHIB enjoy. DOGE and SHIB: Are They Losing Momentum? The first place in the meme coin market has always gone to Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) yet recent price changes show that their growth potential is weakening . Both memecoinskeep their enthusiastic follower base yet encounter difficulties with broader market adoption because they deliver few operational applications to the real world. DOGE earned support from Elon Musk but also depends heavily on social media fads after its initial creation as an internet prank. SHIB's ecosystem expansion with ShibaSwap and metaverse projects has failed to demonstrate sustainable business sustainability. With PEPE price prediction models indicating potential growth, many investors are considering whether meme coins can maintain their relevance in a shifting market. Remittix (RTX): The Future of Crypto Payments A fundamentally strong project stands out in the industry as discussions about PEPE price predictions consume social media platforms. The Remittix (RTX) platform changes cryptocurrency distribution processes by enabling fluid transition from crypto assets to fiat currency. Users leverage RTX unlike other cryptocurrencies such as PEPE and DOGE plus SHIB because it delivers practical value through bank account FIAT deposits stemming from digital currency conversions. The innovative feature of Remittix establishes it as a disruptor for the international payment sector which handles transactions worth more than $700 billion yearly. Why Remittix (RTX) Is a Superior Investment Choice The Remittix payment model operates practically through its usable payment system which differs from PEPE price prediction speculations. The system allows users to execute easy CRYPTO-TO-FIAT money transfers simultaneously connecting decentralized currency to conventional financial systems. The unbanked population exceeding 1.4 billion individuals possesses mobile wallets which makes Remittix (RTX) an attractive investment choice because of its massive market potential. The Remittix system lets these excluded people utilize standard remittance platforms to convert their crypto assets into cash. Investors seeking long-term growth should utilize Remittix because it provides secure transactions alongside compliance while ensuring fast performance. During the RTX presale period investors gain an opportunity to purchase tokens before mass adoption occurs. A properly designed tokenomics structure allows early users to maximize profits when the price increases. Crypto Adoption and the Role of Remittix Experts recognize that many crypto projects encounter issues with actual marketplace penetration which becomes evident through the ongoing discussions about PEPE price predictions. Crypto's long-term success depends mainly on its ability to solve practical problems in the market although speculative trading generates short-term appreciation in meme coin values. Mass adoption faces a significant hurdle because there is no smooth method to convert digital assets into traditional currency values. Businesses are reluctant to deal with cryptocurrency because they find converting cryptos into traditional money too difficult. Through its user-friendly platform Remittix enjoys the distinction of merging crypto assets seamlessly with standard banking operations world-wide. Individuals in Nigeria who work as freelancers receive USDT payments that they can instantly transform into reliable local FIAT currency while skipping expensive remittance charges. The Venezuelan population benefits from overseas family money transfers which occur independently of their unsafe national banking system. Final Thoughts: Will PEPE Outperform RTX While PEPE price prediction models suggest short-term gains, long-term sustainability remains in question. The main driving force behind Meme coins exists only in the form of speculative speculation which lacks practical usefulness. The financial solution provided by Remittix (RTX) enables investors to address genuine economic issues in the world. By bridging the gap between crypto and FIAT, RTX is not just another speculative asset, it's a revolutionary platform poised for mass adoption. Before the presale concludes, investors seeking real-world application and long-term gains should investigate Remittix.

While top 10 cryptos like XRP and Dogecoin are popular, lower-priced alternatives often have more room for growth and can deliver bigger gains. Keeping an eye on these five coins might help you make huge profits on your investments. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance is revolutionizing asset management with blockchain technology, making investing in real-world assets easier. Instead of buying an entire property or expensive artwork, investors can now own small fractions as digital tokens. This makes assets more affordable and increases liquidity in once-tough markets. Thanks to this unique approach, Rexas Finance has gained massive attention. Its presale is already in its twelfth stage, raising over $44 million from selling over 444 million RXS tokens. The price of RXS has skyrocketed to $0.20—a 566% jump from its starting value. Analysts predict it could hit $12 after launch and keep climbing. Beyond asset tokenization, Rexas Finance simplifies decentralized finance. Its Token Builder lets anyone create tokens instantly without coding skills. Rexas Estate allows people to co-own properties and earn passive income in stablecoins. The Rexas Launchpad ensures secure token sales across multiple blockchains, while Rexas GenAI helps users create NFT artwork.

Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) VIRTUAL is a leading AI agent cryptocurrency priced under $5. Despite a 62.7% decline in the past month, big whales have accumulated VIRTUAL, signaling confidence in its long-term potential. Recently, a whale purchased 4.88 million VIRTUAL tokens for $9.86 million, reinforcing this trend. With a $1 billion market cap, VIRTUAL is one of the largest AI crypto tokens. While its price dropped due to a broader crypto market correction, experts believe AI hype could drive a strong recovery. Analysts estimate that VIRTUAL might reach $5.75 by the end of this year and $9.20 by 2030. Virtual protocol could gain as the artificial intelligence industry grows, making it a strong candidate for investors looking outside top coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Although SHIB is currently struggling, many signs indicate a chance of a comeback for the coin. A key technical indicator, the falling wedge pattern, suggests an 80% rally could be on the horizon. SHIB has rebounded significantly from this pattern in the past. Additionally, its RSI is near oversold levels, hinting at a potential price surge. On-chain data is also bullish. The Shibarium network continues to grow, with over 863 million transactions, and whales are accumulating SHIB. Moreover, an upcoming partnership teased by SHIB’s developers could be a game-changer. SHIB's strong fundamentals, rising adoption, and potential major deal make it a promising pick for investors beyond the top 10 cryptos. Sui (SUI) Sui is currently trading between $3.54 and $4.5, gaining momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 60, meaning market sentiment is positive. Another key indicator, the MACD, is just under 0.05, signaling a bullish trend. Sui's price is hovering around $4 close to its 10-day moving average and comfortably above its 100-day moving average of $3.86. If it breaks above $5.16, the next target is $6.14, representing a potential gain of over 35% from current levels. On the downside, support is at $3.22. Over the year, Sui has grown an impressive 145.4%, showing strong performance. Many investors see it as a promising pick. Stellar (XLM) Stellar is slowly rising despite the general bearish market trend. Compared to leading cryptocurrencies, it is a good investment choice. It surged nearly 254% in the past year, indicating solid recovery and growth potential. Unlike many altcoins that suffered heavy losses during recent market corrections, XLM only dipped 4%, demonstrating resilience. Analysts believe it could reach $1.29, a potential 90% increaWith has strong fundamentals, growing investor interest, and bullish momentum. XLM offers a compelling alternative to higher-priced assets and the potential for significant future gains. Conclusion These five cryptocurrencies can potentially yield more profits on investments than other top cryptocurrencies in the market. Rexas Finance is a new cryptocurrency, and it has the prospect of skyrocketing in price after its launch on June 19.

Tokens like Shiba Inu ($SHIB) have trumped expectations to clock a billion-dollar market cap. Driven by market hype around these coins, investors are now looking for new projects that could yield long-term gains. For many such users, Solana-powered ChowWow ($CHOW) is a perfect fit for their purpose. The recently launched token has been rated the best altcoin for GameFi aficionados. By combining elements of staking, community airdrops, and GameFi, the platform gives users multiple options to earn passive income. Analysts believe that ChowWow’s deflationary model makes it a dependable option and it can potentially outdo names like Shiba Inu. Why ChowWow is on every analyst’s best cryptocurrency ICO list ChowWow is an eclectic ecosystem that combines elements of GameFi and staking. The crypto project prioritizes community participation and is inspired by a Chinese dog breed called ‘Chow Chow’. The official medium of exchange on the platform is ChowWow’s native token $CHOW. At the time of writing, the token was priced at $0.0080. Counted among the best new ICOs of the year, the $CHOW token’s supply is capped at 888,777,000. The team has set aside 50% of the supply for the 10 presale stages and the remaining for paying operational expenses like staking and gaming rewards. If you are looking to park your funds safely for time, ChowWow’s staking service is an ideal option. Under staking, cryptocurrencies are locked in liquidity pools and used for a project’s development. Throughout the staking period, the token holders will earn rewards. In ChowWow’s case, the staking rewards are paid every month. The annual staking yield percentage will range between 8 to 15%. The rate will be subject to the staking period and the number of participants. If you ask GameFi enthusiasts, ChowWow is the best cryptocurrency to buy right now. The mix of exciting games, easy access, and attractive rewards make ChowWow nothing short of a wonderland. Players can experiment with strategies, win prizes, buy in-game assets, and even design original memes. The ChowWow kingdom comprises digital pets that $CHOW holders can buy, trade, and train. They can compete in multiple games. If they’re stuck in a game, players can move ahead by buying in-game assets. All such assets will have real-world value. The ChowWow team has won brownie points for hosting regular meme competitions. Anyone can design an original meme to enter the contest and upload it on social media. The participants have to tag the ChowWow team and other relevant stakeholders. The team will then organize an online poll. The entry getting the highest votes will win USDT tokens worth $1,000. Shiba Inu burn rate peaks by 390% Shiba Inu is a unique meme coin project which caters to a variety of DeFi requirements. Apart from functioning as a meme token, the project has rolled out a Layer 2 blockchain called Shibarium. The Shiba Inu ecosystem also includes the popular crypto exchange Shibaswap. For any transactional purposes, people have to use Shiba Inu’s native token $SHIB. The dog-themed token hit the headlines after its burn rate rose by 390% on February 11, 2025. With the move, around 16 million SHIB tokens were removed from circulation giving the meme coin a major boost. Analysts feel that the surge in burn rate could lead to a bullish reversal for the coin. Conclusion Shiba Inu and ChowWow are top altcoins that have put meme coins on the global map. The two tokens are inspired by dog breeds and their reputations precede them. While Shiba Inu has been around for longer, many analysts feel that ChowWow is well-poised to surpass it in the coming months. Experts have cited reasons like ChowWow’s multifaceted model and Solana-backed framework as their chief reasons. If you ask crypto users, ChowWow has an edge over Shiba Inu when it comes to their security standards. The ChowWow security framework has been designed in tandem with global data privacy regulations. There are regular audits conducted so that your assets remain safe. If you are looking for a cutting-edge meme coin to boost your portfolio, head over to the ChowWow presale right now!

This Crypto’s 811% Gain Is Turning Heads!,https://thecoinrise.com/dogecoin-doge-and-ethereum-eth-on-shaky-ground-this-cryptos-811-gain-is-turning-heads/,"The recent turmoil surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) has unnerved the crypto arena. Although some of the best cryptos, they both show red price charts. For instance, the DOGE price fell by double-digits on the monthly chart. At that same time, the price of ETH also saw a big drop. However, market analysts like Cas Abbé and Ted have made bullish price predictions for these crypto coins. On the other hand, a new project is turning some heads amid its 811% price growth – IntelMarkets (INTL) . This crypto coin is now in phase nine of its presale, which has already raised over $9M and may hit $10M before this month ends. As it aims to bring the future of crypto trading thanks to the innovative use of AI technology, some experts foresee it potentially becoming the next 4x token in 2025. IntelMarkets (INTL) Gains Mass Appeal Amid 811% Price Pump While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) show volatility right now, IntelMarkets (INTL) is making a name for itself. This project quickly gained attention due to its new perspective and promising vision regarding the booming AI industry. Statista estimates suggest the AI industry will be valued at $826B by 2030. Even capturing 1% of that market would mean millions in revenue for IntelMarkets. Launching the first AI-based trading platform is the core of IntelMarkets’ vision. On this platform, AI-driven trading signals will let traders pinpoint profitable opportunities in different markets. Plus, unlike traditional trading robots that make the same mistake twice, IntelMarkets will have self-learning trading bots that learn and improve with every trade. With these AI features in their corner, traders will drastically increase their profit potential. Those interested in this project are now rushing to buy its native token, INTL. This crypto coin costs only $0.082 in phase nine of its presale, an 811% rise from its starting price of $0.009. However, phase ten of the crypto ICO event will jump to $0.091. A Tier-1 CEX listing will also push the INTL value to $0.11. With this 34% growth, INTL could be one of the best cryptos to buy for fast returns. Cas Abbé: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) May Soar Soon Dogecoin (DOGE) is a powerful force in the meme coin market but has faced some challenges. CoinMarketCap shows that the DOGE price dropped over 20% on the one-month chart. Its value fluctuated between $0.35 and nearly $0.25 during that time. Crypto analyst Cas Abbé remains optimistic about Dogecoin (DOGE). According to his X post, the RSI for this meme coin is showing momentum, and the SEC has acknowledged the DOGE ETF. He foresees that the DOGE price may soon rise because of these factors. Although this Dogecoin price prediction has turned some heads, more eyes are on INTL. The DOGE price has already surged over 200% on the YTD chart. Therefore, its highest upswings may have passed. Analyst Claims the Ethereum (ETH) Price Could Skyrocket to $4,000 Like the DOGE price, Ethereum (ETH) also shows some volatility. On the one-month chart, its value has fallen from around $3,200 to nearly $2,600. In other words, there has been over a 15% drop in the price of ETH in just a few short weeks. However, the community is still watching Ethereum (ETH) thanks to some bullish statements from analysts like Ted. In a recent X post, he said that network upgrades are coming for this crypto coin soon. Ted also mentioned that the price of ETH could soar to $4,000 soon. This Ethereum price prediction has excited traders, but many are still skeptical. Since its market cap now sits at around $320B, the price of ETH may not soar so fast as it needs a lot of new money. Thus, traders are looking at INTL instead. What Gives IntelMarkets (INTL) an Advantage Over Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH)? Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) may see price rebounds soon, but IntelMarkets (INTL) gains the advantage. This project will introduce groundbreaking technology to tap into the growing AI market. With this connection, its long-term growth potential and stability may be amazing. Plus, the smaller market cap of INTL means faster price growth with less money. Meanwhile, the price of ETH or DOGE will face some challenges. Due to all these reasons, experts forecast a potential 4x price pump for this crypto coin in 2025.

Popular Trader Explains Why It’s Unlikely This Decade,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/no-200k-bitcoin-brandt-explains-why-its-unlikely-this-decade/,"Peter Brandt, a seasoned trader, has dismissed optimistic predictions in the wake of Bitcoin’s recent increase to $97,000+. His latest technical analysis indicates that the most prominent cryptocurrency may encounter difficulty in surpassing the coveted $200,000 threshold prior to 2030. Bitcoin has demonstrated a mixed performance, with a daily gain of 0.17% and a 2.85% decline over the course of the week, prompting the forecast. Related Reading: XRP To 3 Digits?

Only☑️can reply. No interest in non- ☑️replies pic.twitter.com/7a5N7Gliw8 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) February 14, 2025 The Average True Range (ATR) of 8,988 and the Average Directional Index (ADI) of 40.75, which both support a strong trend, show increased volatility in the current market conditions. Historical Patterns Paint A Cautionary Tale Since 2012, Bitcoin has developed a distinctive pattern that has captured the interest of technical experts. Within a red rising channel, the cryptocurrency has been bouncing between two crucial trendlines that serve as price barriers. Particularly intriguing is Bitcoin’s tendency toward both sharp corrections and parabolic movements. Market veterans have raised their antennae due to the striking similarities between the present rally and these previous cycles. Trading Volume Raises Red Flags The numbers tell an interesting story about how people participate in the market. There is a chance that the current rally isn’t stable because Bitcoin’s 20-period volume total of 245,600 is low compared to other breakout stages. Maintaining a long-term upward trend could be challenging in the absence of a notable increase in trade volume. For analysts watching Bitcoin’s next major move, this weak volume has been a growing concern.

Strong support is present in the $60,000 to $70,000 range, while a solid resistance zone looms between $100,000 and $120,000. If the situation worsens, Bitcoin may revisit the lower boundary of its long-term channel, which is approximately $40,000 to $50,000. Brandt’s analysis indicates that Bitcoin’s trajectory to $200,000 by 2030 is dubious in the absence of a significant break above the upper boundary of its parabolic trajectory. The veteran trader underscores the necessity of sustained momentum and the ability to surpass critical resistance levels in order to achieve such elevated valuations.

While Chainlink (LINK) and Ethereum price have faced heavy selling in the last few weeks, a new DeFi entrant based on ERC-20 has stirred the crypto market with its unique model and innovative approach. DTX Exchange is the first hybrid exchange that allows access to over 120,000 financial assets in a single place and aims to disrupt the $110 trillion global trading market. With over $14.35 million raised and over 400 million tokens sold, DTX Exchange has quickly gained recognition among retail and institutional investors. Leading analysts believe it could replicate LINK’s growth trajectory and be among the top 20 altcoins. Chainlink CCIP Now Live on Soneium Mainnet Chainlink, a leader in on-chain finance, has teamed up with Sony Block Solutions Labs, the force behind the Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain Soneium. They announced that Chainlink CCIP, Data Streams, and Data Feeds are now live on the Soneium Mainnet. This integration gives developers powerful tools to create advanced applications and drive chain innovation. With Chainlink’s technology, developers on Soneium can now build on-chain apps more efficiently and securely, making it easier to adopt Sony Block Solutions Labs’ Layer-2 solution. Johann Eid, Chainlink Labs’ Chief Business Officer, highlighted the impact of this collaboration. In September 2024, Chainlink and Sony Block Solutions Labs confirmed Soneium’s participation in the Scale program, further strengthening their partnership. Ethereum Price Holds Ground, $4,000 Soon? A market rebound on February 12th led to a 5.23% surge in the Ethereum price, which reached $2,800. However, the very next day, it lost some of its gains but successfully held above $2,600. The Ethereum price now trades above $2,700 and faces resistance at a 10-day moving average. ETH seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,750 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $2,921 swing high to the $2,524 low. Source: CoinMarketCap In the last few days, Ethereum price has performed quite well in comparison to the general market. If it is capable of getting out from the first resistance level with volume, ETH could overcome the consolidation area and reach $3,000 in the coming weeks. Some analysts suggest that Ethereum price revival is triggered due to TVL having reached a three-year high. Ethereum still holds the largest part of the market with the locked value nearly being double that of the other platforms. DTX Exchange Bonus Round: Last Opportunity? Meanwhile, the Ethereum price is still struggling to regain its previous highs. Due to massive demand, DTX Exchange has entered a bonus round. As a hybrid platform, DTX Exchange combines the benefits of centralized and decentralized exchanges and leverages the best of both solutions to allow people to trade more efficiently.

Moreover, the VulcanX blockchain will be able to execute 200,000 transactions per second, which means users won’t have to wait for their trades to be executed, even during peak times. With its presale already surpassing $14.30 million, many suggest that DTX Exchange could redefine trading standards post-launch. If it reaches Chainlink’s market cap, each DTX token will be priced at $25.12, a whopping gain of 13,855%. Join the DTX revolution before the token rallies!

Ethereum price analysis reveals uncertain trends, with ETH facing competition from leading digital assets. Developers are optimistic about future upgrades despite concerns over increased supply and network performance possibly deterring holders. The exclusion of Ripple (XRP) from Hong Kong’s regulatory framework is causing a stir, with authorities approving several cryptocurrencies but not XRP, leaving its future uncertain in this vital market. On another note, BlockDAG (BDAG) presents itself as a standout crypto with a potential for substantial gains, offering a 350% bonus through the FINALCALL700 promotion. As the presale escalates, those seeking substantial upside are securing their spots before it’s too late. Ethereum Price Analysis Shows Conflicting Trends This year has been tough for Ethereum, trailing behind its competitors in market share. The cryptocurrency has seen a modest 22% growth over the past year, while other major assets have surged ahead, casting doubts among those following Ethereum closely. Developers are hopeful that forthcoming upgrades will mitigate issues like increasing supply and high fees. However, concerns about the Ethereum Foundation’s slow response to these issues persist, with some predicting potential price drops to $2,100 if selling pressure increases. XRP’s Regulatory Challenges in Hong Kong Spark Debate XRP’s exclusion by Hong Kong’s regulators, who have given the green light to Bitcoin, Ether, and others, raises questions. The absence of XRP from the approved assets list on licensed exchanges like PantherTrade adds to the speculation about legal challenges possibly influencing the decision. This leaves market watchers pondering over XRP’s future in the region amidst stringent anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations. Despite its global presence, XRP remains unlisted in Hong Kong, making its exclusion a hot topic among those monitoring international crypto adoption. FINALCALL700: BlockDAG’s Ultimate Presale Offer Crypto enthusiasts are flocking to BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700, eager to capitalize on the 350% bonus for BDAG purchases. With the presale price currently at $0.0248 and over $195.5 million raised, this opportunity is fleeting. Those who entered earlier presales have seen gains of up to 2,380%. This bonus represents an unprecedented opportunity to maximize returns before BDAG launches on top exchanges. A $1,000 investment could grow to $4,500 in BDAG, setting the stage for significant returns once BDAG is publicly traded. With a $600M presale target in sight, the momentum is rapidly building. Presale batch 27 is moving swiftly, and many are predicting this final phase could exceed all expectations. The buzz is not just about the bonus; it’s about securing a strong position for future gains. Once BDAG is listed, the opportunity for early entry benefits will vanish. For those who missed early advantages in other projects, now’s the time to act with BlockDAG. The crypto market moves quickly, and this presale is no exception. Wise traders are securing their spots now, poised for a potentially transformative investment. Time to Take Decision! The crypto landscape continues to evolve, with Ethereum facing both challenges and potential through its ongoing developments. Meanwhile, the XRP Hong Kong regulatory exclusion leaves traders speculating about its future impact in a crucial financial center. While some assets confront hurdles, others are advancing swiftly—none more so than BlockDAG. With the FINALCALL700 offering a massive 350% bonus, BlockDAG positions itself as the top crypto for significant gains. Over $195.5 million has been raised in the crypto presale , and early participants have already seen a 2,380% ROI. Those eyeing a lucrative opportunity before BDAG hits major exchanges are acting fast. This chance won’t last forever—early entry is key to securing a substantial return.

40367494,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/solana-price-prediction-in-february-what-are-crypto-analysts-predicting-for-sol-this-month-is-500-possible,1739638864,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/40367494.jpeg,"Solana Price Prediction In February: What Are Crypto Analysts Predicting For SOL This Month, Is $500 Possible?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/solana-price-prediction-in-february-what-are-crypto-analysts-predicting-for-sol-this-month-is-500-possible,"Because of its speed, scalability and ecosystem expansion, Solana (SOL) has maintained its position as one of the most robust altcoins in the cryptocurrency market, drawing in both institutional and individual investors. Many people are unsure if SOL can keep up its trend and even hit the $500 level as February progresses. While some investors are relying on Solana's steady ascent, others are focusing on a more recent and exciting opportunity: Panshibi (SHIBI) , a meme currency that is gaining popularity quickly and has the potential to outperform Solana in terms of short-term profits. Can Solana Hit $500? Analysts Remain Divided Crypto experts are cautiously excited about Solana's possible price spike, particularly if Bitcoin's upswing persists. Most people believe that for SOL to reach $500 , institutional demand and network adoption will be necessary. Despite its solid fundamentals, Solana's price prediction has seen some optimism in recent times. Transaction costs and network congestion are two important factors that could affect Solana's price. Despite its high speed, Solana has experienced network slowdowns, which have raised questions about its long-term effectiveness. These technical difficulties can impede the quick expansion that some investors desire, even though advancements are still being made. The discussion then shifts to Panshibi (SHIBI). Panshibi is still in its infancy and offers a chance for 100x potential gains before it formally opens on major exchanges, in contrast to Solana, which has already experienced significant gains and is a rival to Ethereum. SHIBI holders may experience exponential returns, akin to early-stage meme currencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, while SOL investors anticipate a 4x-5x return. Why Are Investors Choosing Panshibi Over Solana? Investors are choosing Panshibi instead of waiting for Solana to hit $500 because of several variables. Its early entry advantage and presale growth are two of the main causes. With a modest entrance price and enormous upside potential, Panshibi's presale has already raised over $850K. Early investors in SHIBI may experience exponential gains before the token is even listed, in contrast to Solana, which currently sells at $199.12 and demands a large amount of capital for high returns. In an attempt to grab the next breakout token, investors are scrambling to buy in early at the current presale price of $0.004. Community power and the excitement surrounding meme coins are also important factors. In terms of short-term returns, community-driven meme coins can beat even the most robust initiatives, as seen by the success of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By combining DeFi apps, staking payouts and AI tools, Panshibi transcends memes while capitalising on this enthusiasm. Panshibi is quickly establishing a strong online presence and meme currencies thrive on social interaction. An active investor base and growing social media awareness could cause SHIBI's price to soar at debut. Its development potential is further enhanced by prospective major exchange listings. Analysts anticipate a huge price spike if Panshibi gets listed on Binance, Coinbase and other well-known platforms, much like earlier meme currency success stories. Panshibi still has important catalysts to come, in contrast to Solana, which is now extensively accessible. Following significant listings, SHIB and DOGE saw huge price gains; if Panshibi does the same, early investors may see big returns. Final Verdict: Is Solana The Best Bet, Or Is Panshibi The Real Opportunity? In contrast to Panshibi's breakthrough potential, Solana's price prediction is more gradual and predictable, even if it is still a great long-term project. SHIBI is becoming one of the most promising meme coins of 2025 thanks to its active presale, thriving community and accumulating speculative excitement. Instead of waiting for Solana's gradual ascent, investors seeking high-reward chances are already buying Panshibi. Although it could take months to reach, SOL would yield substantial rewards if it reached $500. Panshibi's presale expansion and impending exchange listings, on the other hand, may produce noticeably larger benefits in a far shorter period of time. For this reason, rather than depending only on Solana, more and more investors are diversifying into Panshibi.

As February progresses, many are questioning whether SOL can maintain its upward trajectory and possibly reach $500. While some investors are banking on Solana's steady climb, others are turning their attention to a newer and exciting prospect: Panshibi (SHIBI) , a meme coin that is rapidly gaining traction and could potentially outperform Solana in terms of short-term gains. Is $500 a Realistic Target for Solana? Experts Are Split There is cautious optimism among crypto analysts about a potential price surge for Solana, especially if Bitcoin's upward trend continues. Many agree that for SOL to hit $500 , a boost in institutional interest and wider network adoption will be essential. Despite strong fundamentals, recent predictions for Solana's price have been somewhat optimistic. Solana's price could be influenced by transaction costs and network congestion. Although it's known for high-speed transactions, Solana has faced slowdowns, which have sparked concerns about its long-term reliability. Such technical challenges might slow the rapid growth some investors are hoping for, even as improvements continue to be made. Attention then turns to Panshibi (SHIBI). Unlike Solana, which has already seen substantial gains and competes with Ethereum, Panshibi is still in its early stages, offering the potential for 100x returns before it officially hits major exchanges. Similar to the early days of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, SHIBI holders might see exponential returns, while those holding SOL are looking at potential 4x-5x gains. Why Is Panshibi Gaining More Attention Than Solana? Several factors are leading investors to choose Panshibi instead of waiting for Solana to reach the $500 mark. One major reason is its early entry advantage and growth during its presale. With a low entry cost and significant upside potential, Panshibi's presale has already garnered over $850K. In contrast to Solana, which is priced at $199.12 and requires considerable capital for substantial returns, early SHIBI investors could see exponential gains even before the token is listed. Investors are eager to get in on the next big token by buying early at the current presale price of $0.004. The power of community and the hype surrounding meme coins are also key factors. Community-driven meme coins can deliver impressive short-term returns, as evidenced by the success of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By integrating DeFi applications, staking rewards, and AI tools, Panshibi goes beyond just memes while tapping into this excitement. Panshibi is rapidly building a strong online presence, with meme coins thriving on social engagement. A growing social media presence and an active investor community could drive SHIBI's price upwards upon launch. Potential listings on major exchanges further boost its growth prospects. Analysts predict a significant price increase if Panshibi secures listings on platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and others, mirroring past successes of meme coins. Unlike Solana, which is widely available, Panshibi still has major catalysts on the horizon. Following large listings, SHIB and DOGE saw substantial price increases; if Panshibi follows suit, early investors could reap significant rewards. Conclusion: Is Solana the Safer Choice, or Does Panshibi Offer Greater Potential? While Solana's price forecast remains steady and foreseeable, making it a solid long-term investment, Panshibi's potential breakthrough seems more dynamic. Thanks to its active presale, vibrant community, and growing speculative interest, SHIBI is emerging as one of the most promising meme coins for 2025. Investors looking for high-return opportunities are gravitating towards Panshibi instead of waiting for Solana's gradual rise. Reaching $500 would indeed offer substantial returns for SOL, though it might take time. Meanwhile, Panshibi's presale growth and upcoming exchange listings could deliver significantly greater benefits in a much shorter timeframe. This is why many investors are diversifying into Panshibi rather than relying solely on Solana.

Many now say that a similar rise could come for Remittix , a new PayFi star with a target price of $0.0599. Investors watch these trends as signs of a shift toward tokens that solve real problems. Remittixoffers a practical fix for global payments and smooth crypto-to-FIAT transfers. Both projects have strong fundamentals and clear use cases. Many believe they are among the best cryptos to buy. Cardano Price: A Steady Climb with Solid Fundamentals Cardano has built a strong reputation for security and careful development. Experts like Ali Charts claim that the Cardano price is breaking out, with a potential to reach $0.83 if momentum holds. This is believed to be the first step towards an even bigger rally in 2025. It is believed that Cardano Price could reach $5 by the end of this year. This prediction comes from Cardano's steady progress and a growing ecosystem of smart contracts and decentralized apps. Analysts note that if network upgrades continue and more projects join Cardano's platform, the token could see steady growth. Investors use Cardano Price predictions as a guide when they add ADA to their portfolios. Many view ADA as a solid asset for long-term value because of its stable design and active community. Its reputation among developers and institutions makes Cardano a favored pick among the best cryptos to buy. Remittix: A New DeFi Project with Real-World Impact Remittix is a new altcoin that offers a solution to slow and costly international payments. Instead of dealing with many middlemen, Remittix connects crypto and traditional finance with its PayFisystem. This system allows users to send money in a simple way, giving recipients faster access to cash. Remittix tackles the problem of lengthy transfers and high fees that many face when using banks. Its technology keeps costs low and speeds up transactions. The project has sold over 458 million tokens during its ICO. Early investors have seen over 200% gains, and some experts predict that Remittix could grow even further. Its current DeFi coin price of around $0.0598 gives many a good chance to enter early. Remittix makes crypto-to-fiat transfers easier by keeping user control and privacy. This new solution can help millions of people without bank accounts send money easily. In many regions, people rely on services like Western Union to receive cash. Remittix could allow users to move funds directly to a digital wallet and then withdraw cash at local banks or money transfer agents. Remittix also aims to support individuals who want to keep the true nature of cryptography. It gives users full control over their assets while tying them into modern finance. This project works as a bridge between fast, private digital transactions and the old ways of handling money. With a clear real-world purpose, Remittix shows how blockchain can solve daily payment challenges. Many experts now see it as one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term growth. Investors who study Cardano Price predictions and compare them with Remittix’s progress often conclude that both tokens have promise. While Cardano continues to offer steady growth and a strong community, Remittix delivers practical solutions that can bring dramatic improvements to global payments. Its potential to ease cross-border transactions could lead to a significant market shift. In a time when many digital currencies struggle with adoption, Remittix gives a glimpse of how real-world finance can benefit from crypto technology. As more people turn to digital finance, tokens that solve real problems gain an edge. Cardano offers a steady climb with a solid network, while Remittix stands out with its real-world impact. Both tokens show that careful development and clear use cases can drive lasting value. Investors who focus on fundamentals and practical solutions may find a bright future ahead for these projects.

The meme coin has seen tidal waves of speculation in past bull cycles, with many believing. Yet, another massive run could be looming, especially now that Elon Musk actively supports DOGE. But while Dogecoin dreamers plot a course for $3, one crypto is quietly taking center stage: FXGuys ($FXG). The new DeFi token, focused on actual utility rather than hype, promises 20x gains in a run for $1.

On-chain data also reflects large whale accumulation, a pattern normally seen before big breakouts. According to an analyst, DOGE’s next stop could be over $3 . However, one question remains: Can Dogecoin sustain such a high valuation when its utility is limited to tipping and payments?

She has been a strong proponent of integrating Bitcoin into national economic policy, with her most significant initiative being the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve , aimed at enhancing financial stability. Recently, she was appointed chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, a key position in shaping Bitcoin-related regulations. At Bitcoin 2025 , Lummis will discuss Bitcoin’s role in financial reserves, U.S. policy, and regulatory developments. Ticket prices are set to rise this Friday, but a special Valentine’s Day promotion offers a discount with the code BTCBAY . Reflecting on Bitcoin 2024 , Lummis shared her surprise when President Trump publicly endorsed the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve before she even spoke. His support indicated a major shift in policy discussions, reinforcing Bitcoin’s potential role in the U.S. economy. Trump has since remained a strong advocate, even proposing a sovereign wealth fund based on Bitcoin. Lummis is also spearheading a newly established Senate subcommittee on digital assets. While key policymakers, including Chairman Tim Scott, the Treasury Secretary, and the Vice President, acknowledge digital assets' importance, many lawmakers still need education on Bitcoin. To address this, she is prioritizing a stablecoin bill to lay the groundwork for more comprehensive digital asset legislation. One of the major challenges facing Bitcoin businesses is Operation Chokepoint 2.0 , where financial institutions were pressured to cut ties with crypto-related companies. Lummis is leading efforts in the Senate to investigate these actions and ensure protections against future disruptions. On the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, discussions are ongoing about whether Trump could use executive action if Congress resists the proposal. The U.S. government already holds approximately 200,000 BTC from asset seizures, managed by the U.S. Marshals. Lummis is proposing that these holdings be transferred to the Treasury as the foundation for the Bitcoin reserve. Additionally, she is exploring whether outdated U.S. gold certificates could be revalued and converted into Bitcoin. State-level initiatives are also gaining momentum. Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin are actively considering the creation of state-based Bitcoin reserves. Internationally, the UAE and other nations are looking into similar strategies, increasing global interest in Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold.” By Bitcoin 2025 , Lummis expects tangible progress. With regulatory obstacles being exposed and state-level Bitcoin reserves moving forward, Bitcoin’s position in the global financial system will strengthen. While some policymakers remain skeptical due to Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, Lummis believes it can support the U.S. dollar and reduce national debt over time . She looks forward to Bitcoin 2025, where the focus will shift from ""what could be"" to ""what is.""",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-15 17:06:27

He is under investigation for allegedly violating federal tax laws after relocating to Puerto Rico, which is largely recognized as a tax haven. Pantera Founder Leveraging on Puerto Rico’s Tax Haven Status Following his move to Puerto Rico five years ago, the US Senate Finance Committee (SFC) requested that the Pantera Founder provide information on over $850 million in investment profits that he earned. At the time, an ongoing investigation focused on people taking advantage of the special tax break in Puerto Rico to evade their financial obligations. Noteworthy, the said special tax break goes as far as reducing taxes of the island residents to zero. In the letter sent on January 9, Oregon Democrat Senator Ron Wyden hinted that the Pantera Capital managing partner may have treated these profits as exempt from US taxes. Unfortunately, “the majority of the gain is actually U.S. source income, reportable on U.S. tax returns, and subject to U.S. tax,” the letter said. Wealthy Individuals Attempt to Evade Tax Before now, tax regulators had caught wind of wealthy individuals’ strategies to evade tax. Investigation into some of these strategies intensified after Sen Wyden took over as chairman of the Finance Committee. For now, it is not certain what the investigation will reveal but it is worth noting that with Donald Trump’s inauguration, regulators have become less aggressive towards crypto projects. In response to the accusations against him, Morehead clarified that he moved to the Caribbean island in 2021 and not 2020, as was earlier suggested. The Pantera founder further insinuated that he had not violated any tax law. “I believe I acted appropriately with respect to my taxes,” he declared. Zero Capital Gains Tax For Crypto in the US As part of the less-stringent approach of the Trump administration towards cryptocurrencies, Eric Trump announced the introduction of zero capital gains tax for certain digital assets. Others that are not based in the US will be required to pay approximately 30% capital gain tax. This tax incentive is a way to encourage innovation in the sector. Senator Ted Cruz is also working on a Congressional Review Act resolution that would overturn an existing IRS rule on crypto tax . The IRS rule requires Decentralized Finance (DeFI) brokers to provide user data, including their names and addresses, and report gross proceeds.

I think he should take some responsibility for this matter, calling on the criminals to return the funds to the victims and take the relevant legal responsibilities.

NFTs were hot in 2021, but the market became increasingly saturated. Sales plummetted, but showed signs of a comeback in October. But with thousands of projects flooding the space, many that lack unique value propositions, buyers have seemingly grown more cautious about speculative investments. The initial hype-driven boom of NFTs, fueled by high-profile endorsements — including a series of photo-shopped images hyped by Donald Trump while he was campaigning — has begun to fade. Many early adopters have grown disillusioned with projects that failed to deliver long-term value, while others face the reality of unsustainable valuations. As a result, interest in NFT trading has slowed, especially as economic uncertainty—including rising inflation and recession fears—has caused consumers to pull back from speculative assets. Despite these challenges, the NFT space is evolving. There is growing interest in NFTs with real utility, particularly those tied to the metaverse and gaming ecosystems, suggesting the market is shifting towards more functional assets rather than speculative collectibles. While the market cools, quality over quantity is becoming the defining factor for future NFT success.

The team behind the project announced the update on X on Valentine’s Day, noting that it marks the project’s transition. In its post , the SafeMoon team said the shift to memecoin is part of a decentralization effort that hands over the project to the community. By becoming a memecoin, there will be no expectations or roadmap, and community sentiment will fully drive the token. The team chose Solana as its new base because the network is synonymous with memecoins and the best place for its planned SafeMoon memecoin. It said: “Solana is the home of all memes, the blockchain where culture thrives. If SafeMoon is going to live up to its true potential as a pure community-driven meme, there’s no better place for it.” Meanwhile, the project noted that choosing the memecoin path means SafeMoon will not have a central team or utility. However, it added that the community can still build on SafeMoon as they wish and integrate the token in all the ways they want. SafeMoon’s checkered past The switch from the original SafeMoon path appears to be an attempt by the new team behind the project to save it from oblivion. It was one of the hottest crypto projects of the 2021 bull run when its market cap reached $17 billion. However, its SFM token has become almost worthless since then, with a market cap of around $20 million. Its crash was due to several exchanges delisting the token after reports emerged that its founders were manipulating its price and siphoning supposedly locked funds. In 2023, the Department of Justice charged its executive team with fraud, accusing them of withdrawing over $200 million for locked project funds to use for personal gains. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also charged the team for violating securities law, describing its SFM token as an unregistered security. The original team behind SafeMoon filed for bankruptcy in late 2023, and VGX Foundation acquired the project. VGX Foundation claims it is working to revive the project and ensure the community can build something new. Memecoin launch delayed so SFM v2 holders can swap their tokens Meanwhile, the SafeMoon memecoin launch has now been delayed due to the team not releasing the contract for the memecoin. According to the team , the contract address has not been made public because it is still working to ensure the SFM v2 swap is fully automated when it goes live. Part of its plan for the memecoin transition is to allow holders of SFM v2 to swap their tokens 1:1 for the memecoin. However, it acknowledged that the swap tech still needs some work. The team also explained that it could not airdrop the memecoin to SFM v2 holders because the v2 contract is on the BSC network. As for holders holding SFM v1 tokens, the project noted that it would get to them later. Since the memecoin contract has not been released, SafeMoon has warned users that any SafeMoon it finds on Solana is fake and likely a scam. It said: “And let’s be crystal clear: the contract is NOT public yet. If you’re buying a “SafeMoon” on Solana (or anywhere else) right now, you ARE getting scammed. Wait for us to drop the official contract address. Don’t get rekt. ⚠️” Meanwhile, the SafeMoon team has burned 2.2 trillion SFM tokens on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon networks.

With its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization, Rexas Finance stands out as a market disruptor capable of delivering 15x returns, far surpassing Ethereum. Investors looking for affordable tokens with strong fundamentals should consider Rexas Finance, alongside Dogecoin, Bonk, PEPE, and Fantom, as the best opportunities before they surge in value. Dogecoin(DOGE): The Established Meme Token with Growth Potential The crypto world now takes Dogecoin seriously after its initial setup as a joke. The present market value of $0.3541 and a market capitalization exceeding $53.06 billion demonstrate solid market performance. The substantial support of its large community and notable endorsements from prominent figures promote both the adoption and utility of Dogecoin. The current market statistics indicate that Dogecoin traces the same trajectory it followed during its 2021 price surge. Prophecies from analysts indicate Dogecoin will possibly exceed its peak value at $0.73 up to $4 during 2025. The rising popularity of merchants using Dogecoin and its functionality in small transactions promotes its projected cost appreciation. The success of Dogecoin depends on the growing popularity of meme coins within the crypto market. A sustained bull trend for Dogecoin might establish it as a leading player in the altcoin marketplace. Price watchers should follow Dogecoin's movement when looking at secure meme tokens. Bonk(BONK): The Solana-Powered Meme Coin Gaining Traction Meme coin competition now centres on Bonk, as this token exploits Solana blockchain features that enable high-speed deals at discounted charges. With a market cap of $2.36 billion, Bonk offers its tokens at the price of $0.000003091. The Solana DeFi ecosystem allows users to stake and automatically earn rewards. The token’s deflationary model ensures scarcity, strengthening its long-term price potential.

While Ethereum (ETH) has historically led the charge in DeFi, smart contracts, and dApps, Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption and growing market confidence have made it the preferred choice among whale investors. As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates between $94,000 and $100,000, Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to hold above $2,690, sparking concerns that it may continue to lose market share. Analysts are now questioning whether Ethereum (ETH) will maintain its dominance, or if new blockchain projects like Coldware (COLD) will capitalize on this shift. Coldware (COLD) Attracts Former ETH and BTC Whales As Ethereum (ETH) struggles, Coldware (COLD) has emerged as an alternative blockchain attracting major investors from both the Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystems. With its scalability, energy-efficient PoS consensus, and interoperability with DeFi applications, Coldware (COLD) has positioned itself as a serious competitor to Ethereum (ETH). One of Coldware (COLD) ’s key advantages over Ethereum (ETH) is its low gas fees and high transaction speed, which make it a more efficient choice for developers and DeFi protocols. Ethereum (ETH) continues to suffer from network congestion and high gas costs, making it difficult for smaller investors and projects to thrive. Ethereum (ETH) Price Faces Resistance Amid Market Uncertainty Ethereum (ETH) recently saw a 3% recovery after facing rejection at the $3,000 level. Despite this short-term bounce, market indicators suggest that Ethereum (ETH) is still under pressure. The RSI remains below the neutral 50 level, indicating a lack of strong buying momentum. Meanwhile, whale transactions have decreased, signaling a possible rotation of capital away from Ethereum (ETH). Bitcoin (BTC), on the other hand, continues to hold above key psychological levels, maintaining stronger momentum compared to Ethereum (ETH). With macro conditions favoring Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation, Ethereum (ETH) is facing an uphill battle to retain investor confidence. Ethereum (ETH) At Risk Of Losing DeFi Market Share to Coldware (COLD) Ethereum (ETH) still dominates the DeFi market, but competitors like Coldware (COLD) and Layer-1 alternatives are beginning to challenge its supremacy. If Ethereum (ETH) fails to implement long-term scalability solutions, it risks being overtaken by newer blockchain networks that offer cheaper and faster transactions. With Ethereum (ETH) now at a critical price level, investors will be watching to see whether it can regain its position against Bitcoin (BTC). Meanwhile, Coldware (COLD) continues to attract whale capital, proving that Ethereum (ETH) is not the only option for DeFi and blockchain innovation.

Historically, Ethereum has been at the forefront of innovations like DeFi, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. However, Bitcoin's rising institutional backing and the increasing trust it commands in the market have led whale investors to favor it more. While Bitcoin (BTC) shows resilience, fluctuating between $94,000 and $100,000, Ethereum (ETH) is finding it challenging to stay above the $2,690 threshold, raising alarms about its potential to lose market ground. Experts now debate whether Ethereum can maintain its stronghold or if emerging blockchain ventures like Coldware (COLD) will seize the opportunity of this shift. Coldware (COLD) Captivates Ex-ETH and BTC Whales As Ethereum (ETH) faces challenges, Coldware (COLD) has emerged as a promising blockchain alternative, drawing significant investors from the Ethereum and Bitcoin realms. With its scalable solutions, eco-friendly PoS consensus, and seamless integration with DeFi applications, Coldware is establishing itself as a formidable contender against Ethereum. A major benefit of Coldware (COLD) over Ethereum is its minimal gas fees and rapid transaction capabilities, offering a more attractive option for developers and DeFi projects. Ethereum, meanwhile, continues to grapple with network bottlenecks and steep gas charges, posing challenges for smaller investors and initiatives. Ethereum (ETH) Struggles with Market Resistance Ethereum (ETH) recently managed a 3% rebound after being turned back at the $3,000 mark. Despite this slight recovery, market signals point to ongoing challenges. The RSI remains under 50, reflecting weak buying interest, while a reduction in whale activity suggests capital may be shifting away from Ethereum. In contrast, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to uphold crucial psychological benchmarks, showing more robust momentum than Ethereum. With macroeconomic factors positioning Bitcoin as a safeguard against inflation, Ethereum finds itself striving harder to win back investor trust. Coldware (COLD) Poses a Threat to Ethereum's DeFi Leadership Although Ethereum (ETH) currently leads the DeFi sector, challengers like Coldware (COLD) and other Layer-1 solutions are starting to contest its top spot. If Ethereum does not address its scalability issues soon, it could be surpassed by newer blockchain systems that offer more affordable and quicker transactions. As Ethereum finds itself at a crucial price point, all eyes are on whether it can bounce back against Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Coldware (COLD) continues to lure large-scale investments, proving that Ethereum is not the sole player in the DeFi and blockchain innovation arena.

Currently, the company meets all eligibility requirements except one: achieving positive GAAP net income over the trailing 12 months (the most recent four quarters combined). To qualify, Q1 2025 earnings must be high enough to offset losses from the previous three quarters—a goal that could be achieved thanks to the adoption (now mandatory) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) digital asset accounting rule. The FASB rule change requires companies to recognize bitcoin (BTC) holdings at fair value, meaning price gains will flow through to the bottom line (as would price declines). Prior to this rule, corporate digital asset holders were required to account for holdings at their weakest levels. Strategy, for example, in the fourth quarter of 2024 still valued its bitcoin at less than $16,000 per token, leading to a $1 billion impairment loss even as bitcoin closed the year at about $94,000. Holy Grail According to an analysis by Richard Hass on X, assuming Strategy holdings don't change between now and March 31, bitcoin must close the first quarter above $96,337 for the company to meet the positive trailing 12-month earnings requirement. “Based on Q4 2024 earnings of -$671 million in net income MSTR requires $1.113B in Q1 2025 earnings to produce positive earnings in the prior four quarters and become eligible for S&P 500,"" he wrote. ""Based on MSTR's current treasury of 478,740 BTC, the required BTC price on March 31 to achieve this is $96,337”. If bitcoin prices remain strong and MSTR continues accumulating tokens, S&P 500 inclusion is within reach. Said Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer: “MSTR’s adoption of the amended FASB guidance strengthens its case for S&P 500 inclusion. Given its outperformance of every current index constituent over four years, exclusion would be surprising.” “While joining the Nasdaq-100 was significant, the S&P 500 is the holy grail,"" continued Palmer."" Inclusion would validate its Bitcoin strategy, as all S&P 500 index funds would hold MSTR shares, indirectly exposing investors to Bitcoin.”Disclaimer: Richard Hass's original X post was made before Strategy's latest bitcoin purchase.

As Ondo Finance (ONDO) ventures into Sui (SUI) to advance its high-grade RWA solutions, Coldware (COLD) is taking a different path, utilizing its decentralized infrastructure to improve tokenized assets and blockchain-based financial services. Ondo Finance (ONDO) has shown remarkable resilience in a fluctuating market, with a market cap of $1.87 billion and a notable $714 million in trading volume over 24 hours. However, Sui (SUI) is grappling with liquidity issues, raising doubts about its capacity for sustained growth. Coldware (COLD) , in contrast, is quickly establishing itself as a formidable competitor, presenting a more robust, scalable, and investor-friendly ecosystem that could transform the future of RWAs. Coldware (COLD) Introduces a Mobile-First Strategy to Compete with Sui (SUI) and Ondo Finance (ONDO) While Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Sui (SUI) center their efforts on institutional RWA solutions, Coldware (COLD) is shaking up the sector by launching a decentralized mobile blockchain for RWA transactions.

As regulatory scrutiny around Tether (USDT) transactions intensifies, concerns about Tron (TRX)’s reliance on stablecoins are rising. If government restrictions on USDT tighten, Tron (TRX) could see significant outflows, forcing traders and institutions to seek a more stable and future-proof blockchain. Coldware (COLD) is positioned to capture this market shift, offering fast transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization without dependence on a single stablecoin. Coldware (COLD) vs. Tron (TRX): A Secure Blockchain for the Future For years, Tron (TRX) has dominated the stablecoin transfer market, processing billions of dollars in USDT transactions daily. However, recent bans and restrictions on USDT in certain jurisdictions have put Tron (TRX) at risk, leading to increased withdrawals and potential instability. Coldware (COLD) offers a more diverse and scalable blockchain ecosystem, providing security, decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization without the risks associated with USDT. Unlike Tron (TRX), which is heavily reliant on stablecoin activity, Coldware (COLD) is built for broader blockchain applications, ensuring long-term growth without being affected by a single regulatory decision. The Risk of USDT Bans and Its Impact on Tron (TRX) The growing concerns surrounding Tether (USDT) have created uncertainty for Tron (TRX) holders, as many regulatory bodies are pushing for stricter control over stablecoin transfers. If these restrictions expand, Tron (TRX) could experience further withdrawal volumes, weakening its position as a leader in the stablecoin transfer market. Coldware (COLD) provides a crucial advantage in this uncertain environment. Unlike Tron (TRX), which depends on stablecoins for high network activity, Coldware (COLD) is designed to support multi-functional blockchain applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized real-world assets (RWA), and mobile blockchain integration. This broader use case ensures that Coldware (COLD) remains relevant regardless of regulatory changes in the stablecoin market. Coldware (COLD) Provides a Secure Alternative to Tron (TRX) As Tron (TRX) faces uncertainty, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a more secure and stable alternative. Unlike Tron (TRX), which depends on USDT transactions, Coldware (COLD) offers a decentralized ecosystem designed for mass adoption, regulatory compliance, and high-speed transactions. The Coldware (COLD) network provides key advantages, including: Scalability – While Tron (TRX) experiences congestion due to heavy stablecoin use, Coldware (COLD) maintains fast and efficient transaction processing even under high demand. Regulatory Compliance – Coldware (COLD) is designed to adapt to global regulations, ensuring long-term stability without the risks that Tron (TRX) faces from USDT-related restrictions. Diversified Use Cases – Unlike Tron (TRX), which relies primarily on stablecoin transactions, Coldware (COLD) supports real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, DeFi applications, and mobile blockchain integration. Low Transaction Costs – As regulatory pressure mounts, Tron (TRX) users may face increasing transaction fees and limitations, whereas Coldware (COLD) ensures cost-effective blockchain interactions. Could Tron (TRX) Lose Its Edge in 2025? The future of Tron (TRX) is now tied to the fate of USDT, making its long-term prospects uncertain. If stablecoin regulations continue to tighten, Tron (TRX) may lose a significant portion of its user base, forcing investors to seek alternative blockchain networks with greater security and sustainability. Coldware (COLD) offers a compelling solution, positioning itself as a leading blockchain for both institutional and retail investors. With its scalable infrastructure, real-world blockchain applications, and secure DeFi ecosystem, Coldware (COLD) is poised to overtake Tron (TRX) as a top blockchain for decentralized finance and tokenized assets. While Tron (TRX) remains a key player in the blockchain space, its heavy dependence on USDT transactions makes it vulnerable to regulatory crackdowns. Coldware (COLD) , on the other hand, offers a more resilient and adaptive ecosystem, making it an attractive option for those seeking long-term stability and high-speed blockchain functionality. Final Thoughts: Coldware (COLD) Emerges as a Stronger Alternative As Tron (TRX) faces increasing withdrawal risks, Coldware (COLD) is stepping in as a more scalable, secure, and regulation-proof blockchain. With Tron (TRX) tied to the fate of USDT, Coldware (COLD)’s diversified approach makes it the smarter choice for investors and developers looking for long-term growth. With high scalability, compliance-ready infrastructure, and a focus on mobile blockchain adoption, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a leading force in the blockchain industry—ready to replace unstable networks like Tron (TRX) in the coming years.

As regulatory bodies heighten scrutiny over Tether (USDT) transactions, concerns about Tron (TRX)'s dependency on stablecoins are growing. Should the government impose stricter regulations on USDT, Tron (TRX) might experience significant withdrawals, prompting traders and institutions to seek more stable and future-ready blockchain solutions. Coldware (COLD) is well-positioned to benefit from this shift, offering rapid transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi) options, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization without relying on a single stablecoin. Coldware (COLD) vs. Tron (TRX): Securing the Blockchain's Future Tron (TRX) has long been a leader in the stablecoin transfer space, handling billions in USDT transactions daily. However, recent USDT bans in certain areas have put Tron (TRX) in a precarious position, leading to increased withdrawals and potential volatility. Coldware (COLD) provides a more versatile and scalable blockchain ecosystem, offering security, DeFi tools, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization without the risks tied to USDT. Unlike Tron (TRX), which heavily relies on stablecoin activities, Coldware (COLD) is designed for a wider range of blockchain applications, ensuring sustainable growth unaffected by any single regulatory change. The Threat of USDT Restrictions and Their Impact on Tron (TRX) Growing concerns over Tether (USDT) have cast doubts for Tron (TRX) investors, as many regulatory authorities push for stricter oversight of stablecoin transfers. If these restrictions become more widespread, Tron (TRX) could see further withdrawal activity, undermining its dominance in stablecoin transfers. Coldware (COLD) offers a significant advantage in this uncertain climate. Unlike Tron (TRX), which depends on stablecoins for high network activity, Coldware (COLD) is engineered to support a variety of blockchain applications, including DeFi, tokenized real-world assets (RWA), and mobile blockchain integration. This broad applicability ensures that Coldware (COLD) remains relevant regardless of regulatory developments in the stablecoin sector. Coldware (COLD): A Stable Alternative to Tron (TRX) In light of uncertainties facing Tron (TRX), Coldware (COLD) emerges as a more secure and stable option. Unlike Tron (TRX), which hinges on USDT transactions, Coldware (COLD) provides a decentralized ecosystem crafted for mass adoption, regulatory adherence, and swift transactions. The Coldware (COLD) network offers key benefits, including: Scalability – While Tron (TRX) faces congestion from heavy stablecoin use, Coldware (COLD) ensures quick and efficient transaction processing even during peak times. Regulatory Compliance – Coldware (COLD) is designed to align with global regulations, offering long-term stability without the risks Tron (TRX) faces from USDT-related limitations. Diversified Applications – Unlike Tron (TRX), which mainly depends on stablecoin transactions, Coldware (COLD) supports real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, DeFi, and mobile blockchain integration. Low Transaction Fees – As regulatory pressure increases, Tron (TRX) users might face higher fees and restrictions, while Coldware (COLD) ensures affordable blockchain interactions. Will Tron (TRX) Maintain Its Advantage by 2025? The outlook for Tron (TRX) is now linked to USDT's future, making its long-term prospects uncertain. As regulations around stablecoins tighten, Tron (TRX) could see a significant decrease in its user base, prompting investors to look for more secure and sustainable blockchain networks. Coldware (COLD) presents a persuasive alternative, positioning itself as a premier blockchain for both institutional and retail investors. With its robust infrastructure, practical blockchain applications, and secure DeFi environment, Coldware (COLD) is set to surpass Tron (TRX) as a leading blockchain for decentralized finance and tokenized assets. Though Tron (TRX) remains influential in the blockchain industry, its heavy reliance on USDT transactions leaves it susceptible to regulatory disruptions. Coldware (COLD) , conversely, offers a resilient and flexible ecosystem, making it an appealing choice for those seeking long-term stability and swift blockchain capabilities. Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) as a Prominent Alternative As Tron (TRX) faces increasing risks of withdrawal, Coldware (COLD) stands out as a more scalable, secure, and regulation-resistant blockchain. With Tron (TRX) linked to the uncertainties of USDT, Coldware (COLD)'s diversified approach makes it a wiser choice for investors and developers seeking long-term growth.

According to him, these companies could easily establish their blockchain infrastructure once they achieve regulatory clarity. Cardano Founder Reveals How Tech Companies Can Replace L1s While speaking on an X space , Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson explained that tech companies like Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon could become competitors to top Layer-1 projects once the stablecoin bill passes. Hoskinson suggested that these tech companies could move to establish their blockchain infrastructure once there is regulatory clarity in the country. He gave an example of these companies issuing their stablecoins or partnering with a company like Circle to achieve this. Hoskinson also highlighted Apple’s ‘Apple Pay’ and Google’s ‘Google Pay’ to show how these companies are in a good position to compete with these layer-1 networks. The Cardano founder also noted that these companies are in a good position to overtake these networks since they already have billions of users and control the operating systems that run on phones. As such, he believes this would be the next wave of competition the crypto space will face. Hoskinson added that he envisages these companies could go as far as creating their Layer-1 networks. He gave an instance of how Meta already tried to venture into the crypto space in the past but failed due to a lack of clear regulations. As such, there is the possibility that they could make such a move again once Congress passes pending crypto bills. These Companies Won’t Pass Up The Opportunity The Cardano founder noted that, based on his sources, the US Congress could pass the stablecoin bill in the next 100 days. He believes that companies like Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Apple will not pass up the opportunity to expand their operations into the crypto market when the bill passes. He remarked that there is no way that layer-1 networks could compete with these companies since they have a larger network of users and the necessary licenses to expand their business into the crypto space. Hoskinson also highlighted the fact that these companies could easily block users’ access to these networks in a bid to win them over. The Cardano founder said believes this is very possible since these companies, with their infrastructure, are already a gateway to accessing these Layer-1 networks. As part of the unfair practices that these companies could adopt, Hoskinson also raised the possibility of them deciding to stop running nodes for these networks, which could alter the operations of these Layer-1s. Hoskinson also highlighted how these tech companies have the edge over L1s with their confidential computing. On the other hand, these blockchains operate within second-generation trust-execution environments which are less reliable. Hoskinson’s bold statements come just days after he hinted at a potential partnership with Microsoft . This has sparked a bullish outlook for the ADA price, with projections that the crypto could rally to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.10.

Currently priced at just $0.0045, Coldware (COLD) is making waves as a high-growth alternative to established networks like Tron (TRX), which faces increasing challenges in 2025. While Tron (TRX) has dominated the stablecoin and DeFi space, Coldware (COLD) ’s recent advancements in scalability and real-world blockchain integration are positioning it as a superior solution for developers and investors alike. Coldware (COLD) Set to Overtake Tron (TRX) in 2025 Tron (TRX) has long been a staple of the cryptocurrency industry, but its reliance on stablecoin transactions and high-fee trading volume is putting its future at risk. Coldware (COLD) offers a more efficient, secure, and decentralized alternative, with faster transactions, lower costs, and an expanding ecosystem that is attracting both institutional and retail investors. Recent data shows that large holders of Tron (TRX) have increased their net inflows by 160%, signaling a potential price rally past $0.23. However, this growth remains tied to the success of stablecoins like USDT, which face increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide. If governments impose stricter regulations on stablecoin transfers, Tron (TRX) could experience major withdrawals, further limiting its growth potential. Meanwhile, Coldware (COLD) continues to gain traction with its robust transaction architecture and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Its innovative freeze.mint platform is attracting developers looking for a more efficient way to launch digital assets without the congestion and fees associated with older blockchains like Tron (TRX). Tron (TRX) Faces Increasing Pressure as Coldware (COLD) Gains Adoption One of the biggest challenges for Tron (TRX) is its reliance on a single revenue model. While it has processed billions in stablecoin transfers, its ecosystem lacks diversity, making it vulnerable to market shifts. Coldware (COLD) v, in contrast, is building a multi-functional blockchain that integrates DeFi, real-world asset tokenization, and scalable dApps—all without relying on a single token or transaction type. Coldware (COLD) also eliminates many of the barriers faced by older Layer-1 blockchains, ensuring that developers can build applications without suffering from network congestion, high fees, or centralized governance. This forward-thinking approach makes Coldware (COLD) a strong candidate to eclipse Tron (TRX) in the coming months. Could Coldware (COLD) Be the Next Major Layer-1 Blockchain? With Coldware (COLD) currently trading at just $0.0045, early investors have a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potential 10,000X blockchain revolution. As the market continues to shift toward more scalable and cost-effective networks, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a clear frontrunner in the race for blockchain dominance. Tron (TRX) may continue to see short-term gains, especially as whales accumulate more tokens, but its long-term growth depends heavily on the fate of USDT and the regulatory environment surrounding stablecoins. If Coldware (COLD) continues its rapid adoption and development, it could very well eclipse Tron (TRX) as a top Layer-1 network. Investors looking for the next high-growth blockchain project should pay close attention to Coldware (COLD). With its cutting-edge technology, strong ecosystem, and focus on real-world applications, Coldware (COLD) is shaping up to be one of the most significant disruptors in the blockchain space—one that could leave Tron (TRX) struggling to keep up.

Recent figures indicate that large Tron (TRX) holders have increased their net inflows by 160%, suggesting a potential price surge beyond $0.23. However, this growth is closely tied to the fortunes of stablecoins such as USDT, which are under increasing regulatory scrutiny globally.

In contrast, Coldware (COLD) is gaining momentum with its solid transaction infrastructure and DeFi solutions. Its innovative freeze.mint platform is drawing developers seeking a more efficient way to launch digital assets without the congestion and fees typical of older blockchains like Tron (TRX). Tron (TRX) Under Pressure as Coldware (COLD) Gains Momentum One of the main difficulties for Tron (TRX) is its dependence on a single revenue stream.

SWIB doubled its holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust to over 6 million. Wisconsin Pension Fund Boosts Bitcoin ETF Stake A Feb. 14 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reveals that the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, the entity overseeing the state’s pension fund, now owns over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fund, worth $335.9 million as of press time. The SWIB in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a Bitcoin ETF purchase, disclosing it had bought shares from both the BlackRock and Grayscale Bitcoin exchange-traded funds collectively worth $164 million at the time. However, Friday’s filing shows that the fund no longer holds any position in Grayscale’s BTC ETF. IBIT has swiftly become one of the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, accumulating a staggering $40 billion in net inflows since it went live in January 2024. The fund’s assets under management reached $56 billion as of Friday. Increasing Exposure To Bitcoin Although Bitcoin is infamous for its high volatility, institutional investors have a long time horizon for their investments, which allows them to enjoy long-term price gains while disregarding short-term bearish price action. Notably, Bitcoin is emerging as a notable contender to traditional reserve assets like gold and the U.S. dollar, with the potential to transform the global monetary order. Under the new Donald Trump regime, the conversation around Bitcoin has shifted dramatically. Once skeptical, President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for Bitcoin as a strategic asset, outlining plans for the creation of a U.S. digital asset stockpile to boost economic stability. It’s worth mentioning that other U.S. pension funds are also purchasing crypto exposure. Last year, for example, the State of Michigan Retirement System reported that it had acquired shares in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. And earlier this week, Goldman Sachs disclosed its holdings of more than $1.5 billion in US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , including around $1.2 billion in BlackRock’s IBIT.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-15 17:45:51

The FDIC says Truist Bank employee Danielle Solomon unilaterally made two Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers totaling $21,618 from a customer’s account to pay her husband Jesse’s Citibank credit card debt. The victim is more than 80 years-old. The FDIC says Danielle admitted to initiating the ACH transactions but claimed she had discussed them with the victim. She was fired the same day. The FDIC’s formal enforcement action against Danielle alleges that she also initiated other unauthorized transactions. On February 10th of 2021, for instance, Danielle allegedly accessed another elderly customer’s account, and wired out $230,000 to the Polk County Clerk of Courts without authorization. “The February 10, 2021, wire was used to fund a bidding account for back tax properties in the name of Jesse Solomon in Polk County, Florida. Jesse Solomon requested a refund from the bidding account for the full amount of funds transferred. As a result, $230,000 of funds originating from the account of J.H. were refunded from the bidding account to Respondent’s [Danielle] husband, Jesse Solomon.” The FDIC further says that Danielle had on January 27th of 2020 made a wire transfer of $108,000 from J.L.’s account to a pass-through account. About $107,960 was later moved from the pass-through account to her husband’s E*TRADE Bank account. The investigations also found that five ACH transactions of $14,450 were done from J.L.’s account between June 8th of 2020 and January 4th of 2021 to pay her husband’s Citibank credit card balances. Transactions linked to J.L.’s account allegedly continued even after the bank fired Danielle. “On March 12, 2021, Respondent [Danielle] deposited $21,618.31 into J.H.’s account. On April 7, 2021, a check deposit of $232,548.36 was attempted from J.H.’s own Merrill Lynch account into J.H.’s account at the Haines City branch of the Bank [in Florida].” According to the FDIC, Danielle caused Truist Bank a total loss of $374,068. The regulator is seeking to compel her to pay $352,450 in restitution and ban her from working in the banking industry without prior regulatory approval. Danielle has 20 days to respond to the enforcement action and request a hearing.

Despite this, the XRP recovery potential remains a hot topic among investors looking for signs of a rebound. On the other hand, VeChain (VET) faces its own set of challenges, with its price dipping significantly. The VET price prediction hinges on its ability to weather the recent storm and recover in a volatile market. Seeing such volatility, the crypto presale market sees huge growth potential—especially for BlockDAG (BDAG) crypto holders. Its presale is about to hit $200 million, plus its mega 350% bonus has diverted traders from relying on volatile coins to buying more secure coins like BDAG that hold potential for big gains. But this bonus is ending soon, and seeing such high demand, BDAG value is about to surge, positioning early adopters among the top crypto gainers. XRP Recovery Potential: Can it Overcome $2.70 Hurdle? XRP recently saw a sharp 25% price drop in just one week, stirring concerns among investors. Despite this setback, there are signs pointing towards possible recovery. The coin’s future largely rests on the actions of long-term holders. Their decision to hold or sell in the current market will be pivotal for the XRP recovery potential. Currently, XRP is priced around $2.47, hovering above a key support level of $2.33. This support is crucial for its near-term stability. If XRP maintains this level, it could signal the beginning of an upward trend, highlighting the XRP recovery potential. The next major hurdle is at $2.70, and overcoming this could set the stage for further gains. However, a failure to hold the support might lead to further declines, underscoring the delicate balance of the XRP recovery potential. VET Price Prediction: A Challenging Path Ahead? VeChain (VET) has faced tough times lately, with a 7% decline last week and a 23% fall over the past month. These drops have raised concerns among investors about the future of VET. Despite these challenges, a falling wedge pattern suggests a possible turnaround, which is crucial for the VET price prediction. Currently, VET is trading at $0.036826 after a slight recovery of 5.58% in the last 24 hours. However, the VET price prediction remains cautious as the recent losses and ongoing market volatility suggest that recovery might not be swift or guaranteed. This uncertain outlook demands close monitoring of market trends and technical patterns to better understand the VET price prediction. Seize The Moment: BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 Is Closing! If you haven’t yet taken advantage of BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700, time is ticking away! This rare offer allows buyers to snag an impressive 350% extra BDAG coins. It’s a pivotal moment that crypto traders are not overlooking. As the offer nears its end, the rush to benefit from this opportunity is visible among smart traders seeking significant returns. The allure of BlockDAG doesn’t just end with the bonus. Industry watchers and crypto analysts are buzzing with predictions that BDAG’s value could surge to $1 post-launch, making BDAG coin a top crypto gainer for traders. Right now, during its presale phase, BDAG is witnessing remarkable interest, with its value reaching $0.0248 and presale nearing $200 million. The excitement doesn’t stop there. Early adopters have already enjoyed an impressive 2380% ROI. And with predictions swirling about BDAG hitting $1 post-launch, the potential for an explosive ROI is high. This means the 350% bonus isn’t just an opportunity; it’s a launchpad for financial growth—making it a golden opportunity for those who have missed out on BlockDAG’s ROI of 2380%. Why wait? Thousands are availing FINALCALL700 bonus offer, which is pushing BDAG towards its $600 million presale milestone. BDAG isn’t just another crypto coin; it’s a chance to be part of something potentially big. Now could be the best time to act, to expand your portfolio before BDAG’s ecosystem broadens and its prices potentially skyrocket. Future Investments: From Uncertainty to Opportunity While XRP contends with significant fluctuations, reflecting its recovery potential, and VET attempts to stabilize in a highly volatile market, BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a compelling choice for forward-thinking traders. Both XRP and VET have shown resilience, yet the promise of BlockDAG, especially with its nearing $600 million crypto presale milestone and a 350% bonus ending soon, positions it as a strategic acquisition. As early adopters eye becoming top crypto gainers, the potential for significant returns post-launch makes BlockDAG an increasingly attractive option in the crypto market.

The outlook for VET largely depends on its ability to endure current market turbulence and stage a comeback. Amid such volatility, the crypto presale sector is booming, especially for BlockDAG (BDAG) investors. The presale is closing in on $200 million, and the substantial 350% bonus has shifted trader focus from risky coins to more promising ones like BDAG, which offer the potential for substantial returns.

Yet, there are indications that a recovery might be on the horizon. The future of the coin is heavily reliant on the decisions of long-term holders, whose choice to hold or sell will significantly impact XRP's recovery prospects. XRP is currently trading near $2.47, just above a critical support level of $2.33. Maintaining this position is essential for its short-term stability. If the coin holds steady here, it may indicate the start of an upward movement, reinforcing XRP's recovery potential. A significant challenge lies at the $2.70 mark; overcoming it could pave the way for more gains. Conversely, failing to sustain the support level might lead to further declines, highlighting the fragile nature of XRP's recovery potential. VET Price Prediction: Is a Difficult Journey Ahead? Recent times have been challenging for VeChain (VET), which saw a 7% decrease last week and a 23% drop over the last month. These declines have sparked investor concern about VET's future. Despite these hurdles, a falling wedge pattern offers hope for a reversal, which is crucial for VET's price prediction. VET is now priced at $0.036826, following a modest 5.58% recovery in the past 24 hours. Still, the price prediction for VET remains uncertain due to recent losses and market instability, suggesting that any recovery might not be immediate or certain. Keeping a close watch on market trends and technical indicators is vital for a clearer understanding of VET's price prediction. Act Fast: BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 is Nearing Its End!

The London-headquartered bank disclosed it holds 2,473,064 shares of BlackRock’s IBIT fund in a recent quarterly filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF in terms of assets under management (AUM), is priced at $55.33 at time of writing, meaning Barclays’ holdings are worth around $136.8 million. Barclays also recently disclosed in a 2024 annual report that the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is probing the bank over potential anti-money laundering rule violations. Explains the firm, “The FCA’s investigation focuses primarily on the historical oversight and management of certain customers with heightened risk. Barclays has been cooperating with the investigation.” Barclays has shown an interest in the blockchain and digital asset space for years. In 2024, the bank teamed up with other financial institutions and the industry body UK Finance to participate in a tokenized deposits pilot project. And back in 2022, reports emerged that Barclays planned to buy a multimillion-dollar stake in Copper, a European crypto firm aiming to provide a secure infrastructure for institutions looking to invest in digital assets. That same year, the bank also backed Elwood Technologies, a crypto infrastructure and market data platform founded by billionaire Alan Howard.

The decline came as speculation surrounding Trump’s tariffs being a negotiating tool. Gold-backed tokens, including Paxos gold (PAXG) and Tether gold (XAUT), have declined roughly 1% over the past week to trade around $2,900 while the wider crypto market rallied. The CoinDesk 20 Index rose 5.7% over the same period, and the broader MarketVector Digital Assets 100 Index (MVDA) rose 3.4%. The precious metal saw its price drop amid growing speculation that the new tariffs threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump are meant to be a negotiating tool. This hit the price of safe-haven assets, including the commodity and the U.S. dollar. Trump announced reciprocal tariffs were on the table to match the tariff imposed by other countries on U.S. imports. Reciprocal tariffs could take months to implement, leading to speculation these are meant to allow the U.S. to negotiate with other countries. However, according to a recent Morgan Stanley report, gold's recent dip could still present an “opportunity for those looking for hedges” amid global reflation, geopolitical tensions, and growing fiscal spending. Wall Street giants have recently raised their gold price forecasts , which would also help the price of gold-backed digital assets rise as these are backed by bullion stored in vaults. Citi strategists recently raised their short-term gold price target to $3,000 and their average forecast for the year to $2,900. Meanwhile, UBS has hiked its 12-month gold target to $3,000 an ounce.",Markets|Gold|Paxg|Xaut,EN,0,0,FIAT|TRADING|MARKET|PAXG|XAUT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-15 17:57:31

As Ondo Finance (ONDO) expands to Sui (SUI) to further its institutional-grade RWA solutions, Coldware (COLD) is taking a different approach, leveraging its decentralized infrastructure to enhance tokenized assets and blockchain-based finance. Ondo Finance (ONDO) has demonstrated resilience in the volatile market, boasting a $1.87 billion market cap and an impressive $714 million in 24-hour trading volume. However, Sui (SUI) faces liquidity concerns, leaving questions about its ability to sustain growth. Coldware (COLD) , on the other hand, is rapidly emerging as a leading competitor, offering a more robust, scalable, and investor-friendly ecosystem that could redefine the future of RWAs. Coldware (COLD) Challenges Sui (SUI) and Ondo Finance (ONDO) with a Mobile-First Approach While Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Sui (SUI) focus on institutional RWA solutions, Coldware (COLD) is disrupting the industry by introducing a decentralized mobile blockchain for RWA transactions. Unlike Sui (SUI), which requires desktop-based infrastructure for RWA trading, Coldware (COLD) integrates Web3 technology into mobile devices, offering on-the-go asset tokenization and decentralized finance capabilities. Coldware’s (COLD) mobile-first approach is attracting interest from retail investors who seek an easier and more flexible way to trade tokenized real-world assets. By eliminating the need for complex third-party integrations, Coldware (COLD) is making blockchain-based RWA trading more accessible than ever before. Additionally, Coldware (COLD) is developing a secure, self-custodial smart wallet system, allowing users to manage their tokenized assets without relying on centralized exchanges. This model could redefine the RWA sector, setting Coldware (COLD) apart from Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Sui (SUI), both of which are still dependent on traditional finance structures. Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Sui (SUI) Face Competition from Coldware (COLD) Although Ondo Finance (ONDO) has gained momentum by expanding to Sui (SUI), some investors are concerned about Sui (SUI)’s overall stability. The blockchain has faced liquidity challenges, and while its DEX volume has surged past Polygon, network congestion and slow adoption in DeFi markets remain major issues. Coldware (COLD) is offering an alternative path for RWA tokenization, focusing on speed, efficiency, and accessibility through mobile blockchain technology. By eliminating network bottlenecks and reducing reliance on centralized exchanges, Coldware (COLD) is shaping up to be the biggest challenger in the space. With Ondo Finance (ONDO) solidifying its RWA position on Sui (SUI), the competition is heating up. Investors are watching whether Coldware (COLD) can outperform both Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Sui (SUI) by offering a decentralized, mobile-friendly alternative that simplifies real-world asset trading. The Future of RWA: Will Coldware (COLD) Dominate? With Ondo Finance (ONDO) expanding to Sui (SUI), the RWA market is growing rapidly, but Coldware (COLD) is setting itself up as the true disruptor. By leveraging Web3 mobile solutions, Coldware (COLD) is introducing a decentralized framework that could challenge both Sui (SUI) and Ondo Finance (ONDO) in the next phase of blockchain-based asset tokenization. If Coldware (COLD) continues to gain adoption, it could emerge as the preferred blockchain for RWA investors, offering lower fees, faster transactions, and seamless mobile access to decentralized finance markets. With its unique approach, Coldware (COLD) might redefine the entire RWA industry, setting a new standard for asset tokenization in the digital economy.

However, such valuations would position Dogecoin among the world’s largest financial entities, raising questions about feasibility. In contrast, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could introduce advancements in the blockchain space. As the first hybrid Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, PlutoChain could bring smart contracts and decentralized applications directly onto Bitcoin’s network. What Will Happen With DOGE’s Price If Its Market Cap Reaches $450B or $2.15T? Dogecoin’s current price is approximately $0.254, with a market capitalization of around $37.5 billion. If its market cap reaches $450 billion, each DOGE would be valued at about $3.05. To achieve a $2.15 trillion market cap, the price per DOGE would soar to approximately $14.55. These scenarios imply significant growth, but such valuations would position Dogecoin among the world’s largest financial entities, surpassing many major corporations. One of the only feasible scenarios where Dogecoin could reach $20 is if Bitcoin itself undergoes an extreme bull run and reaches a valuation between $1 million and $2 million per BTC. In such a case, the overall crypto market could expand, allowing meme coins like DOGE to go on parabolic price gains. PlutoChain’s New Hybrid Layer-2 Blockchain Could Solve Bitcoin’s Scalability Issues Bitcoin has always been the most secure blockchain, but it lacks the ability to support decentralized applications, smart contracts, and scalable transactions. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) wants to change that with its new hybrid layer-2 solution that could bring Ethereum-style functionality to Bitcoin without sacrificing security. With a two-second block time and low fees, it enables DeFi, NFTs, AI, and even metaverse applications to thrive directly on Bitcoin’s network. This change alone would make a huge difference if we look at what Bitcoin is dealing with now – a 10-minute block time! One of its biggest advantages is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Developers could be able to migrate Ethereum-based applications to Bitcoin, potentially unlocking a new financial ecosystem on the world’s most trusted blockchain. This might eliminate the need for bridges to Ethereum or Solana, reducing reliance on external networks. PlutoChain also wants to empower its community through governance, allowing platform users to influence the project’s direction. Additionally, its testnet already handles 43,200 daily transactions, showcasing its efficiency and potential for scaling. Security remains a priority, backed by independent audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . All in all, PlutoChain could redefine Bitcoin’s role, and potentially turn it from digital gold into a foundation for decentralized innovation. Final Words Dogecoin’s potential surge to a $2.15 trillion or $450 billion market cap raises excitement, but its feasibility remains uncertain. Such a leap would demand massive capital inflows and an extreme crypto bull run. Meanwhile, PlutoChain could take a different path – expanding Bitcoin’s ecosystem and case uses with a new L2 solution. It has the potential to enable smart contracts that could bring DeFI, NFTs, AI, and more, directly to Bitcoin. This could redefine this network completely and make it a foundation for blockchain innovation. ——– Disclaimer: It’s important to note that participating in presales carries risks, including market volatility and potential project delays.

As ChainLink (LINK) struggles to maintain its bullish momentum, many investors are turning to Coldware (COLD) as a revolutionary mobile blockchain designed for mass adoption. With Coldware (COLD) currently trading at just $0.0045, analysts predict a 10,000X surge in value before Q4 2025, making it one of the most promising investments in the Web3 space. Coldware (COLD) Captures ChainLink (LINK) Traders Looking for Higher Gains ChainLink (LINK) has seen increased volatility in 2025, with whale investors offloading their holdings amid concerns about its long-term growth prospects. While ChainLink (LINK) remains a key player in the DeFi space, its inability to scale efficiently has pushed traders to explore new blockchain solutions. Coldware (COLD) is filling this gap with a next-generation mobile-first blockchain, offering secure, low-cost transactions and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Unlike ChainLink (LINK), which focuses solely on data oracles, Coldware (COLD) is creating an entire Web3 ecosystem that integrates AI, IoT, and mobile blockchain capabilities. With the demand for mobile-friendly blockchain solutions growing, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as the go-to platform for Web3 adoption, putting pressure on ChainLink (LINK) to innovate or risk losing market share. ChainLink (LINK) Faces Bearish Pressure as Coldware (COLD) Gains Institutional Interest Despite a brief recovery in early 2025, ChainLink (LINK) has struggled to break past the $18 support level, signaling a potential downward trend. Analysts warn that if ChainLink (LINK) fails to regain momentum, it could lose its position as the dominant blockchain oracle provider. Meanwhile, Coldware (COLD) is rapidly gaining traction with institutional investors, thanks to its scalable architecture, low transaction fees, and real-world applications. With major firms exploring blockchain integration, Coldware (COLD) is becoming the preferred choice for enterprises seeking a future-proof solution. The Future of Web3: Coldware (COLD) vs. ChainLink (LINK) The blockchain industry is undergoing a major transformation, with Web3 and decentralized applications (dApps) driving the next wave of innovation. While ChainLink (LINK) was an early leader in decentralized oracles, its growth is slowing as newer, more advanced blockchains like Coldware (COLD) enter the market. Coldware (COLD) offers a unique combination of Web3 mobility, AI-powered security, and high-speed transactions, making it the ideal blockchain for the next generation of digital assets. As investors look for high-growth opportunities, Coldware (COLD) is poised to outperform ChainLink (LINK) in both adoption and market capitalization. With Q4 2025 expected to bring major developments for the Web3 space, Coldware (COLD) is the clear frontrunner for exponential growth, while ChainLink (LINK) faces increasing competition.

According to a Friday filing with the U.S. SEC, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), through its sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company, invested approximately $436.9 million in BlackRock’s IBIT during the fourth quarter of last year, further intensifying the battle for dominance in the digital asset space. This move coincided with the company securing a commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi, highlighting the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin within the Gulf nation. While BlackRock’s IBIT remains the largest Bitcoin spot fund by assets under management, currently holding around $57.46 billion, Mubadala is now the seventh largest investor. Notably, this latest investment from Abu Dhabi is not the country’s first foray into Bitcoin . In 2023, authorities in the city made substantial investments in Bitcoin mining, demonstrating a broader strategy to integrate digital assets into their financial ecosystem. Reacting to this development, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, tweeter, “ I told you the race was on. It’s time for America to win.” Lummis, who has been vocal about the need for the U.S. to enhance its Bitcoin strategy, has previously warned of a potential “crypto arms race” with nations like China and the UAE, consistently pushing for policies that would ensure the U.S. remains at the forefront of financial innovation and security. In a Friday interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Lummis detailed a proposal that would see the U.S. establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Under this plan, the government would accumulate 200,000 Bitcoin annually over five years, eventually holding a total of one million Bitcoin. This reserve, she argues, could be leveraged to stabilize the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, ultimately strengthening America’s economic position. “This asset is transforming not only our country but our world, and the United States needs to be the Global leader, as President Trump just said,” said Lummis. The UAE isn’t the only nation challenging the U.S. in the Bitcoin race. On Friday, British multinational bank Barclays also disclosed its investment in IBIT, holding approximately 2.5 million shares valued at $131.2 million. Goldman Sachs remains the largest institutional investor in IBIT, with around $1.3 billion in holdings. The investment bank has also invested $294 million in Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), bringing its total exposure to over $1.6 billion.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-15 18:18:10

Table of Contents ChowWow: The top altcoin investors can’t afford to miss Binance to organise AI hackathon Franklin Templeton’s money market fund now available on Solana Conclusion A favorable regulatory climate, rallying markets, and a slew of unique products – a lot is happening in the crypto market and investors can’t seem to keep calm. Coaxed by the market hype and FOMO, investors are getting bolder and experimenting with new tokens like ChowWow (CHOW) . Built on the Solana network, ChowWow is a stake-to-earn and GameFi platform where players get multiple opportunities to earn. The token has a deflationary model, which has been a major draw for investors favoring long-term gains. ChowWow’s presale boom has helped it make it to the list of best new ICOs. Such has been the pull of the token that even Binance (BNB) and Solana (SOL) holders are switching sides and giving ChowWow a chance. You might also like: New undervalued altcoins under $0.05 that could soar soon ChowWow: The top altcoin investors can’t afford to miss ChowWow is a vibrant crypto project inspired by a Chinese dog breed called ‘Chow Chow.’ The dog breed is associated with qualities like loyalty and prosperity. Even ChowWow’s official mascot is a Chow Chow dog dressed in red – a color that symbolizes good luck in Chinese culture. The CHOW token has a supply of 888,777,000, and 50% of this stock is meant for presale. Currently priced at $0.0080, the CHOW token has been drawing investors in scores. ChowWow is already on leading analysts’ best cryptocurrency ICO lists. The CHOW token has a deflationary model, which means that its supply will always be scarce. Deflationary models advocate a scarce supply as it keeps the token value stable. Even if markets are volatile, the token price isn’t affected much. The ChowWow team will trim the supply by burning excess tokens and buybacks. ChowWow’s staking service is another reason why people are showering so much attention on the token. The staked tokens help in the platform’s overall growth and in exchange token owners get monthly rewards. The annual percentage yield on staking ranges between 8 and 15% subject to the staking period and the number of stakers. ChowWow has gained a lot of appreciation because of its meme competitions. In these contests, people can design original memes and upload them on social media while tagging the ChowWow team. The winner will be selected through an online poll conducted by ChowWow. The winner will get USDT tokens worth $1,000. Binance to organise AI hackathon Binance is a versatile DeFI ecosystem that includes a blockchain and a crypto exchange. Its native token BNB can be used across the ecosystem for transactions. Counted among 2025’s best altcoins, the Binance network powers powerful dApps and also doubles up as an NFT marketplace. Binance recently announced that it would be organizing a hackathon to encourage creativity in artificial intelligence and blockchain. Called the ‘BNB AI Hack’, the hackathon will not have any deadlines. Participants can submit their entries any time and there will be bi-weekly reviews of the projects. Franklin Templeton’s money market fund now available on Solana Solana is a leading blockchain network where developers can find tools to build innovative dApps and other DeFi tools. The blockchain’s native token SOL is among the best cryptocurrencies to buy as it has registered big-ticket gains in the past few months. The token has outperformed several coins in terms of total volume locked and DEX revenue. In a recent development, Franklin Templeton added Solana to the list of blockchains on which its OnChain US Government Money Market Fund can be accessed. The fund is the world’s third-largest tokenized money market fund. The other blockchains where the fund is available are Ethereum, Avalanche, Aptos, and Base. Conclusion ChowWow is among 2025’s altcoins to watch out for. Within a short span of time, the meme coin has impressed investors with a cutting-edge mode. CHOW holders can not only stake assets or earn passive income but also contribute to decision-making. At a time when cybercrimes are a major concern in the crypto community, ChowWow safeguards users’ interests with a robust security framework. The framework has been designed to meet international data privacy standards and undergoes regular audits. In the coming months, the ChowWow team will be rolling out marketing activities and collaborations to ramp up the token outreach. For more information, visit the official website.

Taking to his X handle, he shared 4 key takeaways that key stakeholders in the industry need to watch out for. Notably, this take comes amid a growing shift toward celebrity tokens in the broader market. Binance Founder on Ideal Token Signs According to the CZ post, industry personalities with respected online profiles must be careful when endorsing a token. He noted that token economies matter for any kind of asset. The former Binance CEO said a lot of research must be done before a user decides to invest or not. He also noted that buying a new asset is inherently risky. He also insinuated that with the growing industry, there is a lot of money from investors ready to be invested. This floating capital in the community entered some memecoins lately. The President Trump family launched the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens in January. The massive embrace of these tokens pushed TRUMP to the top 15 in the market within days. However, these assets have lost bullish momentum, leaving many investors in losses. LIBRA Token and Argentina Ties The comment from the Binance founder came as a response to a thread from Pix, a self-acclaimed Web3 researcher. Pix dived deeper into the origin of the LIBRA token and the ties with Argentina President Javier Milei. Despite the link and narrative, LIBRA crashed by 90% after hitting an all-time high of $4 billion valuation. According to Pix on X , Julian Peh, an investor who bought Bitcoin in 2016, launched the token. With runs to Ethereum and NFTs, Peh soon became vast in the new tech world. He first met the Argentine President in 2021 when he gave a speech on AI, small businesses, and the future at a conference. Impressing Milei, KIP, the company founded by Julia Peh, joined the Buenos Aires Blockchain Committee. Through this linkup, he pitched the idea of a national token to support small businesses. President Milei bought the idea with his plans for transformation and shared the first post about the token on X. This triggered a massive Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) as investors poured in case. With $87 million pulled out by insiders after Milei deleted his post, many now tag the LIBRA token as the biggest political rug pull in history. Binance Founder Almost Caught in Memecoin Saga Meanwhile, Changpeng Zhao almost mixed with a similar memecoin frenzy earlier this week. The trend started when he posted online his dog Brocolli, a Belgian Malinois. In a short while, many memecoin variants tracking the price of the dog came online. One whale made huge gains after betting on BROCCOLI as the price rallied over 160%. Some investors even demanded that CZ drop a contract address for a token linked to the dog. However, he refused, avoiding another potential failed celebrity token. From his experience, he noted that the Argentina LIBRA token could have recorded a better outcome if properly planned.

The scheme involved a fraudulent crypto-mining service called HashFlare, resulting in investor losses of over $577 million. Founders Agree to Forfeit $400M in Assets According to court documents, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin, both 40, sold contracts to customers, entitling them to a share of crypto mined by their purported crypto mining service. Between 2015 and 2019, HashFlare’s sales totaled more than $577 million. However, the firm did not have the necessary computing power to perform most of the mining it claimed to carry out. To hide this, the company’s web-based dashboard displayed falsified data as customers’ supposed mining profits. The fraudulent activities of the Estonian nationals extend beyond HashFlare. In 2017, the co-founders launched an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for a project called Polybius, claiming it would establish a bank specializing in digital currency. The initiative promised investors dividends from the bank’s future profits, leading to at least $25 million being raised. However, no such bank was ever created. The perpetrators encouraged individuals to invest their savings in both companies, assuring them of substantial returns. Potapenko and Turõgin even distributed some profits to early investors to maintain the scheme’s credibility. However, the companies failed to deliver the promised returns. The funds were instead redirected to various accounts and crypto wallets controlled by the two men. The proceeds were then used to purchase real estate and luxury vehicles and maintain investment and crypto accounts. As part of their plea agreement, the duo will forfeit assets worth more than $400 million, which will be used in remission to compensate victims. Further details on this process will be announced at a later date. The Guilty Plea After investigating their fraudulent crypto operations, authorities apprehended Potapenko and Turõgin in Estonia in November 2022. At the time, the U.S. DOJ charged the duo with 16 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Following their arrests, the U.S. sought their extradition, but an Estonian Circuit Court annulled the request in 2023, citing concerns over the conditions of U.S. detention facilities. However, in January 2024, their deportation to the United States was again approved, resulting in their recent guilty pleas. Both men admitted to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and are scheduled for sentencing on May 8. They each face up to 20 years in prison, and the final conviction will be determined by a federal judge based on the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other legal factors.

In contrast to DOGE, which primarily relies on social media fervor and retail speculation, Coldware is developing a Layer-1 blockchain equipped with integrated financial services, IoT-based security solutions, and Web3-supporting mobile devices. This innovation has driven its 600% increase, positioning it as one of the most promising DeFi projects as we approach 2025 and beyond. Dogecoin has been a favorite among meme coin aficionados for a long time, but its future remains uncertain amidst the crypto market's high volatility. Recently, DOGE has faced challenges in regaining its past peaks, leaving investors divided on whether it will surpass the $1 threshold or continue to face downward trends. Market analysts have taken a close look at Dogecoin’s Adam & Eve pattern, a well-known bullish technical setup. Some are optimistic that this pattern could spark a breakout if DOGE sustains critical support levels. However, others argue that Dogecoin lacks the fundamental utility for sustained long-term growth, making it a riskier choice compared to innovative projects like Coldware (COLD). Coldware (COLD) Experiences a 600% Boom as DeFi Adoption Expands While Dogecoin's prospects are unclear, Coldware (COLD) has captured the market’s attention with a remarkable 600% price increase. Unlike DOGE, which depends on speculation and social media buzz, Coldware (COLD) is a truly decentralized Layer-1 blockchain offering genuine utility in DeFi, IoT, and Web3 mobile technology. The recent price surge of Coldware has been driven by growing institutional interest and the increasing adoption of its pioneering DeFi ecosystem. Designed for scalability, security, and real-world applications, Coldware (COLD) has emerged as a strong choice for investors seeking alternatives to meme coins. One of Coldware’s major strengths over Dogecoin is its solid Proof-of-Stake (PoS) framework, which provides energy efficiency, rapid transactions, and network security. At the core of this ecosystem is the COLD token, facilitating easy access to staking rewards, decentralized financial services, and tokenized real-world assets (RWA). Could Coldware (COLD) Surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) by 2028? As DeFi adoption accelerates and investor interest shifts towards projects driven by utility, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a leading contender for sustained growth. Experts suggest that Coldware’s distinct Web3 infrastructure and IoT integration could drive another 10x increase before the next bullish cycle. Conversely, Dogecoin remains highly speculative, with its price heavily influenced by social media trends and celebrity endorsements. Should DOGE struggle to surpass significant resistance levels, its hold on the meme coin market might diminish, paving the way for more innovative projects like Coldware (COLD) to take the spotlight. As the crypto landscape evolves, investors are increasingly seeking assets that offer practical use cases, sustainability, and potential for long-term appreciation. Coldware (COLD) meets all these criteria, marking it as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to monitor between 2025 and 2028.

The token lost over 95% of its value within hours of its launch. KIP Protocol CEO and co-founder Julian Peh clarified in a Feb. 15 X space that the company was hired as a tech consultancy to distribute project funds to Argentine companies. Peh clarified that KIP Protocol neither created the token nor acted as its market maker. In a separate X post, Peh also assured that Project Libertad, the broader project under which LIBRA is attached, would continue to support Argentine businesses despite the token collapse. Concerns Regarding LIBRA Token and Authenticity LIBRA gained momentum after President Milei pinned a now-deleted approval of the project on his X profile for a few hours. Investors initially suspected a social media hack, but the project achieved legitimacy when Argentine politicians re-posted the notice. Milei later revoked his endorsement, claiming he did not have any knowledge about the project. Transparency and rollout of the project have since raised concerns among analysts. Red Flags Raised by Analysts The Kobeissi Letter, a financial newsletter, discovered that the project’s website linked to a generic Google Form as a platform for companies to apply for funding. The domain was also registered a few hours prior to the token launch and for only one year. “There is no public owner information, and multiple restricted domain statuses,” the Kobeissi Letter noted, questioning whether the project was hastily assembled overnight. Onchain Data Raises More Doubts Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps revealed that 50% of LIBRA’s token supply is held in a single wallet. Additionally, 82% of the supply remains unlocked, meaning tokens could be sold at any time. Bubblemaps compared LIBRA to TRUMP memecoin, which also has a lock-up period for portions of its supply. The TRUMP token has also generated political and legal concerns regarding the utilization of crypto as a potential bribery conduit. With LIBRA crashing spectacularly and still under fire, the project’s future is now uncertain, and investors are left questioning its legitimacy and purpose.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-02-15 18:28:58

This decentralized finance project is gaining traction for its strong fundamentals and growing investor interest. With its early success in the presale phase, Mutuum Finance could be poised for significant growth, making it a crypto to watch as XRP rebounds. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new altcoin positioned for strong growth in 2025, offering investors an early opportunity to secure tokens before its anticipated price surge. Currently in its presale phase, the project has set its initial price at $0.01 per token, with a structured plan for 11 presale phases leading up to a launch price of $0.06. The demand for MUTM has been growing rapidly, with over 750 holders joining in just a few days and the project raising more than $470,000. While the presale is attracting significant interest, Mutuum Finance is more than just a fundraising initiative, it is designed to bring practical use cases through its decentralized lending platform and overcollateralized stablecoin. A key feature of Mutuum Finance is its upcoming stablecoin, which is designed to provide users with a decentralized and transparent alternative to traditional fiat-backed stablecoins. Unlike centralized stablecoins that rely on reserves held by third-party institutions, Mutuum’s stablecoin is backed by on-chain collateral, ensuring greater security and transparency. Users can mint stablecoins by locking assets such as ETH or USDT as collateral, allowing them to access liquidity without selling their holdings. The supply of stablecoins adjusts dynamically based on demand and loan repayments, helping to maintain stability in the ecosystem. How the Lending Platform Works Mutuum Finance’s lending platform introduces an efficient and flexible system for users to lend and borrow assets. Lenders can deposit their assets into liquidity pools, earning passive income in the form of interest. For example, a user who supplies 10,000 USDT into the pool at an annual percentage yield (APY) of 5% will receive 500 USDT in interest after a year. On the borrowing side, users can leverage their crypto holdings without selling them. For instance, a borrower can deposit 10 SOL as collateral and access up to 70% of its value in stablecoins, providing them with liquidity for other investments or expenses. The lending platform operates with both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models, giving users flexibility based on their financial needs. Analysts expect a significant price increase for MUTM once it launches, with projections estimating a minimum 2000% surge. This expectation is based on several factors, including its practical DeFi applications, strong early adoption, and growing investor interest. Additionally, as the token secures listings on major exchanges, it will gain wider exposure, increasing demand and trading volume. The team is also preparing to launch a beta version of the lending platform alongside the token’s market debut, allowing users to engage with its features and driving further demand. Mutuum Finance is built for long-term growth, making it an appealing option for investors looking beyond short-term gains. A key feature contributing to its sustainability is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. This system reinvests a portion of the platform’s fees into purchasing MUTM tokens from the market. These acquired tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders, creating continuous buy pressure while rewarding active participants. This mechanism helps to support price appreciation and incentivizes long-term holding by maintaining consistent demand and rewarding active participants. With its structured tokenomics, strong utility, and growing adoption, Mutuum Finance stands out as a high-potential DeFi project. As XRP rebounds, investors seeking the next big opportunity are turning to MUTM as a promising alternative for substantial growth in 2025.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, the prominent altcoin rose by 11% reaching a local peak of $2.81 before experiencing a significant retracement to $2.39. With XRP on the rise again, investors must note the asset must scale certain price barriers to validate its current bullish momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On The Weekly Chart – Potential For A Rebound? XRP Must Move Past $3.40 To Retain Market Interest Popular market analyst Egrag Crypto has shared an intriguing analysis of the XRP market. In an X post on February 14, the crypto expert states that the third-largest cryptocurrency must achieve a strong close above $2.75 (marked in green) to sustain its current upward trend. Based on historical data, $2.75 has presented a significant resistance level. If XRP can close and hold above this price zone on its 4-hour trading chart, it would indicate that buyers are gaining control of the market following a month of major price loss. Thereafter, the altcoin must attain another price close above $2.94 (marked in yellow) which would suggest a higher bullish momentum with significant potential for new highs such as $3.22. For the XRP market, each confirmed close above these specified price levels strengthens the present bullish momentum. However, Egrag Crypto warns that all price movement below the current bull rally peak of $3.40 will remain merely “noise” in the long run. The analyst warns that XRP must break above this psychological price level to confirm a certain trend shift in the upward direction.

Amidst its recent price retracement, community sentiments in the XRP market remain highly bullish, especially with the advancement of a potential XRP ETF. By acknowledging Grayscale’s ETF application, the SEC is allowed an initial review period of 45 days – potentially extensible to 240 days – to approve or reject the proposed ETF. With the implementation of the pro-crypto agenda of Donald Trump, investors are highly positive about an approval suggesting a potential influx of institutional capital as seen with the Bitcoin Spot ETFs.

40370838,https://nulltx.com/?p=144958,1739644245,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,XRP Price Prediction – Popular Analyst Predicts $30 for XRP in 2025 – Is This the Start of a New Bull Rally?,https://nulltx.com/xrp-price-prediction-popular-analyst-predicts-30-for-xrp-in-2025-is-this-the-start-of-a-new-bull-rally/,"XRP’s future depends on regulatory decisions and whether institutions jump in, but analysts are optimistic, saying it could reach $30 this year. We’ll also talk about PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a new hybrid Layer-2 solution that could tackle Bitcoin’s biggest problem — slow and costly transactions. Here’s the latest info on both projects. XRP Price Prediction: Can XRP Hit $8 by 2025? Analyst Predicts a Massive Breakout Ahead At the moment, XRP is trading at around $2.59, up 5.8% in the last 24 hours. The trading volume over the same period is about $4.6 billion. The optimism around XRP comes with speculation about the approval of a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. The SEC is expected to review Grayscale’s filing soon. Bloomberg analysts currently estimate a 65% chance of approval , possibly by mid-2025. If an XRP ETF gets the green light, it could open the door for institutional investors to enter the market, which would boost demand and drive up the price. Armando Pantoja predicts that XRP is set for a major breakout and could reach $8–$30, as regulatory shifts and bullish technical patterns align. PlutoChain ($PLUTO): The Hybrid Layer-2 Solution That Could Transform Bitcoin Into a Fast, Low-Cost, and Practical Payment System Despite its dominant role in crypto, Bitcoin’s slow transaction speeds and high fees make it impractical for everyday use. That’s where PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could come in—a hybrid Layer-2 scaling solution that might make Bitcoin a fast, affordable, and widely accepted payment method. PlutoChain runs on its own blockchain and delivers 2-second block times, a big improvement compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute blocks. This means near-instant transactions, which could make Bitcoin viable for microtransactions, global payments, and day-to-day purchases. No more long wait times or network congestion slowing things down. But, speed isn’t the only issue. High transaction fees have kept Bitcoin from being a practical payment option. PlutoChain could change that by significantly lowering costs, and making BTC more accessible to both individuals and businesses. Instead of just being a store of value, Bitcoin could finally function as a true payment network. PlutoChain could also bring extra utility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility . This could open the door to decentralized applications (DeFi), NFT marketplaces, and AI-driven blockchain solutions—it could bridge Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s flexibility. Its testnet has already processed over 43,200 transactions in a single day, which proves it can handle high volumes efficiently. Security is a top priority for PlutoChain , so it’s undergone audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , plus ongoing stress testing. Beyond technology, PlutoChain supports community-driven governance and gives users a say in network upgrades and policies. By combining speed, lower fees, and advanced features, PlutoChain could redefine Bitcoin’s role and turn it from a slow, expensive asset into a fast and efficient digital currency. The Bottom Line XRP’s path to $30 depends on regulatory approvals and institutional backing, but growing momentum and positive analyst predictions make its future look promising. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might get attention for its new take on Bitcoin’s scalability issues. With 2-second block times and EVM compatibility, it could make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more versatile. Please keep in mind that this article is not financial advice.

While Kaspa (KAS) is recognized for its rapid transaction capabilities, Coldware (COLD) is redefining real-world blockchain utility through its Larna 2400® Web3 mobile phone and ColdBook® decentralized computer. Coldware's value recently soared by 600%, reflecting growing trust from investors in its hardware-supported blockchain network. As institutional investors and crypto whales pivot their attention from Kaspa to Coldware (COLD) , there is a rising demand for decentralized mobile computing solutions. Reasons Behind Kaspa (KAS) Whales Transitioning to Coldware (COLD) Kaspa (KAS) is well-regarded for its swift and efficient transactions but lacks the infrastructure to support decentralized mobile solutions. On the contrary, Coldware (COLD) is effectively closing the gap between blockchain technology and real-world applications by introducing: Larna 2400® Web3 Smartphone – A fully decentralized mobile device integrating Coldware’s Layer-1 blockchain with secure, on-chain financial transactions. ColdBook® Decentralized Laptop – An advanced computing device crafted for blockchain-enabled communication, token-based payments, and secure asset handling. Coldware (COLD) IoT and DeFi Ecosystem – A network offering hardware-empowered financial services, allowing users to engage with decentralized apps without traditional banking. These innovations are why investors from Kaspa are redirecting their funds into Coldware (COLD) , viewing it as a strategic, long-term investment in Web3 mobile growth and blockchain-powered hardware advancements. Evaluating Coldware (COLD) and Kaspa (KAS): Which Offers Better Investment Potential? Though Kaspa is a strong candidate for high-speed blockchain transactions, its real-world applications are limited compared to the decentralized hardware integration of Coldware (COLD) . The 600% surge in Coldware’s presale phase indicates growing interest from both institutional investors and retail traders seeking substantial long-term growth. Furthermore, as Coldware (COLD) gears up for exchange listings, there's anticipation that its Web3-driven ecosystem will boost adoption, potentially positioning COLD among the top-performing cryptocurrencies by 2025. Could Coldware (COLD) Outshine Kaspa (KAS) in Market Value? With Kaspa investors entering Coldware’s presale, the transition towards decentralized mobile and hardware-integrated blockchain networks is becoming increasingly apparent. Although Kaspa excels in transaction speeds, Coldware (COLD) ’s approach of melding Web3, IoT, and practical applications presents it as a more appealing long-term investment. Should this trend persist, Coldware (COLD) may soon eclipse Kaspa (KAS) in market valuation, positioning itself as the premier blockchain for real-world IoT integration and decentralized Web3 mobile solutions.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DOGE gains 6.46%, SHIB surges 10%, and BitLemons emerges as the 2025 GambleFi breakthrough. The crypto market is witnessing an exciting shift as DOGE posts a remarkable 6.46% weekly gain, and SHIB maintains its upward momentum with a 10% surge. Meanwhile, BitLemons (BLEM) is capturing attention as the breakthrough GambleFi protocol of 2025. Here’s why analysts are calling this the perfect storm for crypto investors. Is BitLemons changing the $450b casino industry? The crypto gaming sector has found its new powerhouse in BitLemons, which has already secured an impressive $1 million in private seed funding. What sets BitLemons apart is its game-changing approach to revenue sharing, with 30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) flowing directly back to the ecosystem – 15% dedicated to token buybacks and burns and another 15% rewarding loyal stakers. With over 8,000 games from premium providers like Evolution and Pragmatic, BitLemons isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a fully operational casino platform disrupting the traditional $450B gambling market. The platform’s current presale price of $0.01 represents an extraordinary entry point, especially considering rumors of a 17-18c listing price on major exchanges. You might also like: MEOW, TAO falter while BitLemons emerges as the rising force in gaming Can DOGE maintain its impressive recovery? Dogecoin’s chart tells a compelling story of resilience and momentum. Over the past week, DOGE has demonstrated remarkable strength, pushing from $0.248 to $0.264, representing a 6.46% gain. Trading volume has remained robust at $1.52b, though showing some consolidation with a 21.98% daily decrease. Technical analysis reveals strong support at the $0.255 level, with resistance forming near $0.270. The consistent upward trend and increasing market cap of $39.21b suggest growing institutional interest in the original meme coin. What’s behind SHIB’s 10% weekly surge? Shiba Inu has emerged as one of the week’s top performers, recording an impressive 10% gain over the past seven days. The token’s price action shows sustained buying pressure, with the price maintaining support above $0.00001632. Volume metrics indicate growing market participation, with $287.98m in 24-hour trading volume. Despite a 36.68% daily volume decrease, SHIB’s market structure remains bullish, supported by its expanding ecosystem and strong community backing. Why BitLemons could be 2025’s biggest opportunity While DOGE and SHIB continue their impressive runs, BitLemons presents a unique opportunity at the intersection of crypto gaming and passive income generation. With its deflationary tokenomics, revenue-sharing model, and established gaming platform, BLEM stands out as a potential market leader in the rapidly growing GambleFi sector. The combination of a proven business model, transparent tokenomics, and an attractive entry price point makes BitLemons a compelling investment opportunity. As the platform continues to expand its gaming offerings and user base, early investors stand to benefit from both appreciation potential and sustainable passive income streams.

Analyst Foresees This RWA Crypto to Multiply 10-Fold Before Q3 2025—Here’s Why,https://bitzo.com/2025/02/searching-for-the-next-kaspa-analyst-foresees-this-rwa-crypto-to-multiply-10-fold-before-q3-2025-heres-why,"As Kaspa (KAS) finds it challenging to maintain its momentum, analysts are turning their focus to Coldware (COLD) —a pioneering blockchain merging decentralized finance (DeFi) with practical applications. Coldware is gaining attention with its hardware-integrated Layer-1 blockchain, and experts are forecasting a 10X increase before Q3 2025. As tokenized assets from the real world (RWA) become increasingly significant in the crypto space, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend, offering decentralized finance solutions, IoT-enabled devices, and a Web3-based financial ecosystem. Why Coldware (COLD) is Dubbed the “Next Kaspa” While Kaspa drew attention for its rapid parallel processing, Coldware goes beyond mere transaction efficiency. Unlike Kaspa, which lacks an ecosystem for real-world products, Coldware (COLD) is innovating with decentralized mobile and computing devices, ensuring seamless integration of blockchain technology with consumer hardware. Distinctive Features of Coldware Compared to Kaspa: Larna 2400® Web3 Smartphone – A fully decentralized mobile device powered by blockchain technology. ColdBook® Decentralized Laptop – A laptop crafted for blockchain-driven communication and asset management. Coldware’s $COLD Token – The native cryptocurrency facilitating fast, low-cost transactions, staking, and smooth global payments. IoT and DeFi Integration – Unlike Kaspa, Coldware (COLD) blends hardware, finance, and blockchain, enabling real-world devices to interact with smart contracts. This IoT and Web3 strategy has sparked significant investor interest in Coldware’s presale, pointing towards substantial future adoption. Why Analysts Anticipate a 10X Rise for Coldware (COLD) Crypto analysts are keeping a close eye on Coldware’s presale performance, with many predicting it will overtake Kaspa’s market cap before Q3 2025. Here are some reasons behind this expectation: Institutional Adoption & Whales Moving In – As Kaspa's use case remains limited, major investors are gravitating towards Coldware (COLD) , which provides a more varied blockchain infrastructure. Explosive Presale Growth – The 600% boost in Coldware’s presale highlights strong market interest, with investors banking on Coldware’s future potential. Web3 Mobile Expansion – Unlike Kaspa, which lacks a dedicated hardware ecosystem, Coldware (COLD) is rolling out IoT-enabled blockchain devices, positioning itself as a pioneer in decentralized hardware adoption. With Coldware gaining momentum, the question isn't if it will increase tenfold, but rather how quickly it will achieve this. Will Coldware (COLD) Surpass Kaspa (KAS) in Market Value? Although Kaspa currently leads with its high-speed blockchain processing, it lacks the extensive real-world integration that Coldware is introducing. If Coldware (COLD) continues its rapid growth trajectory, it could soon outpace Kaspa in market capitalization, establishing itself as the leading Layer-1 blockchain for Web3 and IoT. With institutional support, a booming presale, and a strategy focused on real-world applications, Coldware (COLD) is set to become one of the most significant blockchain success stories of 2025.

In a recent, now-deleted X post, Milei talked about Libra, calling it a private project that would help Argentina’s economy. He also shared a link to the token. Right after his tweet, Libra’s value skyrocketed by over 2,000% in just 40 minutes, reaching a market cap of $4.4 billion. However, the excitement was short-lived as the token plummeted by more than 95%. Libra Token: A Pump and Dump Scheme? As Libra’s price peaked, early investors quickly sold their tokens, causing a huge drop. Screenshots shared online showed that some insiders manipulated the market. They used a trick to drain money from the token, removing stablecoins and leaving other investors with losses. Even though Libra had a trading volume of $1.1 billion, the numbers showed something was wrong with the token. Reportedly, there were 74,500 buy orders, but only 28,900 sales. This showed that a few big sell-offs wiped out smaller investors. Javier Milei Tries to Clear His Name After the crash, Milei deleted his tweet and explained he had no real connection to the project. He claimed he did not know much about Libra when he promoted it. Once he realized the situation, he stopped talking about it and removed the tweet. However, the damage was already done. The fall of Libra affected the whole memecoin market, causing an uproar in the crypto market. Sadly another popular token, TRUMP, also lost $500 million in value just 30 minutes after Libra started crashing. The Impact of Politicians and Celebrities Influence on Crypto Prices Many times, a single tweet from a politician or celebrity can send a digital asset’s price soaring , or crashing. This has happened before, and it will likely happen again. This is because the crypto market is highly influenced by hype. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has influenced the market value of Dogecoin (DOGE) many times. Each time he tweets about it, the price jumps. However, investors have also suffered losses when prices dropped after the hype faded. Musk was even sued for allegedly manipulating the Dogecoin market, but the American entrepreneur emerged victorious. Before President Donald Trump’s scheduled inauguration, TRUMP memecoin was created on the Solana blockchain and shortly after it was launched, it surged in value. President Trump has casually dismissed the token, causing the token to drop significantly. The digital asset is currently under investigation for possible solicitation by financial watchdogs. Milei’s Libra tweet is just the latest example of how risky the crypto market can be. Unless stronger rules are introduced, politicians and celebrities will likely keep influencing crypto prices. People are advised to be careful when investing in coins promoted by famous figures.

Additionally, the AIVM is built for scalability, leveraging parallel execution and optimized resource allocation to deliver low-latency AI operations. Lightchain AI is truly shaping the future of blockchain technology. Why LCAI Could See a Major Price Surge in 2025 Unlike many speculative altcoins, Lightchain AI’s technology has real-world applications that cater to institutional and retail investors alike. The combination of AI-driven automation , efficiency, and scalability makes LCAI a strong candidate for mainstream adoption. With continued development and ecosystem growth, analysts predict that its current presale price of $0.006 could be significantly undervalued compared to its future market potential. Furthermore, Lightchain AI’s strategic roadmap includes further integrations into decentralized finance (DeFi) and enterprise-level blockchain solutions, which could drive massive demand for the LCAI token. As blockchain networks evolve, AI-powered automation is expected to become a key component, and Lightchain AI is positioning itself at the forefront of this transition. Future of Altcoins in 2025 As the crypto market continues to evolve, investors are increasingly moving beyond meme coins and speculative assets, focusing instead on projects that offer tangible innovation and real-world applications. Lightchain AI’s AI-powered blockchain solutions exemplify the future of decentralized networks.

While DOGE’s past performance patterns enthuse meme coin enthusiasts, astute investors are pivoting towards Web3Bay , a utility-rich blockchain initiative revolutionizing decentralized commerce. Web3Bay’s presale, exceeding $1 million swiftly, positions it as one of the standout investments for 2025. In contrast to Dogecoin’s speculation-driven surge, Web3Bay is spearheading disruptive changes in the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector, offering practical solutions that distinguish it from other hype-driven assets. Dogecoin’s $10 Ambition: A Recurring Historical Cycle? Dogecoin, initially a parody, has consistently defied market expectations. Analysts note that DOGE follows a 1,442-day market cycle, achieving peak prices precisely 1,442 days apart: In 2013, DOGE peaked early before descending into a prolonged bear market. By 2017, it experienced another peak, marking significant gains. The pattern continued in 2021, with DOGE reaching $0.74 at the bull market’s zenith. If this cyclical trend persists, Dogecoin’s next significant rally could be around mid-2025, potentially elevating its value to the coveted $10 mark, a 1,200% rise from current prices, making it a speculative favorite for the upcoming bull run. However, Dogecoin’s growth is heavily reliant on social media buzz and major investors, lacking a solid, practical use case. While it may experience a surge based on historical trends, investors looking for sustainable, real-world blockchain implementations are gravitating towards Web3Bay, which is dedicated to constructing a lasting decentralized marketplace. Web3Bay’s $1M+ Presale Triumph: Investors Prioritize Utility Over Hype Web3Bay addresses a critical issue by reforming the flawed e-commerce system through decentralization. Unlike conventional platforms like Amazon and eBay that levy high fees, impose constraints, and control data, Web3Bay introduces a trustless, peer-to-peer marketplace empowered by blockchain technology. This revolutionary approach provides: Elimination of corporate intermediaries, allowing sellers to retain more profits. A censorship-resistant environment, removing the risk of unjust account suspensions. Hybrid payment options, facilitating both crypto and traditional transactions, including PayPal. Token-holder governance, with 3BAY investors steering platform developments. These innovations position Web3Bay as another cryptocurrency and a pivotal blockchain application poised to disrupt a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Consequently, Web3Bay’s presale has surged past the $1 million mark, underscoring investor confidence in its potential to outperform mere speculative ventures. Currently, in Stage 4, 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.004562. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early backers are looking at a possible 4,193% return on investment. However, the real potential unfolds post-launch, where, if adoption mirrors previous blockchain successes, Web3Bay could reach $0.50 or even $1 by 2025, transforming a $1,000 investment into approximately $10,960. Decentralized Commerce’s Future: Web3Bay’s Vision While Dogecoin’s $10 forecast is revitalizing meme coin excitement, these speculative cycles tend to be fleeting. Web3Bay, on the other hand, is not just riding the hype wave—it is at the forefront of a blockchain-driven overhaul in online shopping. With a presale already exceeding $1 million, an impending exchange debut, and a vast market to transform, Web3Bay stands as the definitive future of e-commerce. For those seeking the premier Web3 investment for 2025 , Web3Bay offers an unmatched opportunity. With the presale drawing to a close and demand set to skyrocket, the next significant crypto revolution is unfolding with Web3Bay at its helm. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this transformative movement.

A total of 3,898 wallets added to their WAVAX holdings today—nearly twice the recent average of 1,600, the data shows. A wrapped token is a token that represents a cryptocurrency from another blockchain or token standard and is worth the same as the original cryptocurrency. The wrapped token can be used on certain non-native blockchains for trading, lending and borrowing on DeFi platforms and later redeemed for the original cryptocurrency. While a declining price often signals bearish sentiment, the uptick in accumulation could suggest that some traders see long-term potential in WAVAX. However, whether this buying activity translates into price stability or a rebound remains to be seen. The wallet accumulation comes shortly after major cryptocurrency exchange Binance added AVAX as a cashback option for its Bybit Card product and after the Avalanche network saw technological advancements late last year with its Avalanche9000 upgrade . The Avalanche ecosystem has also been seeing growing integrations, including the expansion of BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL onto it. Wrapped AVAX is a tokenized version of Avalanche’s native AVAX coin, enabling broader compatibility across decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The growing number of wallets holding WAVAX may indicate users are positioned for future DeFi activity. Avalanche’s DeFi ecosystem, which includes major protocols like Aave and Lido, has been seeing a slight decline in total value locked over the last few months. Trading volumes on the network have nevertheless been steadily growing, according to DeFiLlama data.

The Meme coin has hovered around $0.000016, struggling to break higher amid selling pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) also declined, trading at $97k. Additionally, a massive 600 trillion SHIB supply appears to be limiting price growth, preventing a potential quadrupling in value. 600T SHIB: How It’s Blocking Price from Moving Higher The Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) Indicator provides an overview of Shiba Inu holders based on their profitability at different price levels. The chart categorizes addresses as In the Money if their average SHIB purchase price is below the current price, At the Money if it aligns with the current price, and Out of the Money if purchased at a higher price. Currently, the SHIB price is trading at $0.00001645, placing a significant number of holders out of the money. The most critical resistance zone is the $0.000018- $0.000019 range, where 40.68K addresses hold 423.54 trillion SHIB. This cluster acts as a supply barrier, and many investors are waiting for SHIB to return to their entry point to break even, leading to potential sell-offs that hinder upward momentum. If Shiba Inu price prediction successfully breaks above the $0.000019 level, the next major resistance forms between $0.000019 and $0.000024, where 155.67K addresses hold 68.23 trillion SHIB. This suggests that even if the first resistance is overcome, another large sell zone awaits at higher levels. SHIB Technical Indicators The Shiba Inu price could increase if it confirms the cup-and-handle. The pattern forms when a rounded bottom (the cup) appears, followed by a smaller dip (the handle), indicating consolidation before a potential surge. The neckline, or resistance level at the cup’s peak, is key in validating the pattern. If the pattern plays out successfully, the Shiba Inu price could climb by approximately 267%. This projection suggests a possible 3.5X to 4X increase from current levels. A confirmed breakout above the neckline could initiate an extended rally, with traders setting targets based on historical resistance points. If market conditions align with technical signals, Shiba Inu could experience a substantial price appreciation . The Global In/Out of the Money indicator highlights key resistance zones, showing where SHIB faces heavy sell pressure. If the cup-and-handle pattern is confirmed, a breakout could drive a 267% surge.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant, new-age projects are stepping up with groundbreaking tech and real-world solutions. One of the most anticipated trends this year is the push toward decentralized applications and privacy solutions. With data breaches and surveillance concerns on the rise, users are demanding better security and transparency. That’s where Qubetics, Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), and Polkadot come in—each offering something unique and powerful for the future of blockchain. Qubetics ($TICS) is already making waves with its decentralized VPN, giving users unmatched privacy and security. Meanwhile, Internet Computer Protocol is redefining how smart contracts work at scale, and Polkadot continues to lead the charge in interoperability. Let’s break down why these three cryptos are the Best Crypto to Invest in February 2025 . Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Secure and Decentralized VPNs Blockchain privacy is a hot topic, and Qubetics is taking it to the next level. The project aims to make online security and data privacy more accessible by offering a fully decentralized VPN service. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralized servers, Qubetics ensures that no single entity has control over your data. At its core, Qubetics is built for businesses, professionals, and individuals who value privacy. Whether you’re working remotely or just want to browse without surveillance, its decentralized VPN makes it easy. Plus, its blockchain infrastructure prevents data logging and censorship, making it a game-changer in online security. The numbers speak for themselves. Qubetics’ presale is currently in its 21st stage, with over 472 million tokens sold and $12.7 million raised. More than 19,900 holders have already jumped in, proving the massive demand for privacy-focused blockchain solutions. Right now, $TICS tokens are available at $0.0733—and investors aren’t wasting time securing their stake. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): The Next-Gen Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is changing the way developers build decentralized applications. Unlike traditional smart contract platforms that struggle with scalability, ICP offers a high-speed and cost-efficient alternative. The goal? To replace centralized cloud services with a fully decentralized internet. ICP allows developers to deploy applications directly on the blockchain, eliminating the need for external hosting services like AWS or Google Cloud. This makes dApps more secure, tamper-proof, and censorship-resistant. Plus, ICP’s unique consensus model ensures faster transaction speeds and lower costs compared to Ethereum. With its focus on scalability, security, and efficiency, ICP is an attractive choice for developers and investors alike. As adoption grows, it’s set to become a major player in Web3 infrastructure. Polkadot (DOT): The King of Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot is solving one of crypto’s biggest challenges—interoperability. With hundreds of blockchains operating in silos, there’s a massive need for a network that connects them all. That’s exactly what Polkadot does. Built to enable seamless communication between different blockchains, Polkadot allows assets and data to move across networks effortlessly. Its parachain structure ensures that projects can scale efficiently without sacrificing security. For developers, Polkadot provides a flexible and customizable environment to build innovative applications. For investors, it offers long-term potential as a key player in the blockchain revolution. With multiple projects launching on its network, Polkadot continues to be a smart bet for 2025. The Power of Decentralized VPNs: Why Qubetics Stands Out Privacy is becoming a rare commodity, and Qubetics is stepping up to protect it. Unlike traditional VPNs that can be subpoenaed or hacked, a decentralized VPN distributes data across multiple nodes, making it virtually impossible to track users. Qubetics’ decentralized VPN is built on blockchain, ensuring that your internet activity remains private and secure. This is particularly crucial for businesses handling sensitive information, remote workers needing extra security, and everyday users who want to browse anonymously. With cyber threats growing daily, Qubetics is positioning itself as the go-to privacy solution for Web3. As adoption rises, its decentralized VPN will likely become a must-have for users worldwide. Conclusion If you’re looking for the Best Crypto to Invest in February 2025, Qubetics, Internet Computer Protocol, and Polkadot should be on your radar. Qubetics is revolutionizing online privacy with its decentralized VPN, ICP is making smart contracts more efficient, and Polkadot is leading the charge in blockchain interoperability. With the Qubetics presale still ongoing, now’s the perfect time to get in early before the masses catch on. Don’t wait too long—2025 is shaping up to be a game-changing year for crypto.

40372712,https://finbold.com/?p=237551,1739647241,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Legendary trader says ‘it’s very unlikely’ Bitcoin will trade above $200k this decade,https://finbold.com/legendary-trader-says-its-very-unlikely-bitcoin-will-trade-above-200k-this-decade/,"When Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached a record high above $100,000, one of the next key anticipated targets was the $200,000 mark. However, a veteran trader has ruled out this possibility in the coming years. To this end, legendary rader Peter Brandt has suggested that it is highly improbable for BTC to trade above $200,000 by the end of the decade unless it can break through a critical resistance level, according to his X post on February 14. Brandt’s analysis highlighted key technical formations that have shaped Bitcoin’s long-term price action. If these patterns hold over the next five years, they could rule out a move to $200,000. “Unless Bitcoin has escape velocity through upper parabolic resistance line it’s very unlikely that BTC will be trading above $200k at the end of this decade,” he said. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt Historically, Bitcoin has experienced multiple parabolic advances, driving it to new highs. However, an upper parabolic resistance could cap its upside potential below $200,000. The analysis identified rectangles (RT), head and shoulders patterns (H&S), and expanding formations (Exp), indicating a structured yet volatile price trajectory. Brandt emphasized that unless Bitcoin decisively breaks its current parabolic structure, a rally beyond $200,000 remains unlikely. Bitcoin’s history includes rounding bottoms (Rnd), symmetrical triangles (ST), and key accumulation phases preceding significant rallies. Yet, each cycle has seen the asset struggle against critical resistance levels. Contrasting Bitcoin price prediction Interestingly, Brandt’s outlook differs from that of technical analyst Gert Van Lagen. In an X post on February 15, Van Lagen stated that Bitcoin might be gearing up for a final push to surpass the $200,000 mark. According to the analyst, the leading cryptocurrency appears poised for a final parabolic rally that could culminate in the $270,000 to $300,000 range. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Gert Van Lagen The technical analysis indicated that the maiden digital asset has successfully broken out of a four-year bullish megaphone pattern and has spent the past three months retesting this breakout—confirming its strength before launching higher. A chart shared by Lagen depicted how Bitcoin progressed through multiple bases before entering full-price discovery. In this line, Bitcoin has exhibited a step-like accumulation structure, guiding its ascent before a parabolic breakout. The formation began with Base 1, which marked the bear market’s end at the megaphone pattern’s lower boundary. Base 2 followed as a bear trap, shaking out weak hands before BTC reclaimed support. The rally gained momentum at Base 3, where Bitcoin confirmed the step formation with a strong price expansion and higher highs. Finally, Base 4 served as the last consolidation phase, signaling that price discovery is now in full swing. Similarly, prominent Wall Street analysts are also forecasting Bitcoin hitting $200,000 in 2025. As reported by Finbold, banking giant Standard Chartered has set a Bitcoin price target of $200,000 for 2025. Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research, stated that institutional capital inflows will mainly drive the push toward this target. Analysts at Bernstein have also echoed the $200,000 price target . If Bitcoin reaches this record, the asset will command a market cap of about $3.96 trillion. Bitcoin is consolidating below $100,000 in the short term as bulls struggle to push the asset past the crucial $100,000 resistance. This performance has been influenced by a mix of macroeconomic factors and market dynamics, with uncertainty regarding the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate move taking the lead. Amid this market indecisiveness, Bitcoin is also recording a notable shift in exchange inflows. Specifically, according to data from cryptocurrency on-chain analysis platform IntoTheBlock , Bitcoin saw $1.04 billion in net inflows to exchanges this week, wiping out three weeks of outflows. BTC saw $1.04B in net inflows to exchanges this week. This essentially wiped out the 3 previous weeks of outflows, indicating hesitancy in the market given global political and economic uncertainties. pic.twitter.com/MVhJGiCUmF — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 14, 2025 It’s worth noting that large inflows often signal selling pressure as traders move assets to exchanges primarily to sell. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was at $97,510, down 0.7% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the asset has posted a modest 1% gain. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Table of Contents Solana’s dominance in the altcoin market PCHAIN: A leading altcoin to buy PropiChain: Leading the new frontier of global real estate market PCHAIN presale: Over 46,000% ROI opportunity for early investors In the ever-evolving crypto world market, investors are constantly searching for the next big opportunity beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). They are always on the lookout for the best altcoin to buy. One name that has consistently drawn attention is Solana (SOL), known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. However, according to a top crypto expert, PCHAIN deserves just as much, if not more, consideration from investors looking to capitalize on the market’s growth. With unique technology and strong fundamentals, this altcoin is poised to deliver significant returns alongside SOL. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, selecting the best altcoin to buy requires more than just hype. It demands insight, research, and a keen understanding of market trends. This expert, with years of experience analyzing blockchain projects, has identified a digital asset that stands out from the rest. The crypto expert highlights PCHAIN’s unique use case in the $600 trillion global real estate market, strong developer ecosystem, growing market demand, and high potential for mainstream adoption, which have positioned the token altcoin as the best altcoin to buy in 2025 alongside Solana.

Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, Solana has gained immense traction among developers, investors, and institutions. SOL has remained a strong contender in the crypto space due to its solid fundamentals. The Solana blockchain can handle over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), far exceeding Ethereum’s current capabilities. SOL recently hit a new all-time high in January 2025, with analysts projecting it could go even higher. Given these advantages, SOL has become a favorite among institutional investors and retail traders alike. However, according to a top crypto analyst, there is another altcoin that should be in every investor’s portfolio alongside Solana. In fact, this expert strongly believes this PCHAIN is the best altcoin to buy in 2025. PCHAIN: A leading altcoin to buy One of the most respected names in crypto research, a legendary expert in identifying emerging altcoins with high growth potential, recently stated that PCHAIN is the best altcoin to buy alongside Solana. PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-based real estate tokenization platform designed to redefine the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. The token gives investors early access to the future of the global real estate market. According to the legendary crypto expert, PCHAIN is the best altcoin to buy in 2025 because of its unique value proposition and solid fundamentals. As an RWA altcoin, PCHAIN bridges the gap between the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market and the blockchain. The token is backed by both the $600 trillion real estate market and the $16 trillion RWA tokenization market. This gives PCHAIN the needed stability to withstand the crypto market volatility, unlike traditional altcoins. The expert strongly believes that the growing market demand for RWA altcoins positions the token for historic gains. PropiChain: Leading the new frontier of global real estate market PropiChain is changing the $600+ trillion global real estate market by using technological advancement to redefine property transactions. Its next-generation platform streamlines operations, offering a faster, more efficient alternative to conventional real estate dealings. At the core of PropiChain’s solutions is its seamless integration of blockchain-based smart contracts. These self-executing digital agreements automate key real estate management processes such as property transfers, lease agreements, and rental payments. This approach eliminates the reliance on brokers and other intermediaries. By removing third-party involvement, PropiChain significantly reduces costs, enhances efficiency, and mitigates the risk of fraud in the global real estate market. PropiChain is pioneering an immersive Metaverse experience to transform property exploration. It deploys 3D virtual technology to enable investors and buyers to explore real estate properties remotely, transcending geographical limitations. With the Metaverse, a real estate investor in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) can easily explore a luxury villa in Bali or a penthouse in New York. Investors can navigate lifelike digital walkthroughs from anywhere in the world, fostering transparency and real-time engagement between buyers and sellers. A game-changing aspect of PropiChain’s ecosystem is its approach to Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. By digitizing physical properties into tradeable tokens, PropiChain enables fractional ownership, making high-value real estate markets more accessible. This tokenization model lowers financial barriers, allowing a broader range of investors to participate in lucrative property ventures without the need for substantial capital. Additionally, PropiChain harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize real estate investment strategies. AI-driven analytics assess market trends, property valuations, and risk factors, delivering data-driven insights that empower investors. Furthermore, AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots further enhance user experience, offering 24/7 personalized support and guidance throughout the investment process. By merging blockchain, AI, and Metaverse technologies, PropiChain is setting a new standard for the future of real estate, one that is more accessible, transparent, and efficient for all. PCHAIN presale: Over 46,000% ROI opportunity for early investors According to leading market analysts, the ongoing PCHAIN presale promises to be one of the most profitable in 2025. The expert’s strong conviction that this token is the best altcoin to buy in 2025 further increases investor confidence in the project’s profit potential. The PCHAIN presale has already raised over $2.5 million, highlighting the growing influx of seasoned investors who are capitalizing on the token’s high-profit potential. According to leading market analysts, your modest $1000 investment in the presale could yield over $460,750 by Q2 2025. After this second presale round, the token price will increase by over 109%.

Investors Turn to Mutuum Finance’s DeFi Lending,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-ethereum-losing-momentum-or-ready-to-rebound-investors-turn-to-mutuum-finances-defi-lending/,"Ethereum has struggled to break past key resistance levels, leaving investors uncertain about its next move. While some see signs of recovery, others are looking for alternative opportunities in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi lending platform, is gaining attention as investors explore new ways to earn passive income and maximize their holdings. With its structured lending system and growing presale demand, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a strong contender for those seeking long-term growth in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a fully decentralized lending and borrowing platform that operates without intermediaries, allowing users to retain full control over their assets. Unlike traditional lending systems, which rely on centralized institutions, Mutuum Finance leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient transactions. Users can deposit their crypto assets to earn passive income or borrow funds by providing collateral, making the platform a flexible financial tool for both lenders and borrowers. By eliminating centralized control, Mutuum Finance ensures that lending and borrowing are accessible to anyone, free from restrictions imposed by banks or other financial entities. Lenders can earn interest on their deposited assets, while borrowers can access liquidity without selling their crypto holdings. This model enhances financial freedom, reduces counterparty risk, and provides greater transparency, as all transactions are executed through smart contracts and recorded on the blockchain. Mutuum Finance is also working on launching an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be backed by on-chain assets. Unlike centralized stablecoins that are controlled by issuing entities, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be fully transparent and decentralized, ensuring security and reliability. The stablecoin will allow borrowers to mint new tokens by locking up collateral, giving them access to liquidity while maintaining ownership of their assets. This system will further strengthen the lending ecosystem and provide users with a stable, on-chain alternative for transactions. Currently, MUTM token is in the presale phase, offering early investors a chance to buy at the lowest possible price before the platform’s official launch. The token is priced at $0.01 in the first phase, with 11 total presale phases, leading up to a launch price of $0.06. The presale has already seen strong demand, with over 750 holders and $490,000 raised, indicating growing confidence in the project. This rapid fundraising is fueling FOMO among investors, as many are eager to secure MUTM tokens before prices increase in the later stages. With demand rising, the early phases of the presale are expected to sell out quickly, making it a limited-time opportunity for those looking to invest at the lowest possible price. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has been facing challenges in maintaining its momentum, with its price struggling to stay above key resistance levels. Despite an increase in the number of ETH holders, market sentiment remains mixed as traders assess whether the recent declines indicate a deeper correction or a temporary pullback. On-chain data shows that large investors have continued accumulating ETH, while futures traders have been more cautious, contributing to uncertainty in price direction. Institutional interest in Ethereum has remained subdued compared to Bitcoin, with recent outflows from Ethereum ETFs suggesting hesitation among traditional investors. However, the network’s role in DeFi and NFT markets remains strong, processing billions in daily transactions across Layer 2 networks. Analysts believe that while short-term volatility persists, Ethereum’s long-term value is still supported by its growing adoption and utility in decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining traction as a high-potential DeFi project, drawing investors looking for early entry into decentralized lending. Its strong presale demand, structured growth strategy, and upcoming platform developments make it a compelling investment for those seeking long-term gains. Meanwhile, Ethereum faces challenges in sustaining momentum, but its role in DeFi remains critical. As uncertainty lingers, many investors are turning to emerging projects like Mutuum Finance, which offers real utility and strong growth potential in the evolving crypto market.

With new capital from Morgan Creek Digital, the firm is doubling down on efforts to offer end-to-end solutions to institutional investors. Strengthening Institutional Offerings Hong Kong crypto custodian Hex Trust announced on Friday that it purchased Byte Trading for an undisclosed sum. The move expands its presence in institutional markets by bringing Byte Trading’s advanced trading platform to its custody and prime services. According to a press release made available, the transaction enhances Hex Trust’s ability to cater to institutional clients in line with its November 2024 launch of the E-Trading platform, a key component of its long-term growth strategy. Combining Byte Trading’s Low-Latency Trading Technology Byte Trading is renowned for its low-latency trading platform, designed for high-speed execution. Hex Trust said the integration of Byte Trading’s technology would enhance its trading services, offering institutions a smoother, more efficient, and secure digital asset trading experience. “Hex Trust’s acquisition of Byte Trading represents another significant step in the company’s strategic evolution,” stated Alessio Quaglini, Hex Trust’s CEO and Co-founder. “Their industry-leading technology propels our evolution as a custody provider to a global, full-service financial institution to better serve institutional investors’ escalating needs in digital assets.” Hex Trust also recently raised new funding in a round led by Morgan Creek Digital, with contributions from a number of other international investors, including Injective. Funding supports Hex Trust’s plan to complete a Series C round sometime later in 2025. Morgan Creek Digital general partner Xavier Segura is confident Hex Trust can serve the future evolving needs of institutional clients through its work of redefining the future of institutional crypto services. The Future of Institutional Crypto Services Hex Trust is a regulated business founded in 2018 that specializes in custody, staking, markets, and investment solutions for institutions, banks, and exchanges. With its recent fundraise and acquisition, Hex Trust is doubling down on regulation and security while betting on the future of institutional crypto services with seamless, end-to-end platforms.

According to new filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the wealth fund has stockpiled about $455 million worth of the asset management giant’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) wealth fund was established in 1976 to promote economic stability and prosperity for the nation. In December, Reuters reported that the fund became the world’s top wealth fund spender, passing Saudi Arabia. Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has become the largest ETF by market cap based on the flagship digital asset. In November, it was found that IBIT surpassed its gold counterpart in terms of net assets despite BlackRock’s gold ETF launching nearly two decades earlier. According to a recent Bloomberg report, BlackRock secured its commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi just last year and said it did so to work more closely with sovereign wealth funds, wealth managers and investment vehicles in the area. As stated by Charles Hatami, head of the Middle East for BlackRock, to Bloomberg, “Abu Dhabi has rapidly transformed into a global financial center. Its strategic location, proactive government policies, and commitment to sustainable growth make it an ideal location for capital markets.” IBIT is trading for $55.41 at time of writing, a 1.2% increase during the last 24 hours.

Tether, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin USDT, has been a controversial figure in U.S. cryptocurrency policy discussions, largely due to concerns over transparency. Critics have long argued that Tether has never undergone a full audit, relying instead on quarterly assessments conducted by global accounting firm BDO. Despite those concerns, Tether dominates the stablecoin market, accounting for about 60% of the $230 billion industry. The company also has a major role in global financial markets, holding more than $114 billion in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. With Congress actively working to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that the company is currently in direct contact with top lawmakers to help shape the upcoming legislation. “We will work within the regulatory framework and try to make recommendations on each of these proposals to ensure our voices are heard,” Ardoino said, referring to the three stablecoin bills introduced in the House and Senate last week. He also emphasized that Tether is committed to compliance, regardless of the final form of the legislation. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Founder Charles Hoskinson Makes Big Bullish Statements and Bitcoin Price Prediction “We’re not going to throw in the towel and let Tether die just for the sake of not complying with U.S. legislation,” Ardoino said. “But there’s still a lot of uncertainty about what’s really going to happen, and we want our voices heard in the legislative process.” Congressman Bryan Steil, Chairman of the Digital Assets Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee, confirmed to Fox Business that Tether is involved in discussions regarding the STABLE Act, a bill he introduced alongside Congressman French Hill. In addition to that legislation, two other stablecoin bills were introduced last week by Republican Senator Bill Hagerty and Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters. The GOP-controlled House and Senate are pushing for a final bill to be signed by President Trump as early as April. If enacted, the regulations would require Tether to undergo a full monthly audit by a U.S.-based accounting firm and maintain a one-to-one ratio of its reserves to pre-approved assets. *This is not investment advice.

Powell, who once criticized Bitcoin, now compares it to gold. This has caught the crypto community’s attention and sparked discussions about what it could mean for the market. Powell’s View: Bitcoin as Digital Gold Speaking at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Powell acknowledged that Bitcoin is primarily used as a speculative asset, comparing it to virtual gold. This is a big change from his earlier stance, where he was less supportive of Bitcoin. In an X post, CZ shared his thoughts on Powell’s new stance, saying the Fed Chair’s new opinion is an “improvement to the previous narrative” Even though Powell now compares Bitcoin to digital gold, he still believes it cannot replace the U.S. dollar. He points out Bitcoin’s high price swings and that it is not widely used for everyday transactions. Powell’s statement has encouraged many Bitcoin supporters. Some believe this could lead to greater acceptance of Bitcoin in the financial world. However, others think it is too early to say if this will result in positive regulation changes. Inflation Worries and the Crypto Market Even with Powell’s softened view on Bitcoin, the Federal Reserve’s actions continue to put pressure on crypto and other risky investments. The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation at 3% in January, higher than expected. The Producer Price Index (PPI) also rose to 3.5%, its highest since February 2023. Since inflation remains a problem, the Federal has not lowered interest rates, which has slowed down the crypto market’s recovery. CZ’s Dog Becomes a Crypto Sensation Aside from Powell’s Bitcoin comments, CZ has also been in the news for a different reason. After he was released from prison , CZ introduced his new dog, Broccoli. Surprisingly, this led to the launch of more than 20,000 memecoins in the market, inspired by the dog. A recent report revealed that a crypto whale made a big investment in the “BROCCOLI” token, adding to the excitement. Many traders are now trying to profit from this trend, making the memecoin market very active.

The startup, fostered by Y Combinator, quickly became a tech unicorn and an NFT sector monopolist. By 2025 the OpenSea timeline became a “rise and fall” story. On Feb. 13, the New York-based company announced the launch of a new version, OS2. The tweaks address some of the concerns while ignoring others. The NFT (non-fungible token) market is still alive, despite losing momentum. The long-term trend is far from being inspiring. Nevertheless, in 2024, the overall NFT trading volume reached $8.8 billion. The launch of OS2 is aimed at flipping the trend, which is hardly an easy task.

In recent years, the sector received a lot of negativity due to multiple scams (users lost tens of millions of dollars), security breaches, insider trading, and alleged hypocrisy of those who claim NFTs are about art and not just a money grab . NFTs have been criticized both by crypto bros and crypto skeptics. Some in the crypto community think NFTs did the crypto sector a disservice, distracting people from innovation while pushing hard-to-swallow narratives about selling JPEGs for millions of dollars and exposing newbies to risky investments. Many people who didn’t know much about crypto began to use the terms “crypto” and “NFTs” interchangeably, associating both with frauds, risks, gambling, etc. Nearly any accusation pointed at NFTs more or less applies to OpenSea as the dominating marketplace in the sector (boasting a 90% market share at its peak, dropping to 33% in 2025). According to the Verge article , a former company employee likened all the fraud, money grab, and craze that was going on across the platform in 2022 to a “blood orgy.” You might also like: OpenSea users targeted in phishing scam disguised as official NFT offers The crypto bear market worsened the company’s wealth as it stored funds in Ether ( ETH ). It saw a severe price decline in 2022. The rise of Blur and Magic Edan, the strong competitor platforms, contributed to the faster fall of OpenSea. The company was looking for new directions and ways to revitalize. At the very same time, it was continuing a series of unexpected layoffs. Additionally, the SEC unleashed a battle on NFTs and OpenSea was one of the targets. While the NFT market left the headlines and shrunk substantially, OpenSea has turned from a monopolist to a shaken survivor. The platform revamp was vital and, finally, we will witness a new version of OpenSea. What will change with the launch of OS2? The platform got a total update. The main direction is switching to a web3 realm. Now, it allows the trade of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. OS2 seamlessly works across various chains, eliminating the need to bridge or swap tokens. The long-anticipated launch of an OpenSea token ($SEA) is aimed at fostering long-term sustainability. OS2 open beta is now live: • A fully reimagined product built entirely from the ground up, for collectors and pros • NFTs 🤝 tokens, brought together in one place • Brand new, beautiful ways to explore — beyond just the floor • 14 chains (welcome @flow_blockchain , ApeChain… pic.twitter.com/fTJT5eKsm2 — OpenSea (@opensea) February 13, 2025 Announcements were met positively, with users and beta testers sharing their first impressions. Some say they lack the previous features like searching for sales by trait, but generally, the update was met with support. Critics blame security issues and plagiarism for ruining OpenSea’s user experience and the official announcement hardly touches on these issues. Moreover, OpenSea founder Devin Finzer rather emphasized a more anarchic approach on social media. “The NFT bull market changed us,” Finzer said. “We got too corporate, too web2, and let fear of risk outweigh building for users.” A lot is changing at @opensea : • We're rolling out OS2 — a brand new OpenSea built from the ground up. NFTs 🤝 tokens. • $SEA is coming from @openseafdn • We're changing policies that didn’t make sense for web3: re-enabling locked items and delisted collections, and removing… https://t.co/RMeu2TQFMC — dfinzer.eth | opensea (@dfinzer) February 13, 2025 Considering how bad OpenSea handled various security issues during its best days, the absence of the safety segment in the announcement is disappointing. It seems that the switch to web3 may be an attempt to outsource protection to end users themselves. Hopefully, updates on security will follow soon. Probably the decreased market share of OpenSea and the overall decline of the NFT craze may help the company facilitate a safer and healthier user experience. The crypto-friendly climate — with Paul Atkins nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission — sets a nice background, too. It remains to be seen whether the OpenSea revamp has the potential to become a comeback story.

Analyst Says $5.8 Is Possible Following ‘Golden Cross’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xrp-price-to-new-all-time-high-analyst-says-5-8-is-possible-following-golden-cross/,"The XRP price action has been one of the brighter spots in the cryptocurrency space in 2025, weathering virtually every storm the market has faced. However, the altcoin could not avoid the market downturn triggered by the new trade tariffs imposed by United States President Donald Trump. The price of XRP dropped to around $2.1 due to the bearish sentiment that engulfed the entire crypto market. However, the XRP token seems to be back on the bullish track, jumping by more than 12% on Friday, February 14. Here’s How XRP Could Reach New ATH In a Friday post on the X platform, pseudonymous crypto analyst Dark Defender shared an updated analysis of the XRP price. The popular crypto trader highlighted the altcoin’s potential to a new all-time high around the $8 level over the next few weeks. Related Reading: XRP Spikes 5% After SEC’s ETF Acknowledgment Sends ‘Enormous Message’ The price of XRP rallied towards $2.8 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Grayscale’s XRP ETF application. According to Dark Defender, this positive price action has provided a springboard for the altcoin’s next move. However, the crypto pundit noted that the XRP price needs to clear some hurdles, specifically a major resistance zone around $2.9, to run up to the critical Fibonacci level of $5.85 and potentially 8.03 (an almost 200% rally from the current price). Interestingly, this projection is reinforced by changes in the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. The RSI is a technical analysis indicator used to measure the balance between a token’s bullish and bearish momentum. According to Dark Defender’s post on X, the XRP RSI has recently formed a Golden Cross, a signal often associated with increased buying pressure. In the RSI — as with other indicators — a Golden Cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average. Typically, Golden Cross formations are associated with extended bullish periods, increasing the odds of XRP price maintaining its upward trend toward $5.85 and beyond. If this bullish scenario does not hold, the next support level to watch out for lies around $2.44. However, if the XRP price does not defend this demand zone in case of a pullback, investors could see the fall to the $2.3 mark. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of XRP stands at around $2.7, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the third-largest crypto is up by nearly 14% in the past seven days.

DOGE often enters a consolidation phase, gathering liquidity at levels both above and below its present price. Concerning DOGE price prediction, some analysts suggest that this buildup could spark a significant upward move once the market decides its new course. While DOGE price prediction remains uncertain, Solana price analysis offers a ray of hope, rebounding sharply after dipping below $200. This recovery was energized by positive market sentiment following Trump’s deal with Mexico. Amidst such a market, crypto fans seeking passive income are turning to BlockDAG (BDAG) . Unlike crypto trading, which is highly influenced by community and market emotions, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner app facilitates iOS and Android crypto mining, allowing users to mine sought-after BDAG coins in an unpredictable market for passive earnings. Latest Dogecoin Price Prediction Just like the wider crypto market, Dogecoin has seen a drastic fall recently. However, breaking down how DOGE price prediction is formulated is essential before drawing any conclusions. Observing the weekly DOGE price analysis, the recent significant price move lacked proper retracement. This suggests the current decline isn’t a sign of market weakness but rather a typical market correction. At this point, patience is key. DOGE usually slows down and collects liquidity at various levels before its next major move. Imagine it as a spring—the longer it compresses, the stronger its release. Thus, DOGE price prediction varies, reaching up to $0.5 or down to $0.144. Solana Price Analysis: Can SOL Hit $300? Although short-term trends for Solana seem mixed, its robust long-term fundamentals keep the $300 target attainable as momentum gathers. Adding excitement, crypto and AI authority David Sacks is scheduled to discuss the future of digital assets in America at an upcoming press conference. Should he announce plans for an American Digital Asset reserve including SOL and XRP, both could see their prices surge. Sacks, who holds Solana himself, could play a pivotal role in this upswing. Despite Solana’s drop below $200 raising alarms, its swift recovery has provided some confidence. Current Solana price analysis indicates that Solana needs to maintain support between $212-$220 and break the $250 resistance to keep up its bullish trend. A solid push past $280 would then pave the way for reaching $300 in the coming months. BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App: The Top Choice for Android Crypto Mining! Amid the rollercoaster ride of crypto market prices, earning passive income by mining BDAG coins through the BlockDAG X1 Miner app appears as a promising option. This app boasts a user-friendly interface that simplifies the mining process with just a simple tap. Designed to support Android crypto mining, it’s also compatible with iOS devices. The app’s ease of use and effective mining capabilities have attracted over half a million active users, demonstrating the community’s trust and confidence in the BlockDAG initiative. BlockDAG’s X1 App has not only seen rapid growth with over 500,000 active miners but early users have witnessed a staggering 2,380% return, with BDAG priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch. With over $195.2 million raised and 18.4 billion BDAG coins sold during the presale, analysts have hailed it as one of the standout cryptocurrencies of 2025. The anticipation for further gains and returns grows as the BDAG mainnet is set to launch this year, promising high exchange listings. With increasing users on the X1 app, the competition for mining BDAG is heating up, suggesting a diminishing supply. Starting to mine BDAG on X1 sooner rather than later could secure lucrative mining opportunities as availability decreases. Final Say The DOGE price prediction indicates a slow climb to $300, with $0.5 remaining an elusive target. Solana has also faced challenges maintaining its stance above $200, reflecting a potent bear market where quick gains are hard to come by. Yet, the BlockDAG X1 app emerges as a robust alternative for passive income generation. Supporting both iOS and Android crypto mining, this app has welcomed over 500K users, broadening access to mining for both seasoned and novice miners alike. Its straightforward interface enables quick learning and mastery of mining techniques. For those aiming to augment their income, BlockDAG’s X1 offers a zero-cost solution to enhance earnings.

While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum hold the mainstream spotlight, it’s often the lesser-known projects with robust community engagement that experience rapid growth. Among these best long-term cryptos, Web3Bay towers above the competition as the decentralized commerce juggernaut, having already amassed over $1 million in presale funds. Accompanied by four other cryptos with robust communities, they are all set to be the potential superstars of 2025. Web3Bay (3BAY): Fueling Decentralized Commerce Beyond just meme coins and speculative assets, Web3Bay addresses a significant real-world challenge—the shortcomings of traditional e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay. These centralized behemoths impose hefty fees, limit sellers, and manipulate data, hindering small businesses and independent vendors. Web3Bay rectifies these issues by facilitating a direct buyer-to-seller marketplace without intermediaries. This shift leads to reduced fees, enhanced control, and a genuinely decentralized shopping experience via blockchain. Its community-led governance model ensures that it is the users, not big corporations, who dictate the platform’s future. This model has propelled Web3Bay’s presale success, quickly raising over $1 million. Investors are catching on that Web3Bay is more than a cryptocurrency; it’s a revolution poised to transform e-commerce indefinitely. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Pinnacle of Meme Coin Fervor Dogwifhat (WIF) has surged in the crypto scene, fueled by a fervent, highly engaged community. Its whimsical branding and robust social media activity have catapulted it into prominence, marking it as one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025. However, WIF’s growth is predominantly driven by community buzz rather than tangible applications, making it a volatile choice. While it might offer short-lived spikes, it doesn’t possess the enduring adoption potential that Web3Bay has. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Bridging DeFi with Institutional Investors Ondo Finance is carving a niche as a DeFi protocol linking institutional investors with blockchain financial solutions. With a growing community and an increasing total value locked, ONDO is drawing significant attention. Yet, while Ondo caters to institutional players, Web3Bay’s focus on everyday commerce renders it more accessible to the average user, thereby enhancing its potential for widespread growth. Kaspa (KAS): The Speediest Proof-of-Work Crypto? Kaspa (KAS) is gaining attention with its rapid proof-of-work consensus mechanism, offering quick and scalable blockchain transactions. Kaspa’s strong community backing supports its ascent, despite general market downturns. Still, the future of proof-of-work cryptos is under scrutiny as many move toward more sustainable models. While Kaspa’s innovations are notable, Web3Bay’s clear use case in e-commerce outlines a more definite path to broad adoption. Hedera (HBAR): The Preferred Enterprise Blockchain Hedera (HBAR) shines as a top enterprise blockchain solution known for its efficiency and low-cost transactions. Its governance model, supported by major firms, maintains a dedicated and engaged community. Nevertheless, while Hedera targets corporate adoption, Web3Bay aims to democratize blockchain for everyday consumers, potentially leading to higher transaction volumes and practical use cases. Web3Bay’s 100X Potential: The Best Long-Term Crypto Investment While Dogwifhat leverages meme magic, Ondo caters to institutions, Kaspa champions PoW efficiency, and Hedera serves enterprises, Web3Bay is poised to revolutionize a sector that touches billions daily—online shopping. Its versatile payment system, supporting both crypto and traditional transactions (including PayPal), enhances its accessibility, addressing a major barrier to Web3 adoption. Having already secured over $1 million in presale funds, Web3Bay’s trajectory demonstrates its community’s growing strength. Early backers see Web3Bay not merely as a speculative asset but as a practical blockchain application with lasting relevance. As the Web3Bay marketplace gains momentum, the demand for its 3BAY token is expected to soar, potentially leading to significant price increases. Unlike other low-cap cryptos dependent on hype, speculation, and corporate support, Web3Bay uniquely addresses a trillion-dollar challenge in e-commerce. Key Insights! As Dogwifhat capitalizes on meme culture, Ondo Finance expands its DeFi footprint, Kaspa pushes PoW capabilities, and Hedera fortifies its enterprise blockchain, the spectrum of committed communities supporting these best long-term cryptos is broad. However, the most potent community is the one forging real-world utility—and Web3Bay is proving that its decentralized commerce vision is more substantial than mere buzz. For those scouting the premier Web3 investment for 2025, Web3Bay undoubtedly leads the race as its presale concludes and demand escalates.
