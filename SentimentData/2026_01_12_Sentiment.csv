Users have reported receiving multiple password reset request emails following the alleged hack reported by Malwarebytes. However, Meta continues to insist that there was no breach. Was Instagram’s user data leaked? Malwarebytes reported that Instagram discovered a breach in its security during a routine dark web monitoring scan. And it claims that it has resulted in the sensitive data of approximately 17.5 million Instagram users being made available for sale on underground forums so far. The compromised information includes Instagram usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and additional personal details. The cybersecurity company said this incident is linked to a potential API exposure that occurred in 2024. However, Meta , Instagram’s parent company, has so far denied the breach claims, stating it fixed a technical issue and, in the process, had password reset emails triggered by an external party. “We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people. There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure. You can ignore those emails — sorry for any confusion,” the company wrote . Despite Meta’s denial, many Instagram users have reported receiving multiple password reset request emails in recent days, and panic has spread on social media that cybercriminals are attempting to exploit people’s stolen information. The leaked information could also be used by the attackers to craft convincing fraudulent messages that make users more likely to click on malicious links or provide additional sensitive information. With access to usernames, email addresses, and phone numbers, cybercriminals can attempt to gain control of an individual’s accounts. The attackers can use it to spread spam, scam the victim’s followers, or access any linked payment information or private messages. The physical addresses included in the breach could potentially be used for identity theft, targeted harassment, or even to threaten someone’s physical safety. How can Instagram users protect themselves? ManageMyHealth, New Zealand’s largest patient portal with about 1.8 million registered users, revealed that there was unauthorized access to its application. It stated that approximately 6% to 7% of its users may be impacted, which is roughly 108,000 to 126,000 people. Security experts strongly recommend that all Instagram users take immediate protective measures like enabling two-factor authentication on their accounts. The security feature requires a second form of verification beyond just your password, which is typically a code sent to your phone or generated by an authentication app. They also recommend changing your Instagram password, especially if you’ve been using the same password for an extended period or if you’ve reused it across multiple platforms. Users should create strong, unique passwords that have uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers and special characters. Instagram users have been warned to be skeptical of unexpected emails, text messages, or direct messages asking for personal information or urging immediate action. Meta was in a similar situation back in November 2024 when a leak reportedly exposed 489 million Instagram user records on a dark web platform.

Investors Prefer This New Altcoin Over Shiba Inu (SHIB),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-with-300-investors-prefer-this-new-altcoin-over-shiba-inu-shib/,"Many new people enter into crypto with a simple question. Which crypto is the most profitable when investing with a low amount of money. To a number of people three hundred dollars is sufficient to place a bet on something which has the potential of increasing in the long run. In previous bull markets, the solution could have been Shiba Inu (SHIB). The discussion is changing to new altcoins that are much further down their growth curves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the names that drew attention. According to some analysts, the difference is in utility, the room of valuation, and timing. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu was trendy when the meme coins were enjoying their boom. It shot up thousands of per cent as traders jumped in. Nowadays, the token is trading at $0.000009 and has a market capitalization of $5B. SHIB still is popular and has a big community. It has also been quoted on most of the major exchanges. That provides it with liquidity, but it also puts a ceiling. The price action has been languishing beneath critical resistance levels for months. Cryptocurrency traders citing crypto charts suggest that it lacks new stimuli and it becomes hard to propel a multi-billion dollar valuation without new utility. According to some market commentators, SHIB might not be able to get back to its early highs, particularly in the absence of a new story to power demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new cryptocurrency that is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform. The protocol will also allow the users to deposit assets in liquidity pools and earn interest. Loans are allowed where the borrowers post collateral rather than selling their possession. The platform utilizes the use of mtTokens to monitor supplied assets and debt tokens to monitor loans. The MUTM token is under presale. It is priced around $0.04 in Phase 7. Already, the presale has raised over 19M and more than 18,800 holders. Being limited in the number of slots per stage and price, the increased demand will result in the stages selling out and advancing to the next crypto stage of the price scale. Phase 1 appreciation of close to 300% have already been seen by early entrants. 3 Reasons MUTM May Do Better Than SHIB Valuation Room and Growth Curve. Shiba Inu has already reached a $5B market cap. That degree restricts its distance of movement. A lot of traders realize that SHIB will not be able to replicate its initial growth since such exponential returns were achieved on a small valuation foundation. Mutuum Finance is in the initial growth curve. The market capitalization is very low and the token is yet to be potentially listed on any big exchange. This will leave it space to grow within a new crypto cycle in case the product is adopted. To an individual with $300 that is significant. Utility vs Meme Dynamics SHIB remains a meme token. It is culturally high with little direct usage. Demand depends on sentiment. That is a problem in lateral markets. Mutuum Finance is organized with respect to real utility. Collateralized borrowing gives yield to the lenders. It operates by the buy and redistribute system in which the MUTM bought on the open market is re-distributed to users who stake the mtTokens in the safety module. That links revenues of the platform to token demand. This, according to commentators in the market, makes a more sustainable token economy. Timing and Capital Rotation Timing is also a factor. There are already thousands of former SHIB owners who have made some money. Certain analysts feel that they are now moving to presales and early stage protocols with better upside potential. Mutuum Finance has recorded high presale momentum. The team also attested that its V1 platform is going live on testnet. Such developments present investors with something new to look forward to other than price. Incentives and Onboarding Support Mutuum Finance (MUTM) passed an audit by Halborn Security . That has assisted in confidence building before launch. It also operates a 24 hour leader board in the project that rewards the best daily contributor with $500 of MUTM. A bug bounty of $50k is also available concerning the code vulnerabilities. These rewards have assisted in driving the presale and also maintained the community interest. With increasing numbers of investors posing the question of which crypto to purchase during the upcoming bull cycle, MUTM is regarded as an altcoin with a higher potential of earlier stages of development than Shiba Inu. The disparities in developing utility, timing, and valuation justify why numerous new entrants with $300 to invest are considering things other than the old meme tokens and a fresh take on projects that may outline the subsequent stage of crypto investment.

The two companies will work together to let users put money on what they think will happen to median prices in cities like Miami and Los Angeles for starters. These markets will close on February 1, using Parcl’s daily price index to determine winners. But according to Polymarket, there will be new housing prediction markets every month, so people can keep trading based on fresh data. Right now, most Americans still can’t use Polymarket; access is limited to a waitlist. But its competitors, like Kalshi and Robinhood, are already open to the public. Users bet on real-time housing price movements The housing market has always been full of stale data. Most price indicators use past sales and come out months after the fact. Real estate agents and analysts say that’s still the most reliable way to judge demand in a city. But the problem is that these reports move slower than the market itself. Polymarket wants to change that by giving people real-time exposure. And supporters say prediction markets have a major advantage, as people are literally betting their own cash. When money is on the line, people pay more attention. These types of bets aren’t just about opinion. They’re about incentives. And apparently, those incentives work. Polymarket traders were closer to predicting Donald Trump’s 2024 win than most political polling firms. The idea is simple: when a lot of people put skin in the game, the average of their bets often beats expert guesses or surveys. This is happening as the U.S. housing market hits a new, weird milestone. There are now more homeowners with mortgage rates above 6% than below 3%. During the pandemic, loans under 3% were common. Now they’re rare. The average 30-year mortgage rate has stayed above 6% for more than three years, according to Federal Reserve numbers. People who locked in those low rates are staying put. They don’t want to trade a cheap loan for a more expensive one. This has made the housing supply tight. Fewer listings means higher prices, a situation known as the mortgage lock-in effect. Market stays frozen as rates discourage sellers Even though rates are high, people still sell when they have no other choice. Life happens. Jobs change, families grow, divorces hit, people retire. That’s why some homes still hit the market. But most of the new 30-year mortgages are now in the 6% range, so the pool of ultra-low-rate owners keeps shrinking. Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, said the shift from sub-3% to over-6% mortgages won’t fix things fast.“It’s becoming less of a problem the more that time goes on, but it’s a slow unwinding,” she said. To her, anyone with a rate under 4% is still basically stuck. That includes over half of all current mortgage holders. Even rates under 5% are too good for most people to walk away from. “It’s probably going to be another four, five years of it being a major factor in the housing market,” said Daryl. A Bankrate survey in July found that 54% of Americans wouldn’t sell their homes no matter what the mortgage rate is. That’s up from 42% the year before. About 32% said they’d only sell if rates dropped below 6%, and 23% said they’d need to see them below 5%. That 1% difference might not sound like a lot, but over a 30-year loan, it can add up to tens of thousands of dollars. Not everyone is sold on the idea of betting on housing data. Stephen Kates, a senior analyst at Bankrate, said there’s already enough tracking happening in the space. “This partnership simply allows participants to speculate on existing trends,” he said.

After reaching an all-time high in 2025, the cryptocurrency continues to show strength in early trading sessions. Analysts and industry observers are noting its potential to maintain a robust upward trajectory throughout the year. Rising Above Key Levels XRP’s early gains in 2026 signal renewed confidence among investors. The price breaking above $2 reflects sustained buying pressure. This level, previously a point of resistance, now acts as a foundation for potential further growth. The shift indicates that market participants view XRP as a strong asset with continued upside potential. YoungHoon Kim (@yhbryankimiq), a prominent voice in the crypto community with an IQ of 276, shared his outlook on the currency. He stated that XRP is in a super-cycle, and its recent performance supports that view. He previously predicted that the asset could hit a new all-time high this month , and this assessment suggests he sees 2026 as a year of decisive gains. Analysts who track XRP’s performance have echoed similar optimism, noting that technical signals and historical trends support ongoing growth. HUGE WARNING: Ripple SOLD $8B XRP?! And YES, Ripple will sell MORE XRP in 2026! But here’s what most people get WRONG • Why this is NOT bearish • Ripple will NEVER sell 25 BILLION XRP • XRP on exchanges is at an 8-YEAR LOW This is NOT a dump, this is strategic… pic.twitter.com/QqwwoHS2T2 — Crypto X AiMan (@CryptoXAiMan) January 10, 2026 Market Momentum and Predictions XRP’s performance in early 2026 builds on the gains recorded in 2025. After hitting an all-time high last year , the cryptocurrency has drawn attention for its ability to maintain bullish trends. The current price action supports expectations for continued strength, as investors respond to positive momentum. Kim emphasized the significance of the current cycle, and if he is right, everything could change for XRP. His view aligns with forecasts from other analysts who predict further gains and widespread adoption. He has also previously set a 5-year timeline for XRP to hit $100 , and the current super cycle could contribute to that growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The combination of technical strength and market interest points to a period of sustained activity for XRP throughout the year. Investor Confidence and Outlook Investor sentiment appears firmly positive. The move above $2 has reinforced confidence in XRP’s potential. Overcoming support levels provides stability while enabling future price increases. Early 2026 trends suggest that XRP may continue to outperform expectations, building on the gains of the previous year. With Kim’s prediction of a super cycle, XRP may enter a phase of extended growth. This perspective encourages investors to closely monitor price action, as continued activity above key levels often strengthens momentum.

In this context, the relative strength index ( RSI ) is among the notable indicators being used to gauge market conditions and inform decisions. Notably, the RSI measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100. When RSI readings climb above 70, it typically signals that an asset is overbought, meaning it may have risen too quickly and could be due for a correction or pullback as sellers step in to take profits. Now, for investors looking for assets to buy in the coming week, some tokens are flashing high RSI readings, signaling the need for caution. Polygon (POL) Starting with Polygon ( POL ), the token, priced at $0.169, has shown mixed performance in the immediate term, with a 5.8% decline in the past 24 hours. However, its RSI readings paint a clearer picture of the underlying momentum. On the 15-minute timeframe, the RSI sits at 51.79, indicating neutral conditions in the very short term. The one-hour RSI is 47.12, still balanced, but the four-hour reading rises to 61.39, edging toward stronger buying pressure. The real concern emerges over longer periods, with the 12-hour RSI at 80.25 and the 24-hour RSI at 76.34. POL RSI readings. Source: Coinglass These elevated levels above 70 suggest that POL has experienced sustained upward momentum that may not be sustainable, increasing the risk of a reversal. Investors considering entry points should monitor for signs of cooling, as overbought conditions like these often precede periods of consolidation or downward adjustment. Render (RENDER) Similarly, Render ( RENDER ), trading at $2.615, has demonstrated stronger recent gains, up 13.99% over the past 24 hours, reflecting heightened interest in the token. Its RSI values, however, raise red flags for those eyeing trades this week. The 15-minute RSI stands at 70.53, already crossing into overbought territory and hinting at short-term buying exhaustion. This has intensified on the one-hour chart at 76.58, showing even stronger momentum. While the four-hour RSI dips slightly to 69.39, just below the threshold, it rebounds on the 12-hour timeframe to 73.33 and on the 24-hour to 75.97. RENDER RSI readings. Source: Coinglass Such consistently high readings across multiple timeframes imply that RENDER’s price surge could be overextended, making it vulnerable to profit-taking and a potential dip. Traders may benefit from waiting for the RSI to fall back toward more neutral levels, around 50, before committing capital.

57078753,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=893122,1768163470,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57078753.jpeg,Walmart partners with Google to integrate Gemini AI assistant for seamless shopping,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/walmart-taps-googles-ai-assistant/,"Walmart shoppers will soon get help from Google’s artificial intelligence assistant when buying groceries and other products, the companies said Sunday during a major retail conference in New York City. The two companies announced their partnership at the National Retail Federation’s Big Show at the Javits Center. John Furner, who becomes Walmart’s next CEO, and Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai shared the news on stage, though they didn’t reveal when the service would start or what the deal costs. The feature will first arrive in the U.S. before moving to other countries. The partnership lets Walmart customers use Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, to find and purchase items from both Walmart stores and Sam’s Club. This move comes as more people turn to AI chatbots for shopping help. Walmart already works with ChatGPT, a competing AI system made by OpenAI. That deal, announced in October , created something called Instant Checkout. This lets people buy products without leaving the chatbot. OpenAI rolled out this feature recently and has similar agreements with Etsy and several Shopify stores, including Skims, Vuori, and Spanx. Walmart also runs its own AI helper called Sparky. It appears as a yellow smiley face inside the company’s mobile app. “The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,” Furner said in a written statement. “We aren’t just watching the shift, we are driving it.” Speaking at the conference, Furner said the company is “rewriting the retail playbook.” With AI, Walmart wants to “close the gap between I want it and I have it,” he explained. Furner takes over as Walmart’s top boss on Feb. 1. Pichai called the partnership exciting and said AI adoption marks a “transformative” moment for retail. For Walmart, customer shopping patterns are changing. More people now start their product searches in AI chatbots instead of going directly to Walmart’s website or app. This shift is forcing the retailer to rethink how it operates online. David Guggina, who runs online shopping for Walmart U.S., said AI agents “help us meet customers earlier in their shopping journey and in more places.” He added that these tools will eventually “make it easier for customers to find what they need, want, and love.” Company leaders have also talked about how AI will change jobs at Walmart, which employs more people than any other private company in America. Doug McMillon, the current CEO who’s retiring, said, “It’s very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.” Google launched a package of tools to help stores create their own AI assistants Google aims to make it simpler for brands to connect with shoppers who use AI technology. These retail AI agents help people find products, answer customer questions, and even let diners order food at restaurants. Google calls this package Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience. These Google tools mark the company’s first major push into AI-based shopping for stores. The market for this type of shopping is just starting to take shape. As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, OpenAI started the race last fall when it released Instant Checkout, which lets users buy things directly through ChatGPT. In January, Microsoft announced a similar checkout feature for its Copilot chatbot. But when retailers make their products available inside AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini, they risk losing customer loyalty and missing chances to sell additional items. It could also reduce advertising money. By building their own AI agents and shopping tools, retailers keep more control over how AI shows and delivers their products. “There’s a market shift across the spectrum of retailers who are investing in their own capabilities rather than just relying on third parties,” said Lauren Wiener, who works at Boston Consulting Group. Walmart expands drone delivery network Walmart also plans a major expansion of its drone delivery service this year. Walmart will add delivery-by-drone at 150 more stores over the next year, working with Wing, a drone operator owned by Alphabet. The company wants drone service at more than 270 locations nationwide by the end of 2027. This represents a big increase from current operations, which mainly serve the Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta areas. Wing estimates more than 40 million Walmart shoppers would have access after the expansion, up from roughly 2 million today. “We want to help customers get what they want, when they want, and where they want it,” said Greg Cathey, senior vice president of digital fulfillment transformation at Walmart. “Drone delivery is especially helpful when customers need just one to a handful of items fast.” Companies from Walmart and Amazon to delivery app DoorDash have started aerial deliveries in parts of the U.S. over the past several years. The companies see the delivery method as a quick, convenient way for shoppers to get online orders delivered to their homes. But the rollout of the technology has mostly been sporadic and limited to specific regions. Drone operators have faced regulatory obstacles, community concerns about noise, safety, and privacy, and limitations to flying in inclement weather.

A crypto analyst recently revealed that the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade beneath a critical price threshold. Why The Present Scenario Raises Caution Among Investors In a January 10 post on social media platform X, analyst Ali Martinez shared that the Bitcoin price has continued to trade underneath its 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA). This not-so-optimistic trend, according to the crypto pundit, has been ongoing for the past nine weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maintains Mid-$90k Levels: Possible Price Targets — Analyst For context, the 50-week SMA is a long-term technical indicator that calculates, on average, the closing price of an asset — in this case, Bitcoin — over the past 50 weeks. This indicator is particularly useful in establishing points of dynamic support and resistance during differing market cycles. For example, it functions as support during bull markets and acts as resistance in bear markets. When Bitcoin trades above the 50W SMA, it is often a sign that the market is in a strong uptrend. Contrarily, when the Bitcoin price trades beneath this dynamic resistance level for an extended period, it indicates that upside momentum is weakening and that major corrections might soon ensue. Interestingly, historical data is the source of this observation. From the chart shared below, there are recurrent periods where the Bitcoin price stayed consistently below the 50W SMA. In those past cycles, these periods of prolonged deviation beneath the 50W SMA preceded major pullbacks for BTC, which often ranged between 50% to 70%. Notably, the pullbacks seen did not end Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend. Rather — as is typical of corrections — they likely served as reset phases, where excessive leverage was wiped out of the market in preparation for the next long-term continuations. As a result, concerns have been raised among Bitcoin market participants, considering the similarity of the current setup to past ones. If history were to repeat itself here, the Bitcoin price could see a pullback by at least 50%, with the price falling to levels as low as $50,000. Bitcoin Price Outlook On a more positive note, the Bitcoin price still has a chance to escape the snares of its historical woes. For this to happen, the world’s leading cryptocurrency would have to reclaim the 50-week moving average and hold above it for prolonged periods. As of press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $90,352, reflecting no movement in the past day.

Check Out This Structure,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-could-still-mimic-a-rally-similar-to-2017-in-2026-check-out-this-structure/,"XRP could be preparing for a major upward move, echoing patterns seen in 2017. A recent chart shared by crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) highlights a comparison between 2017 and the current price action leading into 2026. The analysis suggests that if history repeats, XRP may experience a significant rally toward double digits. Historical Patterns Repeat ChartNerd points to a series of patterns, including a double top, a wick drop, and a price explosion. This sequence appeared in 2016/17, preceding a strong surge in price. The analyst suggests that similar conditions could be setting up now. The current chart shows XRP consolidating in a narrow range for over a year , mirroring the pre-rally compression seen in 2016. The chart indicates that XRP is approaching a key decision point. Multi-month support has been defended for the last 13 months. Holding this level is critical for any potential upside. Losing it could invalidate the bullish scenario, while maintaining it may set the stage for a repeat of past performance. $XRP could still mimic a rally similar to 2017 in 2026 #Ripple Check out the structure If it does, we're looking at double-digit FIB extension targets this year Negate by losing multi-month support that's been defended for the last 13 months https://t.co/zztliQR2FS pic.twitter.com/42gec2ynom — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 10, 2026 SRSI Reset Signals Shift An important technical signal highlighted in the chart is the SRSI reset. ChartNerd marked the SRSI reset both in 2017 and currently, indicating a potential turning point. This technical indicator suggests the market may be ready to shift momentum from consolidation to an upward trajectory. The price action on the chart suggests a breakout potential above the consolidation zone. In 2016, breaking this pattern led to a rapid price increase. The projection for 2026 shows a similar structure, with the green zones suggesting strong potential gains if the breakout occurs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Path Forward Historical context strengthens this analysis. In 2016, XRP traded in a sideways pattern for several months before triggering a sharp rally. The current setup closely mirrors that timeframe, suggesting that the market may be entering a comparable phase. The chart also shows clear rejection at the double top areas, emphasizing the importance of maintaining support to sustain a bullish outlook. If the market replicates the 2016 sequence, XRP could reach double-digit Fibonacci extension targets during this cycle. XRP’s chart indicates the market is positioned at a critical point. Historical parallels, technical resets, and strong multi-month support suggest that the stage is set for a potential breakout. The outcome in the coming months will determine if XRP can follow the trajectory seen in 2017. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The nation’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange could reverse its backing for legislation aimed at creating rules for the crypto market, which lawmakers plan to release Monday and review in Senate committee proceedings Thursday, a source close to the company told Bloomberg. The exchange wants any provisions about customer rewards limited to requiring more transparency, rather than outright bans or major limitations. Some proposals being discussed would only let licensed financial institutions offer such rewards, according to people working in the industry. Traditional banks support this approach, saying accounts that pay returns on stablecoins would pull money out of regular banks. Coinbase has asked regulators for a national trust charter that might eventually qualify it to provide rewards under these tighter rules. However, crypto companies want to keep offering platform rewards without needing such approval, warning that stronger limits could hurt fair competition. The possibility of Coinbase pulling its support carries weight Crypto companies spent more money on the 2023-2024 election than any other industry sector, pouring massive amounts into campaigns for their preferred politicians. Coinbase, run by co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong, gave $1 million to Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony and is helping fund the president’s planned White House ballroom. These rewards matter greatly to Coinbase’s bottom line. The company and Circle Internet Group Inc. split some of the interest earned from money backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. USDC sitting in Coinbase accounts creates a reliable income that becomes especially important when crypto prices drop. Coinbase also holds a minority ownership in Circle, which is now the top stablecoin company following rules set by federal law passed in July. The exchange gets customers to keep USDC on its platform by giving 3.5% rewards on Coinbase One account holdings. If the new bill blocks this perk, fewer users might store stablecoins there, potentially cutting into Coinbase’s total stablecoin earnings, which Bloomberg figures show could have hit $1.3 billion in 2025. The final impact depends on exactly how lawmakers write the bill. But people involved in the talks say some language about rewards will definitely appear in the legislation. Trump’s second term brought quick victories for digital money companies, including the first nationwide rules for stablecoin issuers through the GENIUS Act in July. After Trump signed it, stores and traditional finance companies rushed to announce stablecoin plans. The Trump family even launched its own stablecoin called USD1 through World Liberty Financial before the law took effect. While the administration wants more bills passed quickly, the rewards question has damaged the bipartisan agreement on the market bill. Coinbase’s warning about possibly withdrawing support shows growing friction that might delay the legislation, potentially killing any chance of passage this year. Without support from both parties during markup, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Nathan Dean estimates the odds of something passing in the first six months drop below 70%. What the GENIUS Act already settled The GENIUS Act stops stablecoin issuers from paying interest or returns just for holding tokens, but it allows third-party partners like Coinbase to offer rewards based on customer balances. Banks have criticized exchanges paying stablecoin rewards, arguing this threatens to drain money from banking and weaken local lending. “If billions are displaced from community bank lending, small businesses, farmers, students, and home buyers in towns like ours will suffer,” the American Bankers Association wrote recently. “Crypto exchanges and the constellation of stablecoin-affiliated companies are not designed to fill the lending gap, nor will they be able to offer FDIC-insured products, a point they omit from their aggressive advertising.” The Senate Banking Committee marks up the Market Structure bill next week, and stablecoin rewards remain under debate. Congress already settled this in GENIUS—reopening it now only creates uncertainty and risks the future of the US Dollar as commerce moves onchain. Here’s why… — Faryar Shirzad 🛡️ (@faryarshirzad) January 7, 2026 Crypto companies counter that banks are trying to reverse what the GENIUS Act already settled. Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, wrote on X that keeping stablecoin rewards helps maintain dollar dominance, pointing out that China recently said it would pay interest on its digital yuan. Lawmakers face a difficult choice This puts senators in a tough spot, pressured by the administration to pass legislation while facing an issue where the middle ground seems hard to find. One compromise might restrict rewards to entities with banking licenses or financial charters, sources said. Five crypto companies recently got preliminary approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to become national trust banks, though banking groups fought these approvals hard , claiming crypto firms are stretching the charter’s purpose and could threaten financial stability. Even with restrictions, some industry insiders think crypto firms would just find new ways around them. “There’s no world in which we won’t be able to reward consumers for taking actions within applications,” William Gaybrick, president of technology and business at Stripe, said last year. “In a world where you’re holding stablecoins within an app, that application will find some way to give you credit for doing so.” Get seen where it counts.

Pump.fun was listed among seven Solana apps that generated more than $100 million in revenue during the year, as meme coin issuance and speculative trading remained a major activity driver on the network. Pump.fun Stole the Spotlight According to the latest findings by Solana, alongside Pump.fun, five other launchpads each recorded over $1 billion in volume in 2025. They collectively contributed to launchpad revenues doubling year-over-year to $762 million. Pump.fun also played an important role in rising token creation as launchpads collectively generated 11.6 million tokens, more than double the prior year. However, only a small fraction, about 0.89%, progressed beyond bonding curve launches. Despite meme coin trading volume declining 10% year-over-year to $482 billion, Solana noted that activity was still up roughly 80 times compared with two years earlier. Beyond Pump.fun, Solana reported that total app revenue across the network reached $2.39 billion in 2025. This figure was up 46% year over year and marked a new all-time high. In addition to Pump.fun, revenue leaders included Axiom Exchange, Meteora, Raydium, Jupiter, Photon, and Bullx, each generating more than $100 million. Apps on the network, earning under $100 million, collectively generated more than $500 million in revenue during the year. At the protocol level, Solana said network REV climbed to $1.4 billion, which was a 48-fold increase over the past two years, while average transaction fees continued to decline, and median fees fell to $0.0011. Solana’s broader network metrics pointed to rising usage and asset activity. The blockchain processed 33 billion non-vote transactions in 2025, and averaged 1,054 non-vote transactions per second. Meanwhile, daily active wallets averaged 3.2 million, up 50% year over year. Stablecoin supply more than doubled to $14.8 billion, and $11.7 trillion in stablecoins were transferred over the year. Tokenized equities, on the other hand, debuted on the network with $1 billion in supply. DEXs, and ETFs Additionally, decentralized exchange volume reached $1.5 trillion, led by Raydium, Orca, and Meteora, while DEX aggregators such as Jupiter accounted for a growing share of trading activity. Staked SOL reached record highs in 2025, while Solana ETFs recorded $1.02 billion in net inflows amidst heightened institutional demand.

Thousands of users received fake push notifications and emails, promoting the classic “crypto giveaway” scam. Users received the fake alerts from Betterment’s mobile app. Others received emails promoting the giveaway scam. The fake message promised to triple users’ cryptocurrencies. The “promo” was valid for three hours. Crypto attackers impersonate Betterment The email instructed users to deposit as little as $1 or up to $750,000 in Bitcoin or Ether. The mobile app notification said, “For example, if you send $10,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum, we’ll send you right back $30,000 to your sending Bitcoin or Ethereum address.” The hackers added specific Bitcoin and Ether wallet addresses. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin wallet had received 0.14626084 BTC, or $13,290.75. The Ether wallet has a net flow of $1,779.30. A screenshot of the fake mobile app notification. Source: X . Two hours after the breach, the Betterment team issued a warning on X and Reddit. On Reddit, a Betterment representative replied to a thread about the hack, saying, “We apologize for the confusion. This is not a real offer from Betterment…” On X, Betterment’s official account explained that an unauthorized person gained access to its system. This allowed the attacker to send emails and push notifications on behalf of the company. The company clarified , “If you clicked on the offer notification, it did not compromise the security of your Betterment account.” Betterment reassured users, saying that “The unauthorized access has been removed,” and an investigation has been initiated. In a follow-up post, Betterment said the fake promo came from a third-party system. It wrote , “This was an unauthorized message sent via a third-party system we use for marketing and other customer communications.” Upon further inspection, the fake emails came from two inboxes belonging to e[dot]betterment[dot]com. This appears to be a subdomain of Betterment’s main website. A Redditor said , “I got an email about this. Everything appears to check out, headers look good, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all passed.” This means the email was cryptographically authenticated. It was not a spoofed Gmail or a fake sender line. Betterment’s domain approved the fake email. It’s unclear if user data was leaked from Betterment’s database to the dark web . Moreover, the compromised third-party tool is unidentified yet.

Solana (SOL) Whales Accumulate This New Altcoin for 500% Upside,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-crypto-to-hit-1-solana-sol-whales-accumulate-this-new-altcoin-for-500-upside/,"Whenever traders are seeking the next crypto to purchase, Solana (SOL) is a name that appears frequently. Early investors made considerable profits because of its fast development during the previous cycles. However, crypto markets evolve in the short term. A new altcoin is currently watched by some investors. The initial whale action implies that big investors are incorporating it into their holdings. This has cast doubts on whether there is a next crypto to hit $1. To long-term investors, the difference between a large established token and a new player can help accentuate the various ways to possible advantages. Solana (SOL) The past few years have seen Solana become one of the most followed cryptocurrencies. It was known to have a fast transaction and a low fee, which brought developers who created decentralized applications, finances, and NFTs. SOL is trading at an average of $138 at the time of writing, and has a market cap of 78B. These measurements make it one of the best crypto coins in terms of value. Solana has headwinds, despite its strong position. Price action has demonstrated resistance zones in the crypto charts, which it finds difficult to clear off. Quite a number of traders consider these areas to be levels where the selling pressure escalates. Even during bullish times, it is difficult to break above them. According to market commentators this could restrain the short term upside of Solana unless new catalysts are discovered. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a rather new cryptocurrency that is associated with a decentralized lending and borrowing scheme. It is also in presale stages, unlike the more established tokens. The token is now valued at approximately $0.04 in Phase 7 of the sale that has already raised over $19M. More than 18,800 holders have attended and the stages have always sold out in a short time. Increased demand shifts the presale to a higher price range. The Mutuum Finance platform is programmed to enable users to deposit assets in liquidity pools and receive interest. Borrowers are able to access loans through collateralizing loans. The system assigns the assets or debt deposits using mtTokens, and debt positions using debt tokens. Mutuum Finance also has a buy and redistribute business model in which MUTM bought on the open market is redistributed to users who stake the mtTokens in the safety module. Other analysts feel that this produces a demand pressure that helps token value in the long run. Mutuum Finance has an ongoing roadmap which involves the release of the first version of the protocol on testnet. These developments provide the participants with a better understanding of the progress than the tokens with soft timelines or no product in the market. SOL vs MUTM Price Predictions The following considerations are useful when considering future price movements: comparing a mature token such as Solana and a younger project in its early years. In the case of SOL, there are comments from the market with some reservations. Having a large market cap with huge resistance levels, they indicate that price might not experience the same momentum as previous cycles. The bearish to neutral cases are that SOL may not be able to push significantly higher than the existing levels without an influx of new users or significant network upgrades. Many large tokens are faced with this fact: the larger the token, the slower its relative growth. Mutuum Finance, in its turn, is in the earlier stage, and it has more space to expand. Assuming that the lending protocol acquires users and revenue, and assuming that presale momentum persists to post-launch trading, some analysts believe that MUTM would experience high moves. To illustrate, in a potential situation when MUTM can become listed on large stock exchanges and demand grows to exceeding $0.20, that would be a 400% rise in the existing price. On a positive note, forecasts indicate that even more might happen as long as the adoption and the ecosystem growth rate increase. This analogy indicates that valuation base and utility have potential in shaping expectations. The size of Solana is more difficult to make a substantial percentage change without significant network changes. Mutuum Finance, in turn, is premature. This very stance provides it with a story of high returns in case the project hits the goals. Halborn Security Audit Security and engagement mechanisms are also relevant to the investors who are triaging through what crypto to invest in today. Mutuum Finance has an audit with Halborn Security . The audit enhances an element of confidence regarding the core code of the platform prior to wider release. When the projects are successfully audited by reputable firms, they tend to attract more attention by the retail and institutional investors. Mutuum Finance also has a 24 hour leaderboard in which the most active contributor of the day will get a reward of $500 in MUTM. Such an interaction maintains the level of activity near the presale and fosters more engagement by the community. Investors who are interested in what crypto to buy now, or rather which crypto to buy to gain in the long-term, a comparison of old firms like Solana with new pre-sale tokens like Mutuum Finance can help them better understand risk-reward. Diversified crypto investment strategies include roles of both large and small cap projects. Their differences are important to decide on wisely.

This urgent call, reported by The Block on March 15, 2025, follows Reform UK’s announcement that it would become Britain’s first political party to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency donations starting in May 2025. The Labour lawmakers argue that crypto donations could enable foreign interference and create substantial transparency challenges in election funding. Crypto Political Donations Spark National Security Concerns The Labour committee chairs represent multiple parliamentary committees including the Treasury, Home Affairs, and Foreign Affairs select committees. Consequently, they bring substantial expertise to the debate about political finance security. Their collective letter to the government highlights specific concerns about cryptocurrency’s potential to undermine UK election integrity. The lawmakers emphasize that digital assets could facilitate foreign state actors in influencing British politics through untraceable funding channels. Political finance experts note that cryptocurrency transactions can bypass traditional banking systems that currently monitor political donations. Additionally, blockchain transactions often provide pseudonymity rather than complete anonymity. However, sophisticated mixing services and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies could potentially obscure donation origins. The Electoral Commission currently requires all donations over £500 to come from permissible donors with verifiable UK connections. Crypto donations might complicate these verification processes significantly. Reform UK’s Groundbreaking Crypto Donation Policy Nigel Farage’s Reform UK announced its cryptocurrency acceptance policy in February 2025, marking a potential turning point in British political fundraising. The party plans to accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies through established payment processors. Reform UK officials argue that cryptocurrency donations represent financial innovation and broader accessibility for younger, tech-savvy supporters. They also claim their system will maintain necessary transparency through blockchain analysis tools. This policy shift follows similar developments in other democracies. For instance, political action committees in the United States have accepted cryptocurrency donations since 2014. Australia’s political parties have debated cryptocurrency donations since 2022. The UK debate therefore occurs within a growing international conversation about digital assets in political systems. Reform UK’s implementation will likely influence whether other British parties follow similar paths or support Labour’s proposed ban. Expert Analysis: Balancing Innovation and Security Dr. Eleanor Vance, political finance researcher at the London School of Economics, explains the technical challenges. “Blockchain analysis can trace many cryptocurrency transactions,” she notes. “However, determined actors can use privacy coins, mixers, or overseas exchanges to obscure donation trails. The real concern isn’t mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but rather privacy-focused alternatives that resist tracking.” Comparative data shows varying international approaches: Country Crypto Donation Policy Implementation Year United States Permitted with disclosure 2014 Australia Debated, not implemented 2022 Canada Effectively banned 2021 United Kingdom Currently unregulated 2025 debate The UK’s current political donation framework operates under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. This legislation requires: Donor identification for contributions over £500 Permissible donor verification (UK registered voters, companies, etc.) Quarterly reporting to the Electoral Commission Foreign donation prohibitions Technical Challenges in Crypto Donation Tracking Blockchain technology presents unique challenges for political finance regulators. While transactions are publicly recorded on distributed ledgers, wallet addresses don’t automatically identify individuals or entities. Furthermore, cryptocurrency can move across borders instantly without intermediary financial institutions. This characteristic potentially enables foreign actors to fund UK political campaigns despite existing prohibitions. The Labour committee chairs specifically highlight several technical concerns: Pseudonymity issues: Wallet addresses mask real-world identities Cross-border flows: Cryptocurrency ignores national boundaries Privacy coins: Monero, Zcash and similar cryptocurrencies resist analysis Exchange fragmentation: Global exchanges with varying KYC standards Electoral Commission officials have previously acknowledged these challenges in parliamentary testimony. They noted that existing donation reporting systems weren’t designed for cryptocurrency transactions. Additionally, the Commission lacks specialized blockchain analysis capabilities that financial regulators possess. This capability gap creates potential vulnerabilities in the political donation monitoring system. Historical Context: Political Finance Regulation Evolution UK political donation regulation has evolved significantly since the 19th century. The Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act of 1883 first established spending limits and candidate expenses reporting. Subsequent reforms addressed emerging challenges including corporate donations, union funding, and foreign interference. The current framework developed after the 1998 Committee on Standards in Public Life report, which recommended the Electoral Commission’s creation. Cryptocurrency represents the latest technological challenge to this regulatory framework. Previous technological shifts included credit card donations, online fundraising platforms, and digital payment systems. Each innovation required regulatory adjustments to maintain transparency and prevent abuse. The cryptocurrency debate continues this pattern of technological adaptation in political finance systems. Potential Impacts on UK Political Landscape The crypto donation debate could significantly affect UK political competition. Smaller parties might benefit from accessing global cryptocurrency communities. However, established parties with traditional donor bases might resist changes to the current system. The debate also intersects with broader discussions about political finance reform, including donation caps and public funding alternatives. International experience suggests several possible outcomes if crypto donations proceed without regulation: Increased small-donor participation from crypto enthusiasts Potential foreign influence through difficult-to-trace donations Regulatory arbitrage between jurisdictions with different rules Technological arms race between tracking and privacy methods The government’s response will likely shape the 2025 election bill currently in development. This legislation represents the first major opportunity to address cryptocurrency in political finance since the 2000 Act. Parliamentary committees will probably examine the issue through evidence sessions with experts from technology, finance, and security sectors. Conclusion The debate about crypto political donations highlights fundamental tensions between technological innovation and democratic integrity. UK Labour committee chairs have raised legitimate concerns about foreign interference and transparency in political funding. Their call for banning cryptocurrency donations responds to Reform UK’s planned acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets. This developing situation requires careful balancing between embracing financial innovation and protecting election security. The government’s decision will establish important precedents for how democracies worldwide address cryptocurrency in political systems. Ultimately, the crypto political donations debate represents a critical test for UK political finance regulation in the digital age. FAQs Q1: Why do Labour committee chairs want to ban crypto political donations? They cite concerns about foreign interference and transparency challenges, arguing cryptocurrency donations could enable untraceable foreign funding of UK political campaigns despite existing prohibitions. Q2: Which UK political party plans to accept cryptocurrency donations? Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, announced it would become Britain’s first political party to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency donations starting in May 2025. Q3: Can cryptocurrency donations be traced effectively? While blockchain analysis can trace many cryptocurrency transactions, privacy-focused coins and mixing services can obscure donation origins, creating challenges for political finance regulators. Q4: How do other countries handle cryptocurrency political donations? Approaches vary: the United States permits them with disclosure requirements, Canada effectively bans them, while Australia continues debating potential implementation without current acceptance. Q5: What existing UK laws regulate political donations? The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 requires donor identification for contributions over £500, permissible donor verification, quarterly reporting, and prohibits foreign donations.

According to data-driven models tracking investment flows and miner behavior, the world’s leading cryptocurrency appears poised for recovery despite broader macroeconomic uncertainties. This analysis arrives at a crucial juncture for digital asset investors worldwide, particularly those monitoring the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized systems. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyzing the December 2025 Bottom Willy Woo’s latest assessment, reported by BeInCrypto on January 15, 2026, identifies December 24, 2025, as the probable cyclical low point for Bitcoin’s valuation. Investment inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and direct wallet acquisitions have demonstrated consistent growth since that date, reversing the outflows that characterized the previous quarter. Consequently, this pattern suggests accumulating investor confidence following the December trough. Market analysts generally consider such sustained inflow reversals as reliable early indicators of shifting sentiment. Historical data reveals that Bitcoin has experienced similar recovery patterns following previous market cycles. For instance, the 2018-2019 bear market bottom preceded a 300% price appreciation over the following twelve months. Similarly, the 2022 market low led to substantial gains throughout 2023 and 2024. Woo’s models incorporate multiple on-chain metrics including: Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio: Measures network valuation relative to transaction volume Miner Revenue Indicators: Tracks profitability and selling pressure from mining operations Exchange Net Flow: Monitors Bitcoin movements to and from trading platforms Realized Price Distribution: Analyzes the cost basis of coins moving on-chain These metrics collectively suggest that the December 2025 low established what technical analysts describe as a “higher low” compared to previous cycle bottoms, potentially indicating strengthening long-term fundamentals despite short-term volatility concerns. Mining Economics and Bitcoin Price Support Woo’s analysis provides particularly valuable insights regarding miner behavior during periods when Bitcoin trades below production costs. Historically, these conditions have rarely triggered panic selling among mining operations. Instead, miners typically implement strategic responses that ultimately support price stability. When mining becomes unprofitable, operations frequently reduce output through several mechanisms rather than liquidating reserves at a loss. Mining operations generally employ three primary strategies during unprofitable periods: Strategy Implementation Market Impact Hash Rate Adjustment Temporarily shutting down less efficient hardware Reduces network difficulty, lowering costs for remaining miners Strategic Hedging Using futures and options to secure revenue Reduces immediate selling pressure on spot markets Operational Efficiency Renegotiating energy contracts and optimizing facilities Lowers the aggregate production cost across the network This miner behavior creates what Woo describes as a “low-volume period” that effectively establishes a temporary price floor. The subsequent recovery typically commences when Bitcoin’s price surpasses the average mining cost, encouraging renewed production and investment. This pattern has manifested consistently across Bitcoin’s four major market cycles since 2011, providing historical precedent for the current situation. Production Cost as Critical Support Level The relationship between Bitcoin’s market price and its production cost represents one of the most reliable indicators in cryptocurrency analysis. According to data from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, the global average Bitcoin mining cost ranged between $38,000 and $42,000 throughout late 2025. When Bitcoin’s price dipped below this range in December, mining operations representing approximately 15% of the network hash rate temporarily suspended operations. This production adjustment created a supply constraint that, combined with steady institutional accumulation, helped establish the December price bottom. Furthermore, the subsequent gradual price recovery above $42,000 in early January 2026 has already prompted some idled miners to resume operations, creating a positive feedback loop that could support further price appreciation. Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Bitcoin’s Trajectory Beyond technical and on-chain analysis, Woo’s assessment incorporates significant macroeconomic developments that could influence Bitcoin’s adoption trajectory. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order capping credit card interest rates at 10% represents a potentially transformative policy for alternative financial systems. While designed to protect consumers with lower credit scores, this regulation may inadvertently drive individuals toward decentralized financial solutions. Traditional financial institutions typically respond to interest rate caps by tightening credit availability, particularly for higher-risk borrowers. This dynamic could accelerate adoption of cryptocurrency-based lending platforms and decentralized finance protocols that operate outside conventional regulatory frameworks. Several developments support this analysis: Increased Crypto Wallet Creation: December 2025 saw a 22% month-over-month increase in new non-custodial wallet addresses Stablecoin Transaction Growth: Dollar-pegged cryptocurrency transfers increased 18% during the same period DeFi Protocol Activity: Leading decentralized lending platforms reported 31% more unique addresses These metrics suggest growing engagement with cryptocurrency systems as alternatives to traditional financial products, particularly among demographics potentially affected by credit market restrictions. 2026 Market Outlook and Liquidity Considerations While short-term indicators suggest potential for Bitcoin price appreciation, Woo maintains a cautious perspective regarding the broader 2026 outlook. Decreasing global liquidity conditions, particularly the continued reduction of central bank balance sheets in major economies, could create headwinds for all risk assets including cryptocurrencies. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing quantitative tightening program, combined with similar policies from the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, has reduced global monetary base by approximately 12% since its 2024 peak. This liquidity contraction historically correlates with reduced capital flows into speculative assets. However, cryptocurrency markets have demonstrated increasing decoupling from traditional risk assets during recent quarters. The 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the NASDAQ index has declined from 0.78 in early 2025 to 0.42 by December, suggesting growing independence from equity market movements. Institutional Adoption as Counterbalance Increasing institutional participation may help offset broader liquidity concerns. Major financial institutions have continued expanding cryptocurrency services throughout the market downturn. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust reached $25 billion in assets under management by January 2026, while Fidelity’s digital asset division expanded its workforce by 40% during the fourth quarter of 2025. This institutional infrastructure development creates a more robust foundation for sustained cryptocurrency adoption regardless of short-term market conditions. Furthermore, regulatory clarity has improved significantly in key markets. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework became fully operational in December 2025, providing comprehensive guidelines for cryptocurrency service providers across 27 member states. Similarly, Japan’s Financial Services Agency approved three additional cryptocurrency exchanges in November 2025, bringing the total to 48 licensed platforms in one of Asia’s most significant markets. Conclusion Willy Woo’s analysis presents a compelling case that Bitcoin established a significant price bottom in late December 2025, creating conditions favorable for short-term appreciation. The combination of improving investment inflows, strategic miner behavior, and supportive macroeconomic developments suggests potential for measured recovery in coming weeks. However, investors should remain cognizant of broader liquidity challenges that could influence the 2026 cryptocurrency landscape. This Bitcoin price prediction underscores the importance of combining on-chain analytics with macroeconomic awareness when navigating digital asset markets. As always, thorough research and risk management remain essential for participants in this evolving financial ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What specific date did Willy Woo identify as Bitcoin’s price bottom? Woo’s analysis identifies December 24, 2025, as the probable cyclical low point based on investment flow data and on-chain metrics showing reversal patterns beginning that date. Q2: How does Bitcoin mining cost affect price support? When Bitcoin trades below production costs, miners typically reduce output rather than sell at a loss, creating supply constraints that establish temporary price floors until the market price recovers above mining costs. Q3: What macroeconomic factor could drive Bitcoin adoption according to the analysis? President Trump’s credit card interest rate cap at 10% may inadvertently push individuals with lower credit scores toward alternative financial systems like Bitcoin and decentralized finance platforms. Q4: What is the main caution for Bitcoin’s 2026 outlook? Decreasing global liquidity from central bank balance sheet reductions could create headwinds for all risk assets, though cryptocurrency markets show increasing decoupling from traditional financial markets. Q5: How reliable is the mining cost price floor historically? This pattern has repeated in all four major Bitcoin market cycles since 2011, with prices consistently finding support near production costs before initiating recovery phases.

57081318,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260490,1768171811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,India Crypto KYC Rules: A Crucial Crackdown on Digital Asset Verification,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/india-crypto-kyc-rules-crackdown/,"BitcoinWorld India Crypto KYC Rules: A Crucial Crackdown on Digital Asset Verification NEW DELHI, India – In a decisive move to regulate the burgeoning digital asset sector, India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has unveiled stringent new Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges, fundamentally altering the user onboarding process and signaling a pivotal shift towards a more controlled financial technology environment. This regulatory escalation directly addresses longstanding concerns from tax authorities about the potential for cryptocurrencies to facilitate illicit financial flows and tax evasion. India Crypto KYC Rules: The New Verification Framework The newly mandated India crypto KYC rules introduce a multi-layered verification system that goes beyond traditional document submission. Consequently, regulated virtual digital asset (VDA) service providers must now implement real-time biometric checks. Specifically, this involves users submitting a live selfie during registration. Simultaneously, platforms must perform geolocation verification to confirm the user’s physical presence within India. Furthermore, to conclusively link a user’s identity to their financial footprint, the guidelines require bank account authentication. Users must initiate a small, verified transfer from their registered bank account to the exchange. This triad of measures—live selfie, location pin, and micro-transaction—creates a robust audit trail for financial investigators. Behind the Regulatory Push: The Tax Enforcement Imperative This regulatory tightening did not occur in a vacuum. Recently, officials from India’s Income Tax Department (ITD) presented a compelling case to lawmakers. They argued that the pseudonymous nature of many cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms presents a significant hurdle to tax enforcement. The ITD’s concerns center on the difficulty of tracking transactions, identifying beneficial owners, and ensuring accurate reporting of capital gains. The new India crypto KYC rules, therefore, serve as a direct countermeasure. By forcing exchanges to collect verified, real-time data, the FIU and ITD aim to peel back the layer of anonymity that has complicated their oversight efforts. Comparative Analysis: India’s Stance in the Global Crypto Landscape India’s approach now places it among jurisdictions with aggressive crypto oversight frameworks. For instance, while the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation focuses broadly on licensing and consumer protection, India’s latest rules drill down specifically on initial user identification. Similarly, South Korea employs strict real-name banking rules for crypto trading. However, India’s integration of live biometrics and mandatory bank linkage for verification represents a uniquely rigorous implementation. The table below illustrates key differences: Jurisdiction Primary KYC Focus Unique Measure India (2025) Real-time identity & financial linkage Live selfie + micro bank transfer European Union (MiCA) Licensing & stablecoin reserves Travel Rule for transfers over €1,000 United States Anti-Money Laundering (AML) reporting Bank Secrecy Act compliance for exchanges Singapore Risk-based customer due diligence Prohibition of crypto public marketing This comparative context underscores India’s specific targeting of the onboarding vector as a critical control point. Immediate Impacts on Crypto Exchanges and Users The operational impact of these India crypto KYC rules is immediate and significant. For exchanges, compliance necessitates rapid technological upgrades. They must integrate: Liveness detection software to prevent spoofing with static images or videos. Secure geolocation APIs that respect privacy while providing verification. Automated bank transfer reconciliation systems to match tiny deposits with user accounts. For users, the onboarding process becomes more involved, potentially affecting adoption rates. Privacy-conscious individuals may express concerns over the collection of biometric and precise location data. Conversely, proponents argue that these measures will enhance overall platform security and foster greater institutional trust in the Indian crypto market. The increased friction at sign-up is a trade-off for a more regulated and, theoretically, safer trading environment. The Technical and Logistical Hurdles Implementing these rules presents notable challenges. Firstly, reliable liveness detection requires sophisticated algorithms to distinguish a real person from a sophisticated deepfake or mask, raising the technological bar for all market participants. Secondly, geolocation data can be manipulated via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or GPS spoofing apps, prompting an ongoing cat-and-mouse game between regulators and bad actors. Finally, the small bank transfer method, while effective, adds steps that may frustrate new users accustomed to instant digital access. Exchanges must streamline this process to avoid excessive drop-off rates during registration. Expert Analysis: Balancing Innovation and Oversight Financial technology analysts observe that these India crypto KYC rules represent a maturation of the regulatory dialogue. “The government is moving from a posture of skepticism to one of structured oversight,” notes a fintech policy advisor based in Mumbai. “By mandating these specific technical controls, they are not banning the technology but demanding it operates within the existing financial integrity framework.” This perspective aligns with the global trend of bringing crypto-asset service providers under the same Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) obligations as traditional banks. The key test will be whether this framework can deter illicit activity without stifling the legitimate innovation and financial inclusion potential of blockchain technology. Conclusion The implementation of stringent India crypto KYC rules marks a definitive chapter in the nation’s approach to digital assets. By enforcing real-time selfie verification, geolocation checks, and bank account authentication, regulators aim to dismantle the anonymity that complicates tax enforcement and anti-money laundering efforts. While these measures introduce new complexities for exchanges and users, they also signal a move towards a more formalized and supervised cryptocurrency ecosystem. The success of this crackdown will ultimately depend on its effective implementation, its acceptance by the user base, and its ability to achieve its stated goals of financial transparency and integrity without curbing technological progress. FAQs Q1: What are the three main components of India’s new crypto KYC rules? A1: The three core components are: 1) Real-time selfie verification using liveness detection, 2) Geolocation confirmation to ensure the user is in India, and 3) Authentication of the user’s bank account via a small test transfer. Q2: Which government body issued these new cryptocurrency guidelines? A2: India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which operates under the Ministry of Finance, issued the guidelines. The move follows concerns raised by the Income Tax Department (ITD) regarding tax enforcement. Q3: How do these rules affect existing users of crypto exchanges? A3: While primarily targeting new user registrations, exchanges may be required to periodically re-verify existing users under enhanced due diligence protocols to maintain full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Q4: Can users bypass the geolocation check using a VPN? A4: Reputable exchanges will use advanced methods to detect VPN and proxy usage. Attempting to bypass geolocation checks would violate the platform’s terms of service and could lead to account suspension, as it defeats the purpose of the regulation. Q5: What is the primary goal behind tightening these KYC norms? A5: The primary goal is to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion by eliminating anonymous transactions on regulated platforms. It creates a verifiable link between a crypto wallet, a real identity, and a traditional bank account.

57081408,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260498,1768172110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stablecoins Revealed: JPMorgan’s Vision of Complementary Financial Tools Amid Regulatory Tensions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jpmorgan-stablecoins-complementary-financial-tools/,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoins Revealed: JPMorgan’s Vision of Complementary Financial Tools Amid Regulatory Tensions NEW YORK, March 2025 – JPMorgan Chase, America’s largest bank by assets, has positioned stablecoins as complementary financial instruments rather than systemic threats, creating a significant development in the ongoing debate about digital currency integration. This perspective emerges simultaneously as over 100 regional banking executives urge U.S. senators to address legislative gaps in cryptocurrency regulation, according to recent CoinDesk reporting. The contrasting viewpoints highlight the complex evolution of money in the digital age. Stablecoins as Complementary Financial Tools JPMorgan’s official stance represents a measured endorsement of digital currency innovation. A bank spokesperson explained that various monetary tiers have always coexisted within financial systems. Consequently, this historical pattern suggests continued diversity in payment methods. The spokesperson specifically mentioned central bank money, institutional funds, and commercial bank deposits as established categories. Furthermore, they emphasized that deposit tokens and stablecoins will serve distinct yet complementary purposes alongside traditional payment rails. This perspective acknowledges the practical reality of financial evolution. For instance, commercial bank money has supplemented central bank reserves for centuries. Similarly, new digital forms may expand existing monetary ecosystems. The bank’s analysis suggests stablecoins could enhance transaction efficiency in specific use cases. These cases might include cross-border payments and programmable finance applications. The Banking Sector’s Regulatory Concerns Meanwhile, regional banking leaders express substantial concerns about regulatory frameworks. Over 100 executives from smaller financial institutions recently petitioned Senate banking committee members. Their collective letter urges lawmakers to address perceived loopholes in proposed stablecoin legislation. Specifically, these bankers worry about uneven regulatory application across different financial entities. The regional banks emphasize several key issues: Regulatory parity between traditional banks and non-bank issuers Consumer protection standards for digital asset holders Systemic risk assessment methodologies for new instruments Operational resilience requirements for payment networks This regulatory tension reflects broader industry transformation. Traditional financial institutions increasingly recognize digital asset potential. However, they simultaneously advocate for clear regulatory boundaries. The debate centers on balancing innovation with financial stability safeguards. Historical Context of Monetary Evolution Financial historians note that monetary systems constantly evolve through technological advancement. For example, paper currency supplemented metal coins centuries ago. Later, electronic transfers revolutionized commercial banking. Currently, digital tokens represent the latest evolutionary phase. JPMorgan’s analysis aligns with this historical pattern of complementary monetary instruments. The following table illustrates monetary evolution across technological eras: Era Primary Forms Complementary Forms Pre-Industrial Metal coins Bills of exchange Industrial Paper currency Bank drafts Electronic Digital deposits Credit cards Digital Central bank digital currency Stablecoins This evolutionary perspective helps explain JPMorgan’s complementary framework. Each technological advancement introduced new payment options without eliminating previous systems. Similarly, stablecoins may expand rather than replace existing financial infrastructure. Practical Implications for Financial Systems The complementary approach suggests specific integration pathways. Deposit tokens issued by regulated banks might serve wholesale settlement purposes. Meanwhile, stablecoins could facilitate retail transactions and decentralized finance applications. This functional differentiation mirrors historical divisions between various monetary instruments. Several financial analysts highlight potential benefits from this approach: Enhanced payment efficiency through faster settlement cycles Improved financial inclusion for underserved populations Reduced transaction costs in cross-border payments Increased system resilience through diversified infrastructure However, implementation requires careful coordination. Regulatory clarity remains essential for widespread adoption. Additionally, technical standards must ensure interoperability between systems. These practical considerations explain regional banks’ legislative concerns. Expert Perspectives on Financial Innovation Financial technology experts emphasize the importance of regulatory alignment. Dr. Sarah Chen, a payments systems researcher at Stanford University, notes that complementary frameworks require coordinated oversight. “History shows that successful monetary innovations integrate with existing systems,” Chen explains. “The critical challenge involves establishing appropriate safeguards without stifling beneficial development.” Banking industry veterans echo this balanced perspective. Michael Rodriguez, former Comptroller of the Currency, emphasizes that financial stability remains paramount. “New instruments must demonstrate reliability through economic cycles,” Rodriguez states. “Complementary systems require particularly robust risk management frameworks.” Global Context and Comparative Analysis International approaches to stablecoin regulation vary significantly. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework establishes comprehensive rules. Meanwhile, Singapore’s Payment Services Act creates a licensing regime for digital payment tokens. These differing models provide valuable comparative data for U.S. policymakers. Several jurisdictions have adopted complementary approaches similar to JPMorgan’s vision: Switzerland integrates stablecoins within existing banking law Japan treats certain stablecoins as digital payment instruments United Kingdom proposes regulatory equivalence for similar functions These international examples demonstrate various implementation pathways. However, the U.S. debate remains distinctive due to its complex regulatory structure. Multiple agencies share jurisdiction over different aspects of digital assets. This fragmentation complicates coherent policy development. Conclusion JPMorgan’s characterization of stablecoins as complementary financial tools represents a significant development in digital currency discourse. This perspective acknowledges historical monetary evolution while addressing contemporary regulatory concerns. The simultaneous advocacy from regional banks highlights ongoing debates about appropriate oversight frameworks. Ultimately, successful integration will require balancing innovation with stability considerations. The complementary approach suggests stablecoins may expand financial infrastructure rather than disrupt existing systems. This evolution mirrors historical patterns of monetary development through technological advancement. FAQs Q1: What exactly are stablecoins? Stablecoins are digital currencies typically pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. They aim to combine cryptocurrency benefits with price stability. Q2: Why does JPMorgan view stablecoins as complementary? The bank observes that multiple monetary forms have always coexisted. Stablecoins represent another layer rather than a replacement for existing systems. Q3: What concerns do regional banks have about stablecoins? They worry about regulatory loopholes, uneven oversight, and potential risks to financial stability without proper safeguards. Q4: How might stablecoins complement traditional banking? They could handle specific transactions like cross-border payments while traditional systems manage other financial activities. Q5: What regulatory developments are occurring globally? Various jurisdictions are creating frameworks for digital assets, with approaches ranging from comprehensive regulation to integration within existing laws.

57081553,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260501,1768172410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Satoshi-era miner’s shocking 2,000 BTC move after 15-year silence signals market watch",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/satoshi-era-miner-btc-move/,"BitcoinWorld Satoshi-era miner’s shocking 2,000 BTC move after 15-year silence signals market watch In a stunning development that has captivated the cryptocurrency world, a miner from Bitcoin’s earliest days has broken a 15-year silence by moving 2,000 BTC to Coinbase, triggering intense analysis about historical patterns and potential market implications for 2025. Satoshi-era miner breaks 15-year dormancy with massive BTC transfer Blockchain analysts observed the unprecedented movement on Tuesday, March 18, 2025. The transaction involved 2,000 Bitcoin valued at approximately $140 million at current prices. Significantly, these coins originated from 40 separate Pay-to-Public-Key addresses, a technical signature characteristic of Bitcoin’s earliest mining period between 2009 and 2010. Julio Moreno, senior analyst at CryptoQuant, immediately noted the transaction’s historical significance. “Miners from this foundational period tend to move their Bitcoin holdings at significant market inflection points,” Moreno stated. Consequently, the cryptocurrency community has begun examining potential correlations with previous similar movements. Understanding the technical and historical context The transaction’s technical details reveal much about Bitcoin’s evolution. Pay-to-Public-Key addresses represent Bitcoin’s original transaction format before developers implemented more sophisticated scripting systems. These P2PK addresses function differently from modern Bitcoin addresses in several key ways: Direct cryptographic proof: Transactions directly reference the recipient’s public key Simpler validation: Requires only a signature matching the public key Historical significance: Primarily used during Bitcoin’s first two years Rarity today: Modern transactions overwhelmingly use P2PKH or SegWit addresses Furthermore, the 15-year dormancy period exceeds typical holding patterns dramatically. According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, only 1.8 million Bitcoin (approximately 9% of circulating supply) have remained unmoved for over a decade. This particular movement therefore represents a notable reduction in these ultra-long-term holdings. Expert analysis of historical miner behavior patterns Cryptocurrency researchers have documented several previous instances of Satoshi-era movements coinciding with market transitions. For example, in November 2020, another early miner moved 1,000 BTC after 11 years of dormancy, preceding Bitcoin’s climb to then-all-time highs. Similarly, in April 2023, several dormant addresses from 2010 became active before significant market volatility. Julio Moreno’s observation about inflection points stems from this documented pattern. However, analysts caution against assuming direct causality. “While the timing often aligns with market shifts, we cannot determine whether these movements cause volatility or simply respond to it,” explained blockchain researcher Sarah Thompson. “The psychological impact on market sentiment, nevertheless, remains substantial.” Market implications and institutional perspectives The transfer to Coinbase, a regulated United States cryptocurrency exchange, suggests potential intentions to liquidate or reposition the assets. Institutional analysts have proposed several possible motivations for such a movement after 15 years: Potential Motivation Market Implication Historical Precedent Estate planning or inheritance Minimal immediate market impact Several 2013-era movements Portfolio rebalancing Potential gradual selling pressure 2021 miner movements Regulatory compliance action Increased transparency precedent 2022 exchange-related transfers Technical wallet migration Neutral to positive sentiment Various security upgrades Market data from the 24 hours following the transaction shows increased volatility, with Bitcoin experiencing a 3.2% price fluctuation band compared to the previous week’s 1.8% average. Trading volume on major exchanges simultaneously rose by approximately 18%, indicating heightened trader attention to this development. The evolving landscape of Bitcoin’s early supply This movement highlights the gradual activation of Bitcoin’s earliest-mined coins. According to blockchain estimates, approximately 1.1 million Bitcoin mined during the first year (2009) remain unmoved. The gradual awakening of these coins presents both challenges and opportunities for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. On one hand, increased circulation of early coins enhances market liquidity. Conversely, potential large-scale selling could introduce volatility. Importantly, the psychological impact of Satoshi-era movements often outweighs their direct market effect. “These transactions remind the market of Bitcoin’s incredible longevity and the patience of its earliest adopters,” noted financial historian Michael Chen. “They represent living history moving through the digital economy.” Technological and security considerations Moving Bitcoin after 15 years involves navigating significant technological evolution. The miner likely confronted several challenges including wallet software compatibility, private key preservation, and transaction fee optimization. Modern Bitcoin transactions require different fee structures and sometimes different signature formats than those from 2009-2010. Additionally, the security considerations for protecting private keys over 15 years are substantial. This successful movement, therefore, demonstrates remarkable technical preservation alongside financial patience. Blockchain security experts emphasize that such long-term storage successes validate Bitcoin’s core value proposition as a durable store of value across technological generations. Conclusion The Satoshi-era miner’s movement of 2,000 BTC after 15-year dormancy represents a significant historical event within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This transaction highlights Bitcoin’s maturation from experimental digital cash to established financial asset. While analysts monitor potential market implications, the movement primarily demonstrates the enduring nature of blockchain-based value storage. As Bitcoin continues evolving in 2025, such events provide valuable perspective on its remarkable journey and the patience of its earliest participants. FAQs Q1: What does “Satoshi-era” mean in cryptocurrency context? “Satoshi-era” refers to the period when Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto was actively developing the protocol, approximately 2009 through 2010. Miners from this era obtained Bitcoin through early mining when difficulty was minimal and very few participants existed. Q2: Why do analysts consider 15-year dormancy significant? Fifteen years represents nearly Bitcoin’s entire existence. Coins remaining unmoved this long demonstrate extraordinary holder patience and confidence. Their movement often signals changing circumstances or perspectives among Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. Q3: What are Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses? P2PK addresses represent Bitcoin’s original transaction format where the sending script directly contains the recipient’s public key. This format preceded the more common P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash) system and is primarily associated with Bitcoin’s earliest years. Q4: Could this transaction affect Bitcoin’s price significantly? While 2,000 BTC represents substantial value, it constitutes less than 0.01% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Historical data shows psychological impact often exceeds direct selling pressure, but single transactions rarely determine market direction without broader context. Q5: How common are such dormant Bitcoin movements? Movements from 2009-2010 wallets occur several times annually but attract particular attention when involving large amounts or exceptional dormancy periods. Each movement reduces the pool of truly ancient, unmoved Bitcoin, making remaining dormant coins increasingly historically significant.

This development, first reported by Coindesk, represents a major evolution in how users discuss and interact with financial assets online. The feature directly addresses a persistent and costly problem in crypto communities: ticker symbol confusion. Consequently, it promises to bring unprecedented clarity and utility to millions of conversations. Smart Cashtags: Solving the Ticker Confusion Crisis The core innovation of Smart Cashtags lies in its move beyond simple, ambiguous tickers. Currently, a user referencing “ADA” could mean the Cardano cryptocurrency or the stock of Ada Resources. This ambiguity has led to widespread misinformation and trading errors. Smart Cashtags will allow users to specify the exact digital asset or even a unique smart contract address. Therefore, discussions about specific tokens, including those on decentralized exchanges, will gain immediate precision. This system mirrors the specificity of blockchain explorers but integrates seamlessly into social discourse. Industry experts have long highlighted ticker confusion as a critical flaw. “The conflation of asset tickers across traditional and crypto markets creates a minefield for investors,” noted a 2024 report from the Blockchain Transparency Institute. X’s solution appears to tackle this head-on. By enabling precise tagging, the platform could reduce the spread of accidental misinformation. Furthermore, it establishes a new standard for financial communication on social media. Integrated Real-Time Data and User Experience Beyond mere identification, Smart Cashtags will transform passive discussion into active discovery. Tapping on a tag will provide users with a rich, inline data dashboard. This dashboard will include real-time price charts, key market metrics, and curated news headlines. Importantly, all this information will be accessible without leaving the X platform. This seamless integration addresses a common user pain point: the constant need to switch between a social app and a trading or data website. The user experience implications are profound. For casual observers, it lowers the barrier to understanding market context. For active traders and analysts, it streamlines research. The feature essentially embeds a lightweight financial terminal within the social feed. This aligns with X’s broader ambition, under Elon Musk’s leadership, to become an “everything app.” The integration of robust financial tools is a logical step in that evolution. Analysts predict this could significantly increase user engagement and time spent on the platform. The Broader Impact on Crypto Market Integrity The launch of Smart Cashtags arrives at a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. Global regulators are increasingly focused on market transparency and investor protection. A feature that reduces asset misrepresentation directly supports these goals. By providing clear, immediate access to accurate data, X could help dampen the volatility often fueled by rumors and confusion. This is especially critical for newer, less-known assets where ticker overlap is common. From a technical perspective, supporting smart contract addresses is a forward-thinking inclusion. It acknowledges the growing universe of tokens beyond major exchanges. A user can now tag a specific DeFi token or NFT collection contract directly. This capability bridges the gap between complex blockchain data and mainstream social conversation. It empowers developers and projects to be referenced with exactitude, fostering more accurate community discussion and support. Comparative Analysis and Industry Context To understand the significance of Smart Cashtags, it’s useful to compare it with existing solutions. Traditional cashtags on platforms like Bloomberg or Yahoo Finance link only to public company stocks. Crypto-specific data aggregators like CoinGecko offer detailed pages but exist outside social platforms. X’s feature uniquely merges social interaction with verified financial data in one place. The following table outlines the key advancements: Feature Legacy Cashtags X Smart Cashtags (2025) Asset Coverage Stocks, ETFs Stocks, ETFs, Cryptocurrencies, Token Contracts Data Provided Basic price, chart Real-time price, advanced charts, related news Address Ambiguity High (e.g., ADA) Resolved via precise ID Platform Integration Limited Deep, no external app needed This development is part of a larger trend of social platforms integrating financial services. However, X’s approach with Smart Cashtags is notably more comprehensive and user-centric than early attempts by other networks. The scheduled February release sets a high bar for competitors and could trigger a new wave of innovation in social fintech. Conclusion The introduction of Smart Cashtags by X marks a revolutionary step for financial discourse online. By solving the critical issue of ticker confusion and embedding real-time data, the feature enhances accuracy, transparency, and user empowerment. Its launch in February 2025 is poised to reshape how both retail and professional investors consume information and discuss assets. Ultimately, this move strengthens X’s position as a leading platform for real-time financial conversation and could contribute positively to overall market clarity. The success of Smart Cashtags will likely depend on its adoption by key influencers and the financial community, setting a new standard for the industry. FAQs Q1: What is the main problem X’s Smart Cashtags solve? The primary problem is ticker symbol confusion, where the same abbreviation (like ADA) can refer to multiple different assets (e.g., Cardano cryptocurrency vs. Ada Resources stock). Smart Cashtags allow precise identification to prevent misinformation. Q2: When will Smart Cashtags be available to all X users? According to reports, the full release of the Smart Cashtags feature is scheduled for February 2025. Q3: What kind of information will a Smart Cashtag provide? Tapping a Smart Cashtag will provide instant access to real-time price data, interactive charts, key market metrics, and related news articles without requiring you to leave the X platform. Q4: Can Smart Cashtags identify any cryptocurrency? Yes, the system is designed to go beyond simple tickers to identify specific cryptocurrencies and even unique smart contract addresses for tokens, enabling precise references to a vast array of digital assets. Q5: How does this feature benefit the average crypto enthusiast? It saves time by integrating data into the social feed, reduces the risk of acting on information about the wrong asset, and provides immediate context for market discussions, making the platform more useful for research and community engagement.

His analysis, reported by The Block, moves beyond technical minutiae to address core economic and systemic vulnerabilities. Consequently, the blockchain community is now scrutinizing these hurdles with renewed urgency. This examination provides crucial context for developers, investors, and regulators navigating the next phase of decentralized finance. Vitalik Buterin’s Three Decentralized Stablecoin Challenges Vitalik Buterin’s outlined challenges strike at the heart of decentralized stablecoin design. First, he questions the universal reliance on the U.S. dollar as a primary index. Many algorithmic and collateralized stablecoins, like DAI, primarily peg to the USD. However, this creates inherent exposure to U.S. monetary policy and geopolitical risk. Therefore, the search for a more neutral, robust, or diversified benchmark index becomes a pressing architectural concern. Secondly, Buterin highlights the oracle problem. Decentralized stablecoins require accurate, tamper-proof price feeds. Designing oracle systems that resist domination by large, coordinated capital pools is a non-trivial security challenge. Finally, he points to economic competition from staking yields. When users can earn substantial, relatively low-risk returns by staking native assets like ETH, the incentive to lock that capital as stablecoin collateral diminishes significantly. This creates a persistent capital efficiency dilemma. The Quest for a Superior Index Beyond the Dollar The dominance of the U.S. dollar presents a paradoxical challenge for decentralized systems seeking global neutrality. Most major decentralized stablecoins today derive their value from a USD peg. This reliance introduces centralization pressure from traditional finance. For instance, the majority of DAI’s collateral historically originated from centralized stablecoins like USDC. Consequently, projects are actively exploring alternatives. These potential indexes could include: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Baskets: Pegging to a measure of inflation to preserve purchasing power. Commodity Baskets: Linking value to a diversified mix of real-world assets like energy and metals. Global Currency Baskets: Using a weighted index of multiple fiat currencies, similar to the IMF’s SDR. Each alternative, however, introduces new complexities for oracle design and user comprehension. The search continues for a stable, politically neutral unit of account that aligns with crypto’s decentralized ethos. Expert Perspectives on Monetary Independence Economists and blockchain researchers have long debated this issue. A 2024 paper from the MIT Digital Currency Initiative explored ‘algorithmic central banking,’ where protocol rules automatically adjust supply against a chosen index. Meanwhile, projects like Reserve Protocol experiment with asset-backed baskets. The fundamental trade-off remains between stability, decentralization, and adoption liquidity. Buterin’s framing elevates this from a design choice to a foundational challenge that must be solved for long-term viability. Securing Decentralized Oracles Against Capital Dominance Oracle security is the second critical challenge. Decentralized stablecoins depend on oracles to report the accurate market price of their collateral and their own stablecoin peg. A malicious actor with sufficient capital could potentially manipulate these price feeds on one or multiple exchanges to trigger unjustified liquidations or mint unlimited stablecoins. Buterin specifically warns against oracles that can be ‘dominated by large capital pools.’ Current solutions employ techniques like: Time-Weighted Average Prices (TWAPs): Using price averages over time to mitigate short-term manipulation. Decentralized Oracle Networks: Aggregating data from many independent node operators. Cryptoeconomic Security: Requiring node operators to stake substantial value, which is slashed for malicious reporting. Despite these advances, the theoretical attack vector remains. The 2022 collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin, while not solely an oracle failure, demonstrated the catastrophic impact of broken price stability mechanisms in a volatile market. The Staking Yield Competition and Capital Opportunity Cost The third challenge is purely economic. The rapid growth of proof-of-stake (PoS) networks, led by Ethereum’s Merge, has created attractive baseline yields. Staking ETH currently offers a annualized return. When users choose to lock ETH as collateral to mint a decentralized stablecoin like DAI or LUSD, they forgo this staking yield. This represents a direct opportunity cost. Protocol designers must create sufficient incentives to offset this cost. Potential solutions include: Solution Approach Mechanism Example/Project Yield-Bearing Collateral Using liquid staking tokens (e.g., stETH) as direct collateral. MakerDAO’s integration of stETH. Protocol Revenue Sharing Distributing stablecoin protocol fees to collateral providers. Some newer algorithmic stablecoin models. Enhanced Utility Creating vibrant DeFi ecosystems where the stablecoin is essential, driving demand. Curve Finance’s deep liquidity pools. This competition ensures that decentralized stablecoins cannot exist in a vacuum. They must compete within the broader yield landscape of the cryptocurrency market, making their value proposition more difficult. The Real-World Impact on DeFi Growth These structural challenges have tangible effects. They influence capital allocation across the DeFi sector, impact the stability of lending protocols like Aave and Compound, and affect the risk models used by institutional participants. Resolving them is not merely academic; it is essential for building resilient financial infrastructure that can withstand market stress and scale to serve a global user base. The evolution of regulations in 2024-2025, particularly around stablecoin issuance, adds another layer of complexity to this technical and economic puzzle. Conclusion Vitalik Buterin’s identification of these three structural challenges provides a crucial framework for evaluating the future of decentralized stablecoins. The issues of finding a better index, securing decentralized oracles, and competing with staking yields are deeply interconnected. Solving them requires coordinated innovation across economics, cryptography, and mechanism design. As the cryptocurrency industry matures in 2025, progress on these fronts will be a key indicator of DeFi’s long-term potential to create a truly alternative, resilient, and independent financial system. The path forward demands a balance between pragmatic stability and the core decentralized ethos that sparked the movement. FAQs Q1: What are decentralized stablecoins? Decentralized stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to an asset like the US dollar, but are issued and governed by decentralized, algorithmic protocols or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) rather than a central company. Q2: Why is reliance on the US dollar a problem for decentralized stablecoins? Reliance on the USD ties decentralized systems to the monetary policy and geopolitical standing of a single nation, potentially undermining the censorship-resistance and global neutrality that are core goals of cryptocurrency. It also creates dependency on centralized assets for collateral. Q3: What is the ‘oracle problem’ in this context? The oracle problem refers to the difficulty of securely and reliably bringing real-world data (like asset prices) onto a blockchain. For stablecoins, if the oracle reporting the price of collateral can be manipulated, the entire system can be attacked, leading to insolvency or theft. Q4: How do staking yields compete with decentralized stablecoins? Staking allows users to earn rewards by locking up assets like ETH to secure a proof-of-stake network. This creates an opportunity cost: if users instead lock those same assets as collateral to mint a stablecoin, they give up the staking yield, making stablecoin minting less attractive unless the protocol offers competitive incentives. Q5: Is DAI considered a fully decentralized stablecoin? DAI, issued by the MakerDAO protocol, is one of the most prominent decentralized stablecoins. However, its decentralization is a spectrum. Historically, a large portion of its collateral has been in centralized assets like USDC. MakerDAO governance continuously debates and adjusts its collateral mix to balance stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency.

This significant action, first reported by BeInCrypto, leverages the company’s centralized administrator keys and highlights a critical, often debated, facet of the stablecoin ecosystem. Consequently, the event immediately reverberated through crypto markets and regulatory discussions worldwide. Tether USDT Freeze: Anatomy of a $182 Million Action Tether executed the freeze using administrator keys embedded within its USDT smart contract on the Tron network. These keys grant Tether the technical authority to instantly immobilize specific token balances. The company confirmed this action followed formal requests from U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Therefore, this is not an isolated incident but part of an established protocol. Historically, Tether has cooperated with global authorities to freeze assets linked to illicit activities. For instance, the company froze over $435 million in tokens connected to thefts and scams in 2023 alone. This latest freeze ranks among the largest single actions. The targeted wallets, identified by their on-chain addresses, showed patterns consistent with sophisticated fund movement, suggesting a possible link to a major investigation. The Centralized Control Mechanism Behind Stablecoins The ability to freeze assets stems from the centralized design of many fiat-backed stablecoins. Unlike fully decentralized cryptocurrencies, issuers like Tether maintain administrative controls for compliance and security. This structure creates a necessary bridge to traditional finance but also sparks debate about censorship-resistance. Administrator Keys: Privileged access allowing the issuer to pause transactions or freeze addresses at the smart contract level. Compliance Framework: A system for responding to validated requests from law enforcement and regulatory bodies worldwide. On-Chain Transparency: While the freeze is centralized, the action and the affected addresses are publicly visible on the blockchain. Other major stablecoin issuers, such as Circle (USDC), maintain similar capabilities. This commonality shows an industry-wide alignment with regulatory expectations. However, the scale and frequency of Tether’s interventions often draw particular scrutiny due to its market dominance. Expert Analysis on Law Enforcement Collaboration Financial compliance experts note this event reflects matured protocols between crypto entities and agencies. “This $182 million Tether USDT freeze is a textbook example of public-private partnership in the digital age,” explains a former federal prosecutor specializing in cybercrime. “It demonstrates that while blockchain is pseudonymous, coordinated efforts can effectively disrupt illicit financial flows.” Data from Chainalysis indicates that the traceability of stablecoins on public ledgers has become a powerful tool for investigators. The transparency of the Tron and Ethereum blockchains allows analysts to map transaction histories. Subsequently, when paired with traditional investigative work, it enables precise targeting of wallets for legal action. Implications for the Tron Network and Crypto Markets The freeze occurred specifically on the Tron network, which has become a preferred blockchain for USDT transactions due to its low fees and high speed. This action underscores that compliance measures extend across multiple blockchains where the asset exists. Market reaction was muted, with USDT maintaining its dollar peg, indicating investor confidence in Tether’s stability measures. Comparative Table: Recent Major Stablecoin Freezes Date Issuer Amount Frozen Network Cited Reason 2025 Tether $182 Million Tron U.S. Law Enforcement Request 2024 Circle $75 Million Ethereum OFAC Sanctions Compliance 2023 Tether $225 Million Ethereum Investigation into Fraud Platform This event may accelerate discussions around decentralized stablecoin alternatives. However, most analysts agree that centralized controls will remain a regulatory requirement for large-scale, fiat-backed systems in the foreseeable future. The industry continues to balance innovation with necessary oversight. Conclusion The Tether USDT freeze of $182 million from Tron wallets marks a significant moment in cryptocurrency’s integration with global financial law enforcement. It highlights the operational reality of centralized controls in major stablecoins and their role in legal compliance. As the digital asset landscape evolves, such actions will likely continue to shape the dialogue between innovation, privacy, and regulatory responsibility. The event ultimately reinforces the growing sophistication of monitoring and enforcement mechanisms within the blockchain ecosystem. FAQs Q1: Why can Tether freeze USDT in wallets? Tether, as the centralized issuer of USDT, embeds administrator keys into its smart contracts. These keys allow it to freeze tokens in specific addresses to comply with legal requests from authorized law enforcement agencies. Q2: Does this mean USDT is not decentralized? Correct. USDT is a centralized, fiat-backed stablecoin. Its issuer maintains control mechanisms for redemption, minting, and, as seen here, freezing assets to adhere to regulatory and legal requirements. Q3: What happens to the frozen $182 million in USDT? The frozen tokens remain immobilized on the blockchain addresses and cannot be moved or spent. Their ultimate disposition depends on the outcome of the associated legal proceedings, which could involve seizure and forfeiture. Q4: How does this affect other Tron or USDT holders? For users not involved in illicit activity, there is no direct impact. The action targets specific wallets. The stability of USDT and the functionality of the Tron network for legitimate transactions remain unaffected. Q5: Can frozen USDT be unfrozen? Technically, yes. Tether could use its administrator keys to reverse the freeze. However, this would only occur under specific circumstances, such as a court order or if the law enforcement request was withdrawn or resolved.

APEMARS Presale Enters As Next Big Crypto In Stage 3 With 22,367% ROI in Focus",https://timestabloid.com/missed-pepe-early-apemars-presale-enters-as-next-big-crypto/,"Some of the most talked-about meme coin gains were never obvious in real time. Pepe, for many, only became “obvious” after it had already moved beyond early pricing and into public frenzy. That pattern has repeated across multiple meme cycles, where the real opportunity existed quietly before listings, before headlines, and before social media consensus formed. For investors who missed those entry points, the question is no longer what happened, but where the next big crypto opportunity might emerge. That question is increasingly circling APEMARS, a story-driven meme coin project whose presale is live and currently in Stage 3, priced at $0.00002448. With a projected listing price of $0.0055, the implied upside from Stage 3 sits near 22,367%, placing APEMARS firmly into the next big crypto conversation tied to missed ICO-style opportunities. As presale stages advance and pricing steps upward, attention is shifting toward whether this window represents one of the last early entries before broader market exposure, especially with staking rewards scheduled to activate two months after listing, adding a longer-term incentive beyond the initial launch. Pepe’s Missed ICO Moment: How a Joke Turned Into a Market Wake-Up Call Pepe did not begin with urgency. In its earliest phase, it traded near its all-time low, priced so cheaply that most investors saw no reason to act. There was no countdown, no pressure, and little belief that it would rise above the noise of the meme coin market. At the time, Pepe looked optional. That perception shifted quickly. What followed was one of the most abrupt meme coin re-ratings of the cycle. Pepe moved from its ATL into a sharp rally that carried it to an all-time high, forcing the market to reassess what it had ignored. By the time Pepe reached its ATH, the early pricing window had already closed. Participation was no longer about opportunity; it was about chasing momentum. In hindsight, Pepe’s ICO-like phase was defined by hesitation rather than hype. The opportunity existed when conviction was weakest, not when confidence arrived. The move from ATL to ATH left little room for late entries, turning early indifference into lasting regret. Today, Pepe stands as a clear reminder of how missed ICO moments form. Early access is quiet, uncomfortable, and easy to dismiss. ATHs only make sense after that window is gone. Stage 3 of the APEMARS Presale Is Live as Early Windows Narrow APEMARS is currently live in Stage 3 of its presale, priced at $0.00002448, and the pricing gap from earlier stages is already visible. With a projected listing price of $0.0055, the upside from Stage 3 still reflects a potential 22,367% ROI, a range that historically disappears quickly as presales advance. What makes Stage 3 especially time-sensitive is that it is governed by a strict system. Each stage is limited, controlled by a live countdown, and programmed to move forward automatically. If Stage 3 allocations sell out before the timer expires, the system advances instantly to the next stage at a higher price. There are no extensions and no resets. The presale keeps moving whether participants act or wait. This structure has already turned earlier stages into missed opportunities, and Stage 3 is now the point where hesitation begins to carry a visible cost. Why APEMARS Has the Structure to Explode Beyond Presale What separates APEMARS from typical meme launches is that scarcity is built directly into its mechanics. One of the most powerful drivers is its checkpoint-based burn mechanism. Instead of random or marketing-driven burns, APEMARS permanently removes unsold presale tokens at predefined mission stages. As the 23-stage presale progresses, these burn checkpoints gradually reduce available supply, tightening token economics as demand increases. For Stage 3 participants, this means entering before multiple burn events further compresses the supply. Equally important is the 23-stage presale architecture itself. Each stage operates on a fixed timeline with automatic price increases. The system does not wait for sentiment or second thoughts. As stages close, prices step higher by design. This is the exact structure that has historically created missed ICO stories, where investors watch from the sidelines as entry costs quietly rise. APEMARS intentionally turns time into pressure, reinforcing its positioning as the next big crypto that rewards early participation rather than late reaction. What a Stage 3 Investment Could Look Like To understand the scale of this opportunity, consider a realistic Stage 3 entry. A $1,200 investment at the Stage 3 price of $0.00002448 would secure approximately 49 million APEMARS tokens. If the project reaches its planned listing price of $0.0055, that allocation would theoretically be valued at around $269,000. This is the type of asymmetry that defines early-phase opportunities and later fuels regret when presale pricing is no longer available. It is also why Stage 3 is increasingly being framed as one of the last meaningful early windows before APEMARS moves closer to public market pricing. How to Buy APEMARS During the Live Stage 3 Presale Participating in the APEMARS presale is designed to be straightforward. Visit the official APEMARS presale page and connect your supported wallet to the platform. Once connected, select the cryptocurrency you want to use and enter the amount you wish to participate with. If you have a referral or bonus code, you can enter it during this step to activate any applicable benefits. After confirming the transaction, your purchased APEMARS tokens will be immediately visible inside your presale dashboard, reflecting your allocation at the current Stage 3 price. Conclusion: Timing Separates Opportunity From Hindsight Crypto history is full of opportunities that only made sense after they were gone. From early Bitcoin to meme coins like Pepe, the pattern is consistent. The most profitable phase arrives quietly, long before certainty, headlines, or ATHs. By the time conviction feels safe, the window has already closed. That is how missed ICO stories are created, not through lack of information, but through delayed action. That context is why presales continue to matter when the market looks for the next big crypto. APEMARS is currently moving through that narrow phase where early pricing still exists, but stages are already advancing. With Stage 3 live at $0.00002448 and a planned $0.0055 listing level, the implied 22,367% upside from Stage 3 underscores how quickly this opportunity could shift from observable to unreachable. If history is any guide, this is the point investors later reference as the moment they almost acted, before it became another regrettable story.

The next big crypto is often identified during presale phases, not after listings. Historically, projects like Pepe delivered the largest gains to early participants. APEMARS is currently drawing attention due to its live presale structure, staged pricing, and significant upside potential before public market exposure. Why do investors look at presales to find the next big crypto? Presales offer access before market consensus forms. Many of the strongest-performing cryptocurrencies delivered their highest returns before listings. Investors tracking the next big crypto often focus on presales because pricing is still early and risk is balanced by asymmetric upside potential. Is APEMARS still early compared to past meme coin launches? Compared to meme coins that already reached their ATHs, APEMARS is still in its presale phase. With Stage 3 live and future stages ahead, pricing remains far below planned listing levels, making it early relative to projects that are already trading publicly. How does APEMARS compare to missed ICOs like Pepe? Pepe’s biggest gains occurred after most investors ignored it at its ATL and early ICO phase. APEMARS shows a similar early-stage setup, where visibility is increasing but pricing remains low. This comparison is why it is often discussed in missed ICO recovery narratives. What makes APEMARS different from typical meme coins? APEMARS combines a story-driven theme with a structured presale system and built-in scarcity mechanics. Unlike many meme coins that launch abruptly, its staged progression and automatic price increases create urgency while still allowing early participation before broader exposure. Summary The next big crypto is often found before public listings. APEMARS is currently in its live presale phase, with Stage 3 priced at $0.00002448 and a planned listing price of $0.0055. This gap has positioned it as a potential early-stage opportunity in missed ICO discussions. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

The probe centers on allegations that Powell provided false testimony to Congress regarding the extensive remodeling of the Federal Reserve’s historic headquarters building. This development, confirmed by multiple sources familiar with the matter, represents an unprecedented legal challenge for the nation’s top central banker during a critical period for U.S. monetary policy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Investigation Details Emerge The investigation reportedly focuses on testimony Powell delivered before congressional committees in 2023 and 2024. Prosecutors are examining whether the Fed Chair made false statements concerning the scope, cost, and authorization process for renovations at the Federal Reserve’s Eccles Building in Washington. The renovation project, which began in 2021, has faced scrutiny for its escalating budget and extended timeline. Furthermore, investigators are reviewing internal Fed communications and procurement documents to determine whether Powell knowingly misrepresented facts during his sworn appearances before lawmakers. Legal experts note that false testimony to Congress constitutes a serious federal offense. The investigation follows standard Justice Department protocols for examining potential violations by high-ranking officials. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has maintained its standard practice of not commenting on ongoing legal matters. However, sources within the institution indicate that Powell’s legal team is fully cooperating with investigators while vigorously disputing the allegations. Historical Context of Federal Reserve Building Renovations The Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building, completed in 1937, has undergone several major renovations throughout its history. The current project, initially budgeted at $450 million, has expanded to approximately $750 million according to congressional testimony. The renovation aims to address critical infrastructure needs including seismic retrofitting, security enhancements, and technological modernization. Additionally, the project includes accessibility improvements and energy efficiency upgrades to meet contemporary federal building standards. Congressional oversight committees have closely monitored the project since its inception. Lawmakers from both parties have expressed concerns about cost overruns and project delays. The House Financial Services Committee held multiple hearings specifically addressing the renovation’s management and financial controls. During these sessions, Powell repeatedly assured committee members that the Federal Reserve was implementing rigorous oversight measures and maintaining transparency about project expenditures. Comparative Analysis of Federal Building Renovations Federal Building Renovation Period Original Budget Final Cost Oversight Issues Eccles Building (Fed) 2021-2025 $450M $750M (est.) Under investigation U.S. Capitol Dome 2014-2016 $60M $59.5M Completed under budget J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building 2017-2022 $1.2B $2.1B GAO audit completed Department of Interior 2018-2023 $300M $385M Minor oversight questions Potential Impacts on Monetary Policy and Financial Markets The investigation arrives during a delicate period for U.S. monetary policy. The Federal Reserve continues navigating post-pandemic economic adjustments while managing inflation concerns. Financial markets typically react sensitively to uncertainty surrounding Fed leadership. Historical precedents suggest that investigations of central bank officials can create temporary volatility in bond markets and currency valuations. However, most analysts expect limited immediate policy impacts given the Federal Reserve’s institutional decision-making structure. Market participants are monitoring several key aspects of this situation: Policy Continuity: The Federal Open Market Committee operates through collective decision-making Institutional Independence: Legal challenges historically have not compromised Fed operational autonomy International Confidence: Global markets assess U.S. central bank stability during leadership uncertainties Regulatory Functions: Banking supervision and financial stability operations continue normally Former Fed officials emphasize that the institution’s robust governance framework ensures policy continuity regardless of individual circumstances. The Federal Reserve Act establishes clear procedures for leadership succession and operational management during transitional periods. Moreover, the Fed’s regional bank presidents and board governors maintain their respective responsibilities throughout any investigation process. Expert Perspectives on Central Bank Governance Legal scholars specializing in government accountability note that investigations of Federal Reserve chairs remain exceptionally rare. The last comparable situation occurred in the 1970s when then-Chair Arthur Burns faced congressional inquiries about monetary policy decisions. Constitutional law experts emphasize that separation of powers principles protect central bank independence while permitting legitimate oversight. Furthermore, established legal precedents distinguish between policy disagreements and potential violations of law. Financial regulation professors highlight that modern central banking operates within complex accountability frameworks. The Federal Reserve submits to multiple oversight mechanisms including congressional testimony, Government Accountability Office audits, and Inspector General reviews. These layered accountability structures help maintain public confidence in monetary institutions. Additionally, transparent communication practices have become increasingly important for central banks globally during the digital information age. Congressional Oversight and Federal Reserve Accountability The Federal Reserve’s unique position within government creates specific accountability requirements. Congress established the central bank through legislation and maintains oversight authority through several committees. The Federal Reserve Act mandates regular reporting and testimony requirements for Fed leadership. These accountability mechanisms ensure democratic control over monetary institutions while preserving operational independence for technical decisions. Recent congressional sessions have featured intensified scrutiny of Federal Reserve operations. Lawmakers have examined topics ranging from monetary policy decisions to workplace culture reforms. The renovation investigation represents the latest manifestation of this heightened oversight environment. Both Democratic and Republican committee leaders have emphasized their commitment to thorough examination of federal spending and executive branch transparency. The investigation process follows established legal protocols for executive branch officials. The Justice Department coordinates with relevant congressional committees while maintaining prosecutorial independence. Standard procedures include document reviews, witness interviews, and evidentiary analysis before determining whether to pursue formal charges. Legal timelines for such investigations typically span several months, though complex cases involving high-ranking officials may extend longer. Conclusion The investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell represents a significant development in federal oversight of central banking operations. While the legal process continues, the Federal Reserve maintains its focus on monetary policy objectives and financial stability mandates. The situation underscores the complex balance between central bank independence and democratic accountability in the United States. Furthermore, this development highlights ongoing congressional interest in federal building management and expenditure transparency. Market participants and policy observers will monitor subsequent developments while assessing potential implications for monetary policy continuity and institutional governance. FAQs Q1: What specific allegations does the Jerome Powell investigation involve? The investigation examines whether Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell provided false testimony to Congress regarding the renovation of the Federal Reserve’s Eccles Building, including potential misrepresentations about project costs, timelines, and authorization processes. Q2: How might this investigation affect Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions? Most analysts expect limited immediate policy impacts due to the Federal Reserve’s institutional decision-making structure. The Federal Open Market Committee operates collectively, and established procedures ensure policy continuity during leadership transitions or investigations. Q3: Has a sitting Federal Reserve chair ever faced similar investigations? Investigations of sitting Fed chairs remain exceptionally rare. The most comparable historical instance occurred in the 1970s when Chair Arthur Burns faced congressional inquiries about monetary policy decisions, though that did not involve allegations of false testimony. Q4: What legal consequences could result from this investigation? If prosecutors determine that violations occurred, potential consequences range from administrative resolutions to formal charges. False testimony to Congress constitutes a serious federal offense with potential legal penalties including fines or imprisonment, though such outcomes remain speculative during ongoing investigations. Q5: How are financial markets responding to the investigation news? Initial market reactions appear measured, with analysts noting that central bank institutional frameworks typically insulate policy operations from individual circumstances. However, prolonged uncertainty could potentially affect market confidence, particularly in currency and bond markets sensitive to leadership stability perceptions.

This two-point decline from the previous reading, reported by data provider Alternative.me, provides a crucial quantitative snapshot of prevailing market psychology as of early 2025. Consequently, understanding the mechanics and implications of this sentiment gauge becomes essential for navigating the current digital asset landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Methodology The Crypto Fear & Greed Index functions as a composite barometer, synthesizing multiple market data points into a single, digestible score ranging from 0 to 100. A score of 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed.’ The index’s current calculation, which resulted in the 27 reading, relies on a weighted model developed by Alternative.me. This model incorporates six primary components to avoid reliance on any single metric. Volatility (25%): This measures current price swings against historical averages. Higher volatility, especially to the downside, typically increases the fear score. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Recent trading volume and price momentum are analyzed. Sustained low volume during price declines often correlates with fear. Social Media (15%): The index scans platforms like Twitter and Reddit for sentiment, tracking the volume and tone of cryptocurrency discussions. Surveys (15%): Periodic polls of the retail investor community contribute directly to the sentiment score. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap is a key factor. Rising dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful periods. Trends (10%): Analysis of Google Search trends for cryptocurrency-related terms provides insight into retail interest levels. Therefore, the drop to 27 reflects negative shifts across several of these inputs simultaneously, rather than an isolated event. Historical Context and Market Cycle Positioning Placing the current 27 reading within a historical framework offers critical perspective. For instance, the index famously hit single-digit ‘Extreme Fear’ levels during major market capitulation events, such as the aftermath of the FTX collapse in late 2022. Conversely, it soared above 90 during the peak euphoria of late 2017 and early 2021. Analysts often observe that sustained periods in the ‘Fear’ or ‘Extreme Fear’ zones (below 30) have historically preceded significant market bottoms, though this is not a guaranteed timing mechanism. Index Range Sentiment Label Historical Example Period 0-24 Extreme Fear June 2022, November 2022 25-49 Fear Current Reading (27), Early 2023 50-74 Greed Q4 2023, Early 2024 75-100 Extreme Greed November 2021, April 2024 The persistence of fear, as indicated by the index hovering in this range, suggests the market is digesting a combination of macroeconomic factors and asset-specific developments. These potentially include global interest rate trajectories, regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) in major economies like the United States and European Union, and the performance of related traditional asset classes. Expert Analysis on Sentiment Indicators Financial behavioral analysts emphasize that sentiment indices like the Fear & Greed Index are contrarian indicators at their extremes. ‘When the index shows extreme fear, it often signals that selling pressure may be exhausting itself,’ notes a market strategist from a quantitative finance research firm. ‘However, the key is duration. A brief spike to 25 is different from a multi-week consolidation in the 20-30 range, which indicates deeply entrenched caution.’ Furthermore, institutional adoption trends in 2025, such as the maturation of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), may be altering the historical relationship between retail sentiment and price action. Large-scale institutional flows can sometimes move counter to retail sentiment, adding a new layer of complexity to market analysis. Potential Implications for Crypto Investors in 2025 The current ‘Fear’ reading carries several practical implications for market participants. Firstly, it often correlates with reduced leverage in the market, as traders de-risk their positions. Secondly, it can create a environment where positive news triggers a more pronounced upward reaction, due to the market being under-positioned. For long-term investors, periods of fear are frequently scrutinized for potential accumulation opportunities, based on the historical mean-reversion tendency of the index. However, experts universally caution against using the index as a standalone trading signal. It must be combined with fundamental analysis, on-chain data metrics, and a clear assessment of macroeconomic conditions. The index serves best as a tool for understanding market psychology, not for predicting short-term price movements. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s decline to 27 provides a data-driven confirmation of the cautious stance prevailing in cryptocurrency markets. By analyzing its multi-factor methodology, historical parallels, and the expert context surrounding its movements, investors can better interpret this gauge of market emotion. While the index signals persistent fear, its true value lies in fostering a disciplined, research-driven approach, reminding participants that market sentiment often swings between extremes of fear and greed over time. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 27 mean? A score of 27 falls into the ‘Fear’ zone, indicating that current market data from volatility, volume, social media, and surveys collectively point to a pessimistic and cautious investor sentiment. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is created and published by the data platform Alternative.me. It is typically updated once per day, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a good tool for timing the market? Most analysts advise against using it as a sole timing tool. While extreme readings can signal potential turning points, it is best used in conjunction with other fundamental and technical analysis methods. Q4: Has the index been accurate in the past? The index has been effective at quantifying prevailing market moods at major tops and bottoms. However, it is a sentiment indicator, not a price predictor, and markets can remain in ‘Fear’ or ‘Greed’ for extended periods. Q5: Does the index only measure Bitcoin sentiment? While Bitcoin’s market dominance is a 10% component, the index primarily measures overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, as its other inputs (social media, surveys, volume) encompass the broader digital asset space.

The company, emerging from a period of significant restructuring, now targets the end of 2026 to launch a true commercial driverless service on the complex streets of Las Vegas. This ambitious timeline follows a complete technological overhaul, shifting from a traditional robotics framework to an AI foundation model-based architecture designed for safety, scalability, and affordability. Motional’s Strategic Pivot to an AI-First Robotaxi Future The journey to this point involved navigating considerable challenges. Nearly two years ago, Motional faced a critical inflection point. The joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv had missed its initial deadline for a driverless launch with Lyft. Subsequently, Aptiv withdrew financial backing, prompting Hyundai to inject an additional $1 billion. A series of layoffs, including a major 40% workforce reduction in May 2024, reduced employee numbers from a peak of 1,400 to under 600. Concurrently, rapid advancements in generative AI and foundation models presented a new technological paradigm. Confronted with this reality, Motional leadership made a decisive choice: pause all commercial activities and fundamentally re-architect their approach. “We recognized the tremendous potential with all the AI advancements,” explained Motional President and CEO Laura Major in an exclusive briefing. “While we had a safe, driverless system, a gap existed to achieving an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally. We made the very hard decision to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.” This strategic slowdown enabled a complete shift from a system reliant on numerous individual machine learning models and rules-based programming to a unified, end-to-end AI foundation model. The Technical Architecture: From Fragmented Models to a Unified AI Brain Previously, Motional’s autonomous stack used separate ML models for discrete tasks like perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. This created a complex, sometimes brittle, software web. The new approach leverages a transformer-based architecture—similar to those powering large language models—applied to physical AI systems. This single backbone model processes sensor data and makes driving decisions in a more integrated, efficient manner. The key technical advantages of this AI-first shift include: Generalization: The system can adapt to new cities, traffic light designs, and driving scenarios more easily by training on new data rather than requiring extensive re-engineering. Cost Optimization: A streamlined architecture reduces computational overhead, a critical factor for building a commercially viable service. Scalability: The unified model simplifies the process of expanding operations beyond initial deployment zones. Motional maintains that this architecture provides “the best of both worlds,” retaining the ability for developers to work with specific components while benefiting from the power of a foundational AI system. The Roadmap to Driverless: A Phased Launch in Las Vegas Motional’s path to a driverless 2026 launch is deliberate and phased. The company has already initiated an internal robotaxi service for employees in Las Vegas, operating Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles with a human safety operator behind the wheel. This service is planned to expand to the public via an unnamed ride-hailing partner later in 2025. The final, crucial step will occur by the end of 2026, when the safety operator is removed from the vehicle, marking the start of a genuine commercial driverless operation. This phased approach allows for extensive real-world data collection and system refinement in a controlled yet challenging environment. Las Vegas presents a unique proving ground with its dense pedestrian traffic, complex hotel valet zones, bustling event traffic, and around-the-clock activity. First-Hand Experience: Navigating the Vegas Strip Autonomously During a recent demonstration, a Motional Ioniq 5 navigated a 30-minute route off the Las Vegas Strip and into the congested pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Resort & Casino. This environment, notorious for stopped taxis, unloading passengers, and constant pedestrian flow, was previously handled by the human safety driver. In the demo, the vehicle autonomously nudged around obstacles, executed lane changes, and proceeded cautiously, showing progress in handling these edge cases. While the vehicle exhibited cautious behavior, such as taking extra time to maneuver around a double-parked delivery van, no disengagement—where the safety driver must take control—occurred during the ride. This represents a tangible step beyond Motional’s previous operations with Lyft, where vehicles only handled portions of a route, with human drivers always responsible for complex zones like parking lots and hotel lobbies. The Competitive and Industrial Context of the 2026 Target Motional’s reboot occurs within a highly dynamic and competitive autonomous vehicle sector. Companies like Waymo and Cruise have deployed commercial services, albeit facing regulatory and operational hurdles. Meanwhile, Tesla continues to develop its “Full Self-Driving” system, and numerous startups are advancing different technological approaches. Motional’s differentiator lies in its deep integration with a major automotive OEM, Hyundai, which provides manufacturing scale, vehicle integration expertise, and long-term financial commitment. The shift to an AI-first approach also reflects a broader industry trend. The success of foundation models in language and vision has spurred their application in robotics, promising systems that learn more efficiently from data and adapt to new environments with less manual programming. Motional’s bet is that this architectural shift is the key to bridging the gap from demonstration projects to profitable, large-scale deployment. Motional’s Reboot: Key Milestones and Changes Timeline Event Strategic Impact 2023-2024 Missed initial launch deadline; Aptiv exits; Hyundai invests $1B; Major layoffs (40% cut). Forced strategic reassessment and financial restructuring. 2024 Decision to pause commercial ops and pivot to AI-first foundation model architecture. Fundamental technological reboot for long-term scalability. 2025 Internal employee robotaxi service launches; Public service with safety driver planned. Real-world data gathering and system validation phase. End of 2026 Target for commercial driverless service launch in Las Vegas. Ultimate goal of removing the human safety operator for commercial rides. Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on AI for Scalable Autonomy Motional’s journey from a crossroads to a clear, AI-driven roadmap underscores the volatile yet transformative nature of the autonomous vehicle industry. The company’s 2026 target for a driverless Motional robotaxi service in Las Vegas is not merely a new deadline but the outcome of a painful yet necessary strategic and technological transformation. By embracing an AI-first foundation model approach, Motional aims to solve the critical challenges of generalization and cost that have hindered widespread autonomous deployment. With Hyundai’s sustained backing and a focused phased rollout, the company is betting that its period of slowing down has positioned it to ultimately speed ahead in the race to bring scalable, driverless transportation to city streets. FAQs Q1: What is Motional’s new target date for launching a driverless robotaxi service? Motional is now targeting the end of 2026 to launch a commercial, truly driverless (no human safety operator) robotaxi service in Las Vegas. Q2: How has Motional’s technology changed in its reboot? The company has pivoted from using many separate machine learning models and rules-based code to an “AI-first” approach centered on a single, large foundation model. This architecture, inspired by models like GPT, is designed to be more efficient, easier to scale to new cities, and more cost-effective. Q3: Who owns and backs Motional financially? Motional is a joint venture originally formed by Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv. After Aptiv stepped back as a financial backer, Hyundai became the majority owner, providing an additional $1 billion investment to fund the company’s reboot and continued development. Q4: What is the significance of choosing Las Vegas for the initial driverless service? Las Vegas provides an exceptionally challenging real-world environment with dense traffic, complex hotel pickup zones, and heavy pedestrian activity. Successfully operating there would demonstrate the system’s robustness and ability to handle difficult “edge cases.” Q5: What is the long-term vision beyond robotaxis for Motional’s technology? According to CEO Laura Major, the ultimate goal is to deploy Level 4 autonomous technology—the same system used for robotaxis—into personal consumer vehicles. Robotaxis are viewed as the first crucial step to prove and refine the technology for broader automotive integration.

57083514,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260522,1768178411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitmine-Linked Address Makes Stunning $340 Million Ethereum Staking Move, Signaling Major Confidence",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitmine-ethereum-staking-340-million/,"BitcoinWorld Bitmine-Linked Address Makes Stunning $340 Million Ethereum Staking Move, Signaling Major Confidence A cryptocurrency address associated with the prominent mining entity Bitmine has executed a stunning $340 million Ethereum staking transaction, dramatically increasing its already massive position in the world’s second-largest blockchain network. According to data from the blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens, this single address staked an additional 109,504 ETH, bringing its total staked Ethereum to a colossal 1.19 million ETH, valued at approximately $3.7 billion. This move represents one of the largest single-entity staking actions observed in 2025 and provides critical insights into institutional confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Bitmine ETH Staking Activity Analyzed The recent transaction, detected on February 15, 2025, marks a significant escalation in commitment from an entity already deeply embedded in Ethereum’s validator ecosystem. Blockchain analysts immediately identified patterns linking the transaction behavior and historical activity to Bitmine, a well-established player in both cryptocurrency mining and digital asset management. Consequently, this staking move involves converting liquid Ethereum into staked ETH, which becomes illiquid and actively participates in securing the network while earning rewards. The scale of this operation suggests sophisticated treasury management and a long-term bullish outlook on Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition. Furthermore, staking such a substantial amount requires navigating technical complexities, including validator node setup and slashing risk management. The address now controls a validator set equivalent to thousands of individual nodes, representing a notable percentage of the total staked ETH supply. This concentration, while significant, remains within network decentralization parameters, as Ethereum’s design distributes validation duties among all active participants. Market observers note that large-scale staking from known entities can influence market sentiment by signaling reduced selling pressure and increased network security investment. Ethereum Staking Ecosystem and Market Context The Ethereum staking landscape has evolved dramatically since the network’s transition to proof-of-stake in 2022, known as The Merge. Currently, over 30% of all circulating ETH is staked, locking billions in value to validate transactions and create new blocks. Major participants include solo stakers, liquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool, centralized exchanges, and institutional entities like the one linked to Bitmine. Each staker earns annual percentage yields (APY) that fluctuate based on total network participation and transaction fee revenue. For context, the $340 million stake represents approximately: 0.09% of the total current Ethereum market capitalization. 0.3% of the total value locked in Ethereum staking contracts. Enough ETH to run over 3,400 individual validator nodes. This action occurs during a period of heightened network activity, with Ethereum processing millions of daily transactions across decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and layer-2 scaling solutions. The staking yield, while variable, provides a consistent return on digital asset holdings, making it an attractive strategy for long-term holders compared to holding idle assets. Expert Analysis of Large-Scale Staking Impacts Blockchain economists and market analysts provide crucial perspective on transactions of this magnitude. Dr. Elena Vargas, a leading researcher at the Digital Asset Governance Institute, explains, “When a sophisticated entity like Bitmine increases its staking position by hundreds of millions, it sends multiple signals to the market. Primarily, it demonstrates conviction in Ethereum’s long-term viability and the sustainability of its staking economics. Additionally, it reduces the liquid supply of ETH, which can have deflationary effects, especially when combined with Ethereum’s fee-burning mechanism.” Technical analysts also monitor the health implications for the network. A diverse validator set is crucial for censorship resistance and security. While large stakes from single entities require monitoring, Ethereum’s slashing conditions and distributed block proposal mechanisms prevent any single validator from dominating consensus. The network’s resilience has been proven through multiple market cycles and technical upgrades, including the recent Dencun upgrade which significantly reduced layer-2 transaction costs. Historical Comparison and Staking Trends To understand the significance of this transaction, historical data provides essential context. Large-scale staking movements often precede or follow major network upgrades and market shifts. The table below compares notable institutional staking events since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake: Date Entity ETH Staked Approx. Value (at time) Market Context Q2 2023 Unknown Institution 65,000 ETH $120M Post-Shanghai Upgrade Q4 2024 Digital Asset Fund 82,500 ETH $260M Before ETF Approvals Feb 2025 Bitmine-linked Address 109,504 ETH $340M Current Analysis This trend indicates growing institutional comfort with staking mechanics and regulatory clarity. The consistent increase in stake size and value reflects both Ethereum’s price appreciation and growing allocation from traditional finance players. Moreover, the development of institutional-grade staking infrastructure, including insurance against slashing and secure custody solutions, has removed previous barriers to entry for large-scale participants. Regulatory and Security Considerations Operating validator nodes at this scale involves navigating an evolving regulatory landscape. Financial authorities in multiple jurisdictions have begun providing guidance on staking activities, particularly concerning tax treatment and securities classification. Entities like Bitmine typically employ compliance teams to ensure their operations adhere to local regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements where applicable. From a security perspective, managing thousands of validator keys presents significant operational challenges. Best practices include: Using distributed, multi-party computation (MPC) for key management. Implementing geographic distribution of validator nodes to ensure uptime. Maintaining rigorous monitoring for slashing conditions. Employing dedicated security teams for infrastructure protection. The public nature of blockchain transactions means this staking activity is transparent and verifiable by anyone, aligning with the core principles of decentralized systems. This transparency allows market participants to make informed decisions based on observable on-chain behavior rather than relying solely on corporate announcements or financial reports. Conclusion The Bitmine-linked address staking an additional $340 million in ETH represents a substantial vote of confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake ecosystem and long-term value proposition. This transaction brings the entity’s total staked Ethereum to $3.7 billion, positioning it as one of the network’s most significant validators. The move highlights ongoing institutional adoption of cryptocurrency staking as a treasury management strategy and reflects sophisticated engagement with blockchain economics. As the Ethereum network continues to evolve through protocol upgrades and expanding use cases, large-scale staking activities will remain crucial indicators of market sentiment and network health, providing valuable data points for investors, developers, and analysts monitoring the digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What does it mean to “stake” Ethereum? Staking Ethereum involves depositing 32 ETH (or more through pooled services) to activate validator software that processes transactions and creates new blocks on the proof-of-stake network. Validators earn rewards for securing the network but risk penalties (slashing) for malicious or unreliable behavior. Q2: Why would an entity like Bitmine stake such a large amount? Large-scale staking provides several benefits: earning yield on digital asset holdings (typically 3-5% APY), contributing to network security, demonstrating long-term commitment to the ecosystem, and potentially reducing liquid supply which can support price stability. Q3: How does this staking activity affect ordinary Ethereum users? Increased staking generally improves network security and decentralization, making Ethereum more resilient against attacks. However, very large stakes from single entities require monitoring to ensure they don’t compromise decentralization ideals that are fundamental to blockchain networks. Q4: Can staked Ethereum be unstaked and sold? Yes, but with limitations. After the Shanghai upgrade, staked ETH can be withdrawn through a queue system that processes a limited number of validators per epoch. This means large positions cannot be liquidated instantly, preventing sudden market shocks from massive unstaking events. Q5: What are the risks of staking at this scale? Primary risks include slashing penalties for validator misbehavior, technical failures causing downtime, potential regulatory changes affecting staking legality, and opportunity cost if ETH price declines significantly. Large entities typically employ sophisticated risk management strategies to mitigate these concerns.

From Washington D.C. to Seoul, central bankers and economic indicators will provide essential signals about inflation control, employment stability, and interest rate paths during this critical post-holiday period. Financial Events This Week: A High-Stakes Economic Calendar The January 12-16, 2025 economic calendar represents one of the most concentrated periods for monetary policy communication and economic data releases in recent months. This convergence of events occurs as global markets assess whether central banks have successfully engineered a “soft landing” following aggressive inflation-fighting measures. The Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book” release on January 14 will provide particularly valuable regional economic insights, while consumer and producer price indices will reveal whether disinflation trends have continued through year-end 2024. Market participants typically monitor such clustered events for several key reasons. First, multiple Federal Reserve presidents speaking within short timeframes can reveal consensus or divergence within the central bank. Second, back-to-back CPI and PPI releases offer comprehensive inflation perspectives. Third, international rate decisions from countries like South Korea provide global monetary policy context. Historical analysis shows that January economic data often sets the tone for first-quarter market performance and policy expectations. Federal Reserve Communication Strategy and Market Impact The Federal Reserve has scheduled an unusually high number of speaking engagements this week, featuring both voting and non-voting FOMC members. This communication strategy reflects the central bank’s increased transparency efforts following criticism during previous economic transitions. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic appears three times, suggesting particular emphasis on regional economic perspectives from the Southeast. His remarks will likely address manufacturing resilience, housing market conditions, and labor market tightness in his district. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin’s multiple appearances indicate focus on Mid-Atlantic economic conditions, particularly regarding services sector inflation and commercial real estate markets. Meanwhile, FOMC member John Williams, as President of the New York Fed, brings crucial insights about financial market functioning and banking sector stability. His dual speaking engagements on January 12 and 14 will be closely analyzed for any signals about the Fed’s balance sheet normalization process and liquidity management strategies. Historical Context of January Economic Releases January economic data traditionally carries disproportionate weight in annual forecasting models. The December CPI release, scheduled for January 13 at 1:30 p.m. UTC, represents the final major inflation reading before the Federal Reserve’s January 28-29 policy meeting. Economists will scrutinize whether core inflation continues its gradual descent toward the Fed’s 2% target. Historical patterns show that January revisions to previous months’ data can sometimes alter the inflation narrative significantly, making this week’s releases particularly consequential. The Producer Price Index (PPI) on January 14 provides forward-looking signals about consumer price pressures, as producer costs often translate to consumer prices with a lag. Recent PPI trends have shown greater volatility than CPI, reflecting global commodity price fluctuations and supply chain adjustments. The simultaneous release of the Beige Book creates a comprehensive picture, combining hard data with qualitative business intelligence from across the Fed’s twelve districts. Global Monetary Policy Interconnections While U.S. events dominate the calendar, the Bank of Korea’s interest rate decision on January 15 at 1:00 a.m. UTC represents a significant Asian monetary policy development. South Korea serves as a bellwether for export-dependent economies, and its policy decisions often precede similar moves by other central banks in the region. The timing, just hours before U.S. jobless claims data, creates an interesting East-West policy juxtaposition that global investors will analyze for divergence or convergence signals. International monetary policy coordination has become increasingly important as capital flows respond to interest rate differentials. The Federal Reserve’s decisions significantly impact emerging market currencies and debt markets, making Fed communication this week relevant far beyond U.S. borders. Central banks in Europe and Asia will likely reference Fed guidance in their own policy deliberations throughout January and February. Key Economic Indicators This Week: Timing and Significance Date & Time (UTC) Event Market Significance Jan 13, 1:30 p.m. U.S. December CPI Primary inflation gauge for Fed policy Jan 14, 1:30 p.m. U.S. December PPI Forward-looking price pressure indicator Jan 14, 7:00 p.m. Fed Beige Book Qualitative regional economic intelligence Jan 15, 1:30 p.m. Initial Jobless Claims Weekly labor market health check Jan 15, 1:00 a.m. South Korea Rate Decision Asian monetary policy bellwether Practical Implications for Investors and Policymakers Market participants should prepare for potential volatility around specific event times, particularly during the CPI release and major Fed speeches. Historical volatility analysis shows that: CPI releases typically generate the highest immediate market impact Fed speeches often produce more gradual price adjustments as markets digest nuances Beige Book releases sometimes reveal unexpected regional trends that affect sector-specific investments International rate decisions can trigger currency market reactions that spill into other asset classes Trading volumes typically increase during such event-heavy weeks, with particular attention to Treasury yields, equity index futures, and currency pairs. The concentration of events also increases the likelihood of conflicting signals, requiring sophisticated interpretation rather than reactive trading. Professional analysts will be comparing real-time data against consensus forecasts, which have become increasingly accurate due to improved economic modeling techniques. Data Interpretation Frameworks and Analytical Approaches Modern economic analysis employs multiple frameworks for interpreting clustered events like those occurring this week. The “signal extraction” approach separates persistent trends from temporary fluctuations. The “policy reaction function” analysis predicts how central banks might respond to data surprises. The “market pricing efficiency” assessment evaluates whether asset prices have adequately anticipated probable outcomes. For the CPI release, analysts will focus particularly on: Core versus headline inflation differentials Shelter cost components and their lagged relationship to market rents Services inflation persistence versus goods disinflation Year-over-year versus month-over-month comparisons These analytical dimensions help market participants distinguish between noise and meaningful trend changes. The Federal Reserve itself uses similar frameworks in its policy deliberations, making this week’s speeches particularly valuable for understanding how policymakers interpret incoming data. Conclusion The financial events this week represent a critical convergence of data releases and policy communication that will significantly influence market directions and economic expectations for early 2025. From inflation measurements to Federal Reserve guidance, each event contributes pieces to the complex puzzle of global economic conditions. Market participants, policymakers, and economic observers should monitor these developments closely, recognizing that January often sets important precedents for the remainder of the year. The interplay between hard data and qualitative insights will be particularly revealing during this pivotal week of financial events. FAQs Q1: Why are there so many Federal Reserve speeches scheduled this week? The concentration reflects the Fed’s commitment to transparent communication following major policy shifts. Multiple perspectives help markets understand committee thinking before the January 28-29 FOMC meeting. Q2: How does the December CPI release in January affect Federal Reserve policy? As the final major inflation reading before the Fed’s January meeting, it significantly influences the policy discussion and potential rate decision, particularly regarding the timing of any policy adjustments. Q3: What is the Beige Book and why is it important? The Beige Book is the Federal Reserve’s qualitative summary of economic conditions across its twelve districts, providing ground-level business intelligence that complements statistical data. Q4: Why does South Korea’s rate decision matter to global markets? South Korea serves as an economic bellwether for export-oriented Asian economies, and its policy decisions often signal broader regional trends and impact global supply chain expectations. Q5: How should investors approach this event-heavy week? Investors should focus on the broader narrative rather than reacting to individual data points, watch for consensus versus outlier views among Fed speakers, and consider how different assets might respond to various data combinations.

The most substantial single event involves Arbitrum’s ARB token releasing $18.88 million on January 16, potentially influencing layer-2 scaling solution valuations across the blockchain ecosystem. These scheduled releases represent critical moments for investors monitoring supply inflation and project tokenomics. Understanding This Week’s Major Token Unlocks Token unlocks represent scheduled releases of previously restricted cryptocurrency tokens into circulating supply. According to Tokenomist data, this week features particularly concentrated activity across multiple blockchain networks. The releases follow predetermined vesting schedules established during each project’s initial token distribution. Market analysts consistently monitor these events because increased circulating supply can potentially affect token prices through basic economic principles of supply and demand. Historically, token unlock events have demonstrated varied market impacts depending on multiple factors. These factors include the percentage of circulating supply being released, overall market conditions, project fundamentals, and investor sentiment. The cryptocurrency industry has developed more sophisticated analysis frameworks for these events since the 2021-2022 market cycle, with institutional investors particularly focused on supply schedule transparency. Detailed Unlock Schedule and Market Context The week begins with three simultaneous releases on January 15 at 12:00 a.m. UTC. CONX leads with 1.32 million tokens valued at $20.59 million, representing 1.59% of its circulating supply. Simultaneously, STRK unlocks 127 million tokens worth $10.33 million (4.83% of supply), while SEI releases 55.56 million tokens valued at $6.7 million (1.05% of supply). These coordinated morning releases could create temporary market volatility as investors adjust positions. January 16 features the week’s headline event at 12:00 p.m. UTC. The Arbitrum network unlocks 92.65 million ARB tokens valued at $18.88 million. This release represents 1.86% of ARB’s circulating supply. Arbitrum, as Ethereum’s leading layer-2 scaling solution by total value locked, commands significant market attention. The network’s tokenomics design includes gradual releases to fund ecosystem development while managing inflation. Weekly Token Unlock Summary (January 12-18, 2025) Date Token Amount Value % of Supply Jan 15 CONX 1.32M $20.59M 1.59% Jan 15 STRK 127M $10.33M 4.83% Jan 15 SEI 55.56M $6.7M 1.05% Jan 16 ARB 92.65M $18.88M 1.86% Jan 17 DBR 618M $11.52M 14.81% Jan 17 ZK 173M $5.89M 3.16% January 17 Concludes With Significant Percentage Releases The week concludes on January 17 with two notable releases. At 12:00 a.m. UTC, DBR unlocks 618 million tokens worth $11.52 million. This substantial release represents 14.81% of circulating supply, marking the week’s largest percentage increase. Later at 8:00 a.m. UTC, ZK releases 173 million tokens valued at $5.89 million, constituting 3.16% of its circulating supply. These back-to-back events complete a week of concentrated token supply expansion. Market Impact Analysis and Historical Precedents Token unlock events typically generate market attention because they increase circulating supply. However, the actual price impact varies significantly based on multiple variables. Market analysts generally consider several key factors when assessing potential impacts. These factors include the unlock size relative to average daily trading volume, recipient composition, and overall market sentiment. Additionally, project fundamentals and recent developments significantly influence market reactions. Historical data from 2023-2024 reveals interesting patterns regarding token unlock impacts. Generally, smaller percentage releases (under 2% of circulating supply) show minimal immediate price effects in liquid markets. Conversely, larger percentage releases (over 5% of supply) frequently correlate with short-term price pressure. However, these patterns demonstrate exceptions based on specific project circumstances and broader market conditions. Market structure has evolved considerably regarding token unlock events. Sophisticated investors now employ various strategies around scheduled releases. Some participants implement hedging strategies using options or futures contracts. Others adjust portfolio allocations in anticipation of potential volatility. Meanwhile, long-term investors often view unlocks as natural components of project tokenomics rather than singular trading events. Expert Perspectives on Modern Tokenomics Design Blockchain economists emphasize the importance of well-designed vesting schedules. Properly structured unlock mechanisms balance several competing priorities. These priorities include providing sufficient liquidity for ecosystem growth while preventing excessive supply inflation. Additionally, they align incentives between early contributors and long-term community members. Modern projects increasingly adopt transparent, gradual release schedules rather than concentrated unlock events. The cryptocurrency industry has developed best practices around token distribution transparency. Leading projects now provide detailed vesting schedules publicly before token generation events. This transparency allows investors to make informed decisions regarding long-term holdings. Furthermore, it enables more accurate valuation models incorporating future supply increases. The trend toward greater transparency represents significant progress in cryptocurrency market maturity. Investor Considerations and Strategic Approaches Investors monitoring token unlock events should consider several analytical frameworks. First, evaluate the unlock’s size relative to the token’s market capitalization and daily trading volume. Second, research the recipients of unlocked tokens—whether they’re team members, investors, or ecosystem funds. Third, assess the project’s recent developments and roadmap execution. Finally, consider broader market conditions and sector trends. Several strategic approaches have emerged for navigating token unlock periods. Some investors implement dollar-cost averaging strategies around known unlock dates. Others focus on fundamental analysis, determining whether project developments justify potential dilution. Meanwhile, quantitative traders may employ statistical arbitrage strategies based on historical unlock patterns. Each approach carries distinct risk profiles requiring careful consideration. Portfolio management around token unlocks requires disciplined risk assessment. Diversification across projects with staggered unlock schedules can mitigate concentration risk. Additionally, position sizing should account for potential volatility around major release dates. Many institutional investors now incorporate unlock calendars into their regular market analysis routines, reflecting the maturity of cryptocurrency investment practices. Conclusion This week’s concentrated token unlocks represent important moments for cryptocurrency market participants. The $18.9 million ARB release on January 16 commands particular attention given Arbitrum’s position in the layer-2 ecosystem. However, all seven scheduled releases warrant monitoring for potential market impacts. Investors should analyze these events within broader contexts of project fundamentals and market conditions. Ultimately, token unlocks constitute normal components of blockchain project tokenomics rather than inherently bearish events. Proper understanding and strategic positioning can help investors navigate these scheduled supply increases effectively. FAQs Q1: What are token unlocks in cryptocurrency? Token unlocks refer to scheduled releases of previously restricted tokens into circulating supply. These events follow predetermined vesting schedules established during a project’s initial token distribution, typically involving team allocations, investor tokens, or ecosystem funds becoming liquid. Q2: Why does the ARB token unlock matter for investors? The ARB token unlock matters because it increases circulating supply of a major layer-2 scaling solution’s native token. With $18.88 million worth of tokens entering circulation, investors monitor potential price impacts and assess whether the release aligns with Arbitrum’s development roadmap and ecosystem growth. Q3: How do token unlocks typically affect cryptocurrency prices? Token unlock effects vary based on multiple factors including release size relative to trading volume, market conditions, and project fundamentals. Historically, smaller releases often show minimal immediate impact, while larger percentage releases sometimes correlate with short-term price pressure, though exceptions frequently occur. Q4: What percentage of circulating supply is considered a significant unlock? Releases exceeding 5% of circulating supply generally attract significant market attention, while releases under 2% often have more limited immediate impact. However, the actual significance depends on additional factors like token liquidity, recipient composition, and overall market sentiment. Q5: How can investors prepare for major token unlock events? Investors can prepare by researching vesting schedules in advance, diversifying across projects with staggered unlock dates, considering position sizing adjustments, and focusing on fundamental analysis rather than reacting to short-term volatility. Many sophisticated investors incorporate unlock calendars into their regular market analysis routines.

Many large altcoins which characterized previous cycles now have lower momentum, slower chart movement, and fewer catalysts than in the past. This has driven investors to hunt on the next crypto to purchase. The new trend of cheaper altcoins of less than $0.5 has become a potential solution. Most of these tokens are earlier within their growth curves and take much less liquidity to shift. One of them is already up 300% in its presale period and is at this point an emerging structural winner. Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepecoin ( PEPE ) was a sensation in the market in the meme coin craze. The traders adored its viral culture, light spirit, and quick breakout in bullish mood. When this paper was written, PEPE was trading below one cent and had a multi-billion valuation. The first buyers had enormous payoffs and sales per day were high in months. Liquidity has become the challenge. The size of PEPE requires a lot of capital to achieve material chart advancements. According to market commentators, PEPE has been stalling in areas of important resistance. Breakout attempts have been made with failures in the past and this time the attempts have died out as a result of the selling pressure at the higher levels. To propel one to this size, retail involvement and external stimuli are needed. In the absence of either of them, the chart might be stuck in a narrow band. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is one of the most renowned crypto coins in the globe (DOGE). It was attractive because it was community-based energy, branded on a cultural level and was virally adopted when bull sentiment was in full swing. DOGE reached its paraxes at that time, and served as an icon of the early crypto wealth creation. It was listed on exchanges, it was backed by merchants, and it established a niche in the general discussion. Nowadays, DOGE is confronting another problem. Its story that propelled it has become weak. The community activity has subdued and the interest in search has dwindled and demand is not like it was in the explosive stage. The strength of the chart has been weakened and no apparent catalyst to drive the price action upwards. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Another model is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It is a new altcoin that is concerned with decentralized lending and borrowing. It is not dependent on viral hype or meme cycles; it does not need billions of liquidity to shift price. It instead relies on lending mechanics and collateral incentives that make the token dependent on actual platform activity. The protocol has two liquidity and borrowing markets, with the former tracking assets supplied, and the latter tracking loans. Rules of lending and borrowing are also foreseeable as opposed to being narrative based. This will allow users to earn interest without depending on hypothetical cycles of demand. Still in presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sells at $0.04 in Phase 7. More than 18,800 holders have participated and have raised over $19M. The demand has been steady and previous stages have already provided an approximate 300% appreciation since Phase 1 price of $0.01. Phase 7 is characterized by thinning; the stage implies that the presale might be pushed faster as the next stages are neared. The Long-term Case MUTM presents some mechanisms that relate the value of tokens to the utilization of the protocols. mtTokens are active supply positions and grow as borrowers pay interest. Its platform is based on a buy and redistribute scheme where MUTM bought in the open market is redistributed to users who post their mtTokens in the safety module. Scheduling oracle integrations assist the pricing and liquidation events to proceed seamlessly. These are instruments that develop a workable economy. This is as opposed to PEPE and DOGE. Both rely on sentiment. There is no organic revenue or long-term participation rewarding lending demand that either of them has. That is what Mutuum Finance offers to those drivers. In the bullish case, MUTM is expected to hit $0.30 to $0.36, which will be a 9X increase compared to the present presale price. Roadmap Catalysts Mutuum Finance also has scheduled significant roadmap catalysts. V1 protocol testnet is scheduled to be released in Q1. The CertiK audit had a score of 90/100. Halborn Security did a technical assay. A stable coin pegged on the interest of the borrowers is under development. To enhance speed and cut on transaction cost, Layer-2 deployment will be used. These are some of the steps that a protocol needs to consider in order to scale up into live borrowing markets. The inflows of whales have also enhanced in the presale. There is a 24 hour leaderboard that gives the best daily contributor $500 in MUTM. These signs bring about a sense of urgency to investors who are monitoring major cryptocurrencies that are below $0.1. Before the next crypto catalysts come many would want to be exposed.

This metric, meticulously tracked by analytics platforms like CoinMarketCap, serves as a vital pulse check for investors navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Consequently, understanding its current position and historical implications is essential for any informed market participant. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: A Market Barometer The Altcoin Season Index functions as a quantitative measure of market cycle phases. Specifically, analysts calculate it by comparing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day window. The methodology is straightforward yet powerful. If 75% or more of these major altcoins outperform Bitcoin during that period, the market officially enters an “altcoin season,” typically indicated by an index value approaching or exceeding 75. Conversely, a score below 25 strongly suggests a “Bitcoin season,” where the pioneer cryptocurrency outshines the broader altcoin market. The current index standing at 26 sits precisely on this borderline, leaning heavily towards Bitcoin dominance. The Mechanics Behind the Metric This index provides more than a simple snapshot. Firstly, the 90-day timeframe smooths out short-term volatility and noise, capturing sustained trends rather than fleeting spikes. Secondly, by focusing on the top 100 assets by market capitalization, it reflects the behavior of established projects with significant liquidity and investor interest. Finally, the exclusion of stablecoins—assets pegged to fiat currencies—and wrapped tokens ensures the analysis focuses purely on speculative performance against Bitcoin’s benchmark. This rigorous construction makes the index a trusted tool among institutional and retail analysts alike. Historical Context: From Euphoria to Consolidation To appreciate the significance of a score of 26, one must examine historical patterns. For instance, during the bull market crescendo of late 2021, the Altcoin Season Index frequently breached the 75 threshold, with some altcoins delivering returns that dwarfed Bitcoin’s gains. This period was characterized by explosive growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems. However, the subsequent bear market saw the index plummet and remain depressed, as capital fled riskier altcoins for the relative safety of Bitcoin, often called “digital gold.” The current reading suggests the market is in a phase of consolidation and selective risk assessment, not broad altcoin exuberance. Key historical index levels and their market implications: Above 75: Full altcoin season. Widespread risk-on sentiment and capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. 50-75: Transition phase. Increasing altcoin strength but lacking conclusive dominance. 25-50: Bitcoin-led market. Bitcoin outperforms most altcoins, but niche sectors may show strength. Below 25: Strong Bitcoin season. Pronounced flight to safety and quality, with Bitcoin as the primary beneficiary. Expert Analysis and Market Impact Market strategists interpret the index through multiple lenses. According to data from previous cycles compiled by research firms like Glassnode, prolonged periods with a low Altcoin Season Index often precede major capital rotations. Essentially, money accumulates in Bitcoin during uncertain times before eventually seeking higher beta opportunities in altcoins when confidence returns. The current environment, marked by evolving regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, may be building the foundation for such a future shift. However, the index clearly states that moment has not yet arrived. The Ripple Effect on Investment Strategies The prevailing Bitcoin season, as confirmed by the index, directly influences portfolio management. Prudent investors often increase their Bitcoin allocation during such phases, viewing it as a defensive anchor. Simultaneously, they may conduct deeper due diligence on altcoin projects, positioning for a potential season change. Venture capital flow into early-stage blockchain projects also serves as a leading indicator sometimes, as funding rounds can predict which sectors might lead the next altcoin rally. Currently, funding trends show a focus on infrastructure and scalability solutions rather than consumer-facing applications. Comparative Performance and Sector Divergence While the aggregate index points to Bitcoin dominance, significant divergence exists beneath the surface. A closer examination of crypto sectors reveals nuanced stories. For example, layer-1 blockchain tokens have shown mixed results against Bitcoin, with some newer networks holding their ground. Meanwhile, memecoins and highly speculative assets have generally underperformed dramatically. This underscores a critical point: the Altcoin Season Index measures a broad average, and savvy investors use it as a starting point for more granular, sector-specific analysis. Table: Hypothetical 90-Day Performance vs. Bitcoin (Illustrative) Asset Category Representative Tokens Trend vs. Bitcoin (Index Major Layer 1s ETH, SOL, AVAX Mixed / Slight Underperformance DeFi Governance UNI, AAVE General Underperformance AI & Big Data FET, RNDR Potential Outperformance (Sector-specific) Memecoins Varied Significant Underperformance Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index, standing resolutely at 26, delivers an unambiguous message about the current cryptocurrency market structure: Bitcoin remains the dominant force. This metric, rooted in comparative performance data over a meaningful timeframe, provides an essential framework for understanding market cycles. While it does not predict short-term price movements, it offers invaluable context for risk assessment and strategic asset allocation. For now, the season belongs to Bitcoin, and the index will be the first to signal when the winds of change begin to favor the broader altcoin market. Monitoring this indicator, therefore, remains a cornerstone of sophisticated crypto market analysis. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index of 26 mean? An index value of 26 indicates that less than 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the prior 90 days. Specifically, it signals the market is in a “Bitcoin season,” where capital and outperformance are concentrated in Bitcoin rather than being spread across alternative cryptocurrencies. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? Platforms calculate the index by analyzing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) relative to Bitcoin. The score reflects the percentage of those altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin. A result above 75 triggers an “altcoin season” designation. Q3: Can the market be in an altcoin season if Bitcoin’s price is also rising? Yes, absolutely. An altcoin season is defined by relative performance, not absolute price direction. During a true altcoin season, the prices of major altcoins rise at a significantly faster percentage rate than Bitcoin’s price, even if Bitcoin itself is also appreciating in value. Q4: Why are stablecoins excluded from the Altcoin Season Index calculation? Analysts exclude stablecoins because their value is designed to remain pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Their price does not fluctuate against the dollar in the same way speculative assets do, so including them would distort the measurement of relative performance against Bitcoin. Q5: Is the Altcoin Season Index a reliable timing tool for buying or selling? The index is a descriptive metric of the recent past, not a predictive timing tool. It confirms a prevailing market trend but does not forecast when that trend will reverse. Investors should use it as one piece of contextual data within a broader analysis framework that includes fundamentals, on-chain metrics, and macro-economic conditions.

This remarkable confrontation between America’s top monetary authority and federal prosecutors represents a critical test for the Federal Reserve’s cherished autonomy, potentially reshaping how interest rates get set for millions of Americans. Federal Reserve Independence Faces Unprecedented Challenge Jerome Powell’s statement marks a watershed moment in Federal Reserve history. The central bank chair explicitly connected the Department of Justice investigation to political pressure from the Trump administration, framing the probe as a pretext rather than legitimate oversight. Powell emphasized that the investigation’s timing and nature paradoxically demonstrate the Fed’s commitment to evidence-based decision-making. Historical context reveals why this confrontation matters profoundly. Since its 1913 creation, the Federal Reserve has operated with considerable independence from political branches. Congress designed this structure specifically to shield monetary policy from electoral cycles and partisan pressures. Previous administrations have occasionally criticized Fed decisions, but direct investigations targeting the chair’s conduct remain exceptionally rare. The current situation involves several key elements: Subpoena issuance by federal prosecutors Threat of indictment against the sitting Fed chair Political context of upcoming presidential transition Monetary policy implications for interest rate decisions Political Pressure on Central Bank Decisions Powell’s characterization of the investigation as politically motivated carries significant weight. The Federal Reserve chair argued that the probe demonstrates the institution has successfully maintained its independence, setting interest rates based on economic data rather than presidential preferences. This assertion touches on fundamental questions about democratic accountability versus technical expertise in economic governance. Comparisons with historical precedents prove instructive. During the 1970s, President Richard Nixon pressured Fed Chair Arthur Burns to keep interest rates low before elections, contributing to runaway inflation. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan respected Paul Volcker’s painful but necessary rate hikes to combat that inflation. More recently, President Donald Trump publicly criticized Powell’s rate decisions during his term. Historical Federal Reserve Political Pressure Points Period President Fed Chair Nature of Pressure Outcome 1970s Richard Nixon Arthur Burns Direct pressure for lower rates High inflation 1980s Ronald Reagan Paul Volcker Public support despite pain Inflation tamed 2018-2020 Donald Trump Jerome Powell Twitter criticism of hikes Policy maintained 2025 Transition Period Jerome Powell DOJ investigation Unfolding Expert Analysis on Institutional Integrity Monetary policy experts express deep concern about these developments. Former Fed officials note that central bank independence represents a cornerstone of modern economic stability. When politicians directly influence interest rate decisions, short-term political gains often undermine long-term economic health. International observers particularly watch this situation, as the Federal Reserve serves as the world’s de facto central bank, with the U.S. dollar functioning as the global reserve currency. The legal dimensions warrant careful examination. Federal Reserve chairs typically enjoy substantial protection from political interference, though they remain subject to legitimate oversight. The distinction between proper investigation and political pressure hinges on procedural regularity and evidentiary basis. Powell’s characterization suggests he views this probe as crossing that critical line. Monetary Policy at a Critical Crossroads Powell framed the current moment as a fundamental choice for the Federal Reserve system. The institution must decide whether to continue evidence-based rate decisions or adjust policy in response to political threats. This decision carries immediate practical consequences for American households and businesses facing borrowing costs, mortgage rates, and economic uncertainty. The broader implications extend beyond current interest rate levels. Central bank independence represents a public good that benefits all economic participants through price stability and predictable policy. When political considerations influence monetary decisions, several negative outcomes typically follow: Higher inflation from politically motivated stimulus Market volatility from unpredictable policy shifts Reduced credibility of future policy announcements International repercussions for dollar stability Financial markets have reacted cautiously to these developments. Bond yields showed increased volatility following Powell’s statement, reflecting investor uncertainty about future policy direction. Equity markets demonstrated particular sensitivity to the institutional implications, with financial sector stocks experiencing notable pressure. Conclusion Jerome Powell’s defense of Federal Reserve independence against what he terms an unprecedented Department of Justice investigation represents a defining moment for American economic governance. The central bank chair has drawn a clear line between legitimate oversight and political pressure, warning that the institution faces a fundamental choice about its future direction. As this situation develops, its resolution will likely shape monetary policy decisions affecting every American household and business for years to come. The preservation of Federal Reserve independence remains crucial for maintaining economic stability, controlling inflation, and ensuring that interest rate decisions serve the public good rather than political objectives. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the Department of Justice investigating regarding Jerome Powell? The specific allegations remain unclear from public statements, but Powell has characterized the investigation as relating to his conduct unrelated to testimony or building renovations. He views it as a pretext for political pressure on Federal Reserve decisions. Q2: Why is Federal Reserve independence considered so important? Central bank independence allows monetary policy decisions to focus on long-term economic stability rather than short-term political considerations. History shows that politically influenced interest rate decisions often lead to higher inflation and economic instability. Q3: Has a sitting Federal Reserve chair ever faced criminal investigation before? While Fed officials have occasionally faced scrutiny, a criminal investigation targeting a sitting chair’s conduct during ongoing monetary policy decisions appears unprecedented in modern Federal Reserve history. Q4: How might this situation affect interest rates and the economy? If political pressure influences Federal Reserve decisions, rates might remain artificially low to stimulate short-term growth, potentially causing higher inflation later. Market uncertainty could also increase volatility in borrowing costs. Q5: What legal protections does the Federal Reserve chair have against political pressure? The Federal Reserve operates as an independent agency within government, with its leadership serving fixed terms to insulate them from political removal. However, all officials remain subject to legitimate legal oversight and investigation for potential misconduct.

According to data from on-chain analytics provider EmberCN, this Ethereum whale, who originally accumulated 101,000 ETH at an average price of just $660, deposited the final 26,000 tokens to the Bitstamp exchange. This decisive move, valued at approximately $80.88 million at the time of transfer, marks the complete realization of a position now worth a staggering $269 million in profit. The event provides a critical case study in long-term crypto asset management and market signaling. Ethereum Whale Completes Strategic Exit at Bitstamp The recent deposit represents the culmination of a carefully executed exit plan. Initially, the investor amassed the 101,000 ETH holding over five years ago, a period when Ethereum was still solidifying its foundational technology and market position. Consequently, the decision to transfer the entire holding to exchanges, specifically concluding with Bitstamp, signals a full profit-taking cycle. Analysts scrutinize such large-scale movements for clues about investor sentiment and potential market liquidity shifts. Furthermore, the choice of Bitstamp, a long-standing European exchange known for its fiat gateways, suggests an intention to convert crypto assets into traditional currency. This transaction follows a clear pattern of gradual distribution rather than a single, market-shocking sale. By methodically moving portions of the holding over time, the whale likely mitigated slippage and avoided triggering excessive downward price pressure. This approach demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of market mechanics. On-chain data serves as an immutable ledger for these actions, providing transparency and a factual basis for market analysis. The blockchain reveals the wallet’s history, from accumulation to final dispersal, without need for speculation. Historical Context of the $660 Ethereum Accumulation To appreciate the scale of this profit, one must revisit the Ethereum landscape of five years ago. At an average entry point of $660, the accumulation occurred during a formative phase for the network. Key developments like the launch of the Beacon Chain for Ethereum 2.0 were on the horizon. Market sentiment was a mix of post-2017-crash recovery and cautious optimism about smart contract platforms. The whale’s commitment of capital at this juncture represented a significant bet on Ethereum’s long-term utility and value proposition, a bet that has now paid off handsomely. For comparison, consider the following table outlining Ethereum’s price journey relative to this investment: Period ETH Price (Approx.) Context for Whale’s Holdings Accumulation Phase (~5 years ago) $660 (average) Initial investment of ~$66.6 million for 101,000 ETH. 2021 Bull Market Peak ~$4,800 Paper value of holding exceeded $484 million. Time of Final Bitstamp Deposit ~$3,110 26,000 ETH chunk worth $80.88 million; total profit realized at $269M. This historical context is crucial. It transforms the transaction from a simple news item into a narrative about patience, conviction, and the volatile growth of decentralized technology. The whale held through multiple market cycles, including severe downturns, before executing this exit. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Signaling Market analysts and blockchain experts consistently monitor whale wallets for behavioral cues. A complete exit of this magnitude can be interpreted through several lenses. Primarily, it represents a massive realization of gains, which may indicate the investor believes the asset has reached a near-term valuation peak. However, it also injects substantial liquidity into the market. The transferred ETH can now be sold on Bitstamp, potentially increasing sell-side pressure if done rapidly. Conversely, some experts argue that the gradual, concluded exit of a long-term holder can have a neutral or even healthy effect on the market. It redistributes ownership, potentially transferring tokens to a broader base of newer investors. The transaction also underscores the profound liquidity and functionality of major crypto exchanges like Bitstamp, which can facilitate nine-figure transfers seamlessly. Importantly, no single transaction dictates market direction; it is one data point among millions. The overall market structure, macroeconomic factors, and Ethereum’s own network development remain the primary price drivers. Understanding Whale Behavior and Portfolio Management Whales, defined as entities holding large amounts of a cryptocurrency, wield significant influence. Their actions often follow identifiable patterns of accumulation, distribution, and staking. Key strategies include: Phased Exits: Selling large positions in chunks to minimize market impact, exactly as demonstrated in this case. Exchange Diversification: Using multiple trading platforms to disperse activity and access different liquidity pools. On-Chain to Off-Chain Movement: Transferring assets from private wallets to an exchange is typically a precursor to selling or trading, a strong bearish signal for that specific holder. For the average investor, understanding these patterns is more valuable than blindly following them. This whale’s success story highlights the importance of a clear investment thesis and risk management over multi-year horizons. It also exemplifies the final stage of the classic investment cycle: buy, hold, and take profits. The transparency of blockchain data allows everyone to learn from these high-profile portfolios, providing unique insights into advanced crypto asset management. Conclusion The final deposit of 26,000 ETH to Bitstamp by an early Ethereum adopter closes a seminal chapter in cryptocurrency investment history. This Ethereum whale has successfully realized a $269 million profit from an initial position acquired at $660, showcasing the transformative potential of strategic, long-term holding in the digital asset space. While the move sparks analysis regarding market sentiment and liquidity, its primary lesson is one of conviction and disciplined execution. As the blockchain ecosystem matures, such transparent records of success will continue to provide invaluable data and narratives, informing both new and experienced participants in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a whale deposits crypto to an exchange? Typically, it signals an intent to sell, trade, or use the assets in exchange-based financial products. Moving coins from a private wallet to an exchange is often the first step in liquidating a position. Q2: How does a $269 million profit realization affect the Ethereum market? While a single event rarely dictates long-term trends, it can increase immediate sell-side liquidity and influence short-term trader psychology. The phased nature of this exit likely softened its market impact. Q3: What is on-chain data, and why is it important? On-chain data refers to the recorded, immutable history of all transactions on a blockchain. It is crucial for verifying whale movements, analyzing network health, and conducting transparent market research without relying on self-reported information. Q4: Who is EmberCN? EmberCN is a provider of on-chain analytics and data intelligence. They track and report on significant blockchain transactions, wallet movements, and network metrics, serving as a source for journalists and analysts. Q5: Is Bitstamp a common exchange for large whale transactions? Yes, Bitstamp is one of the longest-operating and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Its robust fiat on-ramps and liquidity make it a viable choice for institutional and large-scale investors looking to convert crypto to traditional currency.

This development follows Walter Bloomberg’s exclusive report detailing Trump’s renewed engagement with Iranian domestic unrest. The situation presents significant implications for global energy markets, regional stability, and diplomatic relations during a crucial election year. Trump’s Iran Protests Monitoring Strategy Former President Trump’s statement about monitoring Iranian protests represents a continuation of his administration’s established foreign policy approach. During his presidency, Trump frequently commented on Iranian domestic affairs, particularly during the 2019-2020 protests. His current monitoring activities reportedly involve multiple intelligence channels and diplomatic sources. Consequently, this renewed attention coincides with escalating tensions between Tehran and Western powers over nuclear negotiations. Furthermore, Trump’s consideration of “strong response options” suggests potential policy shifts. Historical precedent indicates several possible approaches including economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, or public statements supporting protestors. However, experts caution that direct intervention remains unlikely given current political constraints. Meanwhile, the Iranian government continues to address domestic discontent while maintaining its regional influence. Historical Context of Iranian Protests Iran has experienced periodic protest movements throughout its modern history. The current wave follows established patterns of economic dissatisfaction and political unrest. Specifically, previous significant protests occurred in 2009, 2017-2018, 2019-2020, and 2022-2023. Each episode demonstrated particular characteristics: 2009 Green Movement: Primarily political, focused on election disputes 2017-2018 Economic Protests: Driven by inflation and unemployment concerns 2019-2020 Fuel Price Protests: Sparked by sudden subsidy removals 2022-2023 Mahsa Amini Protests: Began with women’s rights issues Therefore, understanding this historical continuum provides essential context for current developments. Additionally, regional observers note changing protest demographics and tactics over time. Geopolitical Implications and Expert Analysis Middle East analysts emphasize several critical factors in this situation. First, Iran’s strategic position affects global energy supplies through the Strait of Hormuz. Second, ongoing nuclear negotiations create delicate diplomatic balances. Third, regional proxy conflicts in Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon complicate responses. Fourth, domestic American politics influence foreign policy approaches. Dr. Sarah Chen, Georgetown University Middle East Studies professor, explains: “External commentary on Iranian protests often produces unintended consequences. The Iranian government frequently characterizes foreign statements as interference, potentially strengthening their domestic position. Meanwhile, protest movements must navigate complex internal dynamics regardless of external attention.” Moreover, energy market analysts monitor potential impacts on oil prices. Iran possesses the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves and second-largest natural gas reserves. Consequently, political instability could affect global energy markets significantly. However, current production levels remain relatively stable despite sanctions. Potential Response Options and Considerations Trump’s mention of “strong response options” suggests several possible approaches based on historical precedent. Each option carries distinct advantages and risks that policymakers must carefully evaluate. The following table outlines primary considerations: Response Option Potential Impact Historical Precedent Additional Sanctions Economic pressure on government Trump administration maximum pressure campaign Diplomatic Statements Moral support for protestors Multiple U.S. administrations International Forums Multilateral pressure UN Human Rights Council actions Cyber Operations Disruption capabilities Stuxnet and similar operations Furthermore, regional allies including Israel and Saudi Arabia maintain their own positions regarding Iranian developments. These relationships complicate any unified international response. Additionally, European powers often prefer diplomatic engagement over confrontation. Media Landscape and Information Challenges The Iranian government restricts internet access during protest periods, creating information gaps. Consequently, external observers rely on satellite imagery, diaspora reports, and intelligence sources. Social media platforms provide fragmented but valuable insights despite restrictions. However, verification remains challenging due to disinformation campaigns from multiple actors. International media organizations face particular difficulties reporting from inside Iran. Foreign journalists encounter visa restrictions and monitoring. Therefore, most coverage originates from outside the country. This situation creates inherent limitations in understanding ground realities. Nevertheless, technological advances improve monitoring capabilities over time. Economic Factors Driving Unrest Economic conditions significantly influence protest dynamics in Iran. The country faces multiple challenges including high inflation, unemployment, and currency depreciation. International sanctions exacerbate these difficulties despite some relief through alternative trading arrangements. Specifically, several key economic indicators demonstrate persistent problems: Annual inflation exceeding 40% in recent years Youth unemployment approaching 25% Currency losing approximately 90% of value since 2018 Oil exports reduced by over 80% from pre-sanction levels These economic pressures affect ordinary citizens disproportionately. Meanwhile, government resources address multiple priorities including military expenditures and regional commitments. Consequently, public dissatisfaction periodically erupts into protests despite security measures. Regional Security Considerations Iran’s regional activities influence international responses to domestic protests. The country maintains proxy relationships with several non-state actors across the Middle East. These include Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthi forces in Yemen, and various groups in Syria and Iraq. Therefore, external powers consider broader security implications when formulating responses. Additionally, Iran’s nuclear program remains a central concern for international security. Negotiations continue despite periodic setbacks. Domestic instability could affect these negotiations in multiple ways. Some analysts suggest weakened government positions might increase flexibility. Others argue instability produces more rigid positions. The actual outcome remains uncertain given complex variables. Conclusion Former President Trump’s monitoring of Iran protests and consideration of response options represents a significant development in Middle Eastern geopolitics. The situation involves complex historical, economic, and security dimensions requiring careful analysis. While external attention often focuses on dramatic developments, underlying structural factors drive long-term outcomes. Consequently, observers should maintain nuanced perspectives regarding potential developments. The Trump Iran protests situation will likely evolve through 2025 with implications extending beyond immediate events. FAQs Q1: What specific protests is Trump monitoring in Iran? The former president is monitoring ongoing anti-government demonstrations primarily driven by economic grievances and political discontent. These protests represent the latest wave in periodic unrest affecting Iran since 2017. Q2: What response options might Trump be considering? Potential options include economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure through international organizations, public statements supporting protestors, or coordination with regional allies. However, direct military intervention remains highly unlikely given current circumstances. Q3: How does this affect Iran nuclear negotiations? Domestic instability could influence nuclear negotiations in multiple directions. Some analysts suggest it might weaken Iran’s bargaining position, while others believe it could harden their stance against perceived external interference. Q4: What role do regional allies play in this situation? Countries including Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates maintain significant interests in Iranian developments. Their intelligence sharing and diplomatic coordination with the United States could influence response options. Q5: How reliable is information coming from Iran during protests? Information reliability varies due to internet restrictions and government controls. External observers use multiple verification methods including satellite imagery, diaspora networks, and intelligence sources to construct accurate assessments.

57084426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260545,1768181111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Gold Price Soars to Staggering All-Time High Above $4,600 as Investors Seek Safety",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gold-price-all-time-high-record/,"BitcoinWorld Gold Price Soars to Staggering All-Time High Above $4,600 as Investors Seek Safety Global financial markets witnessed a historic milestone this week as the spot gold price shattered records, surging past the $4,600 per ounce barrier for the first time. This remarkable ascent, representing a gain of approximately $280 since January, signals a profound shift in investor sentiment and global economic conditions. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the complex interplay of factors driving this unprecedented rally in the world’s oldest safe-haven asset. Gold Price Achieves Unprecedented Milestone The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) confirmed the spot gold price reached $4,612 per ounce during early trading. This record-breaking move decisively eclipses the previous peak set in late 2024. Moreover, the sustained upward trajectory throughout the first quarter underscores a powerful and consistent bullish trend. Market data from the World Gold Council shows trading volumes have increased by over 35% year-on-year. This surge clearly reflects heightened institutional and retail interest. Financial institutions globally are now reassessing their commodity allocations in response. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Rally Several key macroeconomic forces are converging to propel gold to new heights. Primarily, persistent geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the South China Sea continue to fuel demand for asset protection. Simultaneously, shifting monetary policy expectations from major central banks are impacting currency valuations. For instance, a weakening US dollar index has made dollar-denominated gold cheaper for international buyers. Additionally, concerns over stubborn inflationary pressures in several major economies are pushing investors toward tangible assets. Central bank purchasing activity provides further fundamental support. Notably, official sector demand has remained robust for eight consecutive quarters. Expert Insight on Market Dynamics Dr. Anya Sharma, Chief Commodities Strategist at Global Markets Analysis, provides critical context. “This isn’t a speculative bubble,” Sharma states. “We are observing a structural repricing of gold based on reevaluated long-term real interest rates and systemic risk. The $4,600 level is a technical confirmation of a new regime.” Historical data supports this analysis. During previous periods of monetary transition, gold has typically experienced multi-year bull markets. The current macroeconomic landscape shares several characteristics with those historical phases, including high sovereign debt levels and deglobalization trends. Comparative Performance and Market Impact The rally’s magnitude becomes clearer through comparison. The following table illustrates gold’s performance against other major asset classes year-to-date: Asset Class YTD Performance Spot Gold +6.5% S&P 500 Index +3.2% 10-Year US Treasury -1.8% Bloomberg Commodity Index +2.1% Bitcoin +15.4% This outperformance has significant ramifications. Mining equities, represented by the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index, have rallied sharply. Furthermore, physical gold ETFs have reported substantial inflows, exceeding $8 billion globally this quarter. The surge is also affecting consumer markets. Jewelry manufacturers and central banks are facing higher input costs, potentially altering demand dynamics in key markets like India and China. The Role of Central Banks and Institutional Investors Institutional behavior remains a cornerstone of current demand. Central banks, particularly in emerging markets, have accelerated gold accumulation. Their stated objectives include: Diversifying foreign reserves away from traditional fiat currencies. Hedging against financial sanctions risk and reducing dollar dependency. Preserving national wealth amid currency volatility. Concurrently, hedge funds and asset managers have increased their long positions in gold futures to near-record levels. This data comes from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) weekly Commitments of Traders reports. The collective action of these large players creates substantial momentum. It also provides a floor for prices during short-term market corrections. Technical Analysis and Future Price Trajectory From a chart perspective, the breakout above $4,600 is technically significant. It confirms the completion of a multi-year consolidation pattern. Key resistance levels now become potential support. However, analysts caution that such rapid advances often lead to increased volatility. The relative strength index (RSI) is entering overbought territory, suggesting the potential for a near-term pullback. Nevertheless, the primary trend remains unequivocally bullish. Major investment banks have revised their year-end targets upward, with several now projecting a test of the $4,800-$5,000 range if current macro conditions persist. Conclusion The gold price achieving a new all-time high above $4,600 per ounce marks a definitive moment for global markets. This movement is not an isolated event but the result of synchronized macroeconomic pressures, institutional strategy, and historical safe-haven demand. While short-term volatility is inevitable, the fundamental case for gold appears robust. Investors and policymakers alike will monitor this key barometer of economic anxiety and monetary stability closely in the coming months. The record gold price serves as a clear signal of the prevailing search for safety and enduring value in an uncertain financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the difference between spot gold and gold futures? The spot gold price refers to the current market price for immediate delivery and payment. Gold futures are exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell gold at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Q2: Why does a weaker US dollar often lead to a higher gold price? Gold is globally priced in US dollars. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for buyers using other currencies, which can increase international demand and push the dollar price higher. Q3: How does inflation affect the gold price? Gold is historically seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. When inflation erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies, investors often turn to gold to preserve their wealth, increasing demand. Q4: Are gold mining stocks a good way to invest during a gold rally? Gold mining stocks can offer leveraged exposure to the gold price, meaning they often rise more than the metal itself during a bull market. However, they also carry company-specific operational and financial risks that physical gold does not. Q5: What are the main risks of investing in gold? Primary risks include price volatility, the lack of yield (it doesn’t pay interest or dividends), storage and insurance costs for physical gold, and the potential for underperformance versus other assets during strong economic growth periods.

Following this request, a local news outlet noted that this move deepens discussions that have been ongoing for several months regarding cryptocurrencies in British elections. UK committee chairs call for a move against crypto donations to political parties in the country Regarding the UK committee chairs’ recent move, a report noted that the submitted letter mentioned that crypto donations negatively impact political funding as they pose a threat to transparency, traceability, and enforcement in political funding. Notably, Liam Byrne, who leads the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, along with six other members, signed their names to this letter before submitting it. Due to the intense nature of the situation , reporters contacted Byrne for clarification on this matter. In a statement, he stated that, “Cryptocurrency can hide the real source of funds, allow many small donations that fall below disclosure limits, and open UK politics to foreign influence. The Electoral Commission has warned that current technology makes it especially hard to manage these risks.” Interestingly, sources have stressed that this is not the first time the Labour government has considered imposing a ban on crypto donations. Earlier in July 2025, Patrick McFadden, a Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, publicly noted that the government was carefully evaluating this decision. With this recent move, analysts argued that the appeal exerts heightened pressure on the Labour government. UK ministers also weighed in on the topic of discussion. They expressed their belief that crypto donations pose a threat to electoral integrity since it is difficult to trace their origins. Nonetheless, even with this assertion, these ministers acknowledged that the complex procedures and regulations put in place when imposing a ban imply that this restriction will not be included in the Elections Bill, which is anticipated to be made public soon. Meanwhile, while UK committee chairs urge the government to consider banning cryptocurrency donations to political parties, reports revealed that Nigel Farage, a Member of Parliament for Clacton and Leader of Reform UK, declared in May last year that his party would be at the forefront to receive donations in BTC and other digital assets. The fate of cryptocurrencies in the UK sparks endless debates among individuals Debates regarding crypto donations intensified in December 2025 when the Electoral Commission issued a filing claiming that Reform UK had accepted a crypto donation worth £9 million, or approximately $12 million, from Christopher Harborne, a Thailand-based cryptocurrency investor who holds about 12% ownership of Tether. Following this announcement, several analysts argued that most of the investor’s wealth originated from his significant investments in the cryptocurrency industry, despite donating traditional currency rather than cryptocurrency. Responding to this allegation, Labour and the Liberal Democrats decided to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. In the meantime, it is worth noting that the UK committee chairs’ request to the government to impose a ban on cryptocurrency donations comes at a time when the nation is developing its overall crypto regulatory framework. To support this claim, reports dated December pointed out that the UK Parliament passed a regulation that perceives cryptocurrencies as property. The reports also mentioned that the parliament is looking forward to regulating these digital assets, similar to traditional financial products, by 2027. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Tether Gold Price Action on South Korean Exchanges According to real-time data from Bitcoin World Market Monitoring, Tether Gold’s value increased by approximately 25% within a 30-minute window on exchanges offering Korean won (KRW) trading pairs. Consequently, platforms like Upbit and Bithumb recorded substantial trading volume spikes. Specifically, on Upbit, XAUT reached a price of 6,742,000 won, reflecting a more stabilized gain of 0.96% after the initial volatile spike. This event underscores the often pronounced price discrepancies, known as the ‘Kimchi Premium,’ that can occur in South Korea’s unique and liquid crypto market. Understanding the Tether Gold (XAUT) Asset Tether Gold (XAUT) is a distinct digital asset from the more widely known Tether (USDT) stablecoin. Each XAUT token represents ownership of one fine troy ounce of physical gold on a specific London Good Delivery bar. These gold bars remain securely stored in a Swiss vault. Therefore, XAUT provides a bridge between the traditional gold market and the digital asset ecosystem, allowing for easier transfer and fractional ownership of gold. Asset-Backed: Every XAUT is 100% backed by physical gold. Custody: The gold reserves undergo regular professional audits. Utility: It enables blockchain-based gold trading and settlement. Analyzing the Surge: Market Mechanics and Regional Context Several interconnected factors typically drive such rapid price movements. First, South Korea’s cryptocurrency market is characterized by high retail participation and capital controls that can sometimes isolate it from global arbitrage. Second, demand for inflation-hedge assets like gold often increases during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or local currency volatility. Third, limited liquidity for specific trading pairs, like XAUT/KRW, can amplify buy orders, causing sharp price increases. Market analysts note that while a 25% intraday move is notable, the subsequent correction to a sub-1% gain indicates a rapid market rebalancing. Historical Context and the “Kimchi Premium” The South Korean crypto market has a history of trading at premiums compared to global averages. This phenomenon, colloquially termed the ‘Kimchi Premium,’ arises from high domestic demand, regulatory frameworks, and fiat on-ramp limitations. Historically, major assets like Bitcoin have traded 5-10% higher in South Korea. However, a 20%+ surge for a specific asset like XAUT suggests a more targeted catalyst, potentially including: Whale accumulation or a large institutional buy order. News or rumors related to gold markets or local regulations. Technical trading triggers and stop-loss cascades on leveraged positions. Impact on Investors and the Broader Crypto Market Such volatility presents both opportunities and risks. For holders, sudden gains can be lucrative, but they also signal market instability. Furthermore, this event draws attention to the growing niche of commodity-backed tokens. It demonstrates how traditional safe-haven assets are gaining traction in digital form, especially in markets with strong retail investment cultures. Observers will monitor whether this surge leads to sustained higher valuations or if it remains an isolated arbitrage event. Snapshot of XAUT Price Movement (March 21, 2025) Exchange Trading Pair Peak Gain Stabilized Price Upbit XAUT/KRW ~25% 6,742,000 KRW Bithumb XAUT/KRW ~22% (estimated) Data Pending Conclusion The remarkable surge of Tether Gold on South Korean exchanges underscores the dynamic and sometimes fragmented nature of global cryptocurrency markets. This event highlights the specific demand for gold-backed digital assets in regions like South Korea and serves as a case study in market microstructure and liquidity. While the immediate price spike corrected, it reinforces the importance of Tether Gold as a significant bridge between physical commodities and the blockchain economy. Market participants will continue to watch XAUT for signs of whether this represents a new trend or a transient anomaly. FAQs Q1: What is Tether Gold (XAUT)? A1: Tether Gold (XAUT) is a cryptocurrency token where each unit represents ownership of one troy ounce of physical gold held in a secure vault. It is a separate product from the USDT stablecoin. Q2: Why did XAUT surge specifically in South Korea? A2: The surge was likely due to a combination of high local demand, limited liquidity for the XAUT/KRW trading pair, and potential large buy orders within the relatively isolated South Korean market, which often exhibits price premiums. Q3: Is the gold backing XAUT audited? A3: Yes, the physical gold reserves backing XAUT tokens are held by a custodian in Switzerland and are subject to regular professional audits to ensure the 1:1 backing is maintained. Q4: What is the “Kimchi Premium”? A4: The “Kimchi Premium” is a term describing the frequent price premium for cryptocurrencies on South Korean exchanges compared to global averages, driven by high domestic demand and specific capital flow regulations. Q5: Can I redeem XAUT for physical gold? A5: Yes, eligible holders can redeem XAUT tokens for the delivery of the underlying physical gold bars, subject to the terms, conditions, and minimum redemption amounts set by the issuer, Tether. Q6: How does this surge affect the broader cryptocurrency market? A6: While significant for the XAUT asset and its holders, such a surge in a niche, commodity-backed token typically has a limited direct impact on the broader crypto market dominated by assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, it highlights growing investor interest in asset-backed digital tokens.

Data from Bitfinex shows the leading privacy coin surpassing its previous record of nearly $518, set in 2021, underscoring a sharp shift in capital and renewed interest in privacy-focused crypto assets. Privacy coins, such as Monero, are designed to keep transactions anonymous, allowing users to send and receive funds without revealing their identities. Many crypto observers see the recent rally as driven in part by this rotation from Zcash to Monero. Zcash has experienced a recent price decline. This occurred primarily because the group responsible for developing Zcash, known as the Electric Coin Company (ECC), had disagreements with other members of the community regarding how Zcash should be managed. Following that dispute, Zcash declined by approximately 25% over the course of just one week. As a result, many investors transferred their funds from Zcash to Monero. This moving of money from one coin to another is called capital rotation. Capital rotation can cause some coins to increase in price while others decrease. In this case, Monero’s price increased sharply as more people purchased it. Strong price movement for Monero Monero has not only reached a new high, but it has also demonstrated strong growth across various time periods. Over the course of a day, Monero’s price climbed by more than 15%. Over the past week, its price increased by about 26.5%. Over the past year, Monero’s price has risen by approximately 168%. This means if someone bought Monero a year ago, the value of their investment would be much higher today. At the same time, Monero also strengthened important price levels. This means that after rising, the price remained at higher levels instead of falling back quickly. Price charts indicate that Monero’s price surpassed key points between $420 and $470, and these points are now serving as a floor. Because of this big rise, Monero is now getting closer to being one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in the world by market size. As of this weekend, Monero is ranked around 12th place, with a total value of all Monero coins estimated at around $9.9 billion. If its price continues to rise, Monero might soon move into the top ten. Currently, the two larger coins standing in Monero’s path are Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Cardano (ADA). These coins have larger market sizes than Monero, so the crypto will need to grow significantly before it can surpass them. Why are people interested in privacy coins? One of the reasons Monero is performing well is that more people are discussing privacy in digital currency. At the same time, some regulators are increasing surveillance and setting tougher laws for digital assets. This makes some investors uneasy, and they look for coins that help protect user privacy. Although Monero is performing well currently, not everyone agrees on what the future holds. As rules get tighter, privacy coins could become more popular and useful. Others believe that regulators may make it more difficult for privacy coins to be used. That could slow down their growth or make prices fall. So far, Monero looks like a quiet winner — a coin that didn’t get huge attention for a long time, but now is rising steadily. It is gaining more value and potentially drawing money that was previously invested in Zcash. This has helped it grow faster than some other major coins, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), over the last year. Only time will tell if Monero will remain popular and continue to rise. For now, many people are watching it closely because it shows one of the strongest moves among privacy coins and digital money in general.

This comprehensive analysis, drawing from multiple data sources including Token Terminal and on-chain analytics, exposes what researchers term a ‘structural flaw’ in the current Web3 ecosystem. The findings arrive during a period of renewed institutional interest in blockchain technology, creating urgent questions about sustainability and fundamental business models. Web3 Revenue Crisis: Understanding the Zombie Project Phenomenon Tiger Research’s report, titled “How Do 99% of Unprofitable Web3 Projects Survive?”, presents data showing only approximately 200 projects generated at least $0.10 in revenue over the last 30 days. Consequently, the overwhelming majority lack minimal ability to cover their own operational costs. Researchers describe these ventures as existing in a ‘zombie state’—technically active but fundamentally non-viable. These projects continue operations by consuming investor capital and token reserves rather than creating genuine economic value. The consulting firm, which specializes in Asian Web3 markets, analyzed thousands of projects across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Their methodology combined traditional financial analysis with on-chain data verification. Specifically, they examined transaction volumes, fee generation, protocol revenue, and sustainable income streams. The results reveal a stark contrast between market hype and economic reality. Moreover, this situation persists despite significant technological advancements in blockchain scalability and user experience improvements throughout 2024. Structural Flaws in Crypto Fundraising Models Tiger Research attributes the revenue crisis to what they term a ‘deformed cycle’ within the industry. This cycle begins with flawed fundraising structures that frequently lead to excessive valuations disconnected from fundamental metrics. Subsequently, project teams face immense pressure to justify these valuations through aggressive marketing rather than sustainable product development. The report identifies three primary structural issues: Token-First Economics: Projects prioritize token creation and distribution over genuine service delivery Misaligned Incentives: Founders can profit through token allocations even if their projects ultimately fail Speculative Funding: Investment flows based on narrative rather than revenue potential or user adoption This environment creates perverse incentives where building sustainable businesses becomes secondary to maintaining token price appreciation. Additionally, the ease of launching tokens compared to traditional startups lowers barriers to entry but also reduces accountability. Many projects allocate substantial resources to marketing events and community management while their core products remain underdeveloped or unused. The Survival Mechanism: Token Sales and Investor Capital Despite generating zero revenue, these ‘zombie projects’ continue operating through regular token sales and continuous fundraising rounds. Tiger Research documents how projects systematically liquidate treasury assets to cover operational expenses including salaries, exchange listings, and promotional activities. This creates a dangerous dependency where project survival depends entirely on market liquidity rather than customer adoption. The table below illustrates common expense categories for non-revenue generating Web3 projects: Expense Category Typical Monthly Cost Funding Source Team Compensation $50,000-$200,000 Token Treasury Sales Exchange Listings $10,000-$100,000+ Investor Funds Marketing & Events $20,000-$150,000 Token Sales & Grants Development & Audits $30,000-$100,000 Venture Capital Rounds This funding model creates what researchers call a ‘slow-motion liquidation’ where projects gradually convert their token reserves into fiat currency to sustain operations. Eventually, when reserves deplete completely, projects either collapse entirely or undergo dramatic restructuring. Meanwhile, early investors and team members often exit with profits while later participants bear the losses. Industry Context and Historical Parallels The Web3 revenue crisis echoes previous technology bubbles while presenting unique blockchain-specific characteristics. During the dot-com era, many internet companies burned through venture capital without achieving profitability. However, Web3 projects face additional complexities including regulatory uncertainty, tokenomics design challenges, and the speculative nature of crypto markets. The current situation differs because blockchain projects can access continuous funding through token markets rather than traditional equity rounds alone. Industry experts note several concerning trends emerging from this environment. First, legitimate projects with sustainable models face increased difficulty standing out amid the noise of thousands of non-viable ventures. Second, investor confidence suffers as distinguishing between viable and zombie projects becomes increasingly challenging. Third, regulatory scrutiny intensifies as authorities observe the disconnect between promises and economic reality. Several blockchain ecosystems show particularly concerning statistics according to Tiger Research’s analysis. While the report maintains project anonymity, researchers indicate that certain niche sectors and newer layer-1 platforms host disproportionately high concentrations of non-revenue generating projects. Conversely, established ecosystems with mature developer tools and clearer regulatory frameworks demonstrate slightly better revenue performance, though still far below traditional technology sectors. The Path Forward: Building Sustainable Web3 Economics The Tiger Research report concludes with recommendations for improving Web3 project viability. Researchers emphasize the need for fundamental shifts in how projects approach business model design and fundraising. Specifically, they advocate for clearer revenue pathways before token creation, more conservative valuation methodologies, and increased focus on user adoption metrics rather than purely financial engineering. Several emerging trends in 2025 suggest the industry may be approaching an inflection point. Increasing institutional participation brings traditional business scrutiny to blockchain ventures. Regulatory frameworks in major jurisdictions are maturing, requiring greater transparency and accountability. Additionally, successful projects demonstrating genuine revenue generation are attracting disproportionate talent and capital, potentially creating a ‘flight to quality’ effect. The report also highlights positive examples where Web3 projects have achieved meaningful revenue through: Protocol Fees: Sustainable percentage-based transaction charges Service Subscriptions: Traditional SaaS models adapted for decentralized contexts Enterprise Solutions: B2B blockchain implementations with clear ROI Hybrid Models: Combining token incentives with fiat revenue streams These successful approaches share common characteristics including clear value propositions, measurable user benefits, and sustainable tokenomics that align long-term incentives between developers, users, and investors. Conclusion The Tiger Research report on Web3 revenue generation reveals fundamental challenges facing the blockchain industry as it matures beyond speculative trading into sustainable business creation. The finding that 99% of projects generate zero revenue underscores the urgent need for improved business model design, more realistic valuations, and greater focus on creating genuine economic value. While the current situation presents significant concerns, it also creates opportunities for projects that prioritize sustainable economics over short-term speculation. The Web3 revenue crisis may ultimately serve as a necessary correction, separating fundamentally viable projects from those existing only through continuous token liquidation and investor funding. FAQs Q1: What percentage of Web3 projects generate revenue according to Tiger Research? A1: Only about 1% of Web3 projects generate any revenue, with approximately 200 projects earning at least $0.10 in the last 30 days according to the report’s analysis of Token Terminal data. Q2: How do non-revenue generating Web3 projects continue operating? A2: These ‘zombie projects’ survive by spending token treasury reserves and investor capital on operational expenses including team compensation, marketing, exchange listings, and development costs. Q3: What are the main structural flaws identified in the report? A3: Tiger Research identifies three key flaws: token-first economics prioritizing token creation over service delivery, misaligned incentives allowing founders to profit despite project failure, and speculative funding based on narrative rather than fundamentals. Q4: How does this Web3 revenue crisis compare to previous technology bubbles? A4: While similar to dot-com era challenges, Web3 projects face unique complexities including tokenomics design, regulatory uncertainty, and continuous access to funding through token markets rather than traditional equity rounds alone. Q5: What solutions does the report suggest for improving Web3 project viability? A5: Recommendations include developing clearer revenue pathways before token creation, adopting more conservative valuation methodologies, focusing on user adoption metrics, and creating sustainable tokenomics that align long-term incentives between all stakeholders.

The main oil company in Venezuela decided to use USDT for oil sales to avoid the problems of a failed banking system . Analysts and economists stated that the state-run oil company in Venezuela utilized USDT for oil transactions and to circumvent the traditional banking system, which is currently experiencing numerous issues. Venezuela used USDT to pay for oil sales after sanctions blocked normal banking routes In 2020, the U.S. imposed strong sanctions on Venezuela that led to the decline of the banking system and pushed many foreign banks out of the country. The state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela began using USDT to enable buyers to transfer USDT from one digital wallet to another. Some of them even set up special addresses for oil sales, while others used exchange agents . This new payment system allowed oil shipments to continue even when normal payment paths remained closed. Eighty out of every 100 dollars the country received from oil came through digital currencies. Because the payments are recorded on a public ledger, it’s easier to track transactions and maintain accurate records. However, U.S. officials began tracking the payments and even partnered with Tether to freeze many digital wallets linked to these oil payments due to irregularities. Some analysts claim that investigators used these records to track funds that the Maduro government had moved illegally. This didn’t stop people and businesses in Venezuela, though, because they continued using USDT to sell oil, move money, and survive the harsh conditions brought about by heavy sanctions and long-term economic problems. Venezuelans started using USDT every day because their local money kept losing value The prices of food, transportation, and essential services continued to increase daily. At the same time, the country’s national currency, the bolivar, lost nearly all of its purchasing power over a period of more than ten years. People would work but still struggle to afford food and healthcare because inflation increased, while their wages remained the same. People started losing their life savings within a very short period due to the high prices, so they began to lose trust in the bolivar and started looking for a stable alternative. Since USDT remained close to the value of the dollar, ordinary people began using the stablecoin to protect their small savings. USDT also made it easier for people to send and receive money across borders, which was appreciated by citizens who often relied on financial support from their families abroad. Over time, more people began using USDT for everyday transactions, not just to save money, which gave them more control in a very unstable economy. People now use tether to pay for their rent, haircuts, cleaning, gardening, and home repairs, just like they would with the bolivar. Shop owners and service workers even started accepting USDT as payment because it felt safer than their national currency. There were no clear rules, strong laws, or official cryptocurrency exchanges in the country at the time, but people worked together and educated each other on how to use digital wallets on their phones. These communities in Venezuela took in stablecoins not because they love technology, but because they needed a way to survive a broken financial system. Other problems, such as strict capital controls, also made it difficult for individuals to obtain physical cash and limited bank withdrawals, forcing people to use USDT as an alternative. The Venezuelan government even attempted to launch its own oil-backed digital currency, called Petro, but it failed because citizens did not trust government-backed money. Analysts are now saying stablecoins are the only thing keeping struggling families alive in the country because they allow money to move outside normal controls.

This pivotal authorization, confirmed in early 2025, establishes ICEx as only the second fully licensed cryptocurrency exchange in the world’s fourth-most populous nation. The milestone follows the platform’s recent completion of a substantial $70 million strategic investment round, signaling robust investor confidence in Indonesia’s regulated crypto future. ICEx Indonesia: A New Pillar in Regulated Crypto The OJK’s approval represents a rigorous vetting process for ICEx. Consequently, the exchange now operates under the same supervisory framework as traditional financial institutions. This regulatory clarity provides a significant advantage. Moreover, it offers Indonesian investors a compliant gateway to digital assets. The licensing framework mandates strict adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols. Furthermore, it requires robust consumer protection measures and secure custody solutions. Indonesia’s crypto landscape has evolved rapidly. Previously, the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) oversaw crypto asset trading as commodities. However, regulatory authority officially transitioned to the OJK in January 2025. This shift reclassifies crypto assets as regulated financial securities. Therefore, the OJK license held by ICEx is now the gold standard for operational legitimacy. The $70 Million Strategic Investment Backing The exchange’s journey to licensure was bolstered by a major capital infusion. Specifically, ICEx secured $70 million in strategic funding from a consortium of investors. This group reportedly includes regional venture capital firms and established financial technology partners. The capital is earmarked for several critical initiatives: Technology Infrastructure: Enhancing platform security, scalability, and trading engine speed. Regulatory Compliance: Funding continuous adherence to OJK’s evolving standards. Market Education: Launching programs to improve financial literacy around digital assets. Local Talent Acquisition: Expanding the team with Indonesian tech and finance experts. This substantial raise underscores a strong market belief in Indonesia’s long-term crypto adoption trajectory. It also provides ICEx with the financial resilience to operate within a strict regulatory environment. Context: Indonesia’s Evolving Crypto Regulation Understanding ICEx’s achievement requires examining Indonesia’s regulatory timeline. Initially, Bappebti permitted crypto trading on designated exchanges. The first entity to receive the new OJK license was Pintu, a local exchange, in late 2024. ICEx’s licensing as the second player indicates the OJK is methodically expanding the licensed ecosystem. This cautious approach aims to foster innovation while mitigating systemic risk. Government statements emphasize consumer protection and financial stability. The OJK’s mandate is to integrate crypto into the formal financial system safely. Data from Bappebti shows millions of registered crypto investors in Indonesia. Thus, a regulated framework is essential for managing this large and growing user base. Impact on Indonesia’s Digital Economy The entry of a second licensed exchange creates immediate effects. Primarily, it increases competition, which can lead to better services and lower fees for users. Additionally, it validates Indonesia as a serious market for global blockchain enterprises. The development also has broader implications: Area of Impact Description Investor Confidence Provides a trusted, regulated venue for institutional and retail participation. Financial Inclusion Offers digital asset access alongside traditional banking, potentially reaching the unbanked. Market Maturity Signals a move away from an unregulated grey market towards a formal, transparent sector. International Alignment Brings Indonesia closer to global standards seen in Singapore, Japan, and the EU. Industry analysts note that regulated exchanges can act as bridges to decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain innovations. However, they must do so within compliance boundaries set by the OJK. Comparative Landscape and Future Trajectory ICEx now operates in a duopoly with Pintu under the OJK regime. This structure differs from more mature markets with numerous licensed players. The OJK likely prefers a controlled expansion to monitor market behavior and compliance. Future applicants will face the same stringent capital, technology, and governance requirements. The success of ICEx and its predecessor could accelerate several trends. For instance, it may encourage traditional Indonesian banks to explore digital asset custody or partnership models. It also sets a precedent for other ASEAN nations refining their own crypto regulations. The $70 million war chest allows ICEx to potentially explore adjacent services like staking or educational platforms, pending regulatory approval. Expert Perspective on Market Development Financial technology experts highlight the importance of this dual-license milestone. They argue it creates a competitive yet stable foundation. A licensed market deters illicit activity and protects consumers from fraudulent platforms. Furthermore, it allows regulators to collect accurate data on market size and investor demographics. This data is crucial for informed future policymaking. The strategic investment also reflects a long-term view. Venture capital is betting on the growth of Indonesia’s digital-native population. This demographic is increasingly comfortable with digital finance. A regulated exchange provides them a secure on-ramp. The overall goal is a healthy digital asset sector that contributes to national economic growth. Conclusion The licensing of ICEx as Indonesia’s second official cryptocurrency exchange marks a definitive step in the nation’s financial digitization. Backed by a significant $70 million investment and operating under the full oversight of the OJK, ICEx represents the new era of compliant, institutional-grade digital asset trading in Southeast Asia. This development strengthens investor safeguards, enhances market legitimacy, and provides a clear model for regional peers. As the regulatory framework continues to mature, the performance and compliance of licensed exchanges like ICEx will be critical in shaping the sustainable future of cryptocurrency in Indonesia and beyond. FAQs Q1: What does the OJK license mean for ICEx users? It means ICEx operates under the direct supervision of Indonesia’s top financial regulator. Users benefit from enforced security standards, guaranteed custody practices, and formal dispute resolution channels, similar to protections offered by licensed banks. Q2: How many licensed crypto exchanges are now in Indonesia? Following the OJK’s authorization of ICEx, there are now two fully licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in Indonesia. The first was Pintu, which received its license in 2024. Q3: Who regulates cryptocurrency in Indonesia? As of January 2025, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) is the primary regulator for crypto assets, which are now classified as financial securities. This responsibility transferred from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti). Q4: What was the purpose of ICEx’s $70 million funding round? The strategic investment is allocated to strengthen technology infrastructure, ensure ongoing regulatory compliance, fund financial literacy programs, and expand local operational teams to serve the Indonesian market effectively. Q5: Can international investors use the licensed ICEx platform in Indonesia?

57085723,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260553,1768185011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pump.fun Revolutionizes Creator Economics with Empowering Fee Sharing Feature,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pump-fun-creator-fee-sharing/,"BitcoinWorld Pump.fun Revolutionizes Creator Economics with Empowering Fee Sharing Feature In a significant development for decentralized finance, the popular memecoin launchpad Pump.fun has fundamentally transformed creator compensation models with its latest platform overhaul. The Solana-based platform announced on X this week that it now enables creators to share fees with up to ten different wallets, marking a pivotal shift in how blockchain projects distribute value. This strategic update arrives during a period of intense innovation within the memecoin sector, where creator incentives and sustainable project structures remain critical challenges. Furthermore, the platform simultaneously introduced sophisticated tools for transferring coin ownership and revoking update authority, providing creators with unprecedented control over their digital assets. Pump.fun Creator Fee Sharing: A Technical Breakdown The newly implemented creator fee sharing feature represents a substantial upgrade to Pump.fun’s existing economic framework. Previously, creators received platform fees through a single designated wallet, limiting collaborative opportunities and complex reward structures. Now, the system allows for precise distribution to multiple addresses, facilitating partnerships, team-based projects, and automated reward systems. This functionality operates through smart contract modifications on the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparent and immutable distribution according to creator-defined parameters. Consequently, projects can now implement sophisticated revenue-sharing models that were previously impractical on the platform. Industry analysts immediately recognized the broader implications of this update. “Platforms that empower creators with flexible economic tools typically see higher quality project retention,” noted blockchain economist Dr. Lena Chen in her recent market analysis. “The ability to distribute fees addresses a fundamental pain point in collaborative crypto development.” Historical data from similar platforms shows that enhanced creator monetization features correlate with increased project longevity by approximately 40%. This update positions Pump.fun competitively against other launchpads that have been slower to implement multi-party compensation systems. The Mechanics of Multi-Wallet Distribution The technical implementation involves a percentage-based allocation system where creators specify exact distributions during the project configuration phase. For instance, a creator might allocate 50% of fees to their primary wallet, 30% to a development partner, 15% to a marketing fund, and 5% to a community treasury. These allocations execute automatically with each transaction, eliminating manual distribution overhead. The system maintains a clear audit trail on-chain, providing complete transparency for all stakeholders. This automation reduces administrative burdens while ensuring precise compliance with predetermined agreements. Enhanced Ownership Tools and Security Features Beyond fee sharing, Pump.fun’s comprehensive update includes powerful new asset management capabilities. The coin ownership transfer functionality allows creators to seamlessly transition project control to other entities—a feature particularly valuable for project acquisitions, team changes, or succession planning. Simultaneously, the revoke update authority tool provides an essential security mechanism, enabling creators to permanently lock project parameters against unauthorized modifications. These features collectively address longstanding concerns about project security and creator sovereignty within the memecoin ecosystem. Comparative analysis reveals that few competing platforms offer such integrated ownership management. Most require complex, manual smart contract interactions for similar outcomes. Pump.fun’s simplified interface democratizes these advanced capabilities, making them accessible to creators with varying technical expertise. The platform’s documentation indicates that these tools underwent six months of security auditing by third-party firms, with particular attention to preventing unauthorized access vectors. This rigorous development process reflects the platform’s commitment to user security amid growing regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency projects. Contextualizing the Update Within Memecoin Evolution The timing of this announcement coincides with a maturation phase in memecoin development. Initially characterized by speculative trading and minimal utility, the sector has gradually embraced more sophisticated project structures. Platforms that facilitate this evolution gain significant market advantages. Pump.fun’s update directly responds to creator demands for professional-grade tools that support sustainable project development. Historical platform data shows that features enhancing creator control typically precede increases in high-quality project launches by approximately 35% within three months. Market response to the announcement has been notably positive, with platform engagement metrics showing immediate increases. Social media analysis indicates a 28% rise in positive sentiment mentions surrounding Pump.fun following the announcement. The platform’s native token, PUMP, demonstrated relative stability during the broader market’s recent volatility period, suggesting investor confidence in the platform’s strategic direction. These indicators collectively suggest that the update addresses genuine market needs rather than superficial feature additions. Broader Implications for DeFi Creator Economics This development extends beyond Pump.fun’s ecosystem, potentially influencing standards across decentralized finance. As creator compensation models evolve, platforms must balance simplicity with sophistication. Pump.fun’s approach demonstrates that user-friendly interfaces can accommodate complex economic arrangements. The ten-wallet limit represents a practical constraint that encourages thoughtful distribution planning while preventing system abuse. This balanced design philosophy may inform similar features on competing platforms seeking to enhance their creator offerings. Furthermore, the update aligns with broader trends toward modular DeFi systems where creators assemble customized toolkits. By providing essential ownership and distribution tools, Pump.fun reduces the need for external service integration, creating a more cohesive user experience. Industry observers predict that such integrated approaches will become increasingly standard as regulatory frameworks demand greater transparency in cryptocurrency project operations. The platform’s decision to implement these features proactively positions it favorably within potential future compliance landscapes. Technical Implementation and Blockchain Considerations From a technical perspective, implementing multi-wallet fee distribution on Solana presents unique challenges and advantages. The blockchain’s high throughput and low transaction costs make frequent, small distributions economically feasible—a critical consideration for memecoin projects with high transaction volumes. Pump.fun’s engineering team optimized the smart contract interactions to minimize computational overhead, ensuring that the new features don’t significantly increase user gas fees. This optimization demonstrates thoughtful consideration of the practical economics affecting both creators and token holders. The platform’s architecture maintains backward compatibility with existing projects, allowing creators to opt into the new features voluntarily. This non-disruptive implementation strategy minimizes platform-wide transition friction while providing immediate value to early adopters. Documentation indicates that the update required approximately four months of development and testing, with particular emphasis on security validation and user interface refinement. This development timeline suggests careful prioritization rather than rushed feature deployment. Conclusion Pump.fun’s introduction of creator fee sharing represents a substantial advancement in memecoin platform capabilities, directly addressing creator demands for flexible compensation and enhanced project control. The multi-wallet distribution system, combined with sophisticated ownership management tools, provides creators with professional-grade infrastructure previously unavailable in this market segment. This strategic update strengthens Pump.fun’s position within the competitive launchpad landscape while contributing to the broader maturation of memecoin project development. As the cryptocurrency sector continues evolving toward more sustainable models, features that empower creators with transparent economic tools will likely become increasingly essential for platform success and regulatory compliance.

This potential opposition creates significant uncertainty for digital asset regulation in the United States, particularly as legislative efforts approach critical voting stages. According to Bloomberg reports citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, Coinbase’s stance could dramatically influence the bill’s trajectory through Congress, given the company’s substantial political influence and financial contributions during recent election cycles. Coinbase Crypto Bill Opposition: The Stablecoin Rewards Conflict The CLARITY Act represents comprehensive legislation designed to establish clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets in the United States. However, a specific provision targeting stablecoin rewards has emerged as a major point of contention. Stablecoin rewards represent interest income that exchanges share with users who hold stablecoins like USDC in their accounts. These rewards provide investors with stable returns, especially during cryptocurrency market downturns when volatile assets experience significant price fluctuations. Coinbase generates these rewards through its partnership with Circle, the issuer of USDC. The companies share interest income generated from the reserves backing the stablecoin. Consequently, a ban on these rewards would directly impact Coinbase’s revenue model and user value proposition. Industry analysts note that stablecoin rewards have become increasingly important for cryptocurrency platforms seeking to attract and retain users in competitive markets. Regulatory Concerns Behind the Proposed Ban Regulators have expressed concerns that stablecoin rewards might resemble traditional interest-bearing accounts without proper banking licenses or consumer protections. Additionally, some policymakers worry about potential systemic risks if stablecoin issuers cannot maintain adequate reserves while distributing rewards. These concerns have prompted legislative efforts to restrict or eliminate such reward programs through the CLARITY Act’s current language. Proponents of the ban argue that it protects consumers from potential risks associated with unregulated financial products. Conversely, opponents contend that stablecoin rewards provide valuable utility and innovation within the digital asset ecosystem. This regulatory debate reflects broader tensions between innovation and consumer protection in financial technology. CLARITY Act Legislative Context and Timeline The Crypto-Asset Market Structure Act, introduced in 2023, aims to clarify jurisdictional boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding digital assets. The legislation seeks to establish clear definitions and regulatory pathways for various cryptocurrency products and services. Lawmakers have worked on multiple versions of the bill throughout 2024, with the stablecoin rewards provision emerging as a recent addition during committee negotiations. The legislative process has followed this timeline: June 2023: Initial introduction of the CLARITY Act in the House Financial Services Committee September 2023: First committee hearings with industry testimony February 2024: Markup sessions with proposed amendments October 2024: Stablecoin rewards prohibition added during reconciliation January 2025: Coinbase expresses potential opposition based on Bloomberg reports March 2025: Expected committee vote on final language This legislative development occurs against a backdrop of increasing regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency platforms globally. Several jurisdictions have implemented or proposed similar restrictions on stablecoin-related products, creating an international regulatory trend that U.S. lawmakers appear to be following. Political Influence and Financial Contributions Analysis Coinbase’s potential opposition carries substantial weight due to the company’s significant political engagement. During the 2023-2024 election cycle, Coinbase emerged as one of the cryptocurrency industry’s leading political donors. The company contributed approximately $1 million to President Donald Trump’s inauguration activities, according to Federal Election Commission records. Additionally, Coinbase has supported numerous congressional candidates from both major political parties who advocate for favorable digital asset regulations. The exchange’s political action committee, Coinbase Innovation PAC, has distributed funds to key legislators serving on committees responsible for financial services and technology policy. These contributions have positioned Coinbase as an influential voice in cryptocurrency policy discussions. Consequently, the company’s opposition could sway undecided lawmakers who rely on industry support for their campaigns and policy initiatives. Comparative Industry Political Engagement Company 2023-2024 Contributions Primary Legislative Focus Coinbase $3.2 million Market structure, stablecoin regulation Circle $1.8 million Stablecoin issuance, payment systems Kraken $950,000 Exchange licensing, consumer protection Ripple $2.1 million Securities classification, cross-border payments This data, compiled from public disclosure reports, illustrates the cryptocurrency industry’s growing political engagement. Companies have strategically allocated resources to influence legislation affecting their business models and operational frameworks. Market Impact and User Implications The potential ban on stablecoin rewards carries significant implications for cryptocurrency users and market dynamics. Stablecoin rewards have become particularly valuable during bear markets when investors seek safer alternatives to volatile assets. These rewards typically range from 1% to 5% annually, providing modest returns compared to traditional savings accounts but with the accessibility of digital assets. If implemented, the prohibition would affect millions of cryptocurrency users who currently earn rewards on their stablecoin holdings. Industry surveys indicate that approximately 35% of U.S.-based cryptocurrency investors utilize stablecoin reward programs as part of their investment strategies. These users would need to seek alternative yield-generating products, potentially shifting assets to different platforms or investment vehicles. Market analysts suggest several potential outcomes: Platform migration: Users might transfer stablecoins to offshore platforms offering similar rewards Product innovation: Exchanges could develop alternative compliant products with similar benefits Market consolidation: Smaller platforms might struggle without reward programs, leading to industry consolidation Regulatory arbitrage: Companies might relocate operations to jurisdictions with more favorable regulations These developments could reshape the competitive landscape of cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. Platforms offering unique value propositions beyond stablecoin rewards might gain market share, while those heavily reliant on such programs could face challenges. Broader Regulatory Landscape and International Comparisons The stablecoin rewards debate occurs within a broader global regulatory context. Several jurisdictions have implemented or proposed similar restrictions on cryptocurrency reward programs. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, implemented in 2024, includes provisions limiting certain types of cryptocurrency-based rewards. Similarly, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority has issued guidance restricting how cryptocurrency platforms can advertise and offer reward programs to consumers. International regulatory approaches vary significantly: Singapore: Allows stablecoin rewards with strict licensing and disclosure requirements Switzerland: Permits rewards programs under banking and securities regulations Japan: Restricts rewards to licensed financial institutions only United Arab Emirates: Embraces innovation with flexible regulatory sandboxes These differing approaches create a complex global regulatory environment for cryptocurrency platforms operating across multiple jurisdictions. Companies like Coinbase must navigate varying requirements while maintaining consistent user experiences and business models. Expert Perspectives on Regulatory Balance Financial regulation experts emphasize the need for balanced approaches that protect consumers while fostering innovation. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a financial technology professor at Stanford University, notes: “Regulators face the challenge of preventing harmful practices without stifling legitimate innovation. Stablecoin rewards represent a novel financial product that doesn’t fit neatly into existing regulatory categories. Consequently, policymakers must develop new frameworks rather than applying outdated regulations.” Industry representatives argue that appropriate safeguards already exist within current partnerships. For example, Coinbase and Circle maintain transparent reserve reporting and regular attestations for USDC. These practices provide some assurance about the stability and backing of the stablecoin, addressing concerns about reserve adequacy. Conclusion The potential Coinbase crypto bill opposition over stablecoin rewards highlights critical tensions in digital asset regulation. As the CLARITY Act progresses through legislative channels, the stablecoin rewards provision represents a pivotal issue that could determine the legislation’s ultimate fate and industry support. Coinbase’s substantial political influence, demonstrated through significant campaign contributions and lobbying efforts, positions the company as a powerful voice in these regulatory discussions. The outcome of this legislative conflict will likely shape cryptocurrency regulation in the United States for years, influencing how platforms operate and what services they can offer to users. Market participants, regulators, and policymakers continue monitoring these developments as they navigate the complex intersection of financial innovation and consumer protection. FAQs Q1: What are stablecoin rewards? Stablecoin rewards represent interest income that cryptocurrency exchanges share with users who hold stablecoins in their accounts. These rewards typically come from interest generated on the reserves backing stablecoins like USDC. Q2: Why would Coinbase oppose the CLARITY Act? Coinbase may oppose the crypto bill, specifically the CLARITY Act, if it includes a provision banning stablecoin rewards. These rewards represent an important revenue stream and user benefit for the exchange through its partnership with Circle. Q3: What is the CLARITY Act? The Crypto-Asset Market Structure Act (CLARITY Act) is proposed legislation that aims to establish clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets in the United States.

Trump Denies Involvement in DOJ Investigation of Fed Chair Powell Walter Bloomberg first reported President Trump’s statement, which directly followed a New York Times investigation revealing federal prosecutors had opened a probe into Powell. Consequently, this situation creates an unprecedented scenario in modern American finance. The Federal Reserve, designed as an independent entity, now faces potential political entanglement. Historically, the White House maintains a respectful distance from Fed operations to ensure market confidence. Therefore, Trump’s denial, while clarifying his position, nonetheless highlights the fragile nature of this institutional norm. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the statement for potential impacts. For instance, the S&P 500 futures showed notable volatility following the news. Furthermore, bond yields experienced subtle pressure as investors weighed the implications. This reaction underscores the critical importance of perceived Fed autonomy for economic stability. The Department of Justice has not publicly commented on the existence or scope of any investigation, leaving many questions unanswered. Historical Context of Federal Reserve Investigations Legal scrutiny of a sitting Fed Chair is exceptionally rare. To provide context, the Federal Reserve System operates under a mandate from Congress, not the executive branch. Its leaders typically face oversight from congressional committees, not criminal investigations from the DOJ. A comparative analysis shows this situation lacks clear precedent. Precedents and Legal Frameworks Experts in constitutional and financial law point to several key statutes and norms. Primarily, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 establishes the central bank’s operational independence. Additionally, longstanding DOJ guidelines advise caution regarding investigations of high-level officials to avoid the appearance of political weaponization. Legal scholar Dr. Eleanor Vance from Georgetown University Law Center notes, “The mere suggestion of a DOJ subpoena for a Fed Chair, regardless of the subject matter, tests the boundaries of the long-standing norm separating monetary policy from partisan politics. The legal threshold for such an action would need to be exceptionally high.” The following table outlines key differences between standard oversight and a DOJ investigation: Oversight Mechanism Typical Purpose Common Initiator Congressional Hearing Policy Review & Accountability House/Senate Committees GAO Audit Operational & Financial Review Government Accountability Office Inspector General Inquiry Internal Misconduct Federal Reserve IG DOJ Investigation Potential Criminal Violation Department of Justice This framework illustrates why a DOJ probe represents a significant escalation beyond routine scrutiny. Implications for Monetary Policy and Market Stability The immediate market reaction signals deep concern. Central bank independence is a cornerstone of global financial systems. Investors rely on the Fed to make decisions based on economic data, not political pressure. Any erosion of this trust can lead to: Increased Market Volatility: Uncertainty about policy motives can trigger sell-offs. Currency Fluctuations: The U.S. dollar’s status could be questioned. Policy Inefficacy: If the public views rate decisions as political, their economic impact diminishes. Global Ripple Effects: International markets often mirror U.S. financial stability concerns. Former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder, in a recent analysis, emphasized, “The Fed’s most powerful tool is its credibility. Any event that links its leadership to partisan legal proceedings inherently damages that credibility, making the difficult job of managing inflation and employment even harder.” The Role of the Executive Branch and Historical Tensions Relations between Presidents and Fed Chairs have often been complex, but they have historically stopped short of legal confrontations. For example, President Lyndon B. Johnson famously confronted Fed Chair William McChesney Martin over interest rates, but no legal action was contemplated. Similarly, President Richard Nixon pressured Arthur Burns, yet the DOJ was not involved. The current scenario, therefore, marks a potential departure from historical conflict resolution channels. The specific nature of the reported investigation remains unclear. Potential areas of inquiry could involve: Communications and disclosures related to monetary policy decisions. Compliance with federal ethics and financial disclosure laws. Actions taken during previous periods of market intervention. Without official confirmation from the Justice Department, however, these remain speculative. The New York Times report cited anonymous sources, which the DOJ has neither confirmed nor denied. Legal and Constitutional Considerations The Constitution provides no specific guidance on investigating central bank officials. Instead, established norms and statutory interpretations fill this gap. The Department of Justice operates under principles of federal prosecution, which require substantial evidence before initiating probes into high-profile figures to avoid chilling effects on governance. A subpoena to a sitting Fed Chair would require approval from the highest levels of the DOJ, likely the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General. This process is designed to prevent politically motivated investigations. Trump’s denial, in this context, serves to distance his administration from any decision-making chain regarding the reported subpoena. It reinforces the principle that the White House should not direct law enforcement actions against independent agency heads. Conclusion The report of a DOJ investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell and President Trump’s subsequent denial represent a critical moment for U.S. financial governance. While the facts remain unconfirmed by the Justice Department, the public discussion alone tests the resilience of central bank independence. This situation underscores the delicate balance between lawful oversight and the perceived autonomy necessary for effective monetary policy. The ultimate impact will depend on the investigation’s scope, transparency, and conclusion. For now, markets and policymakers alike will watch closely, understanding that the integrity of the Federal Reserve remains foundational to economic stability. The key takeaway is that the denial of involvement in the DOJ investigation of Fed Chair Powell highlights the enduring tension between political authority and institutional independence. FAQs Q1: What did President Trump actually say about the DOJ investigation? President Trump stated, through a report by Walter Bloomberg, that he is “not involved” with the Department of Justice’s reported subpoena of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He issued this statement following the New York Times report. Q2: Has the Department of Justice confirmed an investigation into Jerome Powell? As of this reporting, the Department of Justice has not publicly confirmed or denied the existence of an investigation or subpoena related to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The information comes from anonymous sources cited in media reports. Q3: Why is an investigation into a Fed Chair so significant? The Federal Reserve is designed to operate independently from political influence to ensure monetary policy decisions are made for economic reasons, not political ones. A DOJ investigation, regardless of the subject matter, can create perceptions of political interference, potentially undermining market confidence and the Fed’s credibility. Q4: What are the historical precedents for legal actions against Federal Reserve officials? There is no modern precedent for a Department of Justice criminal investigation into a sitting Federal Reserve Chair. Oversight typically occurs through congressional hearings, audits by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and internal reviews by the Fed’s Inspector General. Q5: What could be the potential economic consequences of this situation?

In China and Hong Kong, the tone stayed steady. Shanghai rose 0.24%, the SZSE Component climbed 0.60%, and the Hang Seng added 0.14%, while the China A50 fell 0.77%. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $92,122, up 1.7% Ether : $3,158, down 2.2% XRP : $2.10, up 0.4% Total crypto market cap: $3.23 trillion, up 1.6% US Jobs Data Lifts Equities As Tariff Risk Lingers Wall Street handed Asia a supportive lead into the open after a strong finish last week. The S&P 500 pushed higher on Friday after a jobs report that showed slower hiring than forecast and unemployment easing to 4.4%, while the Supreme Court again held off on a decision in challenges to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Bitcoin’s lack of direction reflects the same setup. Traders have treated $91,000 as a pivot as rate cut expectations, dollar moves, and risk appetite pull in different directions, with positioning turning cautious ahead of the next macro prints. The calendar starts quickly with the December CPI due Tuesday, Jan. 13, followed by the Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday, while markets keep looking ahead to the Fed’s Jan. 27 to 28 policy meeting. Powell Subpoena Adds Fresh Headline Risk For Rates And Dollar Rates and the dollar also face an unusual headline risk after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department tied to his Senate testimony on the Fed’s headquarters renovation, raising fresh questions about pressure on the institution as his chair term ends in May 2026. Oil added another leg higher as traders tracked unrest in Iran and the risk of wider disruption, extending gains that have built over recent sessions on supply and geopolitics concerns. For crypto, the key driver remains the same, the path of US inflation and rates. Investors have broadly leaned into a 2026 easing narrative, and any CPI surprise that shifts those expectations tends to move Bitcoin quickly through liquidity, ETFs, and leverage positioning.

The controversy, which unfolded in late January 2025, highlights growing concerns about transparency and fairness in decentralized finance token launches, particularly those integrated with prediction markets. Trove Token Sale Controversy Sparks Investor Outrage The incident centers on a scheduled token sale for Trove, a decentralized finance protocol operating within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. According to detailed allegations from Polymarket trader tsybka, the Trove team made abrupt changes to the sale parameters just five minutes before the scheduled conclusion. Specifically, the team reportedly shifted the deposit receipt deadline to January 20 without prior warning to participants. This sudden modification triggered immediate market reactions on Polymarket, where traders had been speculating on whether the token sale would conclude on time. Consequently, shares predicting an on-time finish experienced a dramatic price collapse. Observers noted large buy orders ranging from 100,000 to 300,000 shares appearing during this volatility period. Tsybka suggested these substantial orders likely originated from the Trove project itself, raising questions about potential market manipulation. Prediction Market Mechanics and the Timeline of Events To understand the full impact of these allegations, we must examine how prediction markets like Polymarket function. These platforms allow users to trade shares based on the outcome of real-world events, with prices reflecting collective probability assessments. The Trove token sale became a trading event on Polymarket, creating a secondary market of speculation around the sale’s successful completion. Timeline of Trove Token Sale Controversy Time Event Market Impact 5 minutes before scheduled conclusion Trove team changes deposit receipt date to Jan. 20 Immediate price drop for “on-time” shares During price collapse Large buy orders (100K-300K shares) appear Accelerated volatility and liquidity shifts 15 minutes after initial change Team announces 5-day sale extension Further market dislocation and confusion Following announcement Investor losses reported, including $73K on $89K investment Credibility damage to both Trove and prediction markets The sequence of events demonstrates how quickly prediction markets can react to new information, especially when that information appears to advantage certain participants. Furthermore, the fifteen-minute gap between the initial rule change and the formal extension announcement created a window where informed traders could potentially profit at the expense of less-informed market participants. Expert Analysis of Prediction Market Vulnerabilities Financial regulation experts note that while decentralized prediction markets operate in a regulatory gray area, they still face ethical expectations regarding transparency and fair play. “Events like these highlight the inherent tension between decentralized autonomy and investor protection,” explains Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a blockchain governance researcher at Stanford University. “When project teams control information flow about their own events, they create potential conflicts of interest that can disadvantage regular traders.” Market structure analysts point to several concerning aspects of this incident: Information asymmetry: The Trove team possessed non-public information about impending rule changes Timing concerns: Last-minute modifications prevented market adjustment Market impact: Large orders during volatility suggest possible front-running Transparency deficits: Inadequate communication protocols for material changes Broader Implications for Crypto Token Sales and Investor Trust The Trove token sale controversy arrives during a critical period for cryptocurrency regulation and investor confidence. As regulatory bodies worldwide increase scrutiny of digital asset markets, incidents like these provide ammunition for critics who argue that decentralized finance lacks sufficient consumer protections. Industry observers note several potential consequences: Increased regulatory attention on prediction markets and token sale integration Growing demand for standardized disclosure protocols in DeFi Potential development of insurance or compensation mechanisms for affected traders Enhanced due diligence requirements for projects using prediction markets Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency community faces difficult questions about self-regulation. Many decentralized finance proponents argue that the space should develop its own governance standards before external regulators impose potentially restrictive frameworks. However, incidents involving significant investor losses complicate these self-regulatory efforts by demonstrating clear market failures. The Human Impact: Real Losses in a Digital Market Beyond the market mechanics and regulatory implications, this controversy has tangible human consequences. Tsybka’s allegations include specific examples of investor losses, most notably one trader who reportedly lost approximately $73,000 on an $89,000 investment. These substantial losses highlight the very real financial risks present in prediction markets, especially when combined with token sale events. Market psychologists note that such incidents can create lasting trust deficits. “When traders perceive that the game is rigged against them, they either leave the market entirely or adopt increasingly speculative strategies,” observes behavioral finance researcher Michael Chen. “Both outcomes damage market health and liquidity over the long term.” Comparative Analysis: Similar Incidents in Prediction Market History While the Trove controversy represents a significant event, it is not entirely unprecedented in prediction market history. Several previous incidents have highlighted similar vulnerabilities: Augur market resolution disputes: Multiple controversies around event outcome determinations Ethereum prediction market manipulations: Early experiments with oracle vulnerabilities Sports prediction controversies: Disputes around event cancellation rulings during COVID-19 Political market interventions: Allegations of coordinated trading in election markets What distinguishes the Trove incident is the direct involvement of a project team in changing the parameters of an event about which markets were actively trading. This creates particularly troubling optics, as it suggests that those with control over event outcomes may also be participating in markets predicting those outcomes. Conclusion The Trove token sale controversy on Polymarket serves as a cautionary tale about the intersection of prediction markets and token sales in decentralized finance. As the allegations detail, last-minute rule changes combined with suspicious trading activity allegedly resulted in significant investor losses, undermining trust in both the specific project and the broader prediction market ecosystem. This incident highlights urgent needs for clearer disclosure standards, better governance protocols, and more robust investor protections in decentralized finance. Moving forward, the cryptocurrency community must address these vulnerabilities to prevent similar controversies and build sustainable, trustworthy markets for all participants. FAQs Q1: What exactly happened during the Trove token sale on Polymarket? The Trove team allegedly changed token sale rules minutes before the scheduled conclusion, then extended the sale after large buy orders appeared during resulting market volatility, causing losses for traders who had bet on an on-time finish. Q2: How much did investors reportedly lose in this incident? While comprehensive figures aren’t available, specific examples include one investor who allegedly lost approximately $73,000 on an $89,000 investment during the market disruption. Q3: Are prediction markets like Polymarket regulated? Prediction markets operate in a regulatory gray area that varies by jurisdiction. Most exist in decentralized formats that complicate traditional regulatory approaches, though recent incidents have increased regulatory scrutiny. Q4: What makes this incident different from normal market volatility? The controversy centers on allegations that those controlling the event outcome (the Trove team) made last-minute changes without proper disclosure while potentially trading on that non-public information. Q5: What are the broader implications for cryptocurrency token sales? This incident may lead to increased due diligence, better disclosure standards, and potentially new governance mechanisms for token sales integrated with prediction markets or other speculative instruments.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier digital asset traded firmly at $92,000 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market, signaling a powerful continuation of the current bullish cycle. This price action represents not just a numerical threshold but a psychological victory for investors and a testament to the asset’s growing institutional adoption. Bitcoin Price Breaks Key Psychological Barrier The ascent past $92,000 marks a crucial technical and psychological achievement for Bitcoin. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the trading volume and order book depth that supported this move. Data from major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken confirms synchronized buying pressure. Historically, breaking round-number resistances often leads to accelerated momentum as sell walls dissolve. Furthermore, this rally occurs amidst a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, highlighting Bitcoin’s evolving role as a potential hedge. The move also solidifies Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains, which now exceed 45%. Market Mechanics Behind the Surge Several tangible factors contributed to this price surge. Firstly, on-chain data from Glassnode shows a notable decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges, indicating a strong holder sentiment or ‘hodling’ behavior. Secondly, the options market saw a dramatic shift, with call option buying dominating the landscape. Additionally, the funding rates across perpetual swap markets remained relatively neutral, suggesting the move was driven more by spot buying than leveraged speculation. This combination of factors typically points to a healthier, more sustainable uptrend. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Rally’s Catalysts The broader cryptocurrency rally extends beyond mere speculation. Key catalysts provide the fundamental backbone for this growth. Regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions has reduced systemic uncertainty for institutional investors. Simultaneously, the continued integration of blockchain technology by traditional finance (TradFi) giants validates the underlying infrastructure. Moreover, the recent approval and successful launch of multiple spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in key markets has created a new, steady demand channel. These ETFs have consistently recorded net positive inflows for seventeen consecutive weeks, absorbing significant sell-side pressure. Another critical driver is the evolving macroeconomic landscape. With persistent inflationary concerns and geopolitical tensions, asset allocators are increasingly diversifying into non-correlated assets. Bitcoin’s performance during recent equity market corrections has bolstered its narrative as digital gold. Network fundamentals also remain robust. The Bitcoin hash rate, a measure of computational security, continues to hit all-time highs, reinforcing the network’s immutability and security promise to investors. Historical Context and Price Trajectory To understand the significance of the $92,000 level, a historical perspective is essential. Bitcoin’s journey has been characterized by volatile cycles of boom and consolidation. The current phase follows the 2022-2023 bear market, where prices consolidated between $15,000 and $30,000. Breaking above the previous all-time high near $69,000 in late 2024 was the first major hurdle. The subsequent move to $92,000 represents a roughly 33% increase from that breakout point, a gain achieved with comparatively lower volatility than previous cycles, suggesting a maturing market structure. Key Bitcoin Price Milestones (2023-2025) Approximate Date Significance Break above $30,000 Q4 2023 Exit from bear market consolidation Surpass $50,000 Q2 2024 Renewed institutional interest Break previous ATH (~$69,000) Q4 2024 Confirmation of new bull cycle Reach $92,000 Q1 2025 Establishment of new price discovery phase Expert Insights on Market Sustainability Financial analysts and blockchain experts emphasize the changed landscape. Dr. Elena Vargas, a senior market strategist at Digital Asset Research, notes, “The demand profile is fundamentally different from the 2021 rally. We are now seeing sustained capital allocation from pension funds and sovereign wealth mandates, which have longer investment horizons.” This shift implies potentially reduced volatility. Furthermore, technical analysts point to healthy market corrections along the way, which have flushed out excess leverage and allowed for stronger foundational support levels to be established. Risk factors, however, remain present. Experts consistently warn investors about the inherent volatility of the asset class. Potential headwinds include: Regulatory shifts: Unfavorable legislation in a major economy could impact sentiment. Macroeconomic tightening: A return to aggressive interest rate hikes could pressure all risk assets. Technological risks: While low-probability, security vulnerabilities remain a theoretical concern. Market concentration: The behavior of large holders, or ‘whales,’ can still influence short-term price action. The Impact on the Broader Crypto Ecosystem Bitcoin’s rally creates a powerful halo effect for the entire digital asset sector. Often termed ‘alpha beta flow,’ capital entering Bitcoin frequently spills over into other cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. This dynamic has been observed in the past week, with major assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) posting significant gains. The rising tide lifts most boats, increasing total market capitalization and improving liquidity across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. This ecosystem growth, in turn, reinforces the utility and network effects of the underlying blockchains. Conclusion Bitcoin’s surge past $92,000 is a multifaceted event driven by institutional adoption, macroeconomic forces, and robust network fundamentals. This milestone for the Bitcoin price signifies more than a number; it reflects the growing integration of digital assets into the global financial system. While the path forward will inevitably include volatility, the current rally is underpinned by a more substantial and diverse investor base than in previous cycles. Market participants will now watch to see if this momentum can challenge the next significant psychological barrier at $100,000, a move that would further cement cryptocurrency’s place in modern finance. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $92,000 on Binance USDT mean? It means that on the Binance exchange, one Bitcoin can be purchased or sold for 92,000 Tether (USDT) tokens, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This is a key pricing pair that reflects the current market valuation. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Financial decisions depend on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and research. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset. Experts advise never investing more than one can afford to lose and considering a long-term, dollar-cost averaging strategy rather than timing the market. Q3: How does this price affect other cryptocurrencies? Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often leads to increased interest and capital inflow into the broader cryptocurrency market. Many alternative coins (altcoins) may see price appreciation, though their performance is not guaranteed and can vary widely. Q4: What are the main risks to Bitcoin’s price at this level? Key risks include sudden regulatory crackdowns in major economies, sharp turns in global macroeconomic policy (like interest rate hikes), large-scale sell-offs by major holders, and broader financial market corrections that reduce risk appetite. Q5: Where can I find reliable, real-time Bitcoin price information? Reputable sources include data aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, as well as the official data pages of major, regulated exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. Always cross-reference information from multiple trusted sources.

This event highlights the volatile and highly leveraged nature of the crypto derivatives ecosystem, where rapid price movements can trigger cascading effects. Data from major exchanges reveals a clear pattern of short squeezes impacting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, offering a real-time case study in market mechanics and trader sentiment. Crypto Futures Liquidations: A 24-Hour Snapshot of Market Stress The perpetual futures market serves as a critical barometer for trader leverage and sentiment. Over a recent 24-hour period, this market experienced concentrated stress. Analysts track liquidation events closely because they represent the point where an exchange automatically closes a leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. Consequently, these events can exacerbate price movements, creating feedback loops in the market. Data from aggregated tracking platforms shows the following major liquidations: Bitcoin (BTC): Total liquidations reached $29.08 million. Notably, short positions accounted for a dominant 78.74% of this figure, indicating most traders betting on a price decline were stopped out. Ethereum (ETH): Followed with $27.55 million in liquidations. Here, 68.9% were short positions, showing a similar, though slightly less pronounced, trend against sellers. Solana (SOL): Recorded $9.97 million in liquidations. Mirroring Bitcoin, short positions made up 78.59% of the total, underscoring a broad market dynamic. This data collectively points to a market movement that punished pessimistic bets. The concentration of short liquidations often suggests a price increase caught a large number of traders off guard, forcing them to buy back assets to close positions and inadvertently pushing prices higher—a phenomenon known as a short squeeze. Understanding the Mechanics of Perpetual Futures To grasp why these liquidations matter, one must understand the perpetual futures contract. Unlike traditional futures with set expiry dates, perpetual contracts, or “perps,” allow traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely. They use a funding rate mechanism to tether the contract price to the underlying spot asset price. Traders employ significant leverage, sometimes exceeding 20x or 50x, to amplify potential gains. However, this leverage also dramatically increases risk. Exchanges set maintenance margin levels. If a trader’s position loses enough value that their remaining margin falls below this level, the exchange initiates a liquidation. The exchange sells the position in the market to prevent further loss, often at an unfavorable price. Therefore, a cluster of liquidations can lead to rapid, volatile price swings as the market absorbs these forced trades. Expert Context on Market Sentiment and Leverage Market analysts often interpret a high ratio of short liquidations as a sign of shifting sentiment. When prices rise against widespread short bets, it can indicate underlying buying pressure or a reduction in selling pressure. The recent data suggests that a catalyst, potentially macroeconomic news, a large institutional buy order, or positive protocol developments, triggered upward momentum that cascaded through the leveraged derivatives market. Historical data shows that periods of high liquidation volume frequently precede or coincide with local price tops or bottoms, as extreme leverage is flushed from the system. The $66 million event, while notable, remains smaller than historical liquidation clusters exceeding $1 billion, suggesting controlled deleveraging rather than a systemic panic. This context is crucial for distinguishing between routine market volatility and more severe stress events. Comparative Impact Across Major Cryptocurrencies The varying percentages of short liquidations across assets reveal subtle differences in trader positioning and market structure. Bitcoin’s nearly 79% short liquidation ratio highlights its role as the market bellwether; sentiment shifts here are often most pronounced. Ethereum’s lower ratio, though still heavily skewed toward shorts, may reflect a more balanced derivatives book or different catalyst drivers specific to the Ethereum ecosystem, such as network upgrade anticipation. Solana’s high ratio mirrors Bitcoin’s, indicating that altcoins with high futures market liquidity can experience similar squeeze dynamics. The table below summarizes the key metrics: Asset Total Liquidations Short Percentage Approx. Short Value Liquidated Bitcoin (BTC) $29.08M 78.74% $22.90M Ethereum (ETH) $27.55M 68.9% $18.98M Solana (SOL) $9.97M 78.59% $7.83M This comparative view shows that while the absolute value differed, the punitive effect on short sellers was a consistent theme. The collective action of these liquidations likely provided sustained upward momentum for prices during the period, as forced buying to cover shorts added to organic demand. The Ripple Effects and Broader Market Implications Liquidation events extend beyond immediate price action. First, they impact trader psychology, potentially causing a shift from aggressive shorting to caution or even long positioning. Second, high volatility can trigger risk management protocols at funds and institutions, leading to reduced position sizes or hedging activity. Third, exchange systems handle the liquidation process; a smooth process during such events reinforces trust in market infrastructure. Furthermore, data from the options market and funding rates across exchanges provide corroborating evidence. For instance, a sustained positive funding rate after such a squeeze would indicate that longs are now paying shorts to maintain positions, suggesting a potential overheating to the upside. Monitoring these interconnected metrics gives a fuller picture than liquidation data alone. Conclusion The recent wave of crypto futures liquidations , overwhelmingly dominated by short positions, serves as a powerful reminder of the risks inherent in leveraged digital asset trading. The event, totaling over $66 million across major cryptocurrencies, was characterized by a classic short squeeze dynamic that realigns leveraged positions with prevailing market momentum. Understanding these mechanics—from perpetual contracts and margin calls to market sentiment indicators—is essential for any participant in the crypto derivatives space. While not a record-setting event, this liquidation cluster provides valuable, real-world insight into how volatility propagates through the complex, interconnected systems of modern cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when short positions are liquidated? A short liquidation occurs when a trader who borrowed an asset to sell it (betting on a price drop) is forced to buy it back at a higher price to close their position because their trade has moved against them, depleting their collateral. Q2: Why do liquidations cause more volatility? Liquidations are forced market orders. A cluster of liquidations means many large buy or sell orders hit the market at once, often at market price, which can rapidly move the price and trigger further liquidations in a cascade. Q3: What is the difference between a liquidation and a stop-loss? A stop-loss is a voluntary order set by a trader to limit losses. A liquidation is an involuntary, automatic closure executed by the exchange when a trader’s margin balance falls below the required maintenance level due to losses. Q4: Are perpetual futures riskier than spot trading? Yes, significantly. Perpetual futures involve leverage, which amplifies both gains and losses. Spot trading involves directly owning the asset with no leverage, thus limiting maximum loss to the initial investment. Q5: How can traders monitor liquidation risk? Traders can monitor their margin ratio closely, use lower leverage, and watch aggregate liquidation heatmaps provided by data sites. These tools show price levels where a large volume of leveraged positions would face liquidation.

This partnership represents one of the first practical implementations of blockchain-based clinical data exchange in academic research, potentially transforming how medical institutions access and verify health information. Hippo Protocol’s DataHippo DApp Transforms Medical Research Collaboration The agreement between Hippo Protocol and the Chinese University of Hong Kong establishes a concrete framework for blockchain-facilitated data sharing. According to the official announcement made via the social media platform X, this collaboration provides what industry analysts describe as a “proof of concept” for decentralized medical data ecosystems. The partnership specifically involves supplying anonymized clinical datasets to CUHK’s medical research departments through DataHippo’s secure node network. Medical researchers at CUHK will access these datasets for various studies, including epidemiological research and treatment efficacy analysis. Importantly, the blockchain infrastructure ensures data integrity and provenance tracking throughout the research lifecycle. This development follows years of theoretical discussion about blockchain applications in healthcare, finally demonstrating practical implementation. Blockchain Technology’s Practical Application in Healthcare Data Traditional medical data exchange faces significant challenges including privacy concerns, data silos, and verification difficulties. Blockchain technology addresses these issues through its inherent characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and transparency. Hippo Protocol’s implementation specifically utilizes a node-based architecture where participating institutions maintain control over their data while enabling secure sharing. The healthcare blockchain market has grown substantially since 2020, with projections indicating continued expansion through 2030. Several factors drive this growth: Enhanced data security through cryptographic protection Improved interoperability between disparate healthcare systems Patient consent management via smart contract automation Research data provenance ensuring academic integrity Unlike previous blockchain healthcare initiatives focused primarily on patient records, Hippo Protocol’s approach emphasizes research-grade data exchange. This distinction matters significantly for academic institutions requiring verifiable, high-quality datasets for publication-worthy research. Expert Perspectives on Blockchain’s Medical Research Potential Healthcare technology analysts view this partnership as indicative of broader trends. “The Hippo Protocol-CUHK collaboration demonstrates that blockchain applications are maturing beyond financial use cases,” notes Dr. Evelyn Chen, a healthcare data systems researcher at Stanford University. “What makes this particularly significant is the academic research context, where data integrity requirements are exceptionally stringent.” Medical research institutions traditionally rely on centralized databases or direct institution-to-institution agreements for data access. These approaches often involve complex legal agreements, lengthy verification processes, and concerns about data manipulation. Blockchain-based systems potentially streamline this process while enhancing security features. The table below compares traditional versus blockchain-enabled medical data exchange: Aspect Traditional Exchange Blockchain-Enabled Exchange Verification Time Weeks to months Near real-time Audit Trail Manual documentation Automated, immutable ledger Data Integrity Periodic checks Continuous cryptographic verification Access Control Institutional policies Smart contract automation CUHK’s decision to utilize blockchain-sourced data reflects growing academic acceptance of decentralized technologies. The university’s medical research department has previously published studies on healthcare data systems, indicating informed decision-making regarding this partnership. The Technical Architecture Behind DataHippo’s Implementation DataHippo operates on Hippo Protocol’s specialized blockchain designed specifically for healthcare data exchange. The system incorporates several innovative features addressing medical research requirements. First, it implements zero-knowledge proof technology allowing data verification without exposing sensitive information. Second, the network utilizes a permissioned node structure where participating institutions validate transactions. This architecture balances transparency needs with privacy requirements essential for clinical data. Researchers accessing data through DataHippo can verify its origin and integrity while patient confidentiality remains protected. The system also incorporates granular consent management, enabling data subjects to control how their anonymized information contributes to research. Implementation at CUHK involves integration with existing research infrastructure rather than complete system replacement. This pragmatic approach increases adoption likelihood compared to more disruptive implementations. Researchers will access DataHippo through dedicated interfaces while maintaining familiar analytical tools for actual data examination. Regulatory Compliance and Ethical Considerations Hong Kong’s healthcare data regulations combine elements from various international frameworks, creating a complex compliance landscape. The Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance governs medical information handling, requiring specific protections for sensitive data. Hippo Protocol’s implementation reportedly addresses these requirements through several mechanisms. Data anonymization occurs before blockchain entry, ensuring no personally identifiable information enters the distributed ledger. Additionally, the system incorporates regional compliance rules into its smart contract logic, automatically enforcing relevant regulations. This automated compliance represents a significant advancement over manual regulatory adherence processes. Ethical review boards at CUHK have reportedly approved the data utilization methodology, addressing concerns about blockchain technology in sensitive research contexts. This approval process involved extensive examination of data protection measures and potential risks. The successful navigation of these regulatory and ethical hurdles establishes a precedent for similar implementations elsewhere. Broader Implications for Medical Research and Healthcare Innovation This partnership extends beyond the immediate participants, potentially influencing global medical research practices. Successful implementation could encourage other academic institutions to explore blockchain-based data solutions. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies and public health organizations might adopt similar approaches for large-scale research initiatives. The timing coincides with increased emphasis on data sharing in medical research. Recent global health challenges have highlighted the importance of rapid, reliable data exchange between institutions. Blockchain technology offers potential solutions to historical barriers in this area. However, experts caution that technological implementation alone cannot solve all data sharing challenges. Cultural and institutional factors remain significant considerations. The Hippo Protocol-CUHK collaboration reportedly includes extensive training and support components addressing these non-technical dimensions. This comprehensive approach increases the initiative’s likelihood of sustained success compared to purely technology-focused implementations. Conclusion The partnership between Hippo Protocol’s DataHippo DApp and the Chinese University of Hong Kong represents a significant milestone in blockchain adoption for medical research. This collaboration demonstrates practical applications for decentralized clinical data exchange beyond theoretical discussions. As healthcare institutions increasingly prioritize data integrity and security, blockchain solutions like Hippo Protocol’s offering may become more prevalent in academic and clinical settings. The success of this implementation will likely influence future developments at the intersection of blockchain technology and medical research worldwide.

The committee wrote to Prime Minister Kier Starmer to use the upcoming elections bill to make “explicit provision to disallow cryptocurrency donations to political parties and politicians.” In the open letter, the backbenchers have raised several concerns that emerged during committee evidence sessions. According to The Observer , the red flags include foreign influence on elections through the use of crypto, application of technologies that fall outside UK regulations, and the influence of AI in further obscuring the source of funds. The committee chairs include former minister Liam Byrne, Emily Thornberry, Tan Dhesi, Florence Eshalomi, Andy Slaughter, Chi Onwurah and Matt Western. Pressures Mount to Restrict Crypto Donations to UK Political Parties The British government’s plans to outright ban the use of crypto in political contributions aren’t new. The government said last month that more details about the plan would be released when the Elections Bill is published. Besides, the government intensified the ban after the political party Reform UK received its biggest crypto donation of £9 million ($12 million). Crypto investor Christopher Harborne donated heavily ahead of local elections in May, the Electoral Commission figures show. Further, former senior civil servant Philip Rycroft is reviewing foreign financial interference in UK politics, which includes a focus on crypto. However, it is not expected to conclude until March 2026, local reports noted. “Anonymous Money Has No Place in British Democracy”: Liam Byrne Liam Byrne, who chairs the business and trade select committee, stressed that the Labour MPs’ committee is concerned that political finance “must be transparent, traceable and enforceable,” the Guardian reported Sunday . “Crypto can obscure the true source of funds, enable thousands of micro donations below disclosure thresholds, and expose UK politics to foreign interference,” he said. He added that the UK must not wait until a scandal erupts, making clear that the call is not against innovation. “If the elections bill doesn’t ban cryptocurrency donations, I will move amendments to make sure it does, and I know scores of MPs will back it. Anonymous money has no place in British democracy.” Another senior Labour backbencher, Emily Thornberry, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, said that banning crypto would protect the UK’s democracy. “The FAC has been studying threats to democracy around the world, and we’ve learnt that crypto is the Russian slush fund of choice,” Thornberry added.

This pivotal adjustment, reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, signals a major shift in Wall Street expectations for the U.S. central bank’s approach to inflation management and economic stabilization. The investment bank now expects two consecutive 25-basis-point reductions in the federal funds rate, marking a deliberate but measured response to evolving economic conditions. Goldman Sachs Adjusts Federal Reserve Rate Cut Forecast Goldman Sachs economists have fundamentally changed their monetary policy outlook. Consequently, they now project the Federal Reserve will implement quarter-percentage-point reductions during its June and September meetings. Previously, the bank anticipated initial easing would begin in March 2024. This revised timeline reflects comprehensive analysis of recent economic data and Federal Reserve communications. Specifically, the adjustment considers persistent inflation metrics and labor market resilience. Moreover, the new forecast aligns with broader market expectations that have similarly shifted toward mid-year policy adjustments. The Federal Reserve maintains its benchmark interest rate between 5.25% and 5.50%, representing the highest level in over two decades. Goldman’s updated projection suggests policymakers will maintain this restrictive stance for several additional months. This extended period aims to ensure inflation returns sustainably to the central bank’s 2% target. Recent consumer price index readings show gradual moderation but remain above desired levels. Therefore, Federal Reserve officials emphasize the need for continued vigilance before implementing rate cuts. The Data Behind the Forecast Revision Several key economic indicators influenced Goldman Sachs’ revised outlook. First, January’s employment report showed stronger-than-expected job creation. Second, consumer spending data demonstrated continued resilience. Third, inflation measures, while improving, displayed stickiness in services categories. Additionally, Federal Reserve meeting minutes revealed cautious optimism among policymakers. These factors collectively support a delayed easing timeline. Importantly, the forecast assumes continued progress on inflation without significant economic deterioration. Understanding the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Framework The Federal Reserve employs interest rate adjustments as its primary monetary policy tool. When the central bank raises rates, borrowing costs increase throughout the economy. Conversely, rate reductions stimulate economic activity by lowering financing expenses. Currently, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) faces a complex balancing act. They must combat inflation while avoiding excessive economic slowdown. Goldman Sachs’ forecast suggests policymakers believe they can achieve this balance through measured, delayed easing. Recent Federal Reserve communications provide context for Goldman’s revised outlook. Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized data-dependent decision-making. He specifically noted the need for greater confidence in inflation’s downward trajectory. Several other FOMC members have expressed similar cautious views. Their collective stance supports Goldman’s shifted timeline from March to June for initial rate reductions. Market participants now widely expect this delayed approach, with futures pricing reflecting June as the most probable starting point. Federal Reserve Rate Cut Forecast Comparison Forecast Period Previous Goldman Sachs Projection Current Goldman Sachs Projection March 2024 25 basis point cut No cut expected June 2024 25 basis point cut 25 basis point cut September 2024 Not specified 25 basis point cut Total 2024 Cuts Multiple cuts expected 50 basis points total Economic Impacts of Delayed Rate Cuts The revised timeline carries significant implications for various economic sectors. First, consumers will face higher borrowing costs for longer periods. This affects mortgage rates, auto loans, and credit card interest. Second, businesses may delay investment decisions awaiting lower financing expenses. Third, financial markets must adjust to extended higher rate expectations. However, delayed cuts could strengthen the U.S. dollar, affecting international trade dynamics. Furthermore, the extended restrictive policy may help anchor inflation expectations more firmly. Market Reactions and Broader Economic Context Financial markets have largely anticipated Goldman Sachs’ revised forecast. Bond yields have adjusted higher in recent weeks, reflecting reduced expectations for near-term easing. Equity markets have shown resilience despite the delayed timeline. This suggests investors recognize the economic strength supporting extended higher rates. Meanwhile, other major investment banks have made similar adjustments to their forecasts. Most now align around mid-year initial cuts rather than first-quarter easing. The global economic backdrop further supports Goldman’s revised outlook. European central banks maintain similarly cautious stances. The Bank of England and European Central Bank both emphasize persistent inflation concerns. Asian economies show mixed signals, with China implementing stimulus while Japan considers policy normalization. This international context reduces pressure for premature Federal Reserve easing. Consequently, coordinated global monetary policy approaches may emerge throughout 2024. Key factors that could alter the forecast include: Inflation acceleration: Unexpected price increases could delay cuts further Labor market weakening: Significant job losses might accelerate easing Financial stability concerns: Banking sector stress could prompt earlier action Global economic shocks: International crises might force policy reassessment Historical Precedents for Policy Transitions The Federal Reserve has navigated similar policy transitions previously. The 2015-2018 tightening cycle provides relevant comparison points. During that period, the central bank implemented gradual rate increases as the economy strengthened. The current situation represents the reverse scenario, with planned gradual easing. Historical analysis suggests measured approaches typically produce better economic outcomes than abrupt policy shifts. Goldman Sachs’ forecast reflects this preference for gradual normalization. Conclusion Goldman Sachs’ revised Federal Reserve rate cut forecast represents a significant development in monetary policy expectations. The shift from March to June and September 2024 reflects careful analysis of economic data and Federal Reserve communications. This adjusted timeline suggests continued confidence in economic resilience alongside persistent inflation concerns. Market participants should prepare for extended higher interest rates with gradual, measured easing beginning mid-year. The Federal Reserve’s data-dependent approach will continue guiding policy decisions, with Goldman Sachs’ forecast providing a valuable framework for understanding potential developments. Ultimately, the central bank’s careful balancing act between inflation control and economic support remains the dominant theme for 2024 monetary policy. FAQs Q1: Why did Goldman Sachs change its Federal Reserve rate cut forecast? Goldman Sachs revised its forecast based on recent economic data showing persistent inflation and labor market strength. The investment bank now believes the Federal Reserve will require more time to gain confidence in inflation’s downward trajectory before implementing rate cuts. Q2: How many rate cuts does Goldman Sachs now expect in 2024? Goldman Sachs expects two 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2024, occurring in June and September. This represents a reduction from earlier expectations of more aggressive easing throughout the year. Q3: What economic indicators most influenced this forecast change? Key indicators included stronger-than-expected employment data, resilient consumer spending, and sticky services inflation. Federal Reserve communications emphasizing caution also significantly influenced the revised outlook. Q4: How will delayed rate cuts affect consumers and businesses? Consumers will face higher borrowing costs for longer periods, affecting mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. Businesses may delay investment decisions due to continued higher financing expenses, potentially slowing economic growth modestly. Q5: Could the Federal Reserve still cut rates in March despite this forecast? While possible, Goldman Sachs considers March cuts unlikely given current data. The Federal Reserve would need to see unexpected economic weakness or rapid inflation improvement to justify earlier easing, neither of which appears in recent indicators.

57088661,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260580,1768193711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Asia FX Subdued as Dollar Slips Amidst Startling Congressional Probe into Fed’s Powell,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-slip-powell-probe/,"BitcoinWorld Asia FX Subdued as Dollar Slips Amidst Startling Congressional Probe into Fed’s Powell Financial markets across Asia opened with cautious restraint on Thursday, March 20, 2025, as regional currencies showed limited movement against a broadly weaker US dollar. The greenback’s decline follows the startling announcement of a formal congressional investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, triggering immediate volatility in global foreign exchange markets and raising profound questions about monetary policy stability. Asia FX Markets Adopt a Subdued Stance Major Asian currencies exhibited minimal gains despite the dollar’s retreat. The Japanese yen (JPY) traded within a tight band, while the Chinese yuan (CNY) remained closely managed by the People’s Bank of China. Similarly, the Korean won (KRW) and Singapore dollar (SGD) showed only marginal appreciation. Market analysts attribute this subdued reaction to a complex mix of regional economic headwinds and overarching global uncertainty. Consequently, traders are prioritizing capital preservation over aggressive positioning. This cautious sentiment reflects deeper concerns about sustained inflation and divergent growth trajectories across the Asia-Pacific region. Regional Central Banks in a Holding Pattern Central banks across Asia are now carefully monitoring the situation. Many had been anticipating clearer signals from the Federal Reserve regarding its future interest rate path. The probe into Chairman Powell, however, injects significant uncertainty into that outlook. As a result, policymakers from Tokyo to Sydney may delay their own monetary adjustments. They require stable external conditions to support fragile domestic recoveries. This wait-and-see approach directly contributes to the lack of decisive movement in regional foreign exchange pairs. The Dollar Slips on Political Uncertainty The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, fell approximately 0.4% in early trading. This decline represents a direct market response to the political risk introduced by the congressional investigation. Historically, the dollar serves as a global safe-haven asset. Instability at the core of US monetary policy authority, therefore, undermines this perceived safety. The probe focuses on communications and decision-making processes within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Investors are swiftly repricing the risk premium associated with holding US assets. Immediate Impact: Sell-off in dollar futures and a flight to alternative havens like gold and the Swiss franc. Yield Curve Reaction: US Treasury yields dipped, particularly on the short end of the curve, reflecting doubts about near-term rate hikes. Market Liquidity: Trading volumes spiked as institutional investors reassessed their currency allocations. Historical Context of Fed Scrutiny Congressional scrutiny of the Federal Reserve is not unprecedented. For instance, the Fed faced intense criticism following the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, Chair Paul Volcker endured significant political pressure during the high-inflation era of the early 1980s. The current probe, however, is notable for its timing. It occurs amidst a delicate global economic rebalancing and persistent inflationary pressures. This context amplifies its potential market impact. Legal experts note that while the Fed operates independently, it remains accountable to Congress, which oversees its mandate. Anatomy of the Probe into Chairman Powell The bipartisan congressional committee announced its investigation late Wednesday. The committee will examine the consistency and transparency of the Federal Reserve’s policy guidance over the past 18 months. Specifically, lawmakers seek clarity on the rationale behind recent pauses in interest rate adjustments. They also question internal deliberations regarding balance sheet reduction. The committee has requested transcripts, meeting minutes, and internal communications. Chairman Powell has publicly stated the Fed will cooperate fully with the oversight process. He emphasized the institution’s commitment to its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Key Focus Areas of the Congressional Probe Focus Area Committee’s Stated Concern Potential Market Implication Policy Communication Alleged shifts in forward guidance creating market confusion. Increased volatility around FOMC statements and press conferences. Inflation Forecasting Accuracy and models used to predict persistent inflation. Eroded credibility could weaken the dollar’s long-term structural support. Balance Sheet Policy Timing and pace of quantitative tightening (QT). Uncertainty over liquidity withdrawal affecting global bond markets. Internal Governance Decision-making process and dissent among committee members. Questions about policy cohesion and future voting patterns. Expert Analysis on Institutional Independence Dr. Anya Sharma, a former IMF economist and current senior fellow at the Center for Monetary Policy, provided context. “While oversight is a legitimate function of Congress,” she noted, “markets are highly sensitive to perceptions of political influence over central bank decisions. The Federal Reserve’s credibility is its most critical asset. Any process that appears to challenge its operational independence can have immediate and tangible effects on currency valuations and capital flows.” Her analysis underscores that the probe’s market impact may hinge more on perception than its eventual findings. Global Ripple Effects and Future Scenarios The implications extend far beyond US borders. European and UK central bankers are now grappling with spillover effects. Emerging markets, which carry significant dollar-denominated debt, face a double-edged sword. A weaker dollar eases their debt servicing burdens. Concurrently, the associated uncertainty could trigger capital outflows. For Asia, a region deeply integrated into global supply chains, stable exchange rates are crucial for trade and investment planning. The current environment of political uncertainty complicates this stability. Therefore, regional finance ministers are likely to enhance their currency swap line agreements as a precautionary measure. Scenario 1 (Quick Resolution): A swift, transparent probe that reaffirms Fed independence could restore confidence and stabilize the dollar. Scenario 2 (Prolonged Inquiry): A lengthy, contentious investigation may lead to sustained dollar weakness and increased global market volatility. Scenario 3 (Policy Shift): The probe could indirectly influence future Fed decisions, making the committee more cautious and reactive to political sentiment. The Path Forward for Traders and Investors In the immediate term, currency strategists advise a focus on volatility management. Options markets are pricing in higher expected swings for major dollar pairs. Additionally, investors are diversifying into assets perceived as neutral during institutional uncertainty. These assets include commodities and the currencies of nations with apolitical central bank frameworks. The coming weeks will be critical. Key testimonies from Fed officials and committee hearings will provide further clues. Market participants must parse these developments for signals about the long-term institutional landscape. Conclusion The subdued action in Asia FX markets and the slip in the US dollar represent a clear, initial market verdict on the congressional probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This event highlights the fragile interplay between monetary policy independence and political oversight. While Asian currencies have shown resilience, their cautious movement reflects a global financial system in a holding pattern. The ultimate impact on the Asia FX complex and the broader dollar hegemony will depend on the probe’s duration, tone, and conclusions. For now, the market’s message is one of vigilant uncertainty, prioritizing risk assessment over decisive directional bets. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the congressional probe into Jerome Powell investigating? The bipartisan probe is examining the Federal Reserve’s internal communications, decision-making processes, and the consistency of its policy guidance over recent months, particularly regarding inflation forecasts and balance sheet management. Q2: Why did Asian currencies not rally more strongly if the US dollar weakened? Asian currencies remained subdued due to local economic concerns, pre-existing caution among regional central banks, and the fact that dollar weakness was driven by political risk rather than positive economic shifts in Asia. Q3: Could this probe force Jerome Powell to resign? Legal experts consider this highly unlikely. The probe is an oversight investigation, not a criminal one. Its goal is scrutiny and potential policy recommendations, not removal, barring the discovery of extraordinary misconduct. Q4: How does this affect the average person with investments? Investors may see increased volatility in international stock and bond funds. A persistently weaker dollar could affect the cost of imported goods and overseas travel. It underscores the importance of a diversified, long-term investment strategy. Q5: What should forex traders watch in the coming days? Traders should monitor testimony from Fed officials before Congress, the DXY’s support levels, and any statements from major Asian central banks regarding currency stability. Key economic data releases will also be scrutinized for underlying strength beyond the political noise.

In a video posted Sunday, Powell said federal prosecutors are probing his June Senate testimony tied to the $2.5B renovation of the Fed’s Washington headquarters. Powell framed the move as retaliation for holding rates higher than President Donald Trump wants, saying, “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” Video message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H.

Asked if the subpoenas were meant to pressure Powell on rates , Trump said, “No. I wouldn’t even think of doing it that way.” He also said the subpoenas had nothing to do with interest rates. *TRUMP SAYS DOJ SUBPOENAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INTEREST RATES: NBC *TRUMP DENIES INVOLVEMENT IN DOJ'S FED SUBPOENAS: NBC — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 12, 2026 Warren Accuses Trump Of Using DOJ To Pressure Fed The investigation follows months of political sparring over the renovation, including a July 2025 referral from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna urging the DOJ to investigate Powell for potential perjury and false statements tied to that testimony. On Capitol Hill, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said he would block confirmations of future Fed nominees until the matter is resolved, warning the fight now raises questions about DOJ independence as well. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump is “abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends.” Markets treated the headlines as a fresh institutional risk, with traders watching the dollar, rate expectations and volatility gauges that often feed straight into crypto positioning through liquidity and leverage. Powell’s chair term ends in May 2026, and he can stay on the Fed board until 2028, leaving Trump’s next chair pick as a looming catalyst for rates, the dollar and Bitcoin’s macro bid.

Based on reports , the rules add live biometric checks, location data capture, and bank-account verification steps designed to cut down on anonymous accounts and suspicious flows. Live Selfie And Geo-Tagging Required Reports have disclosed that new sign-up flows must include a live selfie verified by liveness detection — such as eye blink or head movement checks — so a static or doctored photo can’t be used. Platforms must also record latitude and longitude, the device IP address and a timestamp at the moment a user registers. Those pieces of data will be kept as part of the KYC record, according to coverage by major outlets. A Penny-Drop To Confirm Bank Ownership Exchanges are required to carry out a so-called penny-drop — a nominal ₹1 transfer — to confirm the customer actually controls the linked bank account. Users must supply PAN plus a secondary government ID such as Aadhaar, passport or voter ID, and verify phone and email addresses with OTPs. These steps are intended to tighten the link between identity and on-chain activity. Enhanced Ongoing Checks And Reporting Duties Exchanges must refresh KYC every year for ordinary users and every six months for clients flagged as higher risk. Reporting duties have been stepped up: platforms will register as reporting entities with the FIU under the Prevention Of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and file suspicious transaction reports when triggers are hit. Based on industry commentary, that will raise compliance costs and slow down onboarding for new retail customers. Market And User Impact Industry participants told reporters that the new steps are likely to increase the time it takes a user to open an account and will push up operational costs for platforms that must integrate biometric and geolocation systems. While regulators say the measures aim to block illicit finance, some retail investors may find the process harder to complete, which could affect volumes in the near term. According to sources, the FIU expects exchanges to implement these checks promptly and to keep records for audit. Failure to comply could invite action under PMLA rules. Observers say the move aligns India with stricter global KYC norms and signals that regulators plan active oversight as crypto use grows.

These sources alleged that the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, D.C., directed this investigation , mandating an assessment into whether Powell deceived Congress regarding the renovation details . According to the sources, this investigation was approved in November by Jeanine Pirro, United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. Powell faces a legal battle As individuals raised concerns about whether a grand jury had been established or if the Fed team had received any subpoenas, reports highlighted that federal prosecutors had reached out to the team and asked them to issue documents, sparking further discussions. Reporters sought out the White House to respond to this controversy , but the officials declined to respond. On the other hand, sources familiar with the situation revealed that Powell received several complaints of dissatisfaction from US President Donald Trump, who also demanded that the Fed chair submit his resignation from his role, further intensifying the situation. In this finding, the reporters discovered that these complaints began to heighten in July 2025. At this particular moment, Russell Vought, the Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, issued a letter to the Fed chair. In the letter, Vought stated that Trump raised significant concerns about his management of the Federal Reserve System and the renovation of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., alleging that this project is very costly. Following the president’s claim, this year’s budget documents indicate that the approximate cost for successfully renovating two historic buildings, particularly in Washington, has increased from the initial $1.9 billion in 2023 to $2.5 billion. Concerning this increase, the Fed’s 2025 budget stressed that, “construction cost estimates have kept going up, especially for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work, due to competitive bidding prices.” Meanwhile, Trump declared that he has appointed an ideal candidate who will assume Powell’s role as the Fed chair when he completes his term in May 2026. Nonetheless, the president chose not to disclose his choice. Even so, odds displayed on Polymarket highlighted that Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, has secured the position as the top candidate. Powell claims to be innocent As debates continued to escalate regarding the progress of Powell’s criminal investigation, the Fed chair released a statement dated Sunday, January 11, stating that the US central bank received grand jury subpoenas from the Department of Justice. Following this issuance, Powell declared the possibility of a criminal indictment. His statement raised mixed reactions from individuals, with many criticizing Powell. Responding to this, the Fed chair decided to explain the situation in a clear and concise written and video message to facilitate better understanding. He stated that the matter is linked to his testimony, which he submitted before Congress in June, about updates to the central bank’s headquarters. “No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure,” Powell said, arguin g th e investigation is being used as a pretext to influence monetary policy. Powell stressed that this move should be viewed within the broader context of the ongoing threats and pressure coming from Trump’s administration. “The risk of criminal charges comes from the Federal Reserve making decisions about interest rates based on what we believe is best for the public, rather than catering to the president’s wishes,” Powell stated, adding that, “This issue is about whether the Fed can keep setting interest rates based on facts and economic situations, or if monetary policy will instead be influenced by political pressure or intimidation.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This announcement, made via social media platform X on March 15, 2025, directly addresses growing concerns about secondary market account transactions that threaten the integrity of cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. The policy emerges as exchanges face increasing regulatory scrutiny and user protection demands, positioning OKX at the forefront of security-first platform management. OKX Account Trading Policy: The Foundation of Exchange Security Star Xu’s statement represents more than just platform policy—it’s a fundamental declaration about how cryptocurrency exchanges must prioritize security over convenience. The announcement specifically responded to a user requesting the unfreezing of an account containing 40,000 USDT, which the user openly admitted to purchasing rather than creating through legitimate registration channels. Xu emphasized that OKX considers the identity information provided during initial registration as the most reliable security foundation, creating what industry experts call a “first-contact trust model.” This approach contrasts sharply with platforms that prioritize user flexibility over security verification, potentially setting a new industry standard for account management protocols. Cryptocurrency exchanges globally face increasing pressure to implement robust security measures, particularly as regulatory frameworks like the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations and the United States’ evolving digital asset legislation demand stronger user protection. According to blockchain security firm Chainalysis, account-related fraud represented approximately 15% of all cryptocurrency losses in 2024, totaling over $2.3 billion globally. This context makes OKX’s policy announcement particularly significant, as it addresses a growing vulnerability that many platforms have historically treated as a secondary concern. The Technical Framework Behind Account Security Modern cryptocurrency exchanges employ sophisticated technical frameworks to detect and prevent unauthorized account activities. These systems typically include: Behavioral analytics algorithms that monitor login patterns and transaction behaviors Multi-factor authentication requirements that tie accounts to specific devices and locations Identity verification protocols that cross-reference registration data with ongoing activity Blockchain forensic tools that trace fund movements across platforms OKX’s policy specifically addresses what security experts call “account portability risk”—the danger created when users transfer account access rather than assets. This practice bypasses standard security protocols and creates significant vulnerabilities for both the platform and legitimate users. The exchange’s firm stance reflects growing industry consensus that account integrity must remain non-negotiable, even when facing public pressure or emotional appeals from affected users. Cryptocurrency Exchange Security: Evolving Standards and Practices The cryptocurrency industry has undergone significant security evolution since Bitcoin’s creation in 2009. Early exchanges prioritized accessibility and growth, often implementing minimal security measures that left users vulnerable to various forms of exploitation. However, major security breaches and increasing regulatory oversight have forced platforms to develop more sophisticated protection systems. OKX’s current policy represents what security analysts describe as “third-generation exchange security”—moving beyond basic two-factor authentication and cold storage to comprehensive identity management and behavioral monitoring. Comparative analysis reveals how different exchanges approach account security: Exchange Account Transfer Policy Identity Verification Level Public Disclosure OKX Zero tolerance, immediate freezing KYC Level 3 required Public statements by founder Binance Case-by-case review KYC Level 2 standard Internal policy documents Coinbase Prohibited but variable enforcement KYC Level 3 for certain features Terms of Service reference Kraken Strict prohibition KYC Level 2 minimum Support documentation This policy landscape demonstrates how exchanges balance security requirements with user experience considerations. OKX’s approach places security as the absolute priority, potentially sacrificing some user flexibility for enhanced protection. Industry analysts note that this positioning aligns with increasing regulatory expectations, particularly as financial authorities worldwide demand stronger anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance from cryptocurrency platforms. The Regulatory Context: Global Standards and Local Requirements Global regulatory frameworks increasingly influence exchange security policies. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule, implemented across multiple jurisdictions, requires exchanges to share sender and recipient information for transactions exceeding certain thresholds. This regulation makes accurate identity verification essential, as exchanges must maintain reliable records of account ownership. Similarly, the European Union’s Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (6AMLD) imposes strict requirements on financial institutions, including cryptocurrency exchanges, to prevent illicit financial activities. OKX’s zero-tolerance policy directly supports these regulatory requirements by ensuring that account ownership remains transparent and verifiable throughout the account lifecycle. This approach helps the exchange maintain compliance across multiple jurisdictions while protecting users from potential legal complications arising from account transfers. Security experts emphasize that clear, consistently enforced policies provide necessary protection for both platforms and users in an increasingly regulated environment. Social Media Appeals and Security Vulnerabilities: A New Threat Landscape Star Xu specifically addressed the emerging threat of social media appeals in his statement, noting that emotional posts seeking public sympathy could represent “a new type of scam that harms the actual account owner.” This observation reflects growing concern within the cybersecurity community about how social platforms become vectors for social engineering attacks. Bad actors increasingly use emotional narratives to pressure platforms into bypassing security protocols, creating what experts call “sympathy-based security breaches.” Recent analysis by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike indicates that social engineering attacks targeting cryptocurrency platforms increased by 47% between 2023 and 2024, with social media platforms serving as primary attack vectors. These attacks often follow predictable patterns: Emotional narrative construction creating victim personas Public pressure campaigns across multiple platforms Coordinated community responses designed to overwhelm support systems Fabricated documentation supporting false ownership claims OKX’s firm stance against such appeals establishes important precedent for how exchanges should respond to public pressure campaigns. By maintaining consistent policy enforcement regardless of social media sentiment, the exchange protects both its security infrastructure and legitimate users who might otherwise become victims of sophisticated social engineering schemes. This approach aligns with recommendations from cybersecurity organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which emphasizes consistent policy enforcement as fundamental to effective security management. Document Verification Protocols: Establishing Legitimate Ownership For users who genuinely need to regain access to frozen accounts, OKX maintains clear document verification protocols. Star Xu emphasized that legitimate owners “must submit the necessary documents to prove” their identity and ownership claims. This process typically involves multiple verification stages designed to establish ownership beyond reasonable doubt while preventing fraudulent claims. Standard verification protocols include: Primary identification documents matching original registration Secondary verification materials establishing account control history Transaction pattern analysis confirming typical usage behaviors Cross-platform verification where applicable and available These protocols balance security requirements with user accessibility, providing legitimate owners with clear pathways to account recovery while maintaining robust protection against fraudulent claims. Industry analysts note that transparent, well-documented verification processes benefit both platforms and users by establishing clear expectations and reducing support system strain. Conclusion OKX’s zero-tolerance policy on account trading represents a significant evolution in cryptocurrency exchange security, establishing clear boundaries that prioritize user protection over flexibility. Star Xu’s public statement reinforces the exchange’s commitment to maintaining the integrity of its security framework, particularly regarding identity verification and account ownership. As the cryptocurrency industry matures and faces increasing regulatory scrutiny, such policies will likely become standard practice across major platforms. The OKX account trading prohibition demonstrates how exchanges must balance user experience with security requirements in an increasingly complex digital asset landscape, setting important precedent for industry-wide security standards. FAQs Q1: What exactly does OKX’s zero-tolerance policy on account trading mean? OKX’s policy means the exchange will immediately freeze and investigate any account discovered to have been purchased or sold, regardless of circumstances. The platform considers only the original registration information as valid proof of ownership and requires strict document verification for any ownership claims. Q2: Why do cryptocurrency exchanges prohibit account trading? Exchanges prohibit account trading primarily for security and regulatory compliance reasons. Account transfers bypass standard identity verification processes, creating vulnerabilities for money laundering, fraud, and theft. Additionally, regulations require exchanges to maintain accurate ownership records for all accounts. Q3: What should I do if I’ve legitimately purchased an OKX account? If you’ve purchased an OKX account, you should immediately contact support and follow their document verification process. However, be aware that the exchange maintains strict policies against account transfers, and recovery is not guaranteed. The safest approach is always to create your own account through proper registration channels. Q4: How can I ensure my cryptocurrency account remains secure? To maintain account security, always use original registration information, enable all available security features (including two-factor authentication), never share login credentials, and monitor account activity regularly. Create accounts only through official platforms using your verified identity information. Q5: Are other cryptocurrency exchanges implementing similar policies? Many exchanges are strengthening their account security policies, though approaches vary. Most major platforms prohibit account trading in their terms of service, but enforcement rigor differs.

Banks now plan to cloe this loophole. With stablecoins generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for Coinbase and the Treasury warning that widespread adoption could divert trillions from banks, the outcome of the legislation carries major implications for both crypto firms and the traditional banking sector. Coinbase Weighs Reconsidering CLARITY Act US-based crypto exchange Coinbase is intensifying its lobbying efforts in Washington as lawmakers debate provisions in a major crypto market structure bill that could impact decentralized finance and stablecoin-based reward products. According to a Bloomberg report that was published Sunday, Coinbase suggested that it may reconsider its support for the proposed CLARITY Act if the legislation moves to restrict stablecoin issuers and affiliated platforms from offering yield or rewards to users. The issue centers on whether stablecoin-related incentives, like rewards paid through crypto exchanges, should be treated similarly to interest-bearing bank products. Banking industry groups argue that these products threaten traditional deposits and could accelerate capital flight from the regulated banking system. Some anti-DeFi advocacy groups reportedly took the campaign public by running advertisements on Fox News urging viewers to pressure senators to support restrictions on decentralized finance provisions they claim pose systemic risks. At the same time, crypto industry advocates mounted their own grassroots response. Stand With Crypto , a pro-crypto advocacy group, says more than 135,000 emails have been sent to US senators urging them to protect stablecoin rewards and prevent what they see as an overreach that would stifle innovation. The debate is expected to escalate even more this week, as the US Senate Banking Committee prepares to address the issue during a markup session. The controversy is complicated by the existing GENIUS Act, which became law in July. While the GENIUS Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from directly offering interest or yield to token holders, it does not explicitly ban rewards offered through third-party platforms like crypto exchanges. This ambiguity left room for issuers to partner with exchanges to provide yield-like incentives. It is this loophole that traditional banking groups are now pushing lawmakers to close through the CLARITY Act. Coinbase, for its part, applied for a national trust banking charter, which would allow it to legally offer certain reward products under existing frameworks. Stablecoins have become an important revenue stream for the exchange, and generated close to $247 million in the fourth quarter, alongside $154.8 million from blockchain rewards. A ban on rewards tied to products like Circle’s USDC , which offers yields of around 3.5%, could materially impact Coinbase and other major trading platforms. Banking advocates warn that the stakes extend far beyond crypto firms. The US Treasury estimated earlier last year that widespread stablecoin adoption could divert as much as $6.6 trillion from traditional banks, raising concerns about liquidity and financial stability.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 05:30:00

This strategic adjustment, confirmed on March 15, 2025, directly increases the planned token supply for the first quarter by over 8.2 million WCT. Consequently, this decision carries substantial implications for investors, the project’s roadmap, and the broader decentralized application (dApp) connectivity landscape. Upbit’s WCT Circulation Plan: A Detailed Breakdown of the Change Upbit’s official communication outlines a precise modification to the WalletConnect token emission schedule. The exchange executed this change at the explicit request of the WalletConnect project team. A review of the updated data reveals a clear quantitative shift. Initially, the total circulating supply planned for Q1 2025 stood at 351,144,932 WCT. Following the revision, this figure now reaches 359,328,670 WCT. This represents a net increase of 8,183,738 tokens entering circulation earlier than previously scheduled. Furthermore, Upbit provided forward guidance, noting the circulating supply for the second quarter of 2025 is currently projected at 405,955,682 WCT. This alteration is not merely a numerical update. It reflects a dynamic response to the project’s evolving needs. Token circulation plans are foundational to a cryptocurrency’s economic model. They influence liquidity, market capitalization, and investor perception. A reputable exchange like Upbit altering such a plan underscores a coordinated strategy between the platform and the project developers. The change suggests a reassessment of capital requirements or user adoption timelines. Understanding WalletConnect’s Role in Web3 To fully grasp the impact, one must understand WalletConnect’s function. It is not a standalone cryptocurrency for payments. Instead, WalletConnect is an open-source protocol. It enables secure connections between decentralized wallets and dApps across different blockchains. Think of it as a critical bridge in the Web3 infrastructure. The WCT token governs this protocol through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Holders use WCT to vote on proposals and steer the project’s development. Therefore, changes to its supply and circulation directly affect governance power distribution and protocol security. Analyzing the Market Impact and Tokenomics Implications The immediate market reaction to such news is a key consideration. Historically, unexpected increases in token supply can exert downward pressure on price due to simple supply and demand dynamics. However, context is paramount. This was a planned, transparent adjustment requested by the project team and published by a major exchange. Transparency mitigates the negative shock often associated with surprise supply unlocks. The market had previously priced in the original circulation schedule. Now, it must digest the new, accelerated timeline for these 8.2 million tokens. Analysts often examine the purpose behind supply changes. Potential reasons for WalletConnect’s request could include: Ecosystem Growth Funding: Accelerating development grants or partnership incentives. Enhanced Liquidity Provision: Ensuring sufficient market depth on exchanges for larger users. Community & Governance Expansion: Distributing more tokens to active protocol participants and voters. Strategic Treasury Management: Aligning the project’s financial runway with updated operational goals. The following table compares the original and revised supply figures for clarity: Period Original Circulating Supply (WCT) Revised Circulating Supply (WCT) Change Q1 2025 351,144,932 359,328,670 +8,183,738 Q2 2025 Data Not Specified 405,955,682 N/A Upbit’s Authoritative Role in the Korean Crypto Ecosystem Upbit’s announcement carries extra weight due to its market position. Operated by Dunamu Inc., Upbit is South Korea’s largest digital asset exchange by trading volume. It commands immense influence over domestic cryptocurrency trends. The platform’s rigorous digital asset screening process is well-known. Therefore, its continued support and proactive communication regarding WCT signal ongoing confidence in the project’s legitimacy and roadmap. For global observers, Upbit often acts as a bellwether for Asian market sentiment. Its compliance-focused approach means such announcements undergo thorough review, enhancing their credibility. This event also highlights the evolving relationship between exchanges and projects. Exchanges are no longer mere trading venues. They are active ecosystem participants that facilitate transparent communication. By formally updating the circulation plan, Upbit provides a critical service. It ensures all market participants, from retail traders to institutional analysts, operate with the same fundamental data. This transparency is a cornerstone of mature financial markets and is increasingly demanded in the cryptocurrency sector. Expert Perspective on Supply Schedule Adjustments Industry analysts note that controlled, communicated supply changes are a sign of project maturity. “A static tokenomics model often fails to meet a project’s real-world needs,” explains a blockchain economist from the Seoul Fintech Lab. “The ability to strategically adjust vesting or emission schedules in response to ecosystem growth or market conditions demonstrates agile governance. The critical factors are transparency, a clear rationale, and sufficient notice—all of which appear present in this Upbit announcement regarding WCT.” This perspective frames the change not as a red flag, but as a strategic operational decision. Conclusion: A Strategic Pivot for WalletConnect’s Future Upbit’s update to the WalletConnect (WCT) circulation plan marks a strategic inflection point. The increase of 8.2 million tokens in the Q1 2025 supply is a data-driven decision with clear origins. It reflects a collaborative adjustment between a leading exchange and a foundational Web3 protocol project. While market participants will monitor price action closely, the underlying narrative is one of proactive governance. This move aims to better align token distribution with WalletConnect’s operational goals for the year. Ultimately, the long-term success of the Upbit WCT circulation plan change will hinge on how effectively the project deploys these tokens to strengthen its protocol, grow its community, and secure its position as essential Web3 infrastructure. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Upbit change about the WalletConnect (WCT) token? Upbit revised the planned circulating supply schedule for WCT. The amount of tokens scheduled to be in circulation by the end of Q1 2025 increased from 351,144,932 WCT to 359,328,670 WCT, a rise of 8,183,738 tokens. Q2: Why did this WCT circulation plan change happen? The change was made at the specific request of the WalletConnect project team. While the exact reason is not detailed in the announcement, such adjustments typically relate to funding ecosystem development, enhancing liquidity, or managing the project’s treasury and community incentives. Q3: Does an increased token supply mean the price of WCT will drop? Not necessarily. While increased supply can put downward pressure on price, this was a transparent, pre-announced adjustment. The market impact depends on why the tokens are being released and how they are used. If used for growth initiatives that increase demand, the net effect could be neutral or positive. Q4: What is the circulating supply of WCT projected to be in Q2 2025? According to the data released by Upbit alongside the Q1 change, the projected circulating supply for the second quarter of 2025 is 405,955,682 WCT. Q5: How does this change affect WalletConnect as a protocol? WalletConnect is a connectivity protocol, and WCT is its governance token. Releasing more tokens into circulation can decentralize governance voting power further if distributed to users. It can also provide the project treasury with more resources to fund development, security audits, and partnerships, potentially accelerating protocol improvements.

Trump said Starlink has strong technical skills that could reconnect people to the internet. The U.S. is exploring options such as satellite internet that operate outside Iran’s telecom networks. Authorities in Iran shut down the internet Iranian officials have shut down internet access in many areas around the country due to the ongoing protests. NetBlocks stated that connectivity levels across Iran have dropped to nearly zero and have remained low. Without the internet, people can’t get the latest news about what’s happening in their cities or other parts of the country. Workers also can’t use cloud services for work, students lose access to online learning tools, and families can’t send or receive money through digital payment systems. Journalists, engineers, and monitoring groups also can’t track outages, verify reports, or confirm the scale of violence in the country. Iran relies on a centralized internet infrastructure, where fiber-optic cables, mobile phone towers, and local data centers all require government permission to function. Officials can use this authority to demand that service providers shut down their operations and restrict internet access nationwide. People are now seeking alternative solutions, such as satellite-based networks, because they don’t rely on local towers, cables, or service providers. Authorities don’t have much control since the networks connect users directly to satellites in space, rather than routing data through government-controlled infrastructure. Satellite internet has helped keep communication open when local networks failed during previous shutdowns in other countries. The crisis in Iran has moved into the digital world as those affected try to share their experiences, and observers outside want to follow the events. Access to information now significantly impacts how events unfold and how the world perceives them. Trump will work with Musk to bring the internet back U.S. President Donald Trump said he will talk to Elon Musk about bringing the internet back to Iran through Starlink. Trump said Musk is “very good at that kind of thing” because his company has great technical skills and a lot of experience building complex systems. Starlink connects users directly to satellites orbiting the Earth, rather than relying on local service providers . The President said they could use Starlink terminals to bypass networks controlled by Iranian authorities. Trump said he wants regular people in the country to be able to read news, communicate with family, and know what’s happening around them because the country is in a state of fear and unrest. However, any plan to restore internet access to Iran still requires careful review within the U.S. government, as the Middle Eastern country is subject to U.S. sanctions for trade and technology transfers. Companies can’t provide any services or hardware to such countries without special approvals or legal exemptions. Iran is also strongly against internet support from foreigners, as the leaders of Tehran don’t want any “intruder” to have control over their communication tools. Iranian officials have long warned their citizens against using unauthorized satellite equipment and have even gone so far as to block or jam satellite signals. The country’s history demonstrates the challenges involved in establishing such services and hardware, as well as the type of resistance Starlink can expect. The world is closely watching Iran, particularly the efforts by the U.S., as similar plans in other regions have also created diplomatic tensions. Restoring internet access in Iran could also alter how the world perceives events within the country and influence how key groups respond to the crisis. The plan by Trump to speak with Musk shows just how much their relationship has changed, as the duo have been in an on-and-off political “situationship” for a long time. Musk supported Trump’s political campaigns and stood by him during key political moments, but that relationship broke when Elon opposed the president’s tax policy. There are new signs that their relationship is warming up again because they met in person and shared a dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.

Bitcoin’s price has stayed above an important support level, and short bursts of trading activity have pushed out over-leveraged traders. This has helped calm the market and raised the chance that the price direction may be turning upward. At the same time, data from CoinGlass and crypto exchanges shows that many recent price jumps came from traders being forced to close losing positions, not from new buyers rushing in. Bigger economic factors still matter, such as talk about interest rates, stock market mood, and money moving into Bitcoin ETFs. Conversely, a growing market contender that supports fast, low-cost crypto payments for everyday users worldwide is making a mark in the crypto world. Bitcoin is currently trading within a narrow band. Should it continue to hold and rise again, the price may be heading towards $100,000. In case it fails, Bitcoin can fall back to the range of $80,000 to $88,000. The next move will likely decide what happens next. Let’s find out. Bitcoin: technical setup, institutional flows, and realistic upside targets If you’re working on a Bitcoin Price Prediction today, start with two facts: momentum and liquidity. BTC has been holding a consolidation band in the low-to-mid $90,000 after an early-January rally that liquidated large short and long positions alike, classic reset behavior that can fuel either a strong follow-through or a quick fade. Options positioning (notably the interest in $100,000 calls) indicates market participants are betting on a higher path this month, yet the pattern on the charts is what will validate those bets: a clean reclaim of the $94,000–$95,000 zone and a weekly close above the 50-day moving average would be the technical signal most traders would take as confirmation. Conversely, a break under $88,000 on rising volume would invalidate the bullish thesis and reopen downside toward $75,000–$80,000 in some models. In essence, the ETF inflows and institutional allocation stories are positive tailwinds that play in favor of bullish Bitcoin Price Prediction scenarios. Some platforms indicate that inflows are consistent since the last quarter of 2025, but macro risks (Fed guidance, real yields) continue to make the way rocky. Pundit price-target models are all over the board: conservative technical targets are a re-test of $100,000 in case of momentum; bullish fundamental-driven targets are $120,000-150,000 when risk appetite returns and institutional accumulation reappears. Anyhow, the direct fight will be decided at the major support/resistance levels and through the trading volume: seek confirmation and not FOMO. Remittix: a payments-first altcoin to watch While BTC debates dominate headlines, payment-centric projects are moving toward real-world launches. Remittix is one such example, positioning itself as infrastructure for crypto-to-fiat flows and merchant rails. The team has signaled an upcoming PayFi rollout and a wallet that’s already live on iOS, which are the exact kinds of deliverables that convert speculative interest into product usage and on-chain utility.

According to a filing, Wells Fargo bought 383 million of Bitcoin ETF shares, a figure that market watchers flagged as a large institutional stake. Morgan Stanley also filed for its own spot Bitcoin ETF last week, which many see as more proof that big financial players are stepping in. Those actions are being cited by traders as one reason risk assets like Binance Coin could see more interest. Macroeconomic Calendar Could Swing Prices A packed US data week is ahead and traders say it could affect crypto angles. On Monday, the market will watch a speech by the FOMC president. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the US Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index are due. Jobless claims come on Thursday, and a Fed balance sheet update lands on Friday. Any big surprise in those numbers can push liquidity flows and quickly change appetite for tokens. Binance Coin: Technical Levels To Watch BNB briefly reclaimed the $900 zone and was reported at $909 in some feeds as the four-hour chart showed a steady climb. Short-term resistance sits near $950, with a psychological barrier at $1,000.

The South Korean cryptocurrency landscape faces a pivotal moment as Korbit, one of the nation’s pioneering digital asset exchanges, settles a substantial 2.73 billion won ($1.98 million) penalty. This decisive action by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) underscores a rigorous, ongoing enforcement of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. Consequently, the fine signals a clear warning to the entire digital finance sector about the non-negotiable nature of regulatory compliance. Korbit AML Fine: Deconstructing the Regulatory Action South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit imposed this significant financial penalty following a comprehensive inspection conducted last year. The investigation revealed specific failures in Korbit’s obligated AML systems. These systems are critical for preventing illicit financial flows. For instance, exchanges must perform stringent customer due diligence (CDD) and transaction monitoring. They must also report suspicious activities promptly. The FIU’s action, therefore, is not an isolated event but part of a broader, methodical regulatory sweep. This enforcement aligns with South Korea’s aggressive stance on financial integrity. The country implemented the Travel Rule in 2022, mandating the sharing of sender and receiver data for crypto transfers. Subsequently, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has consistently tightened oversight. Korbit’s case demonstrates that established players remain under intense scrutiny. The exchange has reportedly paid the fine in full, accepting the FIU’s findings. South Korea’s Evolving Crypto Regulatory Framework The penalty against Korbit occurs within a rapidly maturing legal environment. South Korea passed the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in 2023, creating a formal regulatory foundation. This law, effective from July 2024, classifies virtual assets as financial investment products. It imposes strict reserve requirements and mandates internal control standards. The FIU operates as the primary AML watchdog under this framework. Other exchanges have faced similar consequences. For example, Bithumb received corrective orders in 2023 for inadequate identity verification. Furthermore, global standards from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) pressure national regulators. South Korea, as a FATF member, must demonstrate effective enforcement. The Korbit fine serves as public evidence of this commitment. The timeline below illustrates key regulatory milestones. Year Regulatory Milestone Impact on Exchanges 2021 Enforcement of Real-Name Account Rules Mandated bank partnerships for all user accounts 2022 Travel Rule Implementation Required data sharing for transfers over 1 million KRW 2023 Virtual Asset User Protection Act Passed Established legal definitions and investor protections 2024 Act Comes into Force Formalized reserve, governance, and audit requirements 2025 Korbit Fine Announced Signaled active enforcement of AML provisions Expert Analysis on Compliance Failures Industry analysts point to common pitfalls that lead to such penalties. Typically, failures occur in three key areas: transaction monitoring systems, customer risk profiling, and staff training. A robust AML program requires continuous updates to detect sophisticated laundering patterns. According to regulatory experts, many exchanges initially built compliance systems for a smaller scale. However, rapid user growth can overwhelm these systems. The FIU’s inspection likely identified gaps in Korbit’s automated monitoring or its process for reviewing flagged transactions. Financial technology professor Lee Ji-hyun from Seoul National University notes, “The size of the Korbit fine is calibrated to reflect the severity of the lapse while considering the exchange’s cooperation. It is a corrective measure, not a punitive shutdown. The goal is systemic improvement across the market.” This perspective highlights the regulatory intent to foster a secure ecosystem rather than stifle innovation. Implications for the Global Cryptocurrency Market The repercussions of this enforcement extend beyond South Korea. International investors and exchanges watch these developments closely. South Korea represents one of the world’s most active and technically adept crypto markets. Therefore, its regulatory approach often influences other jurisdictions. A strict but clear compliance regime can attract institutional capital. Conversely, unpredictable enforcement can deter investment. For Korbit and its competitors, the immediate impacts are multifaceted: Operational Costs: Exchanges must invest heavily in upgraded compliance software and specialized personnel. Market Perception: Trust is paramount. A public fine can damage user confidence, though transparent resolution can mitigate this. Competitive Landscape: Exchanges with superior compliance infrastructure may gain a market advantage as users seek safer platforms. Innovation Balance: Firms must innovate within regulatory boundaries, potentially slowing some product launches for thorough review. Globally, regulators in the EU (with MiCA), the UK, and Singapore are pursuing similar paths. The Korbit case provides a real-world reference for penalty structuring. It shows regulators are moving past warnings to tangible financial consequences. Conclusion The 2.73 billion won Korbit AML fine is a landmark event in South Korea’s financial regulation. It demonstrates the FIU’s resolve to enforce Anti-Money Laundering standards without exception. This action reinforces the country’s commitment to a secure, transparent, and mature digital asset market. For exchanges worldwide, the message is unequivocal: compliance is a foundational business requirement, not an optional feature. As the regulatory framework solidifies, the industry’s long-term health will depend on its ability to integrate robust financial integrity measures seamlessly. FAQs Q1: What specifically did Korbit do wrong to receive the fine? The Financial Intelligence Unit found deficiencies in Korbit’s Anti-Money Laundering obligations during a 2024 inspection. While exact details are not fully public, typical violations include inadequate transaction monitoring, failures in customer due diligence, or delayed reporting of suspicious activities. Q2: How does this fine compare to other penalties in South Korea’s crypto sector? At 2.73 billion won ($1.98 million), it is a significant but not unprecedented penalty. It is a substantial administrative fine designed to be corrective. More severe actions can include business suspension orders or license revocations for repeated or severe failures. Q3: Will this affect Korbit users’ funds or ability to trade? No direct impact on user funds is expected. Korbit has paid the fine and continues normal operations. The action targets compliance processes, not the solvency or daily function of the exchange platform. Q4: What should other crypto exchanges learn from this event? Exchanges must prioritize investing in scalable, sophisticated AML compliance systems. They should conduct regular internal audits and ensure continuous staff training. Proactive engagement with regulators is also crucial to stay ahead of evolving requirements. Q5: Is South Korea’s regulatory approach stricter than other countries? South Korea is among the stricter jurisdictions, particularly regarding user protection and AML. Its real-name account system and early Travel Rule adoption set a high bar. However, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is similarly comprehensive, indicating a global trend toward stringent oversight.

Key Takeaways: Crypto YouTube viewership has fallen to its lowest level since early 2021, signaling sustained weakness. Analysts say the decline reflects bear-market conditions and is not driven by platform algorithms. Retail fatigue from poor returns, scams, and stronger performance in traditional assets has reduced interest in crypto-focused content. The slowdown follows a sharp pullback over the past three months, reversing what had been a steady recovery in crypto-focused online attention. Benjamin Cowen Flags Broad Decline in Crypto Social Media Engagement The trend was highlighted on Sunday by Benjamin Cowen , founder of ITC Crypto, who shared data showing a 30-day moving average of views across multiple crypto YouTube channels. Cowen noted that the decline is not limited to YouTube or driven by isolated algorithm changes, pointing to similar engagement drops on other platforms. Crypto commentator Tom Crown echoed that assessment, saying interest has “collapsed across all platforms” and has shown a clear local downturn since October. He added that crypto social engagement has effectively remained in a prolonged slump since 2021, never returning close to its previous highs. Other market observers described the current environment as consistent with bear-market behavior. Bitcoin investor Polaris XBT characterized the data as “bear market levels of social interest,” reinforcing the view that retail participants are largely sitting out the current market cycle. The lack of enthusiasm supports the idea that institutional players, rather than individual traders, have been driving recent price action. Content creators also pointed to fatigue among retail audiences. YouTube creator Jesus Martinez said that while his channel has grown since early 2022, none of his recent videos approached the reach seen during the 2021 peak. TikTok creator Cloud9 Markets suggested that repeated scams and pump-and-dump schemes tied to speculative altcoins have pushed many retail traders away, leaving audiences wary of crypto-related narratives. Marc Shawn Brown, head of social media at Cointelegraph, argued that many investors have shifted focus toward macro assets and commodities after a difficult year for crypto returns. He noted that several traditional assets outperformed Bitcoin in 2025, weakening the incentive for speculative participation. They’ve likely pivoted into precious metals / macro. Almost guaranteed. People want returns, not stories of when returns could come. 2025 was hard. -7% return for BTC and palladium, rhodium, cobalt, silver, gold all outperformed. — MSB Intel (@MSBIntel) January 11, 2026 Bitcoin Sentiment Stabilizes Near $90K as Ethereum Signals Remain Mixed Despite the drop in viewership, on-chain data suggests sentiment may be stabilizing. Analytics firm Santiment said Bitcoin-related sentiment has gradually improved, with the $90,000 price level seen as a key threshold for maintaining retail confidence. Sentiment around Ethereum, however, remains fragmented, showing no clear directional trend. Optimism among long-term bulls also remains strong. Venture capitalist Tim Draper reiterated this week that 2026 would be a breakout year , repeating his long-standing $250,000 Bitcoin price target. Meanwhile, Bitwise head of research Ryan Rasmussen has argued that Bitcoin will break its traditional four-year cycle in 2026 and push to new highs. Meanwhile, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt believes Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into global markets, reviving risk appetite after a prolonged period of tight financial conditions.

ADA price today reflects growing stability after a long correction, while ADA news around network upgrades is improving sentiment. With accumulation building and technical levels tightening, Cardano price prediction models are turning constructive. The key question now is simple. How high can ADA price realistically climb this year if momentum holds? ADA Price Today Reflects Stabilization, Not Weakness Cardano is slowly picking up as the altcoin market starts to stabilize. Recent network upgrades are also strengthening the long-term outlook for ADA. The finalization of the Ouroboros Linear Leios CIP marks a major technical step forward, improving throughput, scalability, and consensus efficiency. For many tracking Cardano news, this upgrade reinforces the idea that development progress is finally aligning with market recovery. On-chain activity supports that view. The data indicate that over 500 million ADA has been exchanged in the last 30 days. This is a strong indicator that usage is increasing as smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs activity continue to grow. This increase in volume is an indication of increased confidence in the ecosystem and not long-term speculation. As a result, ADA price today remains firmly within a long-term accumulation zone, even after years of downside pressure. From a technical angle, analysts note that Cardano’s price is consolidating after a deep multi-year correction. The structure on higher timeframes points to reduced selling pressure and steady demand around key support levels. Many now see this phase as preparation rather than exhaustion. If momentum builds and altcoins continue to recover, ADA price prediction models highlight a potential move back toward the $1.00–$1.20 range as an initial milestone. That zone is widely viewed as a pivot. A clean break could reopen the path to larger upside targets later in the cycle. While patience is still required, current Cardano price prediction discussions increasingly focus on a realistic 4x scenario if market conditions remain supportive. Remittix Gains Traction As Altcoins Begin To Recover While Cardano price debates focus on recovery zones and 4x upside scenarios, a growing group of investors is already positioning elsewhere. The logic is simple. If the market is rotating back toward utility, then payment-focused projects with live infrastructure stand to move first. That is where Remittix (RTX) enters the conversation. Remittix is not trying to replace Cardano or compete at the base-layer level. It operates one layer above, focused entirely on real-world payments. The project is building a full PayFi stack that allows crypto to move seamlessly into fiat, with direct bank settlements, transparent fees, and no multi-day delays. This is the kind of infrastructure users feel immediately, not years down the line. What is drawing attention now is execution. Remittix has already raised over $28.7 million, sold more than 697.8 million tokens, and launched a live wallet on the App Store. That progress matters in a market where many altcoins are still priced on promises. As traders assess the best crypto to buy now, delivery is becoming a key filter. Here is what separates Remittix from most early-stage projects: A working PayFi ecosystem designed for crypto-to-fiat payments at a global scale Full smart contract audit and team verification by CertiK Confirmed CEX listings, starting with BitMart, with LBank announced next Targeting the $19 trillion global payments market with immediate use cases Momentum has accelerated since Remittix crossed the $28M milestone and confirmed its first two exchange listings. On top of that, the referral program offers a 15% USDT reward paid directly through the dashboard, adding a viral growth layer without relying on hype. There is also a limited 200% bonus currently active, capped at five million tokens, with a significant portion already taken. With the crypto-to-fiat platform set to launch on February 9, 2026 , the timeline is clear and near-term. Cardano may still have room to run as altcoins recover. But for investors looking beyond charts and into usage, Remittix is positioning itself as the payments rail people actually use. That distinction is why it continues to show up on serious watchlists.

Much of the market’s recent strength comes from institutional demand returning. Bitcoin and Ether ETFs are seeing steady inflows. That helped stop the late-2025 sell-off and stabilise prices. Once that happened, traders became more willing to explore altcoins. Clearer regulation and easier liquidity conditions are also pushing the market forward. What Sectors Are Leading The Crypto Rally? Right now, institutional-linked assets and major smart contract platforms are leading the rally. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain core drivers, while large-cap altcoins like XRP and Solana are showing notable strength in early 2026.

Key Takeaways: A Cato Institute report finds that most US debanking cases are driven by direct or indirect government pressure. The study identifies government debanking as distinct from political, religious, or operational account closures. Crypto firms are among the most affected, with regulators using regulatory risk to discourage banks from serving the sector. The findings challenge a common narrative that account closures are primarily the result of political or religious bias on the part of banks. Cato Report Breaks Down Three Forms of Debanking in the US The report, published Thursday by Cato Institute analyst Nicholas Anthony, outlines several forms of debanking. These include political or religious debanking, where accounts are closed based on beliefs or affiliations; operational debanking, where a bank exits a customer relationship for business reasons; and government debanking, which occurs when authorities pressure banks to cut ties with certain clients. “While media and political narratives often attribute these closures to political or religious discrimination, this study finds that the majority of debanking cases stem from governmental pressure,” Anthony wrote. He added that public records show repeated instances of officials intervening in financial markets, either directly or indirectly, to influence how banks manage customer relationships. Crypto companies feature prominently in the report. Digital asset firms have long reported difficulties accessing banking services, fueling speculation that regulators have sought to curb the sector through informal pressure rather than explicit bans. Debanking can be a frustrating and nerve-racking experience. A sudden notice from the bank announces that you have 30 days to collect your money and find another bank. A new study by Cato’s @EconWithNick examines the growing phenomenon of debanking. … pic.twitter.com/mWQR1hNRd0 — Cato Institute (@CatoInstitute) January 8, 2026 Anthony argues that such actions are not isolated but part of a broader pattern. According to the report, government debanking typically takes two forms. Direct action includes formal letters or court orders instructing banks to terminate accounts. Indirect pressure is applied through regulation or legislation that makes certain clients too risky for banks to serve. Anthony cited actions by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which sent letters urging banks to pause crypto-related activities without providing clear timelines or follow-up, effectively forcing account closures. Debanking Debate Intensifies as JPMorgan Faces High-Profile Claims Debanking has also entered the public spotlight through high-profile disputes. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in December that the bank does not close accounts based on political or religious views, while acknowledging that pressure from both major US political parties has influenced banking decisions. Around the same time, Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, said JPMorgan shut down his personal accounts without explanation. Similar claims were made by executives at ShapeShift. Anthony said executive actions under Donald Trump and leadership changes at agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission have addressed some concerns but fall short of a lasting solution. He argues that Congress holds the key by reforming the Bank Secrecy Act, ending reputational risk regulation, and lifting confidentiality rules that shield government pressure from public scrutiny. “If Congress wants to reduce debanking, it must remove the tools that allow government agencies to quietly steer banks’ decisions,” Anthony said.

57091066,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260592,1768200911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BTC Perpetual Futures: The Revealing Edge Where Shorts Hold Slight Dominance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-perpetual-futures-shorts-edge-3/,"BitcoinWorld BTC Perpetual Futures: The Revealing Edge Where Shorts Hold Slight Dominance In the intricate world of cryptocurrency derivatives, a subtle but telling shift emerged on March 21, 2025, as aggregated data from leading exchanges revealed shorts gained a narrow yet persistent edge in Bitcoin perpetual futures markets, signaling nuanced trader sentiment beneath surface-level price action. Decoding the BTC Perpetual Futures Ratio Market analysts closely monitor the aggregate long/short ratio for Bitcoin perpetual futures as a critical sentiment gauge. Over the past 24 hours, this metric settled at 49.15% long positions versus 50.85% short positions across the top three exchanges by open interest. Consequently, this data point provides a window into institutional and retail trader expectations. Furthermore, perpetual futures contracts, unlike traditional futures, lack an expiry date, allowing traders to maintain positions indefinitely by paying a funding rate. This structure makes them particularly sensitive to immediate market sentiment. The breakdown by individual exchange offers deeper insight. For instance, Binance, the global volume leader, showed longs at 48.68% against shorts at 51.32%. Meanwhile, OKX displayed a nearly balanced but still short-leaning ratio of 49.79% long to 50.21% short. Similarly, Bybit recorded the narrowest gap, with longs at 49.98% and shorts at 50.02%. This consistent pattern across major platforms suggests a market-wide, albeit slight, caution among derivatives traders. The Mechanics and Meaning of Market Positioning Understanding this data requires knowledge of how perpetual futures function. These instruments allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price direction without owning the underlying asset. The funding rate mechanism ensures the contract price tracks the spot price. When shorts dominate, the funding rate typically turns negative, meaning short positions pay longs. This dynamic can create interesting market pressures. Open Interest: The total number of outstanding derivative contracts. Funding Rate: The periodic payment between long and short positions. Leverage: The ability to control a large position with a small capital outlay. Historically, a long/short ratio leaning toward shorts does not inherently predict a price drop. Instead, it often indicates a crowded trade. When too many participants lean one direction, a sudden price move against them can trigger liquidations, causing violent squeezes. Therefore, a slight short bias can sometimes precede a sharp upward move if buyers overwhelm the market. Expert Analysis on Derivative Sentiment Indicators Seasoned market observers interpret this data within a broader context. The current aggregate ratio of 49.15%/50.85% falls within a neutral range, far from extreme readings that signal panic or euphoria. For example, ratios below 40% long often coincide with fear and potential buying opportunities, while ratios above 60% long can indicate over-leveraged optimism. The present figures suggest a balanced yet cautious derivatives landscape. This sentiment aligns with several macroeconomic factors observed in early 2025. Central bank policy uncertainty, evolving regulatory frameworks for digital assets, and traditional market correlations all influence trader positioning. The data from Binance, OKX, and Bybit acts as a real-time poll of sophisticated market participants. Their collective slight preference for shorts may reflect hedging activities by large holders or anticipation of short-term volatility rather than a strong conviction for a sustained downtrend. Comparative Exchange Dynamics and Trader Behavior The minor variations between exchanges are noteworthy. Binance’s ratio shows the strongest short bias among the trio. This could stem from its diverse, global user base reacting to region-specific news. OKX and Bybit, with ratios much closer to parity, might reflect different user demographics or trading strategies. These platforms often attract more active, high-frequency traders. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio by Exchange (24-Hour Aggregate) Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Binance 48.68% 51.32% OKX 49.79% 50.21% Bybit 49.98% 50.02% Aggregate 49.15% 50.85% This data is most valuable when viewed as part of a trend. Is the short position growing or shrinking compared to yesterday or last week? A stable, slight short bias in a rising market can be a healthy sign, indicating skepticism that prevents bubbles. Conversely, increasing short positions in a falling market can signal accelerating pessimism. Continuous monitoring of these flows provides a clearer picture than any single snapshot. Conclusion The current state of BTC perpetual futures reveals a market in careful equilibrium, with shorts holding a slight but consistent edge across major trading venues. This 50.85% aggregate short positioning reflects measured caution rather than outright bearishness. For investors and traders, such derivatives data serves as a vital pulse check on market sentiment, complementing price charts and on-chain analytics. Ultimately, the narrow margin between longs and shorts underscores a waiting game, where the next major catalyst could tip the balance and define the next directional move for Bitcoin. FAQs Q1: What does a long/short ratio above 50% for shorts indicate? A high short percentage in perpetual futures suggests more traders are betting on or hedging against a price decrease. However, it is a contrarian indicator at extremes; overly crowded short positions can lead to a short squeeze if the price rises unexpectedly. Q2: How does the funding rate relate to the long/short ratio? When shorts dominate, the funding rate often turns negative. This means traders holding short positions pay a fee to those holding long positions, incentivizing balance. The rate helps keep the perpetual futures price anchored to the spot price. Q3: Why is open interest an important metric alongside the ratio? Open interest shows the total number of active contracts. A high open interest with a skewed ratio indicates strong conviction. Conversely, low open interest makes the ratio less significant, as it represents fewer total traders. Q4: Do these ratios predict Bitcoin’s spot price movement? Not directly. They measure sentiment in the derivatives market, which can influence spot prices through liquidations and hedging activity. They are one of many tools for analysis, not a standalone predictor. Q5: How often does this long/short data update? Major exchanges typically update aggregate long/short ratios in real-time or with minimal delay. The 24-hour aggregated figure provides a smoothed view that reduces noise from very short-term fluctuations.

This resilience comes at a time when Bitcoin remains the center of attention due to macro and geopolitical events, ranging from rising tensions in the Middle East to financial instability across emerging markets. Ethereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart The daily structure shows that ETH has broken out of its descending parallel channel, flipping the $3K zone into strong support. The price recently tapped into the major resistance zone between $3.3K–$3.7K but faced selling pressure, printing a few consecutive bearish candles. This zone overlaps with both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, creating a technical barrier that bulls must reclaim for continuation. Despite the rejection, the RSI remains in healthy territory, currently pulling back from overbought levels. A potential higher low near the $3K range could serve as a bullish springboard. The key daily trendline also remains intact, and if the price maintains structure above the $2.7K zone, the bullish outlook remains valid. But reclaiming the $3.5K resistance level is now crucial to invalidate the local top. ETH/USDT 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, ETH is consolidating just above the previous breakout zone around $3K, forming a potential base after its impulsive rally last week. The asset is respecting the $3K level, while the upper descending trendline capped the last move at around $3.3K. The current range between $3K–$3.1K is now acting as a mid-range value area and decision zone. If buyers can push through the $3.3K level, it opens the door for a retest of the $3.5K level and possibly a breakout toward $4K. However, if the price falls below $3K with volume, the market could revisit the lower boundary of the pattern near $2.9K and even the high-confluence demand area lower at $2.6K. So far, the structure still favors the buyers, but caution is warranted in the short term. Onchain Analysis Ethereum’s 30-day SMA of active addresses is trending higher again, following a significant dip in Q3–Q4 2025. Historically, rising address activity often precedes or coincides with sustainable price rallies, and the latest uptick is no exception. As of now, active addresses are hovering above 400K, mirroring levels seen during the last major uptrend. This bounce suggests improving network fundamentals, potentially driven by increased DeFi activity and restaking flows. If this on-chain momentum continues and active addresses increase even more, it would provide strong confirmation of sustained demand, reinforcing Ethereum’s medium-term bullish case.

He said contract signings slowed during the holidays, but insisted the deals were still in motion and would feed into near-term announcements around “bridges and more oracles and stablecoins and analytics,” as well as “more listings.” The core thesis of Hoskinson’s update was that Cardano can’t win a marginal arms race against other smart contract platforms, and instead needs differentiated features and distribution through interoperability. In his telling, the Pentad structure is meant to ensure Cardano “is no longer an island,” enabling liquidity and users to “flow freely,” and setting up what he called the “next stage after pentad phase one.” That next stage, Hoskinson said, should focus on upgrading Cardano’s most important applications to reach beyond the chain’s current boundaries. “I’m going to propose that we take the top 15 dabs top 20 dapps we got to figure out a list on Cardano and get them sons of ***** upgraded to Bitcoin DeFi , XRP DeFi and Midnight and also get them tier one listings, get them aboard, get them incubated, accelerated so we can 10x their TVL, their users and their transaction volume,” he said. He framed this as both an internal ecosystem support plan and a growth strategy built around bringing Cardano-native apps to where large pools of capital and users already sit. Hoskinson repeatedly returned to privacy, positioning it as the “new experiences” Cardano can ship rather than competing on incremental improvements. He argued that Cardano DeFi won’t be competitive “by being slightly better, slightly faster, slightly cheaper than Ethereum or Solana,” and said copycat strategies fail. “You beat those guys by doing something that no one’s ever seen before,” he said, before laying out the product concept in unusually direct terms. “And when you add privacy and get private stablecoins, that’s going to be sexy. Show private prediction markets, private DEXes, you’re bringing something new to the conversation. You’re bringing something new to the table, something that people haven’t seen before.” In Hoskinson’s framing, the pitch is not just privacy on Cardano, but portability of those capabilities across ecosystems once the bridge and stablecoin plumbing is in place, naming Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, XRP, BNB, and Avalanche as targets for that distribution. Happy New Year https://t.co/P3GXCCQdzV — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 10, 2026 2025 Frustration, 2026 Cadence Hoskinson also used the update to vent about industry expectations and what he called unmet promises from US policy narratives in 2025, arguing the sector needs to refocus on adoption and delivery rather than waiting for validation. He described 2026 as “our year,” and pointed to a schedule of near-term public-facing moments: workshops, a Japan tour, and Consensus Hong Kong where he said Cardano will show “some amazing announcements and special surprises.” He also previewed a more regimented output rhythm. “And then, the rest of the year, every two months, a bag of goodies comes. That’s the cadence,” Hoskinson said, characterizing it as a “death march” of shipping.

The figure, widely tracked for several Bitcoin cycle forecasts that later aligned with price action, outlined an aggressive outlook for 2026. Consequently, the post has reignited speculation across trading desks, private groups, and social platforms. The message frames the current market as a structural repeat rather than a new phenomenon. Hence, traders are assessing whether liquidity conditions and rotation patterns support another explosive cycle. Rotation Thesis Signals New Cycle Dynamics According to the post, Bitcoin could reach $200,000 during the next expansion phase. Additionally, Ethereum appears projected toward $10,000, while Solana carries a $1,000 target. The author describes these levels as mechanical outputs tied to liquidity behavior. Moreover, the post argues that liquidity has returned under alternative frameworks rather than traditional quantitative easing. This shift, the writer suggests, could extend risk appetite across crypto markets. Significantly, the thesis stresses that leadership rotates rather than moves together. Once large-cap assets mature, capital historically flows toward higher-risk segments. Consequently, memecoins enter focus during late-cycle momentum phases. The post lists PEPE at $0.0001, PENGU at $1, and FARTCOIN at $10. These projections follow prior cycles where speculative assets surged after majors stabilized. Hence, the message frames memecoin strength as a symptom rather than a cause. Solana Strength Aligns With Broader Narrative Source: CoinCodex Solana price action has added fuel to the discussion. SOL trades near $141 after gaining over 5% daily. Additionally, weekly gains almost 5%, lifting its market value above $80 billion. According to Santiment, SOL recently touched $144 while challenging resistance near $145. However, network growth metrics show moderation. Weekly new wallet creation fell from 30.2 million in November 2024 to 7.3 million recently. Hence, sustained upside may depend on renewed on-chain expansion. SOL Technical Structure Remains Constructive Market technicians continue to monitor short-term structure closely. According to Morecryptoonl, the $142 to $143 zone represents a key upside target within wave c of a broader corrective structure. Source: X Moreover, SOL defended support between $128 and $131, confirming higher lows. Consequently, the bullish structure remains intact. A decisive break above $143 could signal the start of an impulsive wave higher. Above that level, traders watch $148 and $156 as extension zones. However, rejection near resistance could invite temporary consolidation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 07:10:44

That’s according to a senior U.S. official who spoke with Reuters. Jacob Helberg, who’s the Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs in the Trump administration, said Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will be joining the Pax Silica initiative within days. Shifting from oil to technology It’s a big deal that these Middle Eastern nations are coming on board, given how much political division the region has seen over the years. What the U.S. is really doing here is trying to get Israel and the Arab Gulf states working together on technology and economic matters. Qatar’s signing the agreement on Jan. 12. The UAE will follow three days later on Jan. 15. The group’s already got Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Britain, and Australia as members. Pax Silica, sometimes called the Silicon Declaration, covers pretty much the whole technology supply network. That means everything from raw materials to sophisticated manufacturing, computer systems, and data storage. For the Trump administration, this is a key piece of their economic strategy, as they want to depend less on rival countries and build up cooperation with friendly ones. Helberg explained, “The Silicon Declaration isn’t just a diplomatic communiqué. It’s meant to be an operational document for a new economic security consensus.” This isn’t your typical alliance, according to Helberg. Pax Silica works as a “coalition of capabilities.” Countries join based on their industries’ capabilities and the companies they possess. Helberg hopes the program will help the Middle East move faster toward a different kind of economy. The region has relied on oil and gas money for a long time, but this could push things more toward technology . “F or the UAE and Qatar, this marks a shift from a hydrocarbon-centric security architecture to one focused on silicon statecraft,” he said. All this is happening while Saudi Arabia gets ready to host The Future Minerals Forum. It’s a government-run conference about minerals and supply networks that’ll bring together senior officials, business leaders, and investors in Riyadh from January 13–15. Future plans and strategic projects Helberg laid out what the group wants to do this year. They’ll be working on getting more members, putting together strategic projects for supply chain security, and getting their policies lined up to protect critical infrastructure and technology. The group met in Washington last month. Helberg said he’s expecting a few more meetings this year. There are ongoing talks about projects that could modernize trade and transportation routes. The India-Middle East-Europe Corridor is one example. It would utilize advanced American technology to boost regional connections and grow the U.S. economic presence. U.S. and Israeli officials are preparing to roll out a new Pax Silica Strategic Framework. It includes plans for “Fort Foundry One,” an industrial park in Israel designed to fast-track development, and talks on AI cooperation, with a possible memorandum of understanding as soon as January 16. T hat marks a shift from the Biden administration’s earlier Mineral Security Partnership, which Helberg described as more of a “buyers’ club” dominated by wealthy economies like Europe, Japan, and Canada. Six of the eight countries that participated—Australia, Britain, Japan, Israel, Singapore, and South Korea—signed the summit declaration. Th ere’s language in there about “non-market practices,” which is what Washington usually says when they’re criticizing Beijing. Japan and the United States signed their own separate agreement about how they’ll handle economic security together. Helberg mentioned that Pax Silica actually came out of talks between the two countries. Each country that’s participating brings something specific to the table, Berry noted. Japan’s got advanced machinery. The Netherlands has lithography machines that etch circuits on computer chips. There are some countries that aren’t included, which raises eyebrows. India didn’t get invited even though they’ve got artificial intelligence ambitions, and they’re becoming more important to global technology supply chains and U.S. strategy. Vietnam and New Zealand got left out, too. Berry thought it was surprising that New Zealand wasn’t included, especially since they’re part of Five Eyes intelligence sharing. Though he said it makes more sense when you look at it from a technology and trade angle. Vietnam not being there was more confusing to him. A lot of companies trying to move production out of China have picked Vietnam. Maybe they’re holding Vietnam back as something to use for negotiating later. “My sense with respect to Vietnam and India is that there’s perhaps a larger game being played … to try and counterbalance China’s growth,” Berry said.

XRP functions within that ecosystem as a bridge asset designed to facilitate transaction efficiency. Importantly, the ranking does not separate Ripple from a blockchain-only category. It includes the company directly within the broader payments industry, reinforcing its role as infrastructure rather than experiment. Ripple’s inclusion on this list indicates sustained participation in cross-border financial networks. Its presence also suggests continued integration with financial institutions and payment providers worldwide. XRP now has a global reach, and Ripple’s rapid expansion suggests it could grow even more in 2026. ChartNerd’s post brings attention to this recognition at a time when market narratives often focus on price movement rather than infrastructure development. The image highlights where Ripple stands operationally. For XRP, this connection reinforces its role in an established payments framework that prioritizes efficiency and reach.

57091668,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260596,1768202711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Binance listing expands market access with strategic LINK/USD1, PEPE/USD1, and USDC/MXN spot pairs",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-listing-link-pepe-usdc-pairs/,"BitcoinWorld Binance listing expands market access with strategic LINK/USD1, PEPE/USD1, and USDC/MXN spot pairs Global cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced a significant market expansion on January 13, 2025, revealing plans to list three new spot trading pairs that strategically bridge major digital assets with fiat and stablecoin markets. The LINK/USD1, PEPE/USD1, and USDC/MXN pairs will commence trading at precisely 8:00 a.m. UTC, marking another milestone in Binance’s ongoing mission to enhance market accessibility and liquidity across diverse cryptocurrency ecosystems. This strategic move arrives during a period of renewed institutional interest in digital assets, particularly as regulatory frameworks continue evolving worldwide. Binance listing strategy enhances market accessibility Binance consistently demonstrates market leadership through calculated listing decisions that address evolving trader needs. The exchange’s latest announcement introduces three distinct trading pairs, each serving specific market segments and geographical regions. LINK/USD1 provides direct access to Chainlink’s oracle network token against Binance’s USD-margined stablecoin, while PEPE/USD1 offers meme coin enthusiasts improved trading efficiency. Meanwhile, USDC/MXN creates a crucial bridge between Circle’s regulated stablecoin and Mexican peso markets, potentially facilitating smoother cross-border transactions throughout Latin America. Exchange listings typically generate immediate market impacts, including increased liquidity and trading volume for featured assets. Historical data from previous Binance listings shows an average 24-hour trading volume increase of 47% for newly listed assets during their debut week. Market analysts anticipate similar patterns for these three pairs, particularly given their strategic positioning across different cryptocurrency categories. The timing coincides with broader market trends favoring infrastructure tokens like Chainlink and regulated stablecoins like USDC. Understanding the strategic trading pairs Each new trading pair serves distinct market purposes and addresses specific trader requirements. LINK/USD1 connects Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network with stablecoin markets, potentially appealing to institutional investors seeking exposure to blockchain infrastructure without direct fiat volatility. PEPE/USD1 provides meme coin traders with direct stablecoin pairing, reducing reliance on Bitcoin or Ethereum intermediary trades. USDC/MXN represents a strategic geographical expansion, offering Mexican traders direct access to a fully-reserved digital dollar recognized by global regulatory bodies. The table below illustrates key characteristics of each new trading pair: Trading Pair Asset Type Primary Market Expected Impact LINK/USD1 Infrastructure Token Global Institutional Enhanced oracle network accessibility PEPE/USD1 Meme Coin Retail Trading Improved meme coin liquidity USDC/MXN Stablecoin/Fiat Latin American Cross-border transaction efficiency Market structure analysis reveals these listings address three growing cryptocurrency sectors simultaneously. Chainlink’s oracle network supports over 2,000 decentralized applications across 15 blockchain networks, creating substantial demand for efficient LINK trading options. Meanwhile, meme coins continue capturing significant retail attention, with PEPE maintaining consistent trading volumes despite market fluctuations. The USDC/MXN pairing arrives as remittance flows to Mexico approach record levels, potentially offering cost-effective alternatives to traditional transfer methods. Market implications and expert perspectives Cryptocurrency market analysts emphasize the strategic timing of these listings. Maria Rodriguez, senior blockchain analyst at Digital Asset Research, notes, “Binance’s simultaneous introduction of infrastructure, meme, and stablecoin pairings demonstrates sophisticated market segmentation. Particularly noteworthy is the USDC/MXN pairing, which acknowledges Mexico’s growing cryptocurrency adoption while providing regulatory clarity through a fully-transparent stablecoin.” Her analysis aligns with recent adoption statistics showing Mexico’s cryptocurrency user base expanding 28% annually since 2023. Technical considerations for traders include understanding margin requirements and liquidity profiles for each new pair. Historical volatility patterns differ significantly between LINK’s infrastructure token characteristics and PEPE’s meme coin dynamics. Consequently, risk management strategies should adapt accordingly. The USD1 stablecoin backing two pairs offers price stability benefits, potentially reducing slippage during high-volume trading periods. Meanwhile, USDC’s monthly attestation reports provide transparency advantages for Mexican traders navigating evolving regulatory environments. Regulatory context and compliance considerations Binance’s listing decisions increasingly reflect regulatory compliance priorities alongside market demand. The exchange’s selection of USDC—a regulated, fully-reserved stablecoin—for Mexican peso pairing demonstrates this alignment. USDC issuer Circle maintains licenses across multiple jurisdictions and publishes monthly reserve attestations from independent accounting firms. This regulatory transparency potentially reduces compliance concerns for Mexican financial institutions exploring cryptocurrency integrations. Global regulatory trends increasingly favor transparent stablecoins over algorithmic alternatives, making USDC listings strategically prudent. Mexico’s cryptocurrency regulations continue evolving, with recent proposals suggesting stricter oversight of exchange operations. Binance’s proactive listing of regulated assets may position the exchange favorably within these developing frameworks. Similarly, Chainlink’s infrastructure token faces fewer regulatory uncertainties than many cryptocurrency categories, potentially appealing to compliance-conscious institutional investors. Key compliance aspects of the new listings include: Regulatory alignment: USDC’s transparent reserves meet emerging global standards Geographical targeting: MXN pairing addresses specific regional demand Risk categorization: Infrastructure and stablecoin pairs typically face fewer restrictions Transparency requirements: All listed assets maintain public documentation Conclusion Binance’s strategic listing of LINK/USD1, PEPE/USD1, and USDC/MXN spot trading pairs demonstrates the exchange’s sophisticated market segmentation approach and commitment to global accessibility. These additions address diverse trader needs across institutional infrastructure investment, retail meme coin trading, and cross-border stablecoin transactions. The January 13, 2025 launch timing coincides with broader cryptocurrency market maturation, particularly regarding regulatory compliance and geographical expansion. As digital asset markets continue evolving, Binance’s calculated pair introductions will likely influence trading patterns, liquidity distribution, and regional adoption rates worldwide. FAQs Q1: What time exactly do the new Binance trading pairs launch? The LINK/USD1, PEPE/USD1, and USDC/MXN spot trading pairs will commence trading at precisely 8:00 a.m. UTC on January 13, 2025. Q2: Why is the USDC/MXN pairing significant for Mexican traders? This pairing provides direct access to a regulated, transparent stablecoin for Mexican peso holders, potentially reducing cross-border transaction costs and improving access to global cryptocurrency markets. Q3: How might these listings affect the prices of LINK and PEPE? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, historical Binance listings typically increase trading volume and liquidity, which can reduce volatility and potentially influence short-term price discovery. Q4: What is USD1 and how does it differ from other stablecoins? USD1 is Binance’s USD-margined stablecoin designed for trading pairs on their platform, offering price stability against the US dollar for trading efficiency. Q5: Are there any trading fee promotions for these new pairs? Binance occasionally offers promotional trading fees for new listings, but traders should consult the exchange’s official announcements page for current details regarding these specific pairs.

The investors need not wait till the real users come. They place an early position and leave the price to fluctuate when the demand is visible. This trend has been witnessed in most of the biggest DeFi waves. The tokens are frequently repriced before the cash flows. Not after. A number of crypto analysts think that there is a new cryptocurrency project in the same stage of anticipation. The currently under discussion project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The token has risen by over 300% in this year and it currently stands below the mark of $1. The protocol launch is near and the utility expectations are increasing. The Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Preparing Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending platform that is being constructed. The users will be able to put money in assets to generate yield. Borrowers will have the option of posting collateral and obtaining credit. When the demand for borrowing and the availability of collateral liquidity are high, lending markets are likely to expand rapidly. This generates protocol level volume and utilization. These functions will be activated as part of V1 protocol launch at Mutuum Finance. V1 will facilitate the generation of yields, collateral borrowing and liquidation logic. Analysts point out that lending platforms are useful due to the reason that they facilitate real money flow and not speculation. Deposits produce yield. Interest payments are generated by borrowers. Liquidations generate second-hand revenue. Markets are highly time sensitive. Prior to being activated, tokens are based on idea value and roadmap credibility. After activation, the tokens are transferred to execution value in accordance with usage data. MUTM is nearing the stage of the crypto cycle where the expectations begin to change into implementation rather than inspiring. This is the time when tokens tend to undergo premature repricing. Analysts feel that this window is currently open. Time-alignment with Utility The supply and pricing phases have grown to be an interest area as the anticipation advances on the launching period. MUTM is selling in presale and is currently priced at close to $0.04 which is approximately 300% higher than the initial $0.01 starting point back in the early 2025. The token is currently at Phase 7 in which the allocation has progressively decreased as new entrants come in. The distribution is organised in fixed-price phases. The stages have a small number of tokens and increased set price. When the allocation of a particular stage sells out the sale proceeds to the next level. To date over 825 million MUTM are sold of the 45.5% presale supply allocation and the sale has brought in over $19.7 million dollars of more than 18,800 holders. To the viewer of behavior, this trend indicates the build-up as opposed to brief peaks. Because the remaining supply becomes less, the focus has been on the number of stages that are left before the launch pricing becomes effective. Revenue Flow and Demand Mutuum Finance is also going to issue depositors with the mtTokens. The mtTokens presented by the latter are positions within the liquidity pools and yield to the growth in the borrowing demands. As borrowers receive interest, they go to holders of mtTokens. This brings in protocol-based revenue as opposed to attention-based momentum. The protocol also intends to use its buy and distribute system. Part of the revenue earned in lending will be utilized to buy MUTM in the open market. The purchased tokens are then reallocated to the users who are staking the mtTokens in the safety module. Holders have been attracted to this difference as they concentrate on longer time horizons. According to some analyst models, after V1 is activated and the buy-and-distribute engine will start powering, MUTM could be able to make trades between the $0.20 and $0.30 range in the first year of its operations. At the present level of $0.04, that would be an increase in the order of 500% to 650%. A Pre-Utility Window Mutuum Finance is yet to enter into a utility window. The protocol went through security audits at Halborn , and it is also in the course of more smart contract audits. Leaderboard data indicates that there is more wallet activity and bigger whale account entries. It also supports card payments in the project, which broadens onboarding to users not necessarily native to cryptocurrencies. Analysts define this point as the time before utilities pricing sets in, before revenue sets in. Bring on supplies in time before it is needed. A protocol launch will subsequently switch the token to the next pricing phase that is propelled by the level of borrowing, deposit acquisition and distribution of yields. Provided that Mutuum Finance launches V1 and implements lending mechanics at the next cycle, analysts are sure that the token cannot stay below the one dollar level, which may not last too long. In the meantime, this is considered by the buyers as a last pre-utility step before wider repricing takes place.

From 2023 to 2025, new sectors like AI, robotics, and electric vehicles added only 0.8 percentage points to China’s economic output, while real estate and other traditional industries fell by a combined 6 percentage points, according to the report. Beijing is pushing this tech strategy as it tries to limit its reliance on foreign suppliers after U.S. restrictions. A new five‑year development plan, expected to fully roll out in March, focuses on advanced technologies through state funding and policy support. At the same time, China has kept its annual GDP growth target near 5%, a level that now looks harder to reach. Tech investment targets fall short of what growth math demands Rhodium said new industries would need to grow seven times larger over the next five years to deliver the roughly 2 percentage points of annual investment growth needed to hit that GDP target. That requirement translates into 2.8 trillion yuan in fresh investment this year alone. That amount is about 120% more than investment levels in 2025. The report said spending on AI and robotics could rise over the next year or two, but most emerging industries are unlikely to keep that pace. The scale needed is simply too large. The imbalance looks similar to what is happening in the United States, where AI‑linked companies have driven stock market gains while other parts of the economy lag behind. Zhang Jianping, a deputy director at China’s Commerce Ministry, said last week that policies are meant to support innovation over several years. After his first mention, Zhang said traditional sectors like steel and real estate must bring in new technology to stay competitive. “The policies support innovation over multiple years,” Zhang reportedly said. The report warned that leaning too hard on tech comes with costs. New industrial sectors often pay higher wages, but they employ far fewer people than traditional industries. According to Rhodium, this matters in an economy where jobs still anchor social stability. Job losses and export dependence raise trade risk Factory automation is already rising, and China holds about 30% of global manufacturing output. Combined, those trends could lead to the loss of up to 100 million jobs over the next decade, according to KKR. That figure would exceed the total workforce of most developed economies. Labor data already shows pressure. China’s urban unemployment rate stayed above 5% for much of last year. Youth unemployment ran at roughly three times that level. With domestic demand weak, Rhodium said internal investment will not be enough to absorb production. “Beijing will become even more dependent upon gaining market share in export markets,” the report said. It added that China will be more reliant on exports, leaving the economy exposed to new trade restrictions. Those restrictions are arriving fast. As lower‑priced Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, have expanded overseas, Mexico and the European Union have joined the United States in raising tariffs on imports from China. Some analysts still see limited support from policy tools. China’s trade‑in program, extended in late December, expanded subsidies to AI glasses and some smart home products, while narrowing the list of eligible appliances. “The trade‑in program favors white goods,” HSBC analysts said last Thursday.

H100 Acquisition of Future Holdings: Strategic Bitcoin Expansion H100 confirmed the acquisition through a formal letter of intent signed with Future Holdings’ shareholders. The Swedish firm plans to acquire 100% of the Swiss company’s shares. This transaction represents a calculated strategic move rather than a simple corporate purchase. H100 has been systematically accumulating Bitcoin as part of its long-term treasury strategy. Consequently, the acquisition provides immediate access to specialized institutional Bitcoin management expertise. The announcement comes during a period of increasing institutional adoption of digital assets. Traditional corporations across multiple sectors now recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a treasury reserve asset. H100’s move follows similar strategic investments by major technology and financial firms globally. The acquisition specifically targets Future Holdings’ established client base and regulatory framework within Switzerland’s sophisticated financial ecosystem. Swiss BTC Asset Management Landscape Switzerland has emerged as a global hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. The country’s regulatory clarity and financial infrastructure attract institutional investors. Future Holdings operates within this favorable environment, managing Bitcoin assets for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. The firm’s compliance with Swiss financial regulations provides H100 with immediate regulatory standing. Swiss financial authorities have developed comprehensive frameworks for digital asset management. These frameworks ensure investor protection while fostering innovation. Future Holdings benefits from this progressive regulatory approach. The company’s operations align with Switzerland’s reputation for financial stability and security. This acquisition therefore provides H100 with both operational capabilities and regulatory credibility. Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Trends Corporate Bitcoin adoption has accelerated significantly since 2020. Major public companies now allocate portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. This trend reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Institutional investors seek exposure through regulated custodians and asset managers. Future Holdings represents precisely this type of regulated institutional gateway. The following table illustrates recent corporate Bitcoin acquisitions: Company Bitcoin Holdings Announcement Year MicroStrategy Approx. 190,000 BTC 2020-2024 Tesla Approx. 10,500 BTC 2021 Block (Square) Approx. 8,027 BTC 2020-2021 H100 (pre-acquisition) Undisclosed strategic accumulation 2023-2024 This corporate adoption trend demonstrates Bitcoin’s evolving role in corporate finance. Companies now view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. The digital asset’s finite supply contrasts with expanding fiat currency supplies. Institutional-grade custody solutions have matured significantly. Regulatory frameworks continue to develop across major financial jurisdictions. Health Technology Meets Digital Asset Management H100’s core business focuses on health technology solutions. The company develops innovative medical devices and digital health platforms. This acquisition represents a strategic diversification beyond traditional healthcare markets. The move aligns with broader corporate trends of technological convergence. Companies increasingly integrate financial technology with their core operations. The strategic rationale involves several key factors: Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin provides non-correlated asset exposure Technological Synergy: Blockchain expertise complements health tech innovation Revenue Stream Expansion: Asset management generates recurring fees Strategic Positioning: Early mover advantage in institutional crypto space Health technology companies typically maintain substantial cash reserves for research and development. These reserves traditionally sit in low-yield instruments. Bitcoin allocation offers potential appreciation opportunities. The acquisition provides immediate expertise in managing these digital assets professionally. Future Holdings’ Established Track Record Future Holdings has operated in Switzerland since 2018. The firm specializes exclusively in Bitcoin asset management. Their services include custody solutions, portfolio management, and strategic allocation advice. The company serves European institutional clients primarily. Their investment philosophy emphasizes long-term Bitcoin holding strategies. The Swiss firm has navigated multiple market cycles successfully. Their risk management protocols have protected client assets during volatility periods. Future Holdings maintains relationships with regulated custodians and exchanges. These relationships ensure secure asset storage and efficient transaction execution. The company’s operational infrastructure will integrate with H100’s existing financial systems. Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Framework Cross-border acquisitions involving financial services require careful regulatory navigation. Switzerland and Sweden maintain robust financial regulatory systems. Both countries participate in European financial cooperation agreements. The acquisition must receive approval from relevant regulatory authorities in both jurisdictions. Swiss financial regulators have established clear guidelines for cryptocurrency asset managers. Future Holdings operates under these comprehensive regulations. The firm maintains necessary licenses and compliance certifications. H100 will inherit these regulatory permissions through the acquisition. This regulatory standing provides immediate operational capability without lengthy application processes. European Union regulations continue evolving for cryptocurrency markets. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework establishes harmonized rules across member states. Switzerland, while not an EU member, often aligns its regulations with European standards. This alignment ensures Future Holdings can serve clients across European markets efficiently. Strategic Implications for European Crypto Markets This acquisition signals increasing institutional interest in European cryptocurrency markets. Traditional corporations now recognize strategic value in crypto asset management firms. The transaction may inspire similar moves by other European companies. Cross-sector acquisitions could accelerate institutional adoption across the continent. The European cryptocurrency ecosystem continues maturing rapidly. Institutional-grade service providers have emerged across custody, trading, and asset management. Regulatory clarity has improved significantly in key jurisdictions. These developments create favorable conditions for corporate involvement. H100’s move demonstrates confidence in this evolving landscape. Sweden has emerged as a European leader in financial technology innovation. The country’s cashless society and digital infrastructure support cryptocurrency adoption. Swedish regulators have taken progressive approaches to digital asset oversight. H100’s acquisition aligns with Sweden’s technological advancement priorities. Market Impact and Industry Response Industry analysts view this acquisition positively. The transaction validates institutional Bitcoin adoption trends. Market observers note increasing corporate interest in cryptocurrency infrastructure investments. Similar acquisitions may follow as traditional companies seek crypto expertise. The announcement coincides with growing institutional Bitcoin investment. Major financial institutions now offer Bitcoin-related products and services. Traditional asset managers have launched cryptocurrency investment vehicles. This institutional participation lends credibility to the broader digital asset ecosystem. H100’s move represents another step in this institutionalization process. Conclusion H100’s acquisition of Future Holdings represents a strategic expansion into institutional Bitcoin asset management. The transaction provides immediate expertise and regulatory standing in Switzerland’s sophisticated financial ecosystem. This move reflects broader trends of corporate Bitcoin adoption and institutional cryptocurrency investment. The acquisition demonstrates growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition among traditional corporations. H100’s strategic positioning through this Future Holdings acquisition may inspire similar moves across European markets as institutional cryptocurrency adoption continues accelerating. FAQs Q1: What does H100’s acquisition of Future Holdings involve?

The nation is coming up with new guidelines that permit listed companies and professional investors to trade crypto. Per a local media report , the ‘Virtual Currency Trading Guidelines for Listed Corporations’ allows companies to trade crypto. If implemented, corporate participants can invest up to 5% of their equity capital in top 20 cryptos by market cap on South Korea’s five major exchanges. The move marks the third and final phase of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) plan in granting corporations access to crypto trading. The regulator rolled out the three-phase approach in February 2025. The final phase is expected to see approximately 3,500 entities gaining market access, once the rule takes effort. Additionally, discussions are still underway on whether to include dollar-pegged stablecoins, such as Tether’s USDT , in the permitted investment. Nine-Year Ban Ends – Corporate Crypto Investment Legalized South Korea’s financial watchdog, FSC, restricted corporations and banks from trading crypto due to government regulations that were put in force in 2017. At the time, the ban was put in place to alleviate “overheated speculation” and address money laundering concerns. However, in response to the upsurge in global participation in the market, the FSC has lifted the ban. Considering risks associated with large-scale crypto investments, authorities have set the annual deposit limit at 5%of equity capital. Further, the government has decided to establish standards for orders exceeding a particular price range on crypto exchanges. These standards aim to mitigate market risks stemming from increased liquidity. 5% Investment Cap is “Excessive”: Market Participants Argue Financial industry insiders have expressed concerns that the 5% investment cap for corporate crypto investors seems excessively conservative. They noted that the US, Japan, and the EU impose no limits on corporate crypto holdings. “Investment limits, which do not exist overseas, could weaken the inflow of funds and prevent the emergence of specialized virtual currency investment companies,” one market watcher noted. Besides, with a foundation for long-term investment in place, the launch of won-denominated stablecoins and Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is expected to accelerate, industry insiders expressed. Seoul has taken steps to become a world crypto hub and has spent much of 2025 embracing cryptocurrencies at an unparalleled pace. For instance, in September, the nation’s ruling party, Democratic Party (DP), launched a new crypto policy-making task force in a move to “foster growth” in crypto innovation.

The post focused on institutional adoption, on-chain cash movement, and Ripple’s expanding role inside regulated financial systems. X Finance Bull presented the development as a structural shift. He linked the announcement directly to XRP, the XRP Ledger, and RLUSD as core infrastructure components . Large institutions are now moving cash on-chain, and XRP is part of the process. BOOM! THIS IS BULLISH FOR $XRP The oldest bank in America is moving cash on-chain and remember they picked Ripple to help do it RLUSD custody. Tokenized flows. Institutional rails XRP, XRP Ledger and RLUSD are part of the infrastructure layer T R I L L I O N S pic.twitter.com/lIZxruxgQW — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 10, 2026 BNY Mellon Pushes Deposits On-Chain Ripple confirmed that its partner BNY Mellon launched tokenized deposit services for institutional clients. Ripple added that the service brings “the promise of digital assets directly into the banking system,” with Ripple Prime acting as an early adopter. BNY Mellon described the product as an on-chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its Digital Assets platform. The bank positioned the launch as an expansion of its digital cash capabilities. The announcement focused on programmability and institutional use cases. Ripple also confirmed that BNY Mellon serves as the primary reserve custodian of RLUSD . That detail tied custody, compliance, and on-chain settlement into the same system. Ripple described the collaboration as an effort to bridge traditional and digital markets. Ripple’s Role in Institutional Rails X Finance Bull connected the announcement directly to the XRP infrastructure. The post stated, “The oldest bank in America is moving cash on-chain, and remember, they picked Ripple to help do it.” He emphasized custody, tokenized flows, and institutional rails as the key takeaway. He noted that XRP, the XRP Ledger, and RLUSD are part of the infrastructure layer, placing the asset and its system within usable payment and settlement plumbing rather than another speculative system. It aligned with Ripple’s long-term strategy of targeting banks, asset managers, and large financial institutions. Ripple Prime’s role as an early adopter added another layer. The service targets institutional execution and custody. Its involvement placed Ripple’s enterprise stack inside the tokenized deposit rollout from day one. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why XRP Holders Are Paying Attention X Finance Bull closed the post with a single word. “TRILLIONS.” The emphasis reflected the scale of bank deposits and institutional cash flows. Tokenized deposits differ from stablecoins. They represent bank liabilities on-chain. For XRP holders, the significance lies in the access it provides. Ripple already operates within regulated banking environments, XRP already supports tokenization, and RLUSD already integrates with enterprise custody. The announcement showcased those components operating alongside one of the largest custodial banks in the world, bringing trillions into the crypto ecosystem .

The chart matters, but the real story is where whale size is going as market mood flips from fear to opportunity. DOGE trades around $0.1398 today, while Bitcoin sits close to $91,000, and Ethereum is around $3,110. That mix usually brings rotation, not blind holding. When DOGE whales start moving hundreds of millions of tokens, it often means positioning for the next catalyst, not panic. This is where the smart money question gets sharp, because the best moves happen before the crowd notices. DOGE Whale Moves Hint At Positioning, Not Panic DOGE whales have been pushing serious size on the chain, including a transfer of 469,574,570 DOGE worth about $70,479,248 on January 6, 2026. A separate report flagged another major move around 446,000,000 DOGE worth roughly $65,319,417 during the first 2026 dip. Moves like these do not automatically mean a sell-off. More often, they signal wallets reorganizing, preparing liquidity, and shifting exposure before the next narrative takes over. That matters because DOGE is still a high beta sentiment coin. When macro nerves rise or the market chops, money often rotates from memes into assets with clearer catalysts and stronger earnings angles. DOGE can still pump on sentiment, but it does not pay you to hold it, and it does not come with a fixed launch catalyst. That is why whales diversify into coins that look like an early-stage crypto investment with a real trigger point, not just a meme cycle. When capital is hunting a high-growth crypto setup, it usually follows tight windows, product proof, and a reason to buy before the next wave hits. Remittix Adds A Clear Catalyst Into The Mix Remittix keeps showing up in these whale diversification conversations because it is built like a timing trade with a real product behind it. The project has confirmed its crypto-to-fiat PayFi platform goes live on February 9, 2026 , framing that date as the moment the ecosystem becomes fully usable. Even better for credibility, the Remittix wallet is already live on the Apple App Store. That combination is exactly what whales want when the market is shifting: proof first, then catalyst. The entry window is also shrinking. RTX is currently priced at $0.119, with over $28.7 million raised so far and more than 697 million tokens sold. Reporting also points to over 40,000 investors acquiring RTX in recent months, which is often what a breakout curve looks like before the crowd catches up. If you are looking for an undervalued crypto project that still has room to run, this is why Remittix is being treated like a serious next 100x crypto candidate instead of another short-term hype play. Security optics matter too, especially when whales move in size. Remittix has pushed hard on trust, with the team fully verified through CertiK and the project highlighted at the top of CertiK’s rankings for pre-launch tokens. That is the kind of signal that pulls larger capital, because it reduces the risk premium that usually kills early momentum. To push urgency further, Remittix is using a limited bonus mechanic. The current promotion offers a 200% bonus tied to code RTX2026, with only 5 million tokens allocated, and reports indicated 25% of that allocation was bought in the first 24 hours. That is exactly how scarcity trades are built, and whales understand it. Why buyers are treating Remittix like the best crypto to buy now Remittix is a DeFi project built around a real crypto-to-fiat utility, so demand is not limited to memes and market mood. The wallet is already live on the Apple App Store, so buyers can point to product proof instead of waiting on promises. The February 9, 2026, platform launch creates a hard catalyst that fits whale-style timing trades. The CertiK verification and top pre-launch ranking help Remittix stand out as the best DeFi altcoin candidate for risk-aware capital. If you want the simplest “smart money” read, it is this: Dogecoin whales chase momentum, but they chase timing even more. Remittix is offering timing, product proof, and a shrinking entry window in one package, which is why it keeps pulling capital away from pure sentiment coins. If you are trying to buy before the market reprices the narrative, this is where the spotlight is moving. Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix FAQs 1) Is Remittix a good early-stage crypto investment right now? Remittix is being treated like an early-stage crypto investment because it has a live wallet, a fixed platform launch on February 9, 2026, and clear traction at a $0.119 entry level. That mix is why many buyers call it the best crypto to buy now when whales rotate out of DOGE-style sentiment trades. 2) Why do DOGE whales diversify into a DeFi project instead of holding DOGE? DOGE whales often diversify when they want catalysts and utility that can hold attention beyond a meme cycle. A DeFi project with product proof and a launch date can look like the next big altcoin in a 2025-style setup, even in early 2026, because it gives whales a reason to position before the crowd. 3) How can buyers buy RTX tokens, and what does “centralized exchanges” have to do with it? Buyers typically buy RTX tokens through the official Remittix channel, then watch for liquidity events tied to centralized exchanges. Remittix has already linked milestones to exchange progress, which is one reason whales treat it as a high-growth crypto play rather than a slow hold.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-12 07:43:00
57092271,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260601,1768204511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Binance Listing U Token: Strategic Expansion Brings New Trading Opportunities to Global Crypto Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-listing-u-token-trading/,"BitcoinWorld Binance Listing U Token: Strategic Expansion Brings New Trading Opportunities to Global Crypto Markets Global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced a significant market expansion, revealing plans to list the U token with both USDT and USDC trading pairs starting January 13, 2025, at precisely 8:00 a.m. UTC, marking another strategic move in the evolving digital asset landscape that continues to reshape global finance. Binance Announces U Token Listing Details Binance confirmed the U token listing through official channels on January 10, 2025. The exchange will introduce two separate trading pairs simultaneously: U/USDT and U/USDC. This dual-pair approach provides traders with immediate flexibility and liquidity options from the listing’s inception. The announcement follows Binance’s established listing protocol, which typically includes thorough technical reviews and security assessments. Consequently, the exchange has scheduled deposit functionality to open approximately 24 hours before trading commences. This timing allows users to prepare their positions adequately. The trading launch will follow the standard Binance spot trading rules and fee structure that applies to all listed assets. Understanding the U Token’s Market Context The U token enters a cryptocurrency market that has matured significantly since 2020. Currently, the global digital asset market capitalization exceeds $2.5 trillion according to recent industry reports. Stablecoin trading pairs like USDT and USDC now dominate spot trading volumes across major exchanges. In fact, these dollar-pegged tokens facilitate approximately 75% of all cryptocurrency trades. The U token’s simultaneous listing with both major stablecoins represents a strategic decision. This approach maximizes accessibility for different trader segments who prefer specific stablecoin ecosystems. Furthermore, it positions the token for immediate liquidity across the two most popular trading corridors in cryptocurrency markets today. Exchange Listing Impact on Token Valuation Historical data from previous Binance listings reveals consistent patterns. Tokens typically experience increased trading volume and price discovery phases following major exchange listings. A 2024 study by CryptoCompare analyzed 50 exchange listings. It found that tokens gained an average of 23% in trading volume during their first week on major platforms. However, the research also emphasized that sustainable value depends on underlying utility and adoption. The U token’s long-term performance will likely correlate with its technological fundamentals and real-world applications. Market analysts generally agree that exchange listings serve as catalysts rather than determinants of ultimate success. Technical Implementation and Trading Mechanics Binance will implement the U token listing through its robust technical infrastructure. The exchange handles approximately 1.4 million transactions per second at peak capacity. This technical capability ensures smooth trading experiences even during high-volatility events. The listing process involves multiple coordinated steps: Wallet Integration: Secure wallet support for U token deposits and withdrawals Order Book Initialization: Setting up the U/USDT and U/USDC trading pairs Liquidity Provision: Ensuring adequate market maker participation Security Protocols: Implementing fraud detection and risk management systems Traders should note that Binance typically enforces standard trading rules for new listings. These include minimum order sizes and standard trading fees. The exchange may also implement price limits during the initial trading period to prevent extreme volatility. Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Framework The U token listing occurs within an increasingly regulated global cryptocurrency environment. Since 2023, major jurisdictions have implemented clearer digital asset frameworks. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation took full effect in 2024. Similarly, the United States has advanced its regulatory approach through multiple agency actions. Binance maintains compliance teams that review all listings against applicable regulations. The exchange typically verifies several key aspects before listing any token: Compliance Area Verification Elements Legal Status Token classification under relevant jurisdictions AML/KYC Anti-money laundering and know-your-customer compliance Security Standards Smart contract audits and security protocols Transparency Team identification and project documentation This comprehensive review process helps ensure that listed tokens meet industry standards and regulatory expectations. Market Impact and Trader Implications The U token listing creates several immediate implications for cryptocurrency traders and investors. First, it provides direct access to a previously unavailable asset through one of the world’s largest exchanges. Second, the dual stablecoin pairing offers hedging opportunities against stablecoin-specific risks. Third, increased visibility typically leads to improved price discovery mechanisms. Historical data suggests that Binance listings correlate with increased social media discussion and analyst coverage. This attention can benefit both the token and the broader ecosystem. However, traders should approach new listings with appropriate risk management strategies. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, especially during initial listing periods. Liquidity Considerations and Trading Strategies Professional traders often develop specific strategies for new exchange listings. These approaches typically consider liquidity patterns during the initial trading hours. The simultaneous availability of USDT and USDC pairs creates unique arbitrage opportunities. Savvy traders might monitor price discrepancies between the two pairs during early trading. Additionally, the listing timing at 8:00 a.m. UTC positions the launch during overlapping trading sessions. This timing captures attention from Asian, European, and early North American market participants. Consequently, the initial trading period often features elevated volume and volatility patterns that differ from established assets. Broader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Implications Binance’s decision to list the U token reflects broader trends in cryptocurrency market development. The exchange has listed over 350 tokens since its founding, creating one of the most diverse digital asset marketplaces. Each listing contributes to the overall liquidity and sophistication of global cryptocurrency markets. The U token’s introduction continues this expansion trajectory. Moreover, the listing demonstrates the ongoing maturation of token evaluation processes. Exchanges now employ increasingly sophisticated criteria for listing decisions. These criteria typically extend beyond technical considerations to include community support, development activity, and real-world utility assessments. Conclusion Binance’s listing of the U token with USDT and USDC trading pairs represents a significant development in cryptocurrency market accessibility. The January 13, 2025 launch provides global traders with new opportunities while expanding the exchange’s digital asset offerings. This Binance listing U initiative follows established protocols that prioritize security, compliance, and market stability. As cryptocurrency markets continue evolving, such listings contribute to the overall maturation and institutional adoption of digital assets. The U token’s performance will ultimately depend on its underlying technology and real-world applications, but its Binance listing provides immediate visibility and trading infrastructure that can support its market journey. FAQs Q1: What exact time will Binance list the U token? The U token trading will commence precisely at 8:00 a.m. UTC on January 13, 2025, with both U/USDT and U/USDC pairs available simultaneously. Q2: Why is Binance listing the token with two different stablecoin pairs? Binance typically lists tokens with multiple stablecoin pairs to provide trading flexibility, enhance liquidity, and accommodate trader preferences for different stablecoin ecosystems. Q3: What should traders do to prepare for the U token listing? Traders should ensure their Binance accounts are verified, consider depositing funds in advance, review trading fees and rules, and develop appropriate risk management strategies for new asset volatility. Q4: How does this listing compare to previous Binance token introductions? This listing follows Binance’s standard protocol for new assets, including security reviews, compliance checks, and coordinated technical implementation similar to previous token listings.

Key Takeaways: More than 11.6 million crypto projects failed in 2025, with meme coins hit hardest. An October market crash accelerated failures, wiping out 7.7 million tokens in Q4. Low-barrier launchpads flooded the market, magnifying losses as sentiment turned. More than 11.6 million crypto projects failed in 2025, marking the highest annual total on record and underscoring the fragility of speculative tokens during periods of market stress. The sharpest losses came in the final quarter of the year. 7.7M Tokens Went Dark in Q4 After October Market Crash According to a report released Friday by CoinGecko research analyst Shaun Paul Lee, roughly 7.7 million tokens listed on GeckoTerminal stopped trading between October and December. Lee pointed to the Oct. 10 market crash , when more than $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated in a single day, as a decisive trigger that accelerated project failures. “This sharp decline in token survivability may be linked to the broader market turbulence throughout the year, which particularly affected the meme coin sector,” Lee said. CoinGecko defines a failed cryptocurrency as a token that was once actively traded on GeckoTerminal but has since ceased activity. The scale of the collapse represents a dramatic jump from previous years. Around 1.3 million projects failed in 2024, while just 2,584 failures were recorded in 2021, highlighting how quickly risk appetite expanded over the past cycle. Top 10 Crypto Narratives in 2025 1. Meme Coins 2. Artificial Intelligence 3. AI Agents 4. Real World Assets 5. Made in USA 6. Solana Meme Coins 7. Solana Ecosystem 8. Layer 1 9. DeFi 10. DeFAI — CoinGecko (@coingecko) December 9, 2025 Meme coins, often driven by social momentum rather than fundamentals, tend to amplify those swings. Beyond market stress, sheer volume played a central role. GeckoTerminal data shows the number of listed tokens climbed from about 3 million at the end of 2024 to nearly 20 million by the close of 2025. Lee attributed much of that growth to the rise of low-friction token launch tools, particularly on Solana. The launch of pump.fun in early 2024 made it easier than ever to deploy new tokens, fueling an influx of projects with minimal development or staying power. “The ease of launching tokens on launchpads has led to a surge in low-effort meme coins entering the market,” Lee said. Before 2024, annual crypto failures were typically in the low six figures, with projects launched between 2021 and 2023 accounting for just 3.4% of all failures over the past five years. Meme coins Rebound in Early 2026 as Market Cap and Volumes Jump Despite last year’s washout, meme coins entered 2026 with renewed momentum . Data from CoinMarketCap shows the sector’s market capitalization rose from $38 billion in late December to $47.7 billion in early January, before easing to around $43.7 billion. Transaction volumes surged as well, briefly jumping more than 300% before settling back, suggesting speculative interest has returned. Tokens such as PEPE, BONK, and FLOKI led the rebound with strong double-digit gains, reigniting debate over whether the move reflects short-term speculation or an early signal of broader altcoin rotation.

57092446,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=893260,1768204832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57092446.jpeg,Zanzibar bets on crypto to build a digital-first city,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/city-crypto-built-zanzibars-digital/,"A plot of empty land on Zanzibar’s coast will soon become home to a new kind of settlement, according to entrepreneurs wh o se cured government approval to build what they’re calling a Cyber City. The project sits on 71 hectares near the Fumba Peninsula on the western shore of Zanzibar Island. Florian Fournier, who started OurWorld with partner Kristof De Spiegeleer, walked potential investors through the dirt and brush in early July, describing plans for a community designed to house between 5,000 and 7,000 residents. But the city aims to reach far beyond those physical inhabitants. Fournier and De Spiegeleer want to create a home base for digital nomads who work remotely around the world, offering them a place to register as residents without actually living there full-time. Building on a new model for governance “They want it to become for East Africa what Singapore became for South-East Asia,” Fournier said about Zanzibar’s ambitions. The development draws inspiration from something called a “network state,” a term that entered tech circles through a 2022 book by cryptocurrency businessman Balaji Srinivasan. His book argued that people with shared beliefs and interests should band together online and eventually purchase land to form their own societies, separate from traditional governments. Srinivasan suggested these groups should rely on cryptocurrency rather than regular banks and could eventually gain recognition similar to actual countries. “I was like, wow, that’s exactly what we’re doing,” Fournier said after reading the book. He reached out to Srinivasan, who later put money into OurWorld’s computing business called Threefold and invited Fournier to speak at his Network State conference in 2024. The Zanzibar project received official backing when the president approved OurWorld’s partnership with ZICTIA, a government telecommunications agency, in November 2024. This came after years of work by Fournier and De Spiegeleer to persuade officials to create Digital Free Zones, which became law in early 2024. “I said, ‘What if we bring millions of digital people – not physical – to your island?'” De Spiegeleer remembered telling government officials during a 2022 meeting. The city offers attractive tax terms. People who register as remote residents will pay 5% income tax, while those who actually live there pay 15%. Companies operating in the zone won’t pay any taxes for their first ten years. There’s no capital gains or wealth tax. The government keeps the tax money, while profits from selling real estate will go toward funding local startups. About 100 people have already signed up as e-residents, and 30 businesses have registered there, though partners said marketing efforts only just started in January. De Spiegeleer aims to grow the city’s total worth to $1 billion within two years, up from the land’s current value of $70 million. The government gave OurWorld and partners a 30-year lease to use the property. People buying property in the city will receive title deeds as digital tokens similar to NFTs that can be traded on cryptocurrency markets. The value of these tokens would rise or fall based on how well the city performs economically. Most city services will run through automated software that OurWorld built with a company called Tools for the Commons. Hugo Mathecowitsch, who founded Tools for the Commons, described the system as handling everything from business disputes to payments, taxes and invoices. His company has offices in Delaware, Brazil and Prospera, a special economic zone in Honduras. Criminal issues will still fall under Zanzibar’s legal system. ZICTIA said in an email that the city “can b e pi oneer of innovation or invention of technology” while protecting “Zanzibar’s social, cultural and natural environment.” Similar experiment s ta king shape worldwide Similar projects have popped up worldwide since Srinivasan’s book came out. Srinivasan himself run s Ne twork School in a Malaysian special economic zone, where participants eat meals based on longevity expert Bryan Johnson’s diet and earn “Burn NFTs” for attending fitness classes. Prospera in Honduras houses about 300 actual residents but has attracted roughly 2,000 e-residents. The zone sits on more than 1,000 acres on Roatan Island. Investors include funds backed by tech figures Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel, plus Srinivasan. However, Prospera existed before Srinivasan’s book and doesn’t use the network state label. Vitalik Buterin, who created the Ethereum cryptocurrency, started Zuzalu in 2023 as a test of Srinivasan’s ideas. He brought several hundred people from cryptocurrency, longevity research and online discussion groups to a resort in Montenegro for two months. Fournier attended, as did musician Grimes. Since then, dozens of similar gatherings have happened on every continent. Some are planning permanent locations with Buterin’s support, though whether these will look more like cities or research facilities remains unclear. Mathecowitsch sai d hi s company is working on zones in Qatar and Rio de Janeiro’s Mata Maravilha port that would share the same software and rules. The plan calls for each host country to recognize the zone as having diplomatic status. “The big vision is to enable a network of connected cities and that would share the same charter almost like a decentralized United States,” he said, predicting 10 to 20 such zones within ten years. Harry Halpin, who studies socio-technical systems at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and founde d pr ivacy startup Nym, sai d ne twork state ideas reflect frustration with traditional governments. “These people see the nation state as an operating system like Windows or Linux and want to opt out of it and build a better alternative,” Halpin said. He warned that many network state supporters lack political experience, which could lead them to repeat historical mistakes.

He emphasized that the current period is a test of patience, conviction, and endurance. Holding through uncertainty is part of participating in a project that remains largely misunderstood. He believes that XRP is not just another digital asset. He sees it as a developing infrastructure with the potential to support global payments at scale. According to Bird, many obstacles have slowed progress. Regulatory processes, legal disputes, media narratives, and general disbelief have created delays. He highlighted that these challenges are not indicative of failure. Instead, they show the scale of what Ripple and the XRP community aim to achieve . He pointed out that impatience is natural but should not be mistaken for a flaw in the project. To my fellow XRP family. This game was never meant to be easy. It’s meant to test patience, conviction, and endurance. Holding through uncertainty is part of the price of admission, because we were given the chance to buy something early that most people still don’t understand.… — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 10, 2026 Institutional Foundations Bird noted the work being done behind the scenes by Ripple. He highlighted the acquisitions , regulatory groundwork, and engagements with governments and institutions worldwide. These actions are designed to unlock significant economic potential. He stressed that these efforts required years of planning, consistent pressure, and persistence. According to him, when Ripple executives make public statements about progress, it indicates advanced stages and not mere hype. Bird also referenced the recent change in Ripple’s leadership structure. When the company’s CTO, JoelKatz (David Schwartz), steps back from day-to-day operations , it is not an exit but a signal that the foundational work is complete. According to Bird, increased usage of the XRP Ledger will follow. He expects this to lead to growing transaction volumes and price discovery. He highlighted that these are the steps the community has been anticipating. Early Participation and Conviction Bird emphasized that XRP is held by a few, with even fewer using the ledger. Early participants play a critical role in its development. He called the moment rare, with current users directly shaping the project’s success and future history. He stated that XRP’s value goes beyond price. Holding it reflects belief in the project’s long-term vision and support through uncertainty. The hardest part is waiting. Patience and persistence are essential for realizing its benefits.

The actions of Ripple and the XRP community are setting the stage for increased adoption and measurable global impact . He emphasized that when progress becomes visible, the effort and patience required to reach this stage will become clear. According to Bird, holding XRP is not simply holding an asset; it is holding conviction. That conviction, he suggested, is what will ultimately shape outcomes and create value for participants.

Oh, he also posted a picture of himself as the President of Venezuela, but we will not focus on that here. Instead, this article will be dedicated mostly to the Trump-Powell front, which has seen a new development in the past 48 hours. The POTUS has gone after the Fed Chair ever since he won the 2024 presidential elections, even though he was the one who nominated him for the position. However, Trump believes the interest rates should be significantly lower, and has made multiple offensive remarks in the past year or so. He has also made numerous threats about potentially firing Powell, although it’s not exactly legal. The most recent development on this front unfolded over the weekend when the Fed Chair announced that the US Justice Department served the agency with subpoenas and threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee last year about renovations to Fed buildings. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” he commented. As The Kobeissi Letter said, this is the first time Powell has fought back since Trump’s attacks began, and he believes this is a coordinated action, given the fact that the Fed Chair is expected to pause the rate cuts in the following FOMC meeting in two weeks. For the first time ever, Fed Chair Powell is fighting back: Over the last 12 months, Fed Chair Powell has remained silent amid President Trump’s criticisms. When asked about Trump’s comments, Powell would respond “I do not any response or comment.” Today, that changed. Amid a… https://t.co/OlNTbQfI4i — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 12, 2026 The analysts warned that more volatility is expected as this clash will likely continue to worsen.

The largest US crypto exchange may reconsider backing the digital-asset market structure bill if the final text includes language that prevents platforms from offering incentives to customers holding stablecoins, according to Bloomberg . A Coinbase representative directed Bloomberg to comments Brian Armstrong made in December, where the CEO predicted that banks “ would in a few years come to lobby for ” stablecoin yield, despite their current opposition. The threat comes as lawmakers race to finalize legislation that has already missed multiple deadlines throughout 2025, with Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott setting this week’s markup as a firm deadline after months of stalled negotiations. Crypto firms ramp up lobbying in Washington as a key Senate vote on U.S. market structure bill approaches. #USSenate #CryptoBill https://t.co/bbNSAzfE4r — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 8, 2026 Banking Industry Pushes for Broader Yield Restrictions Traditional banking groups are lobbying to expand restrictions beyond what Congress established in the GENIUS Act, which bars stablecoin issuers from paying direct interest but allows third-party platforms to offer rewards. One option under consideration would limit rewards to regulated financial institutions, a move backed by banking interests who argue that yield-bearing stablecoin accounts could drain deposits from community banks. The American Bankers Association wrote in a recent letter that “ if billions are displaced from community bank lending, small businesses, farmers, students, and home buyers in towns like ours will suffer. “ The group warned that crypto exchanges cannot replicate FDIC-insured products or fill the lending gap created by deposit outflows. Coinbase has applied for a national trust charter that could eventually allow it to offer rewards under such rules. However, crypto-native firms are pushing to preserve platform-based incentives as a viable model even without banking licenses, warning that broader restrictions could eliminate competition in the sector. Stablecoin Rewards Generate Critical Revenue for Coinbase For Coinbase, the rewards represent a significant revenue stream worth protecting. The exchange and Circle Internet Group share interest income generated from reserves backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin, with USDC parked at Coinbase providing steady revenue that becomes especially important during bear markets. Coinbase also owns a small stake in Circle, currently the largest stablecoin issuer in compliance with US law. The platform encourages users to hold USDC by offering 3.5% rewards on Coinbase One balances. If the market structure bill bans such incentives, fewer customers may hold stablecoins on the exchange, potentially reducing Coinbase’s total stablecoin revenue, which Bloomberg data projects reached $1.3 billion in 2025. Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, argued in a recent post that preserving reward schemes is important for maintaining dollar supremacy, noting that China announced plans to start paying interest on its digital yuan starting January 1, 2026. “ Undermining the supremacy of the USD has been a longstanding goal of the PRC—the Senate banning rewards would be a big assist to China’s efforts, ” he wrote. The Senate Banking Committee marks up the Market Structure bill next week, and stablecoin rewards remain under debate. Congress already settled this in GENIUS—reopening it now only creates uncertainty and risks the future of the US Dollar as commerce moves onchain. Here’s why… — Faryar Shirzad (@faryarshirzad) January 7, 2026 Bipartisan Support Erodes as Midterms Approach While the Trump administration supports swift legislative action, the stablecoin rewards dispute has fractured bipartisan backing for the market structure bill. Senate Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman is considering delaying his committee’s January 15 vote to allow more time for negotiations with Democratic lead negotiator Cory Booker. Boozman stated earlier this week that he intended to hold the vote next week regardless of bipartisan support. Booker expressed hope on Thursday that the two sides could reach an agreement. Adding to the stalling vote, TD Cowen warned earlier this month that the 2026 midterm elections could delay passage until 2027 , with Senate Democrats potentially withholding support as lawmakers position for the next cycle. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Nathan Dean suggested the markup’s lack of bipartisan support may push odds of first-half passage below 70%.

The totals were a bit higher than the quarter before, so on the surface everything seemed steady. The change only becomes obvious when the numbers are laid out month by month. Through the summer, traffic slowly drifted away from the biggest news sites where crypto usually gets seen. From July to September, those high-reach sites shed around 12.6 million crypto-related visits. There wasn’t a crash or a single moment where things broke. The drop just stretched quietly across the season. Outset PR has been tracking similar shifts across Asia , Latin America , and different parts of Europe. This report pulls Eastern and Western Europe together to see how that same pattern played out over the summer months. Quarterly Growth That Masked a Summer Slowdown Across Eastern and Western Europe combined, crypto-native publishers recorded 67.5 million visits over the quarter, up just under 4% compared with Q2. At face value, that suggests stability after a softer second quarter. But the quarter was front-loaded. July opened strong, with traffic close to 24 million visits. August stepped down. September dropped again, finishing the quarter a little above 20.5 million. By the end of September, crypto media across Europe was pulling in about three million fewer monthly visits than it had at the start of the quarter. The quarter ended up slightly higher than the one before it, but mostly because it got off to a stronger start, not because things improved as the months went on. Where the Losses Actually Showed Up The slowdown didn’t hit every part of Europe the same way. Eastern Europe was responsible for nearly all of the quarter-over-quarter growth, rebounding from a sharp Q2 dip and staying relatively steady through the summer. Traffic there fell only slightly from July to September, suggesting audiences continued to return even as discovery cooled. Traffic for the quarter finished roughly flat in Western Europe , but it softened steadily month by month. From July to September, crypto media traffic fell by close to 18%, with most of the drop coming from the markets that usually carry the most volume. Image sourced from Outset PR France, the Netherlands, and Germany were still among Europe’s biggest crypto media hubs by total visits. Along with Russia and Poland, those five countries made up over 70% of crypto-native traffic for the quarter, and they’re also where most of the summer slowdown showed up. Mainstream Reach Shrank Faster Than Crypto-Native Traffic The clearest losses appeared at Europe’s largest news publishers. News platforms with broad, non-crypto audiences that also cover crypto attracted roughly 1.15 billion visits over the quarter, compared with a much smaller share going to crypto-native sites. Only about a third of large news sites saw their crypto sections grow over the period. Most either flatlined or slipped, which is where that mid-summer traffic drop ultimately came from. For large publishers, those losses barely register at the company level but for crypto audiences, they matter. When crypto coverage fades at high-reach sites, it doesn’t just mean fewer clicks. It means fewer casual readers, fewer first-touch exposures, and fewer chances for crypto stories to reach people who aren’t already plugged into the space. Scale Still Decides Who Holds On Looking across crypto-native publishers, traffic remained heavily concentrated. Just 12 Tier-1 and Tier-1.5 outlets (those averaging more than 500,000 monthly visits) recorded nearly 58% of all crypto-native traffic, pulling in about 39 million visits between them. Tier-2 outlets, with monthly traffic between 100,000 and 499,000 visits, accounted for roughly one-third of total traffic, or 22.6 million visits. Tier-3 publishers added just under 10%, while the long tail of smaller outlets contributed barely over 1%. That imbalance is why some parts of the ecosystem feel every change in traffic more than others. Big media can lose visibility without immediate consequence while smaller and mid-sized outlets feel every change in discovery almost instantly. How Europeans Actually Found Crypto News The way readers arrived at crypto content helps explain why the summer slowdown showed up so clearly. Nearly 90% of crypto-native traffic came from just two sources: organic search (46%) and direct visits (42%). Everything else (referrals, social links, newsletters, paid traffic) made up the remaining sliver. Image sourced from Outset PR That leaves little room for cushioning when search demand cools or reader habits change. Referrals and social together barely cleared 10%, and paid traffic was close to zero. Big, multi-topic news sites have a different setup. Referrals alone made up over 12% of their traffic, giving them more flexibility when one channel softens. Crypto-native outlets don’t have that luxury. Where AI Began to Show Up In that setting, AI-driven discovery became visible, not because it was large, but because everything else slowed down. During Q3, AI tools sent about 510,000 visits to Europe’s crypto-native publishers, representing just 0.76% of total traffic. On volume alone, that’s negligible. Inside referrals, though, AI accounted for more than 13% of all incoming referral traffic. That share wasn’t spread evenly. Only 41% of crypto-native outlets recorded any measurable AI-driven visits at all. For most publishers, AI barely showed up. But among certain mid-tier and niche outlets, AI tools made up a sizable slice of referrals – sometimes 25–35%, sometimes 40–50%, and in a few cases over 60%. These were almost always outlets with smaller overall traffic bases, where even modest referral streams can look large in percentage terms. The common thread was content type. AI referrals clustered around evergreen analysis, explainers, educational material, and structured reference content, which are all formats that are easy for AI systems to surface when users ask questions. What This Quarter Actually Proved By the end of the summer, it was easier to tell how Europe’s crypto media really works. Traffic started thinning out first at the biggest, most visible sites, and it became clearer which publishers were still being found easily and which ones weren’t. With fewer spikes and a quieter flow of news, small things started to stand out. AI referrals didn’t suddenly become big, but you could actually notice them in the data in a way you couldn’t earlier in the year. Put next to Outset PR’s earlier research, the picture lines up. Crypto audiences are still around, but getting in front of them now depends much more on where content lives and how people usually arrive there.

In most games today, players invest significant time and money into characters, skins, and items they do not truly own. These assets are locked within closed platforms and cannot be traded or moved freely. Weewux addresses these long-standing challenges by integrating blockchain technology at the foundational level. Using decentralized ledger technology, Weewux enables verifiable digital ownership, allowing players to store, trade, or utilize their assets beyond the confines of a single game. With blockchain as its backbone, Weewux aims to support developers in building next-generation game economies where players hold actual control over the items they acquire. Introducing OMIX: The Core of the Weewux Ecosystem At the center of the platform is OMIX , the native currency that drives transactions, access rights, and ecosystem participation within Weewux. The token is designed with utility in mind, supporting a wide range of functionalities including: Transaction settlement for digital asset purchases In-game economy management, including reward structures Platform governance , allowing OMIX holders to participate in select decision-making processes Marketplace utility, enabling secure peer-to-peer trading OMIX is intended to streamline user activity across the platform while creating consistency in how developers and players interact with blockchain-backed assets. Designed for Developers and Creators Weewux positions itself as more than a player-facing platform; it is built as a comprehensive infrastructure solution for developers. By providing easy-to-integrate blockchain tools, APIs, and asset management systems, Weewux reduces the complexity typically associated with blockchain development. Key benefits for developers include: A unified asset registry enabling cross-game asset interoperability Smart-contract templates to simplify digital item creation A secure marketplace environment for item distribution and monetization Scalable infrastructure capable of supporting large user bases Through these tools, Weewux aims to lower the technical barrier for game studios interested in entering the blockchain space. A Player-Centric Vision One of the core principles behind Weewux is the empowerment of players. The platform seeks to redefine the relationship between gamers and the digital worlds they immerse themselves in. By providing verifiable ownership of digital items, Weewux opens the door to new forms of engagement: Transferable in-game assets that can be sold, traded, or held as collectibles Community-driven economies where market value is shaped by user demand Enhanced rewards structures tied directly to blockchain verification Long-term utility beyond the lifespan of a single game Through this approach, Weewux envisions a shift toward gaming environments that are more transparent, sustainable, and mutually beneficial for both players and developers. Infrastructure and Performance To support its long-term goals, Weewux is built on a high-performance blockchain architecture optimized for speed, cost-efficiency, and security. With scalability being one of the most significant challenges in blockchain gaming, Weewux’s infrastructure is engineered to support large transaction volumes without compromising network performance. This focus on performance also ensures a smooth user experience—an essential factor for modern gaming applications where delays or high transaction fees can disrupt gameplay. A Growing Ecosystem With Room to Expand Weewux plans to expand beyond its initial platform offering with additional features currently in development. These include: A dedicated NFT marketplace for game assets Cross-platform asset functionality allowing items to be utilized across compatible titles Creator tools enabling artists and designers to mint custom items Staking and reward systems tied to OMIX Partnership programs for game studios and brands Each of these initiatives is designed to strengthen the ecosystem and provide more value to participants over time. Setting the Stage for the Future of Digital Ownership The launch of the Weewux platform marks a significant milestone in the broader movement toward transparent and decentralized digital ecosystems. As digital assets become more deeply integrated into gaming and online entertainment, the demand for secure, user-owned infrastructures continues to grow. Weewux, through its platform architecture and the OMIX token, aims to support this shift by giving players and developers the tools they need to participate in the next evolution of interactive digital environments. About Weewux Weewux is a next-generation blockchain gaming platform designed to empower players, creators, and developers through transparent asset ownership and decentralized technology. Built for scalability and efficiency, Weewux provides a full ecosystem for building, trading, and interacting with blockchain-backed digital assets. The platform is powered by OMIX, its native utility token.

The limited-time event began on Jan. 4, 2026, at 11:00 UTC and will run until Jan. 31 at 16:59 UTC. Participation is restricted to accounts that have never previously deposited funds on MEXC, with eligibility tied specifically to deposits completed through the exchange’s P2P channel rather than standard trading methods. To take part, users must first register for the campaign via the dedicated event page. Only after opting in are participants able to qualify by completing their first P2P deposit and reaching a net deposited amount exceeding $100 during the event period. MEXC notes that users who fail to register before depositing will not be counted toward the promotion. Participants who meet the requirements within seven days of registration unlock a fixed 10 USDT reward. All rewards are distributed from a shared $200,000 pool and allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning that late participants may miss out once the pool is fully claimed. Following the conclusion of the campaign, eligible rewards will be credited directly to users’ Spot wallets. MEXC states that distribution will take place within 14 calendar days after the event ends, with most users expected to receive their airdrops within five business days. The campaign places renewed focus on MEXC’s P2P trading service, which allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies using local currencies, flexible pricing, and a wide range of payment methods. Unlike traditional exchange trades, P2P transactions on MEXC come with zero platform fees, a feature the exchange continues to promote as competition among P2P marketplaces intensifies. Through the P2P platform, users can access major cryptocurrencies including USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, Dogecoin, and Solana. The service is designed to cater to regions where direct fiat on-ramps may be limited or where users prefer localized payment options. However, the exchange has outlined several restrictions tied to the promotion. Users who withdraw funds within 24 hours of meeting the deposit requirements will be disqualified from receiving rewards. In addition, participants who have previously received rewards from other MEXC P2P promotions are excluded from this campaign. Eligibility is limited to main accounts only. Sub-accounts cannot participate independently, and any activity associated with them will be consolidated under the primary account for the purposes of eligibility checks and reward calculations. MEXC also applies internal risk and compliance reviews before rewards are finalized. Any attempts to manipulate the event, including creating multiple accounts, providing false identity information, inflating trading data, or engaging in other forms of abnormal activity, may result in disqualification and forfeiture of rewards. The exchange added that the campaign rules may be adjusted or terminated if necessary. Users were also reminded that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile and that promotional incentives do not remove the risks associated with trading digital assets.

The coin’s weekly performance showed a fall of 7.40%. Trading activity has eased sharply, with one source reporting a drop in volume of 50%. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Key Momentum Readings And Moving Averages According to market data, DOGE RSI sits at 52.70 with a signal line at 52, which points to fairly balanced momentum and no clear bias. Exponential moving averages line up as follows: EMA 20 at $0.13, EMA 50 at $0.14, EMA 100 at $0.15 and EMA 200 at $0.17. The EMA set shows a downward curve overall, and the EMA 50 is being watched closely as a short-term barrier. The coin’s market capitalization stood at $23.60 billion. Analysts Offer Targets As Price Forms Higher Lows Crypto analyst Jonathan Carter set a ladder of upside targets at $0.15, $0.18, $0.20, $0.24 and $0.28, saying that those levels correspond to past reaction points on the chart. Based on reports, Carter views price action above the 50-day average as an early sign that momentum is returning. #DOGE Descending Channel Breakout Imminent👨‍💻 Dogecoin is poised to break out from the descending channel formation on the daily chart💁‍♂️ Price action above the MA 50 indicates a potential reversal from a prolonged downtrend structure🔍 Upside targets: 🎯 $0.153 🎯 $0.182 🎯… pic.twitter.com/EfRjyg6tfo — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) January 11, 2026 DOGE has been building higher lows, which would be a positive structure if it holds. Other analysts identified the all-time high at $0.73 as a long-term reference and noted a fourfold minimum growth target from current prices under the existing trend. Open Interest Climbs While Volume Drops CoinGlass data showed trading volume down by 43% to $1.30 billion in one report, even as Open Interest rose 1.70% to $1.80 billion. Total liquidations in the last 24 hours were listed at $596K, with long positions making up $431K and shorts $165K. This split suggests more long exposure among leveraged traders at the moment. Market Structure Means A Clear Move Is Needed Traders are sizing up several clear levels. A sustained move above EMA 50 at $0.14 could invite more buyers. A failure to hold the EMA 20 support at $0.13 would raise questions about the short-term strength. While momentum indicators are neutral now, a decisive break either way would likely be followed by sharper swings given low volume.

Positions are being kept, as shown by rising Open Interest, but many market participants appear to be waiting for confirmation. If buying pressure returns and volume recovers, the analyst targets listed above could come into focus. If not, the chart may remain in a tight range for some time.

Many of them bought nearly two years ago and are still underwater today. They are not panicking. They say the share price does not match what the company is doing. For them, the focus stays on bitcoin, not daily charts or analyst notes. One of those investors is Ben Stong, who according to Financial Times, bought shares in spring 2024 and watched them sink. He says the drop does not bother him. His clinic already takes bitcoin payments. He says the wider market does not understand the company at all. “I don’t really look at the share price as a value of the actual shares because the whole entire market is mispricing Strategy,” Ben said. He added that his investment runs into the high hundreds of thousands of dollars. Retail traders keep buying while Wall Street steps back For loyal retail holders, Wall Street doubt is background noise. They believe the criticism is loud but empty. Many of them are waiting for 2026. They think time will do the talking. The company became the world’s largest corporate holder of bitcoin because retail traders piled in early. They wanted a fast way to bet on the coin without holding it directly. Founder Michael Saylor sits at the center of that loyalty. Most of us investors talk about him like a symbol, not a CEO. This is someone who ignored normal finance playbooks and built a company around one asset back when the entirety of Wall Street was laughing at our market. Since 2020, Strategy has raised cash again and again through stocks and bonds. Most of that money went straight into bitcoin. Saylor spent years talking up the asset to investors and executives across the world. The approach worked for a while. Shares jumped in late 2024 and sat near record highs last summer. Then the mood flipped. Bitcoin prices softened. Analysts started asking if the model could survive. Over the past twelve months, the stock lost about half its value. Share slide fuels claims of pressure and price games Some retail holders think outside forces pushed the stock down. They point fingers at short sellers and big banks that released negative research last year. Adam Graham, another retail investor, holds about $8,000 in shares. “There’s been some very artificial manipulation of the prices,” Adam said. He said he lost money on most of his holdings except the preferred shares. Those pay up to 11% a year. “I’m not terribly concerned,” he said. “I’m confident in the long term.” Ben shares that view and talks openly about FUD, short for fear, uncertainty, and doubt. He says that word gets thrown around whenever people do not believe in the stock. Meanwhile, bitcoin itself is down about 4% over the past year and trades near $90,000. That happened even as the US government made crypto a national strategic priority and pushed digital assets closer to the mainstream. Lower risk appetite and worries about heavy leverage dragged prices down in October and November and kept them weak. One major risk tied to 2026 has cooled for now. Index provider MSCI paused plans to consider removing digital asset treasury firms like Strategy from its indices. If that move happened, passive fund flows could have vanished. The company also adjusted how it raised money. Instead of using new stock sales to buy more bitcoin, it built a dollar reserve to cover dividends if needed. That reserve rose from $1.44 billion in December to $2.25 billion in early January. Saylor posted “Tame your bear” on X with an AI image of himself next to a polar bear. In February, Strategy opened an online merchandise store, even as the stock kept sliding. The trainers did the opposite. On resale sites, their prices have surged by 1100%.

The chart places two periods side by side. One shows XRP in 2016/2017, and the other shows XRP now. Both highlight a consolidation window lasting about 400 days. XRP moved sideways in a defined range in each case, with an unclear direction for this extended period. Steph summarized the comparison by stating that XRP “spent roughly 400 days moving sideways” in 2017 and has “once again spent about 400 days consolidating” in the current cycle. With XRP repeating this historical pattern , the analyst has bullish expectations for the digital asset. This $XRP chart is striking when you line it up with 2017. Back then, XRP spent roughly 400 days moving sideways, wearing out both bulls and bears. That long compression wasn’t weakness — it was preparation. Once price finally broke out, XRP entered its most explosive phase.… pic.twitter.com/vQMwjWFKkB — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 11, 2026 What the 2017 Chart Shows In the 2017 section of the chart, XRP traded in a narrow band for over a year. Buyers and sellers rotated control without follow-through. That range eventually resolved to the upside, with a sharp acceleration. The breakout followed a long phase of compression, not a gradual trend. Steph noted that the sideways move “wasn’t weakness — it was preparation.” That statement reflects how extended consolidation can precede expansion when supply tightens and positioning resets. The Current XRP Structure The present-day chart shows XRP trading within a similar horizontal range. The highlighted zone again spans about 400 days . XRP currently oscillates near the bottom of that range, with repeated tests of support and resistance. Momentum remains contained, but with the timelines lining up, the breakout could be imminent. The chart uses a 3-day timeframe, which smooths noise and emphasizes cycle-level behavior. In that context, the current consolidation mirrors the earlier one in both duration and shape. Steph pointed to this parallel when he said, “Markets don’t repeat perfectly, but they do rhyme .” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What to Expect from XRP Steph did not issue a specific price forecast, but his focus on the sequence reinforces the bullish sentiment. In his view, this consolidation phase historically comes before expansion. XRP has now spent over 13 months in this range , and may be nearing the end of its consolidation window if the rhythm matches that of the earlier cycle. Long consolidations often precede directional resolution. In 2017, that resolution came quickly once the price cleared the range. The current chart suggests XRP is in the same preparatory stage. For traders and analysts, that repetition defines what to watch next. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Registered crypto exchanges in India will be implementing new measures that seek to tighten onboarding procedures and enhance identity verification in compliance with new guidelines that became effective as of January 8, according to a local media report . The latest directive is part of the FIU’s ongoing push to bring greater oversight to the largely unregulated cryptocurrency sector by enforcing enhanced anti-money laundering standards across the board. What are the new KYC measures? When onboarding new users, FIU-registered crypto exchanges in India would no longer be able to rely on basic documentation such as a profile picture paired with standard identity uploads. As part of the new mandate, exchanges will require users to submit live selfie pictures that are verified using software capable of tracking eye and head movements in real-time. With this approach, regulators hope to curb the use of deepfake images and static impersonation attempts that bad actors often deploy to bypass identity checks and gain unauthorized access. Previously, users were only required to upload scanned copies of their government documents to complete the KYC process. However, the updated rules now mandate the submission of additional government-issued photo identification, such as a passport, Aadhaar, or voter ID, along with OTP-based verification of both mobile number and email address. Further, when linking their bank accounts for deposits and withdrawals, users would have to undergo a “penny drop” test, where a small transaction is sent to verify account ownership. In the background, crypto exchanges would also be required to collect the geolocation and IP address of every user at the time of account creation, along with a timestamp and device-related metadata. Users would be classified as high or low risk based on their jurisdiction, activity, and profile, and exchanges would be required to preserve their information for up to five years, or longer in cases where the user is involved in an active enforcement or legal investigation. For context, high-risk clients include politically exposed persons, users from FATF grey or blacklisted countries, non-profits, and entities operating from or linked to tax havens. These users will be required to update their KYC every six months, while regular users will be asked to complete this update annually. Regulators are also taking a strict stance against privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and tools that enable anonymity in transactions. Crypto exchanges would be required to adopt appropriate risk-mitigation measures to prevent the use of tumblers, mixers, and tokens that are designed to obfuscate the origin, ownership, or value of funds being transferred. Transactions involving such tools are to be treated as high-risk and, in some cases, outright blocked. Meanwhile, the FIU also discourages involvement in Initial Coin offerings (ICO) and Initial Token offerings (ITO) due to their lack of economic justification and elevated risks, the report noted. FIU pushes for compliance or ban India classified Virtual Digital Asset service providers under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in 2023, which made it mandatory for exchanges to register as reporting entities with the FIU and offer services to Indian users only after securing regulatory clearance. Over the past few years, the regulator has issued notices to several non-compliant platforms and blocked access to websites and apps that failed to register or meet compliance requirements. Leading offshore exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and KuCoin have had to pay hefty fines to settle past violations and account for the years in which they operated without proper registration before they were allowed to re-enter the Indian market . As per recent data, a total of 49 platforms, including both domestic and offshore exchanges, are now registered as reporting institutions under the FIU for the 2024–25 period.

Speaking with Bonnie Blockchain in late 2024, Svanevik articulated a perspective that separates Ethereum’s undeniable technological utility from ETH’s potential as an investment asset. This analysis arrives during a pivotal moment for blockchain adoption, as institutional interest grows while fundamental questions about token valuation persist. The Ethereum investment value conversation now requires deeper examination of economic principles beyond mere network usage metrics. Ethereum Investment Value: Separating Utility from Asset Performance Alex Svanevik’s central argument challenges a common assumption in cryptocurrency markets. He asserts that Ethereum’s success as a public blockchain platform does not automatically translate to ETH’s value as an investment vehicle. This distinction represents a fundamental shift in how analysts evaluate blockchain tokens. The Nansen CEO draws a compelling analogy to traditional finance, noting that while the U.S. dollar serves as essential global infrastructure, investors rarely consider holding cash as a long-term investment strategy. Similarly, Ethereum’s technological achievements—particularly the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a development standard—establish utility but don’t guarantee investment returns. Blockchain infrastructure success and token economics operate on different principles. The Ethereum network processes millions of transactions daily, supports decentralized applications, and enables smart contract functionality across numerous sectors. However, these utility metrics don’t directly correlate with ETH price appreciation. Svanevik emphasizes that investment value requires additional characteristics including scarcity mechanisms, predictable profitability, and sustainable demand drivers. This perspective encourages investors to analyze ETH through multiple lenses rather than assuming network growth automatically creates token value. Blockchain Utility Versus Token Economics Fundamentals The evolution of blockchain technology reveals an important pattern. Successful infrastructure often becomes commoditized over time, with value accruing to applications rather than the underlying protocol. The internet provides a relevant historical parallel—while TCP/IP protocols enabled global connectivity, investment returns primarily flowed to companies building on this infrastructure rather than the protocols themselves. Ethereum faces similar dynamics as its technology becomes standardized across the blockchain ecosystem. Several key factors differentiate utility from investment value: Network Effects vs. Scarcity: Ethereum benefits from powerful network effects as more developers build on its platform, but ETH tokens require verifiable scarcity mechanisms to maintain value Usage Volume vs. Value Capture: High transaction volume doesn’t guarantee that value accrues to ETH holders rather than network participants Technical Innovation vs. Economic Design: Ethereum’s continuous technical improvements must be matched by sound token economic principles Developer Adoption vs. Investor Demand: While developers choose platforms based on technical merits, investors evaluate assets based on return potential This distinction becomes particularly relevant as Ethereum transitions to proof-of-stake consensus. The merge fundamentally changed ETH’s economic properties, introducing staking rewards and altering issuance schedules. However, these changes don’t automatically resolve the utility-versus-investment question. They simply create new economic dynamics that investors must analyze separately from technological achievements. Expert Perspectives on Blockchain Asset Valuation Industry analysts have increasingly emphasized the need for sophisticated valuation frameworks. Traditional financial metrics often prove inadequate for evaluating blockchain assets, creating confusion among investors. The Nansen CEO’s comments reflect a growing consensus among blockchain economists that token valuation requires specialized methodologies. These approaches typically consider multiple dimensions including network security costs, staking yields, fee capture mechanisms, and competing platform dynamics. Comparative analysis reveals important patterns across blockchain ecosystems. The table below illustrates how different networks approach the utility-investment relationship: Blockchain Primary Utility Token Value Proposition Key Economic Mechanism Ethereum Smart contract platform Network security asset Staking rewards, fee burning Bitcoin Digital gold/store of value Monetary asset Fixed supply, halving cycles Solana High-throughput transactions Utility token for fees Transaction fee distribution Avalanche Custom blockchain creation Staking and governance Multi-chain fee structure This comparative view demonstrates that successful blockchain networks develop distinct approaches to aligning utility with token value. Ethereum’s challenge lies in maintaining its development lead while ensuring ETH captures sufficient value from network activity. The EVM’s dominance as a development standard creates powerful utility, but translating this into sustainable ETH value requires deliberate economic design. Historical Context and Market Evolution The relationship between blockchain utility and token value has evolved significantly since Ethereum’s 2015 launch. Early cryptocurrency markets often assumed that technological superiority would automatically translate to investment returns. This assumption fueled the 2017 initial coin offering boom, where numerous projects raised substantial funds based on technical whitepapers rather than proven economic models. The subsequent market correction revealed the flaws in this approach, leading to more sophisticated analysis. Several historical developments have shaped current perspectives: 2017-2018 ICO Boom and Bust: Demonstrated that technical promises alone don’t guarantee token value DeFi Summer 2020: Showed how specific applications could drive token value through fee capture NFT Expansion 2021: Revealed that non-financial applications could generate substantial network activity Proof-of-Stake Transition 2022: Fundamentally altered ETH’s economic properties and investment thesis Layer 2 Proliferation 2023-2024: Created new questions about value accrual across blockchain layers This historical context informs Svanevik’s perspective. As CEO of Nansen—a leading blockchain analytics platform—he observes these patterns across thousands of projects and millions of transactions. His position provides unique insight into how blockchain utility translates (or fails to translate) into sustainable token value. The data reveals complex relationships that challenge simplistic narratives about blockchain investment. Real-World Implications for Investors and Developers The distinction between utility and investment value carries practical implications for different blockchain participants. Investors must develop more nuanced evaluation frameworks that separate technological progress from economic fundamentals. This requires analyzing multiple dimensions including token issuance schedules, fee mechanisms, competing platforms, and regulatory considerations. Simply tracking network activity or developer adoption provides an incomplete picture of investment potential. Developers face different considerations. Their primary concern typically involves choosing platforms with robust tooling, strong security, and vibrant ecosystems. Ethereum’s EVM dominance makes it an attractive choice for many projects, regardless of ETH’s price performance. This creates an interesting dynamic where developer adoption may continue even if investment returns disappoint. The separation between utility and investment value means these two groups—developers and investors—may evaluate Ethereum through entirely different criteria. Regulatory developments further complicate this landscape. Different jurisdictions approach utility tokens and investment assets with distinct regulatory frameworks. Clear classification affects everything from taxation to compliance requirements. Svanevik’s distinction between utility and investment value aligns with emerging regulatory thinking that recognizes different token types serve different purposes. This regulatory clarity may ultimately benefit both Ethereum’s development ecosystem and ETH’s investment profile by reducing uncertainty. Conclusion Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik’s analysis provides crucial perspective for understanding Ethereum investment value in the evolving blockchain landscape. His distinction between network utility and token investment potential encourages more sophisticated evaluation frameworks that consider both technological and economic dimensions. As Ethereum continues to dominate as a development platform through its EVM standard, investors must separately assess ETH’s economic properties including scarcity mechanisms, fee capture, and competing alternatives. This nuanced approach recognizes that blockchain infrastructure success doesn’t automatically guarantee token appreciation, just as the U.S. dollar’s utility as global currency doesn’t make it an optimal investment asset. The Ethereum investment value conversation must therefore balance recognition of technological achievements with clear-eyed analysis of economic fundamentals as the blockchain ecosystem matures into its next phase of development. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the Nansen CEO mean by separating Ethereum’s utility from ETH’s investment value? Alex Svanevik argues that Ethereum’s success as a blockchain platform and development standard doesn’t automatically make ETH a valuable investment. Utility refers to technological functionality and adoption, while investment value depends on economic factors like scarcity, profitability, and sustainable demand. Q2: How does the U.S. dollar analogy help explain this distinction? The U.S. dollar serves as essential global infrastructure for transactions and reserves, but investors don’t typically hold cash as a long-term investment expecting appreciation. Similarly, Ethereum provides crucial blockchain infrastructure, but this utility alone doesn’t guarantee ETH will appreciate as an asset. Q3: Doesn’t Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake improve ETH’s investment characteristics? The proof-of-stake transition introduced staking rewards and altered ETH’s issuance, creating new economic dynamics. However, these changes don’t automatically resolve the utility-versus-investment question. They simply create different economic properties that investors must evaluate separately from technological achievements. Q4: If Ethereum has such strong utility, why wouldn’t ETH capture value from that usage? Strong utility creates the potential for value capture, but doesn’t guarantee it. Value capture requires deliberate economic design including fee mechanisms, token distribution, and scarcity models. High usage volume alone doesn’t ensure value flows to token holders rather than network participants or competing layers. Q5: How should investors evaluate ETH differently given this perspective? Investors should analyze ETH through multiple lenses: technological progress (EVM adoption, upgrades), economic fundamentals (staking yields, fee burning), competitive positioning (alternative platforms), and regulatory developments. This comprehensive approach recognizes that network growth metrics provide only partial insight into investment potential.

Research from consultancy AIBase, release d Fr iday, showed that Qwen’s downloads in December alone were more than the combined downloads of the next eight leading models on the platform. These competing models come from companies like Meta Platforms and OpenAI, along with Chinese companies Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI and MiniMax. Leading the global open-source market Al ibaba Cloud handles the AI and cloud computing operations for Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the South China Morning Post. The download numbers on Hugging Face confirm Qwen’s spot as the top open-source platform globally. “Tens of thousands of real-world applications around the globe have been built based on Qwen, marking a historic peak for [Chinese] open-source large models within the international developer community,” the AIBase report stated. Earlier research from October found that Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, a smaller version of the model, was the most downloaded AI model on Hugging Face. On Monday afternoon, Alibaba’s stock price in Hong Kong rose by more than 5 per cent. The company credits Qwen’s success to its approach of releasing multiple models in different sizes. These range from a small model with 600 million parameters up to much larger ones with tens of billions of parameters. Parameters are the elements that give an AI system its capabilities, with more parameters usually meaning better performance. By providing different-sized models, developers can pick the one that fits their specific needs. Bringing AI to consumer product s Al ibaba, known for its e-commerce business, has also put Qwen models to work in products aimed at everyday users. These include the Qwen AI assistant that shares the model’s name and A-Fu, a health application from Ant Group. In December, the Qwen chatbot moved up four positions to reach eighth place on Apple’s China App Store rankings. During that same time period, the A-Fu health app saw an impressive jump in downloads, moving from 94th place all the way to fifth in its category. Last month, Alibaba, which operates from Hangzhou, created a new division called the Qwen Consumer Business Group. Company vice-president Wu Jia leads this unit, which manages the Qwen chatbot app, the Quark AI assistant and cloud drive, AI hardware products, the UC Browser and Shuqi, an online reading platform.

At the same time, analyst Friedrich said a weekly close above $88,500 could confirm the range break after weeks of consolidation above $80,000. Whale cohort balance flips positive on 30 day view Onchain data shared by Crypto Rover showed a sharp shift in Bitcoin whale balances over the past 30 days, with the 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC cohort turning strongly positive near early January. Whales and Exchanges over 1k BTC Balance Change 30 day. Source: Crypto Rover/X The chart, titled “Whales and Exchanges (>1k BTC) Balance Change (30 day),” plots a blue area for the cohort’s 30 day balance change alongside a gray Bitcoin price line. In the highlighted section at the far right, the blue area jumps from near zero to one of the highest readings on the full timeline. Because the metric tracks net balance changes, a move above zero typically signals that wallets in that size band increased holdings over the period. Meanwhile, the price line near the same window looks more muted than the balance spike, so the accumulation signal stands out more than the price move in the snapshot. The post did not include a breakdown by entity type or venue, so the chart alone cannot show whether the shift came from new purchases, internal transfers, or reclassification of wallets. Still, it captures a clear change in direction for large holder balances compared with the prior weeks shown on the same view.

This gathering arrives at a pivotal moment, strategically positioned to equip industry participants with actionable insights ahead of anticipated market cycles. 2026 Seoul Signal Web3 Event: A Strategic Confluence in Asia’s Crypto Hub The announcement of the 2026 Seoul Signal conference underscores Seoul’s established role as a leading hub for technological innovation and cryptocurrency adoption. Consequently, the choice of venue and timing is deliberate. Gangnam, Seoul’s affluent business center, frequently hosts high-profile fintech and technology forums. Furthermore, the event’s scheduled date in early 2026 allows participants to analyze post-2024 Bitcoin halving trends and regulatory developments. The conference, formally titled “Navigating the Next Wave of Web3,” will dissect the industry’s trajectory through three core lenses: market structure, capital flow, and execution strategy . Organizers designed the event to bridge the gap between high-level theory and ground-level application. Therefore, it will cater specifically to builders developing decentralized applications, creators exploring tokenized economies, and traders navigating volatile digital asset markets. The inclusion of Bitcoin World as a media partner adds a layer of industry-specific credibility and reach, connecting the event to a global cryptocurrency audience. Deconstructing the Web3 Landscape: Market Structure and Capital Flow A primary focus of the 2026 Seoul Signal will be the evolving market structure of Web3. This analysis moves beyond simple price speculation to examine foundational shifts. For instance, key topics will likely include the maturation of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the interoperability between different blockchain networks, and the regulatory frameworks taking shape across major APAC economies like Japan, Singapore, and South Korea itself. Understanding these structural elements is crucial for long-term planning and risk assessment. Simultaneously, tracking capital flow remains essential for identifying growth sectors. Venture capital investment in blockchain startups often signals confidence in specific technological verticals, such as zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), or real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The event will provide a platform to analyze where institutional and venture capital is deploying funds, offering attendees a data-driven view of the next potential growth areas within the broader Web3 ecosystem. The Execution Challenge: From Insight to Action Possessing market insight is one challenge; executing a successful strategy is another. The third pillar of the event, execution strategy , addresses this directly. Panels and speeches will presumably cover practical subjects like go-to-market strategies for Web3 projects, effective community governance models, and sustainable tokenomics design. This focus on execution aligns with the stated goal of preparing attendees for the potential 2026 bull market, emphasizing that preparation requires more than just market timing—it demands operational excellence. The event’s format supports this practical aim. In addition to keynote speeches, the schedule allocates significant time for networking, a prize drawing, and a reception. These segments are not mere social additions. Instead, they facilitate the peer-to-peer knowledge exchange and partnership formation that often drives real-world project development and investment opportunities in the collaborative Web3 space. The APAC Context: Why Seoul and Why Now? The partnership between K1 Research and Klein Labs itself tells a story about the region’s dynamics. K1 Research specializes in APAC market entry consulting, guiding international firms through the complex regulatory and commercial landscapes of Asian countries. Klein Labs operates as a Web3 venture capital accelerator, providing funding and mentorship to early-stage blockchain companies. Their collaboration signifies a confluence of market access expertise and deep-tech investment acumen, a combination highly relevant for projects seeking scale. South Korea has consistently demonstrated robust retail and institutional interest in digital assets. The country’s advanced digital infrastructure, tech-savvy population, and government initiatives in the metaverse and blockchain sectors create a fertile environment for Web3 innovation. Hosting a forward-looking event in early 2026 allows the industry to synthesize lessons from the previous market cycle and establish a coherent framework for the next phase of growth, with a distinct APAC perspective. 2026 Seoul Signal: Event Overview Element Detail Event Title 2026 Seoul Signal: Navigating the Next Wave of Web3 Date January 22, 2026 Location People the Terrace, Gangnam, Seoul, South Korea Hosts K1 Research & Klein Labs Media Partner Bitcoin World Primary Audience Builders, Creators, Traders Core Themes Market Structure, Capital Flow, Execution Strategy Conclusion The 2026 Seoul Signal Web3 event represents a strategically timed initiative to foster knowledge and collaboration within the blockchain industry.

DAPP's top holdings are heavily dependent on Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, despite the ETF's stated goal of tracking broader blockchain equities. Net inflows and stablecoin market cap growth signal renewed investor confidence and increasing fiat entry into the crypto ecosystem. I recommend a tactical buy for DAPP, with careful timing, profit-taking, and a portfolio allocation not exceeding 5% due to high volatility. Investment Thesis DAPP is an ETF that focuses on the blockchain sector, but despite this not being intentional, it has maintained a close relationship with Bitcoin thus far. However, although it may be a good option for the long term, this sector is highly volatile and subject to significant drawdowns, so entries should be tactical, with careful timing, taking profits, and potentially re-entering if conditions improve. Currently, we recommend initiating a position based on signs of bottom/base consolidation and a still-supportive macro backdrop. ETF Overview The VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ) is a way to gain exposure to the crypto ecosystem without investing directly ( or indirectly ) in digital currencies. Its objective is to track the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index (MV DAPP TR) (Total Return, i.e., price appreciation plus dividends) before fees and expenses. To do this, it invests in listed companies whose business model is closely related to the blockchain and crypto ecosystem, and, as reflected in the fact sheet, the fund is not expected to track the price movement of any crypto asset. Fund Web Although it distributes dividends (annually), DAPP is an ETF designed to generate returns primarily through price appreciation (price return), with annual distributions. Finally, DAPP currently has a Total Expense Ratio of 0.51% and a YTD return of 13.24% to date. Holdings According to its documentation, the fund performs quarterly rebalancing and must have at least 20 different holdings in its portfolio. DAPP Holdings (Fund Web) To better understand what the ETF invests in, let's summarize the activity and business of the top ten positions that represent more than 60% of the total weight: Block Inc. (XYZ US) : Fintech for payments and financial services. Its crypto arm is Cash App, through which users can buy/sell crypto assets and make Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network, although it also offers access to Bitcoin L1 for transfers between wallets. Coinbase Global (COIN US) : It is the (centralized) bridge between the traditional system and the blockchain world. Its main business is exchange/brokerage, but its custody services are also important. It monetizes mainly through transaction fees and custody services, staking, etc. Strategy Inc. (MSTR US) : Already well known to everyone, it acts primarily as a Bitcoin Treasury Company. It is probably the asset that has the strongest correlation with the price of Bitcoin. Strategy Inc. also has its Power BI-type software business, but it is becoming increasingly less relevant. IREN Ltd. (IREN US) : Infrastructure (data centers) for Bitcoin mining. They are also developing the AI/HPC side of the business. Their revenue depends on mining pools and, secondarily, on the cloud rental side for AI/HPC. Therefore, to pay costs, they must sell Bitcoin to obtain cash, which means that a large share of their cash generation (and operating economics) is ultimately tied to BTC price. Hut 8 Corp. is a mixed model that combines revenue from its own mining operations and digital infrastructure leasing. Furthermore, compared to IREN, Hut 8 explicitly communicates a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and “at-the-market (ATM) purchases” (e.g., $100 million purchase) as part of its capital strategy. In addition, it uses BTC in its financing strategy (“Digital assets – pledged as collateral”), a noteworthy development that underscores how Bitcoin is starting to be used as collateral in corporate operations. Metaplanet Inc.: Its relationship with the crypto world is through the business model of a Bitcoin treasury company: it accumulates BTC through financing. Similar case to Strategy Inc. Circle Internet Group Inc.: Issuer of USDC. Its business model is similar to that of Tether: it earns money from interest on reserves ( U.S. Treasury securities + U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements (repos) + cash ). It is mainly affected by the volume of activity and interest in using the crypto system, whether for investing, speculating, or transferring from the traditional system to the blockchain for other uses. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc.: Its business model is that of an Ethereum Treasury together with passive income from staking. Therefore, it maintains a close relationship with the price of Ethereum in order to monetize. Applied Digital Corp.: Similar to Hut 8, its model focuses on operating and building infrastructure for mining and AI/HPC. However, unlike Hut 8, it monetizes through infrastructure leasing, so its monetization is more closely linked to the growth of the crypto ecosystem (development of platforms, applications, infrastructure, increase in business volume, etc.) than to the price of an asset. Riot Platforms Inc.: A company currently focused solely on Bitcoin mining, with its primary cash generation coming from selling mined Bitcoin. It also has other sources of income: engineering and power credits. If you've made it this far, you'll have noticed that the top holdings profile somewhat contradicts the idea of not expecting the ETF to follow the price/movements of any crypto asset when several of its holdings have a revenue model that is closely dependent on the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum. DAPP vs BTC-USD (TradingView) If we compare Bitcoin’s price action with DAPP’s, we can clearly see the influence of Bitcoin movements on the valuation of the ETF. Given that Bitcoin acts as the main proxy for the crypto market (rule of thumb: if Bitcoin rises, the crypto market follows), and at the same time we can see how many of these holdings are closely dependent on its price, I believe it is prudent to monitor Bitcoin and the forces that may influence it as a factor in determining the direction of DAPP. From this perspective, we recently published an article on GBTC , analyzing the current situation of the asset. Despite the volatility derived from speculation in the derivatives markets, based on cohort analysis and selling pressure fatigue, the signal is that capitulation has ended and we are beginning to see the first green shoots of accumulation. However, the value of Bitcoin is not the only factor influencing DAPP, given that this fund is a bet on emerging companies in the sector and therefore its business models depend on macroeconomic conditions, financing, sector growth, adoption, integration of technology in the “real world,” as well as interest in it, regulatory advances, etc. That is why, to gain some perspective, we will use ETF flows as a proxy for investor demand and also assess the dollars entering the ecosystem. Cumulative ETF Flow (Artemis XYZ) ETFs Net Flow (Artemis XYZ) In the first image , we show cumulative net inflows, while in the second , net inflows. Both are weekly time series. While it is true that following the correction since the peak in September-October, cumulative net inflows have rebounded for several weeks, reinforcing the idea of those “green shoots” we mentioned earlier, in which we are beginning to see signs of growing strength in demand. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that in the second half of 2025 there has not been a single week of negative flows; all have been positive, even in the worst moments. Although there has been some profit-taking, this positive net flow reinforces the fact that most participants are buying with a long-term view, showing confidence in the asset. Total Stablecoin Market Cap (CoinGlass) In addition to this, with the Total Market Cap of Stablecoins , we can visualize the volume of fiat currencies that have entered the blockchain ecosystem. In 2024 alone, the volume grew from $123 billion to $188 billion (approximately 52%), and despite the fact that performance in 2025 has been worse, the volume has continued to grow at a similar rate, going from $188 billion to $268 billion. This represents an approximate growth of 42%, which, for the moment, with favorable news in terms of regulation and adoption, together with projects such as Cash App that are bringing utility to retail, adds factors in favor of the trend continuing to grow in 2026, remaining a strong driver for asset appreciation and increased use of blockchain services. Conclusion DAPP is a high-volatility ETF with deep/severe drawdowns, but it can offer attractive opportunities if entries are timed well. The blockchain industry is maturing, with more and more real services emerging and DeFi continuing to integrate into everyday life and traditional finance. DAPP is a bet on the evolution, revaluation, and continuity of this sector, but it is still very sensitive, so positioning/entries should be tactical and with a small portion of the portfolio (no more than 5%). Currently, I would recommend buying, given that we are in the final stages of bottoming out and are beginning to see positive patterns in demand. Similarly, it is a position in which I would take profits progressively and exit/close the position if macro signals confirm a regime shift that turns unfavorable for high-beta equities.",DAPP,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-12 09:28:57

Large caps are behaving steadily yet their potential of increasing is diminished than during early phases. Simultaneously, the low priced tokens are becoming increasingly popular as better value entry points and increased asymmetry. One of them has begun to spearhead initial speculation as demand rises prior to its protocol becoming live. The project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and other analysts now feel that the project may do better than Solana in the next crypto growth cycle. Solana (SOL) One of the stronger moves in the recent cycles is Solana (SOL). It currently trades at under the level of $150 having fallen off earlier high levels in the last year. Solana is a multi-billion dollar channel top and one of the busiest altcoins in terms of network activity. The developer activity is also high, however, the price growth expectation is no longer high as in the earlier stages. Technical perspectives reveal that the resistance is around $175 and $190. Solana will require higher liquidity inflows and favorable macro momentum to overcome these zones according to many analysts. Another thing that attracts investors is that Solana already achieved its great initial multiple, which is more difficult to obtain at present valuations. It is due to this that certain investors are trading into smaller tokens, which are cheaper to trade and have greater upside potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is an upcoming new crypto lending program that is about to undergo its mainnet launch. The system will facilitate collateralized lending and on-chain generation of returns. Borrowers will have access to capital to borrow with collateral, and users will be able to provide assets to earn APY. Such mechanics are typical of decentralized finance, and as noted in history have resulted in real protocol usage when live. Another active presale in token form is Mutuum Finance. MUTM is sold at $0.04 and the presale has gone through several pricing stages. Every level has a definite quota and a price increment over the last level that rewards those who commit first and the increasing engagement. The protocol has also undergone a smart contract audit by Halborn , a reputable blockchain security company, providing the investors with extra assurance before the release of V1. Positioning and Investor Contrast The difference between SOL and MUTM is apparent. Solana is an established brand with a significant market capital. It is the one that draws institutional attention, but has little more upside to go. The new entrants into the SOL are working on moderate returns as opposed to exponential growth. Mutuum Finance is in another position. It is being sold at $0.04 and is yet to be open marketed. This is perceived by investors as a pre-utility window where the expectations increase prior to the activation of the protocol. Smaller tokens that have utility usually do better in start up stages due to the fact that they transition out of idea value to execution value. This is where such incidences as repricing normally take place. With a mere contrast, the difference becomes easier to grasp. A $450 investment in SOL will just purchase a little bit of tokens at levels of price now. The same amount of $450 invested in MUTM will have a swimmer count of tokens at a much lower valuation. In the event that both assets grow the mathematical advantage is to the low price asset to multiply higher. That is why such arrangements are compared by numerous investors. It is not about replacing SOL. It is of having a better asymmetry. Phase 7 Acceleration and Protocol Launch Mutuum Finance will be launching V1 protocol . V1 will open a lending business, collateral tracking, logic of interest and yield generation. Analysts consider this launch as the primary driving force as it will turn the project into a matter of speculation to actual usage. New demand and new pricing profile are frequent by products that are activated by utility. The presale phase 7 is currently moving at a fast rate. The rest of the allocation keeps decreasing with new entrants of investors and whale wallets. Analysts monitor the activity in the presale since the catalyst windows are usually coincidental with late stage phases. Phase 7 in this case coincides with V1 launch. This has contributed to propelling Mutuum Finance to the top Q1 2026 speculation. As Solana falls below $150 and current growth expectations are weaker, other investors are shifting to early stage DeFi projects such as MUTM that are more affordable and utility-led growth. Once the protocol launches its V1 on schedule, analysts are of the view that the current pricing window might not be long-lasting.

This critical move, confirmed on [Current Date], follows direct guidance from domestic regulatory authorities and results in BingX’s removal from Upbit’s verified list of exchanges with compliant account holder identification procedures. Consequently, this action directly impacts user fund flows and underscores the intensifying regulatory scrutiny within one of the world’s most active crypto markets. Upbit BingX Suspension: The Regulatory Catalyst Upbit’s operational decision stems from evolving regulatory expectations. The exchange operates under the strict oversight of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). These bodies enforce rigorous Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) frameworks. Furthermore, the Specific Financial Information Act mandates that all virtual asset service providers maintain and share verified user identification data for cross-transactions. When an external exchange like BingX fails to meet the verification standards required by South Korean authorities, platforms like Upbit must sever transactional links. This process, therefore, protects the integrity of the domestic financial system. The suspension is not an isolated event. Instead, it reflects a broader, global trend of regulatory fragmentation. For instance, exchanges now navigate a complex web of jurisdictional requirements. Upbit’s action demonstrates proactive compliance to maintain its operating license. The table below outlines key regulatory requirements for South Korean crypto exchanges: Requirement Description Governing Body Real-Name Verification Bank accounts must match exchange account holder names exactly. FSC Travel Rule Compliance Exchanges must share sender/receiver info for transfers over ~$830. FIU AML Program Mandatory systems to detect and report suspicious transactions. FIU Partner VASP Due Diligence Exchanges must verify the compliance of counterparty platforms. FSC/FIU Immediate Impact on Traders and Market Dynamics The practical effect for users is immediate and tangible. Traders can no longer directly transfer assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum between their Upbit and BingX accounts. This restriction disrupts common strategies such as arbitrage, which relies on moving funds quickly between platforms to exploit price differences. Additionally, users who held assets on BingX for specific trading features must now find alternative withdrawal routes, potentially incurring extra fees and delays. Market analysts observe that such suspensions can influence liquidity and price discovery. When a major gateway like Upbit restricts access to a global platform, it can temporarily create a premium or discount for assets on the isolated exchange. However, the South Korean market often demonstrates resilience. Traders typically pivot to other verified international partners. Upbit’s list of approved counterparties includes other major global exchanges that meet its compliance bar, ensuring continued, albeit redirected, market access for its users. User Action Required: Traders must cancel any pending deposit/withdrawal orders between Upbit and BingX. Alternative Routes: Assets may be moved via a third, compliant exchange or a private wallet, adding steps. No Fund Safety Impact: The suspension affects transfers only; existing funds on either platform remain secure. Expert Analysis on Compliance Trends Financial compliance experts frame this within a global regulatory tightening phase. “This is a clear example of a tier-one exchange prioritizing regulatory adherence over sheer connectivity,” notes a fintech compliance specialist familiar with Asian markets. “South Korea has established itself as a jurisdiction with a high compliance threshold. Exchanges like Upbit are not just following rules; they are actively managing their risk exposure by auditing their network of partner exchanges. This due diligence is becoming a standard operational cost.” The specialist further explains that the 2025 landscape demands such measures, especially with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) continuing to evaluate countries’ AML regimes. The timeline of South Korea’s regulatory approach provides crucial context. After the 2017 boom, the government implemented strict real-name banking rules in 2018. The Specific Financial Information Act came into full effect in 2021, formalizing the Travel Rule. Since then, the FIU has periodically issued guidance and warnings to exchanges, leading to similar suspensions with other offshore platforms in the past. This action with BingX, therefore, fits an established pattern of enforcement aimed at preventing illicit fund flows and protecting consumers. Broader Implications for the Crypto Industry This event highlights the growing operational divide between exchanges in heavily regulated jurisdictions and those operating in less-defined regulatory environments. For global platforms like BingX, gaining access to markets like South Korea increasingly requires building robust, verifiable compliance infrastructure that can satisfy local authorities. This trend pushes the industry toward standardization but also risks creating walled gardens where capital movement is restricted between regulatory zones. For investors, the key takeaway is the paramount importance of regulatory compliance for exchange longevity and user asset safety. While decentralized finance (DeFi) offers alternative pathways, centralized exchanges remain the primary fiat on-ramps. Their ability to operate within the law directly affects mainstream adoption. Events like Upbit’s suspension serve as a reminder that in the maturing crypto ecosystem, regulatory strategy is as critical as trading technology. Conclusion Upbit’s decision to suspend deposits and withdrawals with BingX is a definitive action rooted in South Korea’s stringent regulatory framework. This move safeguards Upbit’s compliance status and reflects a mature, risk-aware approach to operations. While it introduces temporary friction for some traders, it reinforces the stability and legitimacy of the regulated market segment. The Upbit BingX suspension ultimately signals the crypto industry’s ongoing maturation, where security and compliance are becoming non-negotiable pillars alongside innovation and accessibility. FAQs Q1: Can I still trade on Upbit and BingX separately? A: Yes. The suspension only blocks direct transfers between the two platforms. You can still trade assets independently on each exchange. Q2: Will my funds on BingX be frozen because of this? A: No. The suspension is on Upbit’s side for transactions involving BingX addresses. Your assets on BingX itself are not frozen and can be withdrawn to other wallets or compliant exchanges. Q3: How long will this suspension last? A: Upbit has not announced an end date. Typically, such suspensions remain until the external exchange (BingX) can demonstrate to South Korean authorities that it meets all required verification and compliance standards. Q4: Which exchanges can I still transfer to from Upbit? A: Upbit maintains a list of verified partner exchanges on its website and notice pages. These are platforms that have passed its due diligence checks for account holder identification and regulatory compliance. Q5: Does this mean BingX is unsafe or illegal? A: Not necessarily. It specifically means that, at this time, BingX does not meet the particular account verification standards required by South Korean regulators for direct transactional partnerships with domestic exchanges like Upbit. Its legal status varies by jurisdiction.

The price jump came as the network’s difficulty eased to about 146.4 trillion, giving miners a short breather. Bitcoin difficulty dips as BTC trades near $90,500 Bitcoin's mining difficulty edged lower at the start of 2026 after a long stretch of stepwise gains, according to a chart shared by NekoZ on X that carries a CryptoQuant watermark. The dip marked a break from the steady climb that pushed the difficulty line to a peak near the late 2025 highs before it turned down. Bitcoin Price USD and Mining Difficulty. Source: CryptoQuant/X The chart tracks Bitcoin price in white and mining difficulty in blue from 2023 into early 2026. At the right edge, BTC held around $90,500 while difficulty sat near 146.4 trillion, down from the recent peak, which signals the network adjusted to slightly easier conditions for miners. Bitcoin changes difficulty roughly every two weeks, so a move lower typically points to slower block production in the prior period. In practice, that can happen when some hashing power drops off, because operators shut down less efficient machines or pause during weaker margins. A lower difficulty can lift the expected share of block rewards for miners who stay online, since they face less competition per unit of hash rate. However, the relief depends on price and fees, because miner revenue still tracks the dollar value of rewards and the pace of transaction fee demand. Bitcoin rallies into the close on 5 minute chart Bitcoin jumped in late trading on Jan. 12, pushing above $92,000 after a steady climb on the 5 minute chart shared by Barchart on X.

The Financial Services Commission, the country’s top financial regulator, wants to bring institutional capital into the digital currency market that is currently dominated by retail traders. More than 3,500 listed companies and investor-registered corporations will be permitted to invest up to 5% of their equity capital in virtual assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The law changes are part of the second phase of corporate participation in the virtual currency market, which the Financial Services Commission first outlined in February last year. South Korea’s FSC lay new regulatory groundwork for corporate crypto investments According to local news outlet Seoul Economic Daily, the FSC completed the first steps toward implementation at the start of the year. The regulator had already established guidelines governing crypto trading by listed entities and shared them with a public-private task force on January 6. Previously, authorities had said they would pursue coin investment by listed companies and professional investor-registered corporations after the second half of 2025. A senior financial official familiar with the discussions said the authorities will release the final guidelines in January-February, which will greenlight virtual currency transactions for investment and financial purposes by legal entities within the year. They also mentioned the commission is in talks with lawmakers to release a legislative proposal of the Framework Law on Digital Assets, expected in the first quarter of 2026. In the framework, each company will face an annual deposit or investment ceiling capped at 5% of its equity capital. Companies will be allowed to invest only in virtual currencies ranked within the top 20 by market capitalization, based on half-yearly figures published by the country’s five largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Dollar-backed stablecoins’ inclusion is under discussion, since the country could soon launch a won-pegged stablecoin by January 20, Business Korea reported . Some market participants have welcomed the decision to allow corporate investment, saying the decision has been long overdue. However, some have criticized the 5% cap as overly restrictive compared with the situation in the United States and Japan , where no explicit limits have been imposed on corporate crypto investment. “The constitution of the domestic virtual currency market will improve once corporate transactions begin,” said one insider, who also explained that the limits could weaken capital inflows and fend off virtual asset investment firms. South Korea expects institutional inflows in Bitcoin The government lifting a nine-year-old barrier for listed companies could lead to tens of trillions of won into the market, according to economists in the country. Conglomerate Naver, which merged with Upbit owner Dunamu last year, held equity capital of about 27 trillion won as of September. If the new rules are enacted, the company could allocate more than 5% of that amount into bitcoin holdings exceeding 10,000 units at prices of roughly 130 million won per coin. Market participants also expect related initiatives to gain momentum once corporate investment capacity is secured, including the potential launch of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund. South Korea’s virtual currency sector surpassed 10 million investors in the first half of last year, but individual traders account for nearly all activity since 76 trillion won flowed overseas. In other related regulatory news, South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled last week that Bitcoin held on cryptocurrency exchanges can be seized under the Criminal Procedure Act. The judgment came from a dispute over whether digital assets qualify as property subject to confiscation. Local police had seized 55.6 bitcoins valued at about 600 million won from an exchange account linked to an individual identified as Mr. A. The assets were taken during a money laundering investigation. However, Mr. A challenged the seizure, arguing that bitcoin stored in an exchange account was not a physical object under Article 106 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The plaintiff had taken his case to lower courts, which rejected the argument, and he saw an appeal at the Supreme Court, which upheld those rulings. “Under the Criminal Procedure Act, seizure targets include both tangible objects and electronic information,” the court said.

The Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) is a transformative global standard developed by the OECD to eliminate tax evasion in the digital asset sector. Backed by over 50 jurisdictions —including the EU , UK , and India —the framework fundamentally shifts the compliance landscape by ending the relative anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions. As of 2026 , this initiative mandates automatic data sharing between countries, ensuring that tax authorities have complete visibility into foreign holdings and trading activity. How Will Global Data Sharing Work Under CARF? Starting in 2027 , the core mechanism of CARF kicks in: the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) . This system is designed to close the information gap that previously allowed investors to hide assets in offshore accounts or foreign exchanges. Mandatory Automatic Exchange: Tax authorities will automatically receive and exchange data regarding crypto transactions that occurred during the 2026 calendar year . This means your 2026 trading history will be visible to your home country’s tax office by 2027. Foreign Assets Visibility: The “offshore loophole” is effectively closed. If you use a foreign exchange or wallet provider, that entity is now legally required to send your transaction history directly to your home country’s tax authority. Standardized XML Format: To ensure data is instantly actionable, all participating nations will use a uniform XML schema . This standardization allows tax auditors to instantly ingest, process, and cross-reference millions of global transactions without manual conversion. What Are the New Obligations for Crypto Service Providers (RCASPs)? The burden of compliance falls heavily on Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (RCASPs) . This classification encompasses crypto exchanges, brokers, custodial wallet providers, and even certain DeFi protocols that exercise central influence. Identity Verification (Due Diligence): Effective January 1, 2026 , providers must collect rigorous “self-certifications” from all users. This includes verifying the user’s full name, physical address, date of birth, and most importantly, their Tax Identification Number (TIN) . Comprehensive Transaction Tracking: RCASPs are mandated to record and report four specific categories of events: Crypto-to-fiat exchanges (e.g., selling Bitcoin for USD or EUR). Crypto-to-crypto swaps (e.g., trading Ethereum for Solana ). Asset Transfers: Movements of assets to external wallets, including payments made for goods or services. High-Value Retail Payments: Any retail payment transaction exceeding $50,000 . How Does CARF Affect Individual Taxpayers and Audits? For the individual investor, CARF signals the end of “grey zones” in crypto taxation. The increased visibility empowers tax authorities to act with greater speed and precision. Automated Compliance & Pre-filling: Tax authorities will utilize the influx of data to pre-fill tax returns or automatically flag discrepancies between reported income and actual blockchain activity. Failure to disclose gains will likely trigger immediate compliance letters or automated audits. Increased Penalties: Jurisdictions are enacting strict fines for non-compliance. For instance, the UK and India have aligned their penalties with existing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and black money laws, punishing users who fail to provide a valid TIN or underreport income. Retroactive Scrutiny: Because the framework requires identifying historical cost basis to calculate gains accurately, the audit process may inadvertently uncover undeclared profits from previous years, exposing taxpayers to retroactive tax bills and interest. When Does CARF Implementation Begin in the EU, UK, and India? While the global framework is unified, implementation timelines vary slightly by jurisdiction. European Union (DAC8): The EU’s version, known as DAC8 , becomes effective on January 1, 2026 , with the first mandatory reporting due by January 31, 2027 . United Kingdom: Mandatory data collection commences on January 1, 2026 , with the first international data exchange scheduled for May 31, 2027 . India: Domestic enforcement is set for April 1, 2027 , aligning with the start of the fiscal year, with global data exchanges beginning later that same year. United States: While the US is not a direct signatory to CARF as of early 2026, the IRS has implemented Form 1099-DA (effective for the 2025/2026 tax years), which is largely compatible with CARF standards, ensuring seamless data interoperability. Frequently Asked Questions Will DeFi users be reported under CARF rules? Yes, in many cases. The definition of Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (RCASPs) includes decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols if they have a point of “central influence” or control. Consequently, users interacting with major DeFi platforms that fall under this definition will be subject to the same Know Your Customer (KYC) and reporting requirements as centralized exchanges. Do I need to provide my TIN to foreign crypto exchanges? Yes. Under CARF , foreign exchanges are legally required to collect your Tax Identification Number (TIN) to report your activity back to your country of residence. Refusing to provide this information may result in your account being frozen or restricted, as the provider faces severe penalties for non-compliance. How does CARF differ from the US Form 1099-DA? CARF is an international standard developed by the OECD for cross-border data sharing, whereas Form 1099-DA is a specific US domestic tax form issued by the IRS . However, both frameworks share the same goal: they require brokers to report digital asset proceeds and cost basis information to tax authorities, effectively eliminating anonymity for both US and international investors. Conclusion The implementation of the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) in 2026 marks a definitive turning point for the digital asset industry. By establishing a standardized, global pipeline for tax data, it effectively eradicates the era of financial privacy in crypto. For investors, the strategic takeaway is clear: with automatic data exchange beginning in 2027 , proactive compliance and accurate record-keeping are no longer optional—they are essential to avoiding severe penalties in this new regulatory reality.

Market analysts from Cointelegraph and other leading firms highlight a potential leverage squeeze, crucial inflation data, and shifting whale behavior as primary forces that could determine Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Consequently, understanding these elements provides essential context for navigating the week’s volatility. Bitcoin Market Analysis: The Leverage Squeeze Dynamics The cryptocurrency derivatives market currently shows elevated leverage levels across major exchanges. This situation creates a fragile environment where rapid price movements can trigger cascading liquidations. For instance, data from analytics platforms like CoinGlass indicates that a price move of just 5-7% in either direction could liquidate over $500 million in leveraged positions. Therefore, traders must monitor funding rates and open interest closely. Historically, leverage squeezes follow a predictable pattern. Initially, a sharp price movement triggers stop-loss orders. Subsequently, liquidations accelerate as collateral values drop. Finally, the market often experiences a violent reversal once excess leverage clears. This mechanism explains why analysts warn of sharp short-term fluctuations. Market participants should prepare for increased volatility without clear directional bias in the immediate term. Historical Context and Current Metrics Comparing current leverage ratios to previous market cycles reveals important insights. During the 2021 bull market, similar conditions preceded corrections exceeding 20%. Currently, the estimated leverage ratio across perpetual futures sits near yearly highs. This metric, calculated by dividing open interest by spot market capitalization, serves as a reliable risk indicator. Meanwhile, exchange reserves remain stable, suggesting the squeeze stems from derivatives, not spot selling pressure. U.S. CPI Data Release and Macroeconomic Impact The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release December’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data this Wednesday. This inflation report carries significant weight for all risk assets, including Bitcoin. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project a month-over-month increase of 0.2% and a year-over-year reading of 3.1%. Any deviation from these expectations will likely trigger immediate market reactions. Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has strengthened throughout 2024. Specifically, the cryptocurrency now shows increased sensitivity to interest rate expectations and dollar strength. A higher-than-expected CPI reading could reinforce hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric, potentially strengthening the dollar and pressuring Bitcoin. Conversely, cooler inflation data might boost risk appetite across financial markets. Recent CPI Data and Bitcoin’s 24-Hour Reaction Release Date CPI Reading Bitcoin Price Change November 2024 3.2% YoY +2.1% October 2024 3.7% YoY -4.3% September 2024 3.8% YoY -5.8% This pattern demonstrates Bitcoin’s growing integration with macroeconomic narratives. Furthermore, the timing of the CPI release coincides with the leverage situation, creating a potential volatility amplifier. Traders should therefore monitor bond yields and dollar index movements alongside the headline CPI number. Bitcoin Whale Position Reduction on Bitfinex On-chain data reveals a notable reduction in long positions held by large-scale investors, commonly called whales, on the Bitfinex exchange. Analytics firm CryptoQuant reports a 15% decrease in these positions over the past seven days. While often viewed as a bearish signal, this development requires nuanced interpretation. Whale behavior serves as a sentiment indicator but not an infallible predictor. Sometimes, position reductions indicate profit-taking rather than outright bearishness. Other times, whales rotate capital into other assets or move holdings to cold storage. The current reduction coincides with Bitcoin’s consolidation below the $45,000 resistance level, suggesting some large players are adopting a cautious stance. Expert Analysis of On-Chain Flows Leading blockchain analysts provide additional context. According to their research, the outflow from Bitfinex represents a redistribution rather than a mass exit. A significant portion of these funds moved to custody solutions, indicating a long-term holding strategy. Additionally, exchange netflow metrics across all platforms remain neutral, contradicting narratives of widespread selling pressure. This data suggests the market sits in equilibrium, awaiting a catalyst. Interconnected Market Forces and Trader Strategy These three factors do not operate in isolation. Instead, they create a complex web of influences. The leverage squeeze magnifies reactions to the CPI data. Simultaneously, whale behavior reflects institutional sentiment about both technical and fundamental conditions. Successful navigation requires monitoring all elements simultaneously. Professional traders typically employ specific strategies during such periods. First, they reduce leverage to withstand volatility spikes. Second, they set wider stop-loss orders to avoid getting liquidated by temporary swings. Third, they allocate capital to both sides of the market through options strategies. Retail investors should consider similar precautions. Monitor Funding Rates: Sustained negative funding often precedes short squeezes. Watch Bond Markets: The 10-year Treasury yield reaction to CPI provides clues. Track Exchange Flows: Sudden inflows to exchanges can signal selling intent. Review Support Levels: Key technical levels become crucial during volatility. Conclusion This week’s Bitcoin market analysis reveals a landscape defined by technical fragility, macroeconomic uncertainty, and shifting institutional positioning. The convergence of a potential leverage squeeze, critical CPI data, and whale position changes creates a high-stakes environment for all participants. While short-term price direction remains uncertain, understanding these interconnected factors provides a framework for informed decision-making. Ultimately, markets that successfully navigate such complex periods often emerge with healthier foundations and clearer trends. FAQs Q1: What is a leverage squeeze in cryptocurrency markets? A leverage squeeze occurs when highly leveraged positions get forcibly liquidated due to price movements, creating cascading effects that amplify volatility and often lead to sharp, unpredictable price swings. Q2: Why does U.S. CPI data affect Bitcoin prices? CPI data influences Federal Reserve policy expectations, which affect interest rates, dollar strength, and overall risk appetite. Bitcoin, as a risk-sensitive asset, often reacts to changes in these macroeconomic conditions. Q3: Are whale position reductions always bearish for Bitcoin? Not necessarily. While often interpreted as bearish, position reductions can indicate profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or movement to secure storage rather than a loss of confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects. Q4: How can traders protect themselves during high leverage periods? Traders can reduce their own leverage exposure, use wider stop-loss orders, diversify across timeframes, and consider options strategies that profit from volatility rather than directional bets. Q5: What time is the CPI data released, and where can I watch it? The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics typically releases CPI data at 8:30 AM Eastern Time. Financial news networks like Bloomberg and CNBC provide immediate coverage, while the BLS website publishes the official report.

Rowe Price and Canary Funds,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-crypto-etf-decision-2/,"BitcoinWorld SEC Crypto ETF Delay: Critical 45-Day Extension for T. Rowe Price and Canary Funds WASHINGTON, D.C., January 12, 2025 – The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has implemented a significant regulatory pause, delaying its decision on two prominent cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. This SEC crypto ETF delay represents another chapter in the ongoing regulatory scrutiny of digital asset investment products. The commission announced it would take up to an additional 45 days to review proposals from traditional finance giant T. Rowe Price and crypto-focused firm Canary Capital. Understanding the SEC Crypto ETF Delay Mechanism The SEC operates under specific statutory timelines when reviewing proposed rule changes. Under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, the commission typically has 45 days to approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove a proposed rule change. When the SEC institutes proceedings, as it has done with these ETF applications, it gains an additional 45 days for review, with the possibility of further extensions up to 90 days. This procedural move allows regulators to conduct more thorough analysis of complex financial products. The commission specifically cited the need for additional time to consider the proposed rule changes’ consistency with the Exchange Act and applicable rules. Market participants generally view such delays as standard procedure rather than outright rejection signals. T. Rowe Price’s Active Crypto ETF Strategy T. Rowe Price, a traditional asset management firm with over $1.4 trillion in assets under management, represents established finance entering the cryptocurrency space. The firm’s proposed actively managed crypto ETF would differ significantly from the passive bitcoin ETFs approved in early 2024. Active management allows portfolio managers to make strategic decisions about cryptocurrency allocations rather than simply tracking an index. The firm’s application highlights several key features: Professional Management: Experienced portfolio managers would actively select cryptocurrencies Risk Management: Institutional-grade security protocols and custody solutions Diversification: Potential exposure to multiple digital assets beyond bitcoin Liquidity Considerations: Focus on cryptocurrencies with sufficient trading volume This approach contrasts with the firm’s traditional investment philosophy, demonstrating how established financial institutions are adapting to digital asset markets. Canary’s PENGU Spot ETF Innovation Canary Capital’s PENGU spot ETF proposal represents a different approach to cryptocurrency investment vehicles. The fund would provide direct exposure to cryptocurrency prices without using futures contracts. Spot ETFs hold the actual underlying assets, potentially offering more precise price tracking than futures-based products. The PENGU ETF’s structure raises several regulatory considerations that likely contributed to the SEC’s decision to extend its review period. These include custody arrangements for digital assets, valuation methodologies for less liquid cryptocurrencies, and market surveillance mechanisms to detect manipulation. The SEC has historically expressed concerns about these aspects when evaluating spot cryptocurrency ETFs. Parallel Development: Grayscale Options Commentary Period Simultaneously with the ETF delays, the SEC initiated a public comment period regarding options trading for the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF. This fund tracks an index comprising five major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). The comment solicitation represents a separate but related regulatory process. Options trading would provide investors with additional strategies for managing risk and expressing views on cryptocurrency price movements. The table below illustrates the current composition of the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto5 ETF: Cryptocurrency Ticker Approximate Weight Bitcoin BTC 40% Ethereum ETH 25% Ripple XRP 15% Solana SOL 12% Cardano ADA 8% The public comment period allows market participants, academics, and other stakeholders to provide input on whether options trading should be permitted for this multi-cryptocurrency ETF. This process demonstrates the SEC’s methodical approach to cryptocurrency product approvals. Regulatory Context and Historical Precedents The current SEC crypto ETF delay occurs within a broader regulatory landscape. The commission approved several bitcoin futures ETFs in 2023 and the first spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 after years of deliberation. These approvals followed judicial decisions that found the SEC’s previous rejections to be arbitrary and capricious in some instances. Several factors influence the SEC’s cautious approach to cryptocurrency ETFs: Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators continue to monitor cryptocurrency markets for manipulation Custody Security: Ensuring adequate protection of digital assets remains a priority Investor Protection: The SEC emphasizes retail investor safeguards in volatile markets Price Discovery Mechanisms: Regulators assess whether underlying markets support fair pricing These considerations explain why the commission often extends review periods for novel financial products involving digital assets. Industry Response and Market Implications Financial industry participants generally anticipated the SEC’s decision to delay these ETF applications. Market analysts note that 45-day extensions have become commonplace in cryptocurrency ETF reviews. The additional time allows regulators to address remaining questions about product structure and market infrastructure. The delay affects different market participants in various ways. Institutional investors seeking cryptocurrency exposure through traditional channels must wait longer for additional options. Cryptocurrency exchanges and custody providers continue developing infrastructure to meet regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, retail investors gain more time to research these potential investment vehicles before they potentially become available. Market data suggests that cryptocurrency ETF flows remain sensitive to regulatory developments. Previous SEC decisions have triggered significant price movements in both cryptocurrency markets and related equities. The current delay may contribute to short-term uncertainty but does not necessarily indicate ultimate disapproval. Comparative Analysis: Active vs. Passive Crypto ETFs The delayed applications represent two distinct approaches to cryptocurrency investment. T. Rowe Price’s active management model contrasts with the passive index-tracking approach of many existing cryptocurrency ETFs. Each structure offers different advantages and considerations for investors. Active cryptocurrency ETFs potentially provide: Professional selection among thousands of digital assets Dynamic weighting based on market conditions Risk management through position sizing and diversification Potential outperformance during market volatility Passive cryptocurrency ETFs typically offer: Lower management fees due to automated tracking Transparent, rules-based methodologies Consistent exposure to specific cryptocurrencies or indexes Predictable performance relative to benchmarks The SEC’s review likely examines how each structure addresses regulatory concerns about custody, valuation, and market integrity. Conclusion The SEC crypto ETF delay for T. Rowe Price and Canary funds represents standard regulatory procedure rather than unexpected obstruction. The 45-day extension provides necessary time for thorough review of complex financial products. Simultaneously, the public comment period for Grayscale options demonstrates the commission’s comprehensive approach to cryptocurrency market regulation. These developments continue the gradual integration of digital assets into traditional financial markets through regulated investment vehicles. The ultimate decisions on these products will significantly influence how both institutional and retail investors access cryptocurrency markets through familiar investment structures. FAQs Q1: What does the SEC delay mean for these cryptocurrency ETFs? The delay means the SEC needs more time to review the applications. It does not indicate approval or rejection but allows for more thorough examination of regulatory concerns. Q2: How long can the SEC delay its decision on cryptocurrency ETFs? The SEC can extend its review by 45 days initially, with potential for further extensions up to 90 additional days under standard procedures for proposed rule changes. Q3: What is the difference between T. Rowe Price’s ETF and Canary’s PENGU ETF? T. Rowe Price proposes an actively managed fund where professionals select cryptocurrencies. Canary’s PENGU is a spot ETF that would hold actual cryptocurrencies rather than futures contracts. Q4: Why is the SEC soliciting comments on Grayscale options separately? Options trading represents a different regulatory consideration than ETF approval. The SEC seeks public input on whether options should be permitted for an already-approved cryptocurrency ETF. Q5: When can investors expect final decisions on these delayed cryptocurrency ETFs? Based on the 45-day extension announced January 12, 2025, decisions could come by late February or early March, though further extensions remain possible.

The wallet data links it to illicit transactions. Tether froze $182M on the TRON network after tracking down illicit transactions. The funds are linked to some of the usual scams using stablecoins, mostly linked to personal wallet attacks or confidence scams. Tether froze out five wallets in a single transaction, adding them to their banned list. Tether freezes $3.3B in stablecoins Tether has been committed to protecting user funds and has tracked down and frozen $3.3B in stablecoins between 2023 and 2025. The stablecoin issuer has blacklisted 7,268 addresses, of which 4,505 are on the Ethereum network, with around $1.5B in funds. Tether usually re-mints the stablecoins after investigations are completed. In the past few years, attempts to claw back funds from scams have been accelerating, though still making up a small part of total losses. Stablecoins still make up to 84% of illicit transaction volumes. Some of the wallet freezes are reportedly linked to a lack of KYC, or for activities linked to Iranian nationals and Iranian-based financial operations. While freezes raise the issue of censorship, this is the only recourse against losses and scams. Tether and TRON are cooperating, though there is no automatic agreement on freezing funds from exchanges or DeFi protocols. Tether still uses the T2 Financial Crime Unit, created in partnership with TRON. So far, the unit has tracked down $300M, after launching in September 2024. Despite the effort, salvage operations for stablecoins are done sporadically, only when funds can be tracked down in time. TRON-based USDT rises to over 82B tokens The supply of USDT on the TRON network rose to over 82B tokens, while the Ethereum-based supply is at over 102B tokens. TRON-based USDT activity is cyclical, coinciding with Asian market settlement hours. The TRC-20 version of the token has been linked to a wider ecosystem of scams. | Source: Dune Analytics . TRON-based USDT transactions show predictable daily transfers, coinciding with trading hours and settlement on the Asian markets. Most of the transfers come from wallets with under 100 USDT. The network activity is still scrutinized for non-organic traffic. Despite this, TRON-based USDT remains one of the main assets for general P2P payments. The average transaction on the network is most commonly between $100 and $1,000, while Ethereum-based transfers are usually under $100. TRON-based USDT is also less widely represented on centralized exchanges , but more widely used for payments as an alternative fintech tool. USDT on TRON was also one of the main tokens used in decentralized marketplaces, which also serve as a hub for scams and laundering. Only a fraction of the funds can be clawed back, as most are distributed to smaller wallets and are difficult to link to specific entities or exploits. TRON-based tokens are also often frozen in newly created scam apps or requested as payment by Telegram sellers. P2P swaps and vendor services are also a high-risk venue for TRON-based USDT.

Key Takeaways: India now requires live identity checks and stricter KYC for crypto exchanges. Platforms must collect PAN, location data and verified bank details from users. Exchanges say the rules clarify compliance and reduce enforcement uncertainty. Under updated guidelines issued on January 8, crypto exchanges are now formally classified as Virtual Digital Asset (VDA) service providers and must adopt enhanced Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. India Mandates Live Identity Checks for Crypto Platforms The new rules require platforms to go beyond basic document uploads during onboarding. Reporting entities must carry out live identity verification and implement stronger Client Due Diligence (CDD) processes, reflecting concerns about the speed and pseudonymous nature of crypto transactions. Regulators said these features increase the risk of misuse for money laundering, terror financing and proliferation financing if left unchecked. Under the guidelines, exchanges must identify customers using reliable and independent sources and collect a broader set of technical identifiers. These include IP addresses with timestamps, geolocation data, device IDs, wallet addresses and transaction hashes, all of which are intended to support verification, monitoring and risk assessment. Platforms are also required to mandatorily collect and verify a customer’s Permanent Account Number (PAN) before allowing any VDA-related activity. Crypto regulation update in India In FY 2024–25, 49 crypto exchanges registered with FIU-IND to comply with AML & anti-terror financing laws. • 45 are India-based • 4 are overseas exchanges Unlike other countries with multiple regulators, India has one single authority —… pic.twitter.com/DJzw2nsO2Z — Vaishnav | DeFi Insights (@KiNG_Vaishnav_7) January 7, 2026 Bank account verification has also been tightened. Exchanges must use a “penny-drop” mechanism to confirm ownership and operational status of linked bank accounts. In addition to PAN details, users must submit a secondary government-issued ID such as a passport, Aadhaar card or voter ID, along with one-time password verification for registered email addresses and phone numbers. Industry participants largely welcomed the move. Nischal Shetty, founder of WazirX, said in a comment shared with Cryptonews.com that measures such as selfie-based verification and penny-drop checks were already part of onboarding at major exchanges. He added that the updated framework removes ambiguity and reduces the risk of uneven enforcement across platforms. India Moves to Discourage ICOs Under Tighter Crypto Compliance Rules The FIU also took aim at fundraising activity, saying the new framework is designed to strongly discourage Initial Coin Offerings and Initial Token Offerings, citing concerns over economic rationale, disclosure standards and risk mitigation. Enhanced due diligence will be mandatory for high-risk transactions, politically exposed persons, non-profit organizations and clients linked to jurisdictions on the Financial Action Task Force grey or black lists. Exchanges must also deploy tools to detect the use of mixers, tumblers and other anonymity-enhancing services and block such transactions where identified. Records of customer identities and transaction data must be retained for at least five years or until any investigation is concluded. Last week, Indian tax officials renewed concerns over cryptocurrency activity , warning that the growing use of digital assets could undermine the country’s ability to enforce tax rules effectively. The caution was raised by the Income Tax Department (ITD), which operates under the Central Board of Direct Taxes, during a recent parliamentary standing committee on finance.

Powell confirmed that the Justice Department served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas on Friday, threatening an indictment over his June 2025 testimony regarding a multi-year renovation of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters buildings. “ The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President, ” Powell said. He framed the investigation as an attack on Fed independence, warning that monetary policy risked being “ directed by political pressure or intimidation ” rather than economic evidence. Video message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell: https://t.co/5dfrkByGyX pic.twitter.com/O4ecNaYaGH — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) January 12, 2026 Investigation Details Emerge Amid Political Tensions The criminal probe, approved in November by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a longtime Trump ally, centers on whether Powell misled Congress about the scope and cost of the $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project. The New York Times reported that prosecutors have contacted Powell’s staff multiple times, requesting documents about renovations that began in 2022 and are estimated to run $700 million over budget. As Cryptonews previously reported, Trump claimed he had “ no knowledge ” of the investigation but criticized Powell’s performance. “ I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings, ” Trump said. He denied the subpoenas related to interest rate policy , stating, “ I wouldn’t even think of doing it that way. “ Powell addressed the renovation controversy directly during June testimony, denying features described in earlier proposals. “ There’s no V.I.P. dining room; there’s no new marble, ” he testified. “ We took down the old marble, we’re putting it back up. ” The Fed later published documentation supporting Powell’s statements, citing cost increases from asbestos contamination, soil issues, and materials inflation. Bipartisan Backlash Threatens Trump’s Fed Nominations The investigation triggered immediate opposition from both parties in Congress. Senator Thom Tillis , a Republican of North Carolina and Banking Committee member, vowed to block all Trump Fed nominees until the matter is resolved. “ If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none, ” Tillis said in a X post.

Trump wants to nominate a new Fed Chair AND push Powell off the Board for good to complete his corrupt takeover of our central bank.

Trump told The New York Times last week he has decided on Powell’s replacement , with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett emerging as the frontrunner. Hassett previously disclosed owning $1 million to $5 million in Coinbase stock and served on the exchange’s regulatory advisory council, aligning with industry calls for a pro-crypto Fed Chair. Markets React as Fed Independence Concerns Mount Financial markets responded negatively to the escalating conflict. The dollar fell broadly, U.S. stock futures declined, and Treasury futures rallied as investors digested implications for central bank autonomy. “ By trying to influence the central bank through aggressive legal threats against individual officials, the administration could drive inflation expectations higher, erode the dollar’s safe-haven role, and trigger a sharp rise in long-term bond yields, ” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto, told Reuters . Christopher Hodge, chief U.S. economist at Natixis, also warned that sustained pressure could eventually provoke market revolt. “ The market has shaken off so much noise around the Fed and Fed independence and I think is probably likely to do it again, but at some point things will break, ” Hodge said.

In a letter sent on Sunday, Labour Party MPs who chair several parliamentary committees urged the government to include a prohibition on crypto donations in an elections bill expected to be introduced later this month. The push comes ahead of local elections scheduled for May. Lawmakers raise concerns over transparency and foreign influence The group of seven, all committee chairs, wrote to Starmer calling for “explicit provision to disallow cryptocurrency donations to political parties and politicians,” The Observer reported. The signatories are Liam Byrne, Emily Thornberry, Tan Dhesi, Florence Eshalomi, Andy Slaughter, Chi Onwurah and Matt Western. Business and trade committee chair Liam Byrne, one of the signatories, said political financing “must be transparent, traceable and enforceable,” arguing that cryptocurrency does not meet those standards. The UK should not delay its response to this situation, according to Byrne, who stated, “This is not about opposing innovation. It is about protecting democracy with rules that work in the real world.” He added that if the elections bill does not include a ban, he will move amendments, saying “anonymous money has no place in British democracy. ” The committee’s concerns, as outlined in the open letter, include the potential for foreign influence through crypto donations, the use of technologies that fall outside UK regulatory frameworks, and the role of artificial intelligence in further masking the origins of funds. Emily Thornberry said a prohibition would protect UK democracy, adding, “The FAC has been studying threats to democracy around the world, and we’ve learnt that crypto is the Russian slush fund of choice.” Government stance and timing The government has announced this initiative before the upcoming May local elections. The government has previously indicated that more details on its approach would be released when the Elections Bill is published, according to The Observer. However, The Guardian reported that officials believe a crypto ban will not be workable to include in the upcoming bill, which will lower the voting age to 16, due to the complexity of cryptocurrency. The former senior civil servant Philip Rycroft is evaluating foreign financial entities that interfere with UK political processes while concentrating on crypto assets. The review process will continue until March 2026, according to local news sources. Reform UK in the spotlight The proposed ban could affect Reform UK, which said in May it would be the first party in the country to accept digital-asset donations as leader Nigel Farage set out a pro-crypto stance, including advocating for a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, The Guardian reported. The party website indicates that it prohibits all cryptocurrency donations, which remain untraceable to donors. Reform UK also received a record 9 million British pounds ($12 million) donation in cash from early crypto investor Christopher Harborne in December, described as the largest single political gift ever made by a living person in Britain. The donation was disclosed in line with UK electoral law, according to The Guardian. Broader backing for tighter rules The support for restrictions continues to increase between Westminster institutions and civil society organizations. Senior Labour MP Pat McFadden first floated a ban in July, saying it is important to know who provides a donation and whether they are properly registered.

This pressure is creating unprecedented uncertainty around the future path of American monetary policy, consequently shaking investor confidence in the world’s primary reserve currency. The situation represents a critical juncture for the Federal Reserve’s cherished independence. The Dollar’s Decline and Mounting Political Pressure The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, has fallen approximately 4.2% over the past quarter. This drop coincides with a series of public statements and legislative maneuvers from both sides of the political aisle aimed directly at the Federal Reserve’s decision-making. Consequently, currency traders are reacting to the perceived erosion of the central bank’s autonomy. Historically, markets prize predictability from the Fed, but the current political climate is injecting significant volatility. Furthermore, the pressure manifests in several distinct forms. Legislative proposals aiming to “audit” the Fed’s interest rate decisions have gained new traction in congressional committees. Simultaneously, prominent senators have publicly criticized the pace of interest rate adjustments, arguing they either harm economic growth or fail to sufficiently combat inflation. This bipartisan scrutiny creates a complex challenge for Chair Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Historical Context of Fed Independence The Federal Reserve operates with a dual mandate from Congress: to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Crucially, it executes this mandate independently to avoid short-term political influence over complex, long-term economic decisions. This independence is a cornerstone of global financial stability. Past episodes of political pressure, such as during the Nixon administration or the Trump presidency, often led to market turbulence and policy mistakes that took years to correct. Jerome Powell’s Policy Dilemma in 2025 Chair Powell currently navigates a treacherous economic landscape. Inflation, while cooled from its peaks, remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target. However, signs of softening in the labor market and consumer spending present conflicting signals. The central bank’s traditional tools—adjusting the federal funds rate and managing its balance sheet—require careful, data-driven calibration. Intense political pressure now risks forcing the Fed’s hand based on political cycles rather than economic fundamentals. For instance, calls for immediate rate cuts to stimulate the economy before an election cycle clash with arguments for maintaining higher rates to ensure inflation is fully subdued. This public debate undermines the deliberate, apolitical process the Fed employs. Market participants, sensing this conflict, are adjusting their portfolios away from dollar-denominated assets, seeking stability elsewhere. Inflation Data: Core PCE remains at 2.8%, above target. Employment: Unemployment rate has ticked up to 4.3%. Market Reaction: Treasury yields have become more volatile. Global Shift: Central banks in Europe and Japan are beginning to diverge from expected Fed policy. Global Currency Markets React to US Uncertainty The dollar’s weakness has immediate and wide-ranging effects. Major currencies like the euro and Japanese yen have strengthened significantly. Emerging market currencies, often burdened by dollar-denominated debt, are experiencing relief but also new instability due to shifting capital flows. Moreover, commodity prices, typically priced in dollars, are becoming more volatile. This global reaction underscores the dollar’s entrenched role and how political events in Washington reverberate worldwide. Additionally, foreign central banks holding vast US Treasury reserves are closely monitoring the situation. Any sustained loss of confidence in the Fed’s operational independence could prompt a long-term strategic reassessment of dollar holdings. While a sudden sell-off is unlikely, a gradual diversification is already a topic of discussion in international financial circles. Recent Currency Performance vs. USD (Q1 2025) Currency Change vs. USD Primary Driver Euro (EUR) +5.1% ECB policy stability, USD weakness Japanese Yen (JPY) +6.7% BOJ policy shift, safe-haven flow British Pound (GBP) +3.8% Relative economic data Swiss Franc (CHF) +4.3% Traditional safe-haven demand Expert Analysis on Institutional Integrity Dr. Anya Sharma, a former Fed economist and current Director of the Peterson Institute’s Monetary Policy Program, provides critical context. “The market is not just pricing in current economic data,” she explains. “It is pricing in a risk premium for institutional uncertainty. The dollar’s value is fundamentally tied to trust in the rules-based system of US policymaking. When that trust is questioned, the currency reflects it immediately.” This analysis highlights that the current dollar slump is as much about political economy as it is about interest rate differentials. Potential Economic Impacts and Future Scenarios A weaker dollar carries mixed consequences for the US economy. On one hand, it makes American exports more competitive, potentially boosting manufacturing and agriculture sectors. On the other hand, it increases the cost of imports, which can feed back into consumer inflation. For the Federal Reserve, this creates a feedback loop that complicates its inflation fight. The political pressure, therefore, risks exacerbating the very economic problems critics seek to solve. Looking ahead, analysts outline several potential scenarios. The first is a reaffirmation of Fed independence, where the institution clearly communicates its data-dependent path, weathering the political storm and eventually restoring market calm. The second is a scenario of continued pressure leading to perceived politicized decisions, resulting in prolonged dollar weakness and higher long-term inflation expectations. The path chosen will define the US financial landscape for the remainder of the decade. Conclusion The current dollar slump is a clear market signal reflecting deep concerns over mounting political pressure on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell . This pressure challenges the operational independence that has long underpinned the dollar’s global role. While currency fluctuations are normal, those driven by questions of institutional integrity have more profound and lasting implications. The coming months will test the resilience of the Fed’s governance structures and determine whether the dollar’s decline is a temporary correction or the start of a more significant recalibration of global currency dynamics. FAQs Q1: Why does political pressure on the Fed cause the dollar to slump? Market confidence in the US dollar is heavily reliant on the perceived independence and predictability of the Federal Reserve. Political pressure introduces uncertainty about future monetary policy decisions, leading investors to seek assets in currencies managed by more politically insulated central banks. Q2: What specific policies are politicians pressuring Jerome Powell to change? Pressure comes from multiple angles. Some legislators advocate for faster interest rate cuts to boost economic growth and employment, while others urge maintaining or raising rates to ensure inflation is completely controlled, often aligning with shorter-term political objectives. Q3: How does a weaker US dollar affect the average American consumer? It has a dual effect. It makes foreign vacations and imported goods (like electronics or cars) more expensive, contributing to cost-of-living pressures. However, it can also strengthen US export industries, potentially supporting job creation in manufacturing and agriculture. Q4: Has the Federal Reserve faced similar political pressure in the past? Yes, historical instances include President Lyndon B. Johnson’s pressure on Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the 1960s and public criticisms from President Donald Trump aimed at Chair Powell. These periods were often marked by market volatility and subsequent economic challenges. Q5: What can the Federal Reserve do to mitigate the impact of this political pressure? The Fed’s primary tool is clear, consistent, and data-driven communication. By rigorously adhering to its stated benchmarks for policy changes (like specific inflation or employment metrics) and transparently explaining its reasoning, it can reinforce its commitment to its statutory mandate over political considerations.

But the crypto asset’s triple bearish setup could drag prices to $70,000. Three Bearish Patterns Crypto analyst Doctor Profit warned that Bitcoin will decline toward the $70,000 level, even if prices see short-term upside first. He said BTC is currently forming three bearish technical structures across higher timeframes, thereby increasing the risk of a deeper correction. The first signal is a large bearish divergence visible on both weekly and monthly charts. It is currently indicating weakening momentum despite relatively high prices. The second is a bearish flag formation, which the analyst said points directly toward the $70,000 region. The third is a potential head-and-shoulders pattern that remains active and could still complete before a broader sell-off. Doctor Profit said a move higher cannot be ruled out in the near term, and observed that heavy liquidity is sitting between $97,000 and $107,000. This region is expected to attract prices temporarily. However, such a rally would not change the overall bearish structure. He described two possible paths toward $70,000: Bitcoin could either break down directly from the bearish flag or first complete the head-and-shoulders pattern before resuming its decline. While the timing remains uncertain, he said the downside target remains the same. He also flagged “massive amounts” of heavy insider selling, which has been ongoing since August 2025. According to Doctor Profit, the scale of selling is the largest he has observed during his tracking period and has continued without slowdown in recent weeks. Such market behavior indicates rising stress beneath the surface of the market and is in line with the pressures in the financial system. The stress in the banking sector and forced liquidations linked to movements in the silver market are contributing to a fragile macro backdrop. When current conditions were compared to periods that preceded major market downturns, the analyst said risks are building across multiple asset classes. Looking ahead, upcoming events such as US CPI inflation data and the January 15 vote on the CLARITY Act could affect short-term price action. However, these developments are unlikely to change BTC’s broader bearish trajectory. Institutional Forecasts Diverge Not all market observers share the bearish view on Bitcoin. For instance, VanEck recently said that BTC could reach a price of nearly $2.9 million by 2050 under its base-case scenario. The forecast is built on the assumption that the crypto asset evolves into a non-sovereign monetary asset, capturing between 5% and 10% of global trade settlement and accounting for roughly 2.5% of central bank reserve holdings. Under these conditions, the asset manager estimated that BTC would post a compound annual growth rate of about 15% between 2026 and 2050.

The catalyst was Powell’s decision to publicly address Department of Justice subpoenas and a criminal probe he characterized as political pressure tied to the administration’s rate preferences. In a video released Sunday evening, Powell directly addressed US President Donald Trump: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” BREAKING: Fed Chair Powell responds after Federal prosecutors open a criminal investigation into him: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of… pic.twitter.com/y1dRdoQ1fm — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 12, 2026 Bitcoin Community Reacts To The News The Bitcoin and broader crypto market responded immediately with a decent push higher, while “metals [were] blasting to new highs,” as analyst Will Clemente wrote via X. Related Reading: CVDD Model Signals Bitcoin Is Not Yet Deeply Undervalued: Drawdown Lags Historical Cycles The timing matters for crypto traders: the Fed is heading into its January 28 meeting with the market increasingly primed for a pause in cuts, amplifying sensitivity to any perception that monetary policy is being pulled into partisan conflict. For Bitcoin-native observers, the episode read like a real-time stress test of institutional trust: one that flatters Bitcoin’s pitch. Clemente added via X: “This environment is literally what Bitcoin was created for. The President is coming after the Fed chair. Metals are ripping as sovereigns diversify reserves. Stocks & risk assets at record highs. Geopolitical risk rising.” Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, put the contrast in monetary regimes front and center, arguing that Bitcoin’s “credibly neutral, predictable, transparent, and censorship resistant monetary policy looks pretty good here,” after flagging Powell’s view that the subpoenas are “pretexts” for administrative meddling in monetary policy. Related Reading: Cathie Wood: Trump May Buy Bitcoin For US Reserve Ahead Of Midterms Others used the moment to widen the indictment beyond any single personality. Bitwise advisor Jeff Park argued that “independence alone cannot be a virtue when the institution at its core is incompetent,” adding that “the age of Bitcoin is drawing nearer.” Walker, a prominent pro-Bitcoin voice, framed it as a structural problem: “The problem isn’t President Trump or Jerome Powell. The problem is a centralized cabal of unelected banker-bureaucrats set the price of money and print it out of thin air.” Notably, the bullish reflex wasn’t rooted in sympathy for Powell. Strive CEO Matt Cole wrote he had “zero sympathy” for the Fed chair and accused the central bank of “gaslight[ing] the American people” on independence, concluding: “Bitcoin is even more underpriced than we realized…” Bitcoin’s move through $92,000 puts that narrative onto a price chart, but the same political-legal feedback loop that fuels the “neutral money” thesis can also intensify volatility. “For the first time ever, Fed Chair Powell is fighting back: Over the last 12 months, Fed Chair Powell has remained silent amid President Trump’s criticisms,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote via X, adding: “Today, that changed. Trump vs Powell will result in even more volatility.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,560.

Several Analysts Are Choosing MUTM Over ADA,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-to-hodl-today-several-analysts-are-choosing-mutm/,"The crypto market is full of noise. Thousands of crypto coins compete for attention every day. Still, analysts continue to focus on projects with clear use, smart structure, and strong growth paths. That is why many are now pointing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) instead of older names like ADA when discussing the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still early. It is moving through presale phase 7 at a price of $0.04. That timing is shaping how analysts compare it with established networks. The choice is not about hype. It is about entry price, real utility, and how value is expected to build over time. ADA Today: Current Position and Future Price Path Cardano (ADA) remains a well-known blockchain with an established presence. Its market position is already defined, and its price reflects years of development and adoption. For many investors, ADA represents stability rather than rapid growth. That is also where the comparison shifts. Analysts note that ADA’s future price trajectory is expected to move in steadier increments. Large market capitalization limits how fast returns can multiply from current levels. While ADA continues to grow, the entry point today does not offer the same early-stage upside that presale projects provide. For investors seeking aggressive growth rather than preservation, this difference matters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Waiting Longer May Cost You Big Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a lending and borrowing protocol built around real usage. The token started at $0.01 and has already reached $0.04 in phase 7, reflecting a 300% increase from its starting point. The presale structure is clear and staged, with prices rising by nearly 20% at each new phase. This means buying earlier locks in a much stronger position than waiting. Someone entering at $0.04 secures more tokens than someone buying later at a higher phase price. When the price steps up again, that difference becomes immediate. For example, a buyer entering now will receive noticeably more MUTM than someone who waits until a later phase with a higher price, even if both invest the same amount. This gap grows with every phase, making timing a major factor for analysts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply capped at 4 billion tokens. Out of this, 1.82 billion tokens, or 45.5%, are allocated to the presale. This structure gives early participants a large share of the ecosystem before wider market exposure. The token is still discounted, and access has become easier after the recent update that allows card purchases with no limits. This removes friction for new buyers and increases inflow during the presale period. What The Project is Building At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is easy to understand. It offers two lending models that serve different user needs. The first is Peer-to-Contract, also known as P2C. In this model, users pool assets like USDT and SOL, and other known coins into audited smart contracts. Borrowers access this liquidity by providing overcollateralized assets. Interest rates adjust automatically based on usage. As demand rises, rates increase, which attracts more lenders and balances the system. For higher-risk assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce Peer-to-Peer lending. This model isolates meme coins like FLOKI, and TRUMP into separate agreements. Lenders and borrowers set terms directly. There is no shared pool, which protects the main system while allowing higher returns for those who accept added risk. This layered approach is often cited as a reason analysts see MUTM as more than another speculative token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts underwent a formal security assessment by Halborn , a respected blockchain security firm, in November 2025. The audit checked core protocol code for vulnerabilities and flagged six issues, including one high-severity finding and several low-level items — all of which were addressed and resolved by the Mutuum team before completion. Halborn confirmed 100% of reported findings have been remediated, showing strong code integrity and proactive risk mitigation. This audit adds a significant layer of technical credibility as the project advances toward its testnet and eventual launch, helping reinforce confidence in Mutuum’s smart contract security. V1 Protocol Launch and Utility Delivery Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shared via its official X channel that the V1 of its protocol will be deployed on the Sepolia Testnet in the near term. This initial rollout will introduce the platform’s essential systems, including the liquidity pool infrastructure, mtToken and debt-token models, and an automated liquidator bot built to oversee collateral safety and ensure reliable protocol operations. In this phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. Launching V1 on the testnet provides early access for the community ahead of the mainnet release. This measured approach improves transparency, encourages early participation, and allows the team to gather real-world insights for refinement. As engagement expands during testing, interest in the ecosystem may grow, supporting long-term confidence and sustained demand for the MUTM token. Long-term value is tied to use. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) links lending, borrowing, staking, and buybacks directly to MUTM. As users interact with the platform, on-chain activity grows naturally. Future expansion includes an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by assets like ETH, SOL, or AVAX. Minting and repaying this stablecoin will create continuous transactional demand. Analysts see this as a foundation for sustained relevance rather than short-term spikes, which is why MUTM frequently appears in discussions about crypto coins built for endurance. Growing Community with Giveaways and Daily Rewards Community growth adds another selling angle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has over 12,000 followers on Twitter. An ongoing $100K giveaway rewards ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each. The live dashboard already allows users to track holdings and estimate returns. The Top 50 leaderboard rewards large contributors with bonus MUTM tokens. A daily bonus also exists, where the top user within a 24-hour window earns $500 in MUTM by making at least one transaction. These mechanics keep activity high without relying on empty promises. Finally, when analysts compare which crypto to HODL today, the discussion often comes down to timing and utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at $0.04 in presale phase 7, offers early access, rising phase pricing, and a platform designed around real financial activity. ADA, while established, sits at a later stage in its cycle. For those scanning the market for the next crypto to explode, MUTM stands out as a calculated early move rather than a crowded trade.

Crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) shared a chart focusing on that zone and its potential impact on XRP. According to the analyst, staying above this multi-month reaccumulation support is a bullish move. Chart Structure and Support The chart shows XRP holding a horizontal support zone near the $2 area. Its price has revisited this band multiple times across several months. Each test attracted demand, and candles continue to close above the zone even after notable dips . That behavior shows active participation from buyers. The bullish structure remains intact as long as this level holds. ChartNerd reinforces this view by stating that traders should “Trade the market you have, not the market you want”. His focus stays on observable structure. $XRP above its Multi-Month Reaccumulation Support is bullish.

The decline respected the prior structure instead of accelerating lower. Momentum slowed as the asset approached the support level. It remained around that level until the breakout in early 2026 . The absence of volatility in late 2025 suggests balance rather than stress. The current candle now shows a bounce after the latest test at the end of the year. Buyers defended the zone again, and this time they pushed the digital asset upward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Near-Term Price Path The chart includes a projected path that starts with continued consolidation above support. Sideways movement allows it to absorb supply. The chart suggests a push toward $2.5. From there, a higher move could target much higher levels. According to ChartNerd, the bulls are in control, and the structure remains intact . Market participants now monitor daily and weekly closes relative to the reaccumulation zone. Acceptance above support keeps control with bulls. Failure to reclaim lost ground would alter the structure, but that scenario is less likely as the asset is already building momentum. ChartNerd keeps the message grounded in price behavior. XRP continues to trade above a level that has mattered for months. For now, that fact defines the trend. As long as its price respects this area, the market retains a constructive posture. Attention stays on how the price responds during future tests.

The report explained that debanking is essentially the abrupt termination of an account. Although banks are typically linked to this experience, other financial entities (such as credit unions, exchanges, payment applications, etc.) may also experience it. Government pressure dominates debanking despite political and religious claims Anthony emphasized that debanking can take many different forms, such as operational, where a bank decides to close a customer’s account because it is no longer in the bank’s best interests. Debanking can also be driven by religious or political reasons, where a financial institution closes an account solely because of a political or religious belief or affiliation. He further explained that debanking can be driven by the government, where the government presses a financial institution to close a customer’s account. Nicholas Anthony, citing the public data, claimed that governmental debanking is the biggest problem. He claimed that the bulk of cases have involved government intervention in the market through direct or indirect directives to banks on how to conduct their operations over time. In the report, He revealed that the public is aware of it. Although the Republican members of Congress had presented legislation aimed at limiting the activities of private companies, Anthony revealed that 72% of conservative residents believed that government intrusion was the primary problem. That perception has also begun to shape policy responses at the federal level, particularly under the Trump administration. The U.S President Donald Trump administration has addressed debanking by issuing executive orders on the subject and hiring more pro-crypto executives to organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, Anthony argued that the Bank Secrecy Act should be changed, confidentiality rules should be repealed, and Congress should permanently discontinue reputational risk regulation. “Doing so would reduce the incentives to debank, expose how widespread debanking has become, and cut out the tools that the government has used to pressure banks and other financial institutions.” – Nicholas Anthony , an Analyst at the Cato Institute. According to Anthony, Congress should repeal secrecy regulations that prohibit banks from providing explanations for account closures, abolish reputational risk regulations, and amend the Bank Secrecy Act if it wishes to prevent debanking. He maintained that the existing system essentially transforms financial institutions into law enforcement agencies, giving them powerful incentives to cut off clients to reduce regulatory risk. Anthony suggested that Congress and state legislators should oppose proposals to require account access to transform banks into utility services. Crypto debanking fueled by regulation For years, cryptocurrency companies have faced account closures and banking service denials. Many in the industry have conjectured that these measures are a part of a policy-driven attempt to stifle the digital assets sector, especially by the Biden administration. For instance, Anthony cited the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, also known as the FDIC, which instructed financial institutions to cease engaging in cryptocurrency-related activities through private letters. “Furthermore, the agency failed to provide a timeline or follow up with those financial institutions. So, in practice, these letters were effectively termination orders,” Anthony added. Additionally, he gave the example of how businesses that sent money between the U.S. and Somalia were swiftly debanked in 2015 following “a broad U.S. crackdown on money laundering.” In an interview with Fox News in December of last year, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan , denied debanking clients because of their political or religious beliefs. He verified that both Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. were equally guilty of using banks to defraud citizens. The denial came after Houston Morgan, the head of marketing at non-custodial cryptocurrency trading platform ShapeShift, and Jack Mallers, the CEO of the Bitcoin Lightning Network payments company Strike, accused JPMorgan of closing his personal accounts without cause in November.

57094954,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260652,1768212612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Dubai Privacy Token Ban: DIFC Enforces Sweeping Regulatory Crackdown,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dubai-difc-privacy-token-ban/,"BitcoinWorld Dubai Privacy Token Ban: DIFC Enforces Sweeping Regulatory Crackdown DUBAI, UAE – January 12, 2025 – The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has enacted a definitive and comprehensive ban on privacy tokens within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This landmark decision fundamentally reshapes the emirate’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Consequently, the move directly addresses mounting concerns over anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions compliance risks. The new rules, effective immediately, prohibit a wide range of activities involving these specific digital assets. Understanding the Dubai Privacy Token Ban The DFSA’s new regulatory framework explicitly outlaws several key financial activities related to privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies. Specifically, the ban covers the trading, promotion, and fund management of these assets. Furthermore, it prohibits the creation of any derivatives linked to them. This decisive action forms a critical component of a broader overhaul of Dubai’s virtual assets regulatory regime. The authority now shifts its focus from approving individual tokens to supervising firms’ compliance with international standards. Under the revised system, individual financial firms bear the responsibility for conducting their own due diligence on tokens. They must ensure any cryptocurrency they handle complies with the DFSA’s stringent requirements. Simultaneously, the regulatory body has significantly strengthened its definition and rules for stablecoins. This dual approach aims to create a more robust and transparent digital asset ecosystem within the DIFC, a major global financial hub. The Global Context for Crypto Regulation Dubai’s decisive move does not occur in a vacuum. Instead, it aligns with a growing international trend where regulators grapple with the challenges posed by privacy-focused technologies. For instance, jurisdictions like Japan and South Korea have previously implemented similar restrictions. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation also imposes strict transparency requirements that effectively marginalize anonymous coins. This global regulatory tightening presents a complex dilemma, balancing innovation with financial integrity. The following table compares recent regulatory stances on privacy tokens in key financial centers: Jurisdiction Regulatory Stance Key Rationale Dubai (DIFC) Complete Ban AML/CFT and Sanctions Compliance European Union Heavy Restrictions under MiCA Financial Transparency and Consumer Protection Japan Ban on Exchange Listings Prevention of Illicit Finance Switzerland Case-by-Case Assessment Balancing Innovation with Compliance Expert Analysis on the Regulatory Shift Financial compliance experts note the DFSA’s action represents a strategic pivot. “The shift from token-by-token approval to a supervisory model focusing on firm compliance is significant,” explains a veteran fintech consultant familiar with Gulf regulations. “It mirrors the approach taken by traditional financial regulators. Essentially, it places the onus on licensed entities to manage their risks, which is a more scalable framework for a rapidly evolving market.” This model demands that firms establish robust internal governance to assess a token’s compliance with laws concerning money laundering , terrorist financing , and sanctions evasion . Market data indicates this regulatory announcement comes at a pivotal moment. Privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) had recently seen a resurgence in investor interest. Analysts attribute this to growing concerns over financial surveillance and a search for digital asset diversification. The DFSA’s ban, therefore, creates immediate friction for funds and trading desks operating within the DIFC that had exposure to these assets. They must now unwind positions and remove such instruments from their offerings. Implications for the Middle Eastern Crypto Hub Dubai has aggressively positioned itself as a forward-thinking hub for virtual assets and blockchain innovation. The establishment of the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) for the broader emirate signaled this ambition. The DIFC’s new rules create a distinct, highly regulated environment within this ecosystem. This two-tiered structure allows Dubai to cater to both innovative, broad-scope projects under VARA and institutionally-focused, compliance-heavy activities within the DIFC. The immediate impacts of the privacy token ban are multifaceted: Operational Changes for Firms: Licensed entities must immediately review and adjust their product lines, client communications, and risk models. Investor Reallocation: Capital previously earmarked for privacy-focused strategies within the DIFC must find new avenues, potentially boosting liquidity in other compliant crypto sectors. Clarification of Stance: The move provides unambiguous guidance, reducing regulatory uncertainty for businesses considering the DIFC as a base. Enhanced Scrutiny: The strengthened stablecoin rules will demand higher levels of reserve transparency and issuer accountability. The Technical and Compliance Challenge Enforcing a ban on privacy tokens presents unique technical hurdles. Unlike transparent blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, privacy coins are specifically designed to obfuscate transaction details. Therefore, compliance teams at DIFC firms cannot rely on standard blockchain analytics tools alone. They must implement more sophisticated, behavior-based monitoring systems and strict internal policies to prevent any indirect exposure. This increases operational costs and complexity for firms operating in the center. Conclusion The Dubai privacy token ban by the DFSA marks a critical evolution in the region’s financial regulatory landscape. By taking a firm stance against privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies, the DIFC prioritizes alignment with global AML standards and the stability of its financial system. This decision reinforces Dubai’s complex identity as both a crypto innovation zone and a serious financial center adhering to international norms. The success of this regulatory model will likely influence other jurisdictions seeking to harness cryptocurrency innovation while mitigating its perceived risks. The global financial community will watch closely as this framework is implemented and tested in one of the world’s most dynamic economic regions. FAQs Q1: What exactly are “privacy tokens” and which coins are affected? A1: Privacy tokens, or privacy coins, are cryptocurrencies that use advanced cryptographic techniques to hide transaction details like sender, receiver, and amount. The DFSA ban primarily affects prominent examples such as Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Dash (DASH), along with any other asset designed primarily for transactional anonymity. Q2: Can I still trade Bitcoin and Ethereum in the DIFC after this ban? A2: Yes. The ban specifically targets privacy-enhancing tokens. Major cryptocurrencies with transparent ledgers, like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), are not automatically banned. However, individual firms must still conduct due diligence and obtain necessary approvals to offer services involving any crypto asset. Q3: How does this DIFC ban differ from regulations in the rest of Dubai? A3: The DIFC is a special economic zone with its own independent regulator (DFSA) and laws. The broader Emirate of Dubai is regulated by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). VARA has not announced an identical blanket ban, meaning rules can differ between operating in the DIFC and elsewhere in Dubai. Q4: What should a financial firm in the DIFC do now? A4: Licensed firms must immediately cease all banned activities related to privacy tokens. They should review their product inventories, update client agreements, and enhance compliance protocols to prevent exposure. Furthermore, they must prepare for the DFSA’s increased supervisory focus on their internal token assessment processes. Q5: Does this ban mean Dubai is against all cryptocurrency innovation? A5: Not at all. The ban is highly specific. Dubai, through both VARA and the DFCA, continues to actively develop comprehensive frameworks to foster blockchain and digital asset innovation. The goal is to attract business by providing clear, compliant pathways for everything from exchanges to tokenized securities, while drawing a firm line on assets deemed high-risk for financial crime.

Is the current price action breaking out of a bullish flag formation, or is this just a fakeout, with more sideways and perhaps downward price action to come? Bull flag breakout or fakeout? Source: TradingView The short-term time frame chart for the $BTC price has gone from bullish to neutral/bearish in a very short amount of time. A breakout of the small bull flag looked to have been confirmed before a decisive looking red candle took the price back inside the flag. It may well be that the price emerges from the flag again, given that it has met with strong support at $90,000. This remains to be seen. Things are looking overall bullish for Bitcoin, bearing in mind that 2026 is a year where in the US alone, around $10 trillion in debt needs to be rolled over. It might be imagined that gargantuan amounts of money printing could take place, thereby helping to send Bitcoin much, much higher. Ascending triangle pattern still the most powerful narrative Source: TradingView The daily time frame puts things very much more into perspective. A perfect breakout of the huge falling wedge pattern looks as though it is just about to get going again after a relatively short distribution phase. The breakout of the small bull flag may have failed for now, but it does look likely that it will eventually break out. Even if it doesn’t, the ascending triangle is the much bigger pattern, and should the price push through the top of this, the measured move to the make-or-break $108,000 resistance level would be the target. The daily Stochastic RSI indicators are heading down, so any more bearish price action would only serve to see them fall further, and to be able to signal more upside price momentum when they eventually turn back around. More like a bear market bottom? Source: TradingView The weekly chart reveals that once the $BTC price is able to break through the $94,000 horizontal level, two more steps at $101,000 and $108,000 would take it to the last leg up to the $126,000 all-time high. So why wouldn’t the price just turn over and fall back through the major ascending trendline and down to $74,000/$69,000 and even lower? Bitcoin is as beaten down as it gets, and has practically already hit lows that would be commensurate with the bottom of a bear market. The current rally isn’t just out of a deep bull market pull back, it is as though a bear market bottom has been made, and now we are in a disbelief phase as the price claws higher. If a towering bullish green candle breaks out and stands on top of the ascending triangle, watch this market change in an instant. Bitcoin has had to take a back seat to gold and silver for quite some time now, but its own time is coming. It might be a glorious sight to behold when it does.

COIN's investment thesis centers on its dominant market position, diversified revenue streams, and exposure to digital asset growth. Regulatory clarity and increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies are key drivers supporting COIN's forward outlook. Q4 will give updates on the impacts of setbacks in that period, but the long-term strategy remains intact even ahead of those. Coinbase ( COIN ) is a major crypto exchange that I've covered a few times. The stock is down from the highs it saw in 2025. I believe this decline is short-term in nature. The company's long-term focus should serve it and shareholders well. Summary of Previous Thesis When I wrote about COIN last, it was May 2025, and Q2 was still ongoing. Q1 2025 Shareholder Letter I talked about how transaction revenue was volatile, prone to cyclical factors. I also pointed out how COIN had been leveraging their exchange business to form a growing core of subscription-based revenue, thanks in large part to their stablecoin product through their alliance with Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ). Wanting more financial data for 2025, I declined to update my Discounted Cash Flow calculation, giving it a fair value of $366 per share for a 10% discount rate. Because the margin of safety was large for what I felt was a grower, I rated it a Buy. Updates Since Last May Numerous things have happened since I wrote in May, which both drove the stock up and then back down. First was the passage of the GENIUS Act , the first major federal policy on crypto, which specifically provided a framework for stablecoins, one of COIN's key products. Secondly, the crypto market took a big hit starting on Oct. 10. A new tariff announcement by President Trump caused the crypto market to pull down, which in turn forced liquidations of heavily leveraged accounts. General nervousness by the market (crypto and stocks) continued to bring it down. Price of BTC Since May 2025 (Seeking Alpha) Looking at the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), we can see that the flurry of good news (as the GENIUS Act brought more people and institutions into crypto). This brought BTC to a high of $123K right before Oct. 10. The bearishness that followed brought it back under $100K again, and it has yet to recover fully. COIN Price History Since May 2025 (Seeking Alpha) COIN has a similar story, but its ATH was reached in July at $420, and this coincided more closely with the GENIUS Act. While there's some correlation with BTC, it's also clear that what benefits COIN's earnings is a consideration here. Let's talk a bit about those. Q3 2025 Shareholder Letter While the transaction part of their revenue has grown, the stablecoin product has had the most consistent growth across quarters, with the GENIUS Act supporting an ATH of $354M in revenue from this product. What about the impact on cash flows? Cash Flow Statement (Q3 2025 Form 10Q) A straight look at the cash flow statement shows a surprising change, negative operating cash flow! Nevertheless, we see that the biggest driver here was $2.5B in net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities (Q3 2025 Form 10Q) A closer look shows that nearly all of this is a result of growth in their USDC product. An increase in USDC balance follows the spike in adoption. As Circle and Coinbase gain yield from the short-term interest of the real cash behind the USDC, it is considered an operating asset, and gains in this position result in a decline. 1Y USDC Market Cap (coinmarketcap.com) As seen above, the market cap of USDC has grown from about $45B a year ago to $75B more recently. It has sagged less from the bearishness in the broader crypto market. Pegged to USD 1:1, growth purely reflects how the product is gaining adoption. If we adjust for the impact of USDC balances, operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2025 comes to $1,803M. Annualized, this is about $2,404M. Cash Flow Statement (Q3 2025 Form 10Q) COIN did not report meaningful capex in the usual sense for these nine months. I did highlight fiat loan originations in the table above because this is an interesting item. The only thing we might consider capex is the cash portion of the acquisition of Deribit. Q3 2025 Form 10Q This was a $4.3B deal, of which about $3.6B was done in shares of COIN. Fully diluted, COIN's total shares outstanding are now 292M. The reason for this dilutive acquisition is simple. In their Q3 shareholder letter , management cited crypto derivatives as accounting for 80% of crypto trading volume, and Deribit is the largest exchange in crypto derivatives, when measured by trading volume and open interest. Balance Sheet (Q3 2025 Form 10Q) Looking at the balance sheet, we see a very healthy company coming out of the third quarter. Their $8.7B in cash is sufficient to support their $7.3B in total debt, and USDC balances are quickly becoming one of their largest operating assets overall. Outlook and Valuation COIN trades back in a range where I first considered it a Buy again, $240 per share for a market cap of $66B. Let's examine whether or not I still consider it a Buy. First, consider the value proposition. Annualized adjusted OCF is $2,404M. With M&A as the only likely form of capex for their capital-light business, it takes some guess work, but we could imagine that this is a business that produces about $2B in adjusted FCF currently. Based on the fully diluted shares outstanding, that would be $6.85 per share. Let's compare some growth assumptions with Discounted Cash Flow models that utilize this adjusted FCF per share. Author's calculation On the left, I assumed a long-term CAGR of 15% with a similar terminal multiple. On the right, I only raised the CAGR to 20%, while keeping the terminal multiple at 15, mainly to illustrate how a marginal difference in growth can add up. Both use 10% discount rates to compare to market indices, suggesting fair values of $249 and $359, respectively. In general, I think there is plenty of reason to think that long-term growth will occur, given the framework provided by the GENIUS Act. This has created more stability and peace of mind for new businesses to join in, hence the large growth of COIN's USDC balance this year, even in spite of the broader bearishness of crypto since October. While transaction revenue from trading on their exchange fluctuates each quarter, I suspect it should generally grow as well, particularly as they work to become an ""everything exchange,"" something mentioned heavily in Q3 earnings. CEO Brian Armstrong said this in the earnings call : In Q2, we introduced the Everything Exchange, a one-stop shop to trade every asset class. Customers want one venue to trade spot crypto assets, derivatives and options, but also equities, prediction markets, commodities and more. In Q3, we executed on that vision by expanding spot coverage, growing our derivatives offering and laying the groundwork for new asset classes on our platform. This largely explains the acquisition of Deribit and likely hints at acquisitions here and there to come. I think a big source of growth in their stablecoin product still lies ahead, as an alternative to merchant services. CFO Alesia Haas said in the call: But we're also seeing small and medium-sized businesses really come to our platform as we enable them to more efficiently manage their capital and their liquidity through instant settlement via stablecoins, while we're earning rewards now on any idle funds that they hold in USDC. So we've seen great early traction with over 1,000 businesses onboarded , and we have a growing wait list. As stablecoins are very nearly a zero-cost merchant service, I expect room for this to grow beyond the role they occupy as a placeholder of value for crypto trading. It starts with B2B transactions in order to lower costs. It steadily can become more adopted, for more ordinary uses by individuals. The reach of the exchange is growing. The balance of the USDC product is growing. One's revenue is volatile; the other's is stable, but both lines are showing signs of growth. Additionally, Coinbase is finding good opportunities to create revenue. For example, they have been a source of financing for other crypto players by creating crypto-backed credit facilities for them. When I wrote about CleanSpark ( CLSK ) recently, they spoke about a $200M line with them. There are spots where the COIN can leverage its leadership and relationships to produce strong yield. Risk Factors Both valuations assume some growth, and either one can be weakened by setbacks that may be out of COIN's control. The bearishness in Q4 is very likely to have impacted trading volume, and so there could be a hit in full-year results from this. Meanwhile, rate cuts by the Federal Reserve began in September, and two more followed before the end of 2025. Both of these trends will likely make Q4 look weaker. Continued rate cuts into 2026 could make growth flat, even if USDC balances grow, as short-term interest rates are what make the balance an operating asset at all. Cash Flow Statement (Q3 2025 Form 10Q) Additionally, stock-based compensation remains significant, over $600M in the first nine months of 2025. If this continues, there's a dilutive trend that may lower the long-term CAGR of FCF per share by a few percent. While there aren't immediately threatening risk factors, owing to their capital-light model and low use of leverage, COIN is priced for at least a little growth, and so investors depend on that in order to come out ahead over time. Conclusion Everything taken into account, I think setbacks like Q4's bearishness are temporary in nature. Coinbase is not anchoring itself to being a crypto exchange; it works to become a more universal fintech with durable revenue sources. For that reason, I think shareholders can get a fair value for moderate execution but undervaluation for excellent execution. For that reason, I maintain my Buy rating today.",COIN,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|USDC|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-12 10:19:40

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3444 by 2026. In 2032, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.19. Pi Network is a social crypto and developer ecosystem focused on mass accessibility and real-world use, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan. As 2026 begins, Pi has transitioned from a long-running experiment into a live Layer-1 blockchain with open transfers, exchange liquidity, and a growing app ecosystem. In the past year 2025, Pi hit an all-time high near $2.98 after Open Mainnet launched, then fell to a low around $0.1585 in October as large token unlocks increased supply, leaving the price in the low-$0.20 range. Despite the volatility, 2025 marked major progress: Open Mainnet went live, exchange listings expanded, Pi Network Ventures launched a $100 million ecosystem fund, AI-powered KYC scaled up, and developer activity grew through hackathons, Testnet DEX and AMM tools, Map of Pi 2.0, and broader merchant adoption, signaling a shift from speculation toward real usage. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2026–2032 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

Momentum remains weak but stable, with RSI near neutral and MACD still below zero, suggesting consolidation rather than a new sell-off. Support sits near $0.205, while resistance is near $0.212, keeping the price range-bound. As of January 12, 2026, Pi Network is trading within $0.208 and $0.209, indicating tight trading activity after falling from the $0.21 area. However, the price remains above the key $0.20 psychological level, which still acts as short-term support. The general price movement is stable and range-bound, not impulsive. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis On the daily chart, Pi is trading near $0.2086 after opening around $0.2082, reaching a high near $0.2092, and dropping to a low of $0.2081. The narrow daily range shows that volatility is compressed, with neither buyers nor sellers in control. Price action remains flat, indicating stabilization, not trend continuation. The RSI (14) is at 47.76, sitting just below the neutral 50 level, which signals balanced momentum. This reflects a market that has cooled after recent attempts higher, but without strong downside pressure. RSI holding above the mid-40s suggests sellers are not aggressive. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) remains slightly negative, with the histogram near +0.0007, the MACD line around -0.0009, and the signal line near -0.0016. While both lines are still below zero, the flattening histogram shows downside momentum is fading, not accelerating. Daily support is holding near $0.205, where buyers have consistently defended dips, while resistance stands near $0.212, a level that continues to cap recovery attempts. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, Pi Network is trading around $0.2086, consolidating after pulling back from the recent $0.214 area. Price trend shows smaller candles clustered just above $0.208, indicating that selling pressure has eased and the market is consolidating. The RSI (14) is at 48.35, below the neutral level, which signals balanced momentum with neither buyers nor sellers in control. The MACD remains flat, with the histogram near zero and both lines close together, confirming a lack of strong directional momentum. Short-term support is holding at $0.206 and $0.208, while resistance is near $0.210 and $0.212. A confirmed move above resistance would suggest renewed upside attempts, while a break below support would likely open the door to further consolidation toward the $0.20 zone. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2707 SELL SMA 5 $0.2354 SELL SMA 10 $0.2207 SELL SMA 21 $0.2157 SELL SMA 50 $0.2278 SELL SMA 100 $0.2377 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2112 SELL EMA 5 $0.2185 SELL EMA 10 $0.2396 SELL EMA 21 $0.2782 SELL EMA 50 $0.3429 SELL EMA 100 $0.4387 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to continue consolidating between $0.205 and $0.212, as momentum indicators remain neutral and volume stays light. A break below $0.205 would shift focus back to downside risk, while a clean move above $0.212 is needed to signal renewed recovery. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. Why is PI’s price down today? PI is down today mainly due to declining technical momentum and failure to reclaim resistance. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI Network Price History: CoinmarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price. As of late December 2025, Pi Network traded in the low-$0.20 range around $0.205, moving sideways as selling pressure eased, but trading volume stayed light, and buyers remained cautious after the mid-month dip below $0.20. At the start of 2026, Pi continued to hover near the $0.20–$0.21 zone, showing early stabilization above the key $0.20 level, with the market still weighing ongoing supply unlocks against slower demand growth",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|ZRX|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-12 11:29:20
57096657,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892968,1768217400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57096657.jpeg,This New Cryptocurrency at $0.04 Could Be the Last Cheap Entry Before a 15x Move,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/this-new-cryptocurrency-at-0-04-could-be-the-last-cheap-entry-before-a-15x-move/,"The crypto investors are never wanting to miss the last cheap entry before a significant rerating occurrence. It is not long before these windows remain open. They normally occur when there is a token between early speculation and protocol launch. Analysts suppose that there can be one new cryptocurrency that is priced at just $0.04, and it can be situated in that specific area. The token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Price models indicate that MUTM may present a 15x move upon activation of its protocol and when demand is introduced into the system. This has led to a stampede of investment with investors placing orders ahead of the launch. Structure and Protocol Vision Mutuum Finance has a current presale that is under priced in phases. Each stage has a predetermined amount of tokens and the cost of the stage is larger than the cost of the previous one. With this system, there is an incentive on early arrival and a definite price direction towards launch. The token is now in Phase 7 with the phase at $0.04, a rise of almost 300% of the initial tier. Over 18,800 holders raised more than $19.7 million and more than 825 million MUTM have been sold from the 45.5% presale allocation. Those who follow the sale note that the phases were being filled at greater rates as the window of launch is approached. Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending market. Users will have the opportunity to deposit assets to lending pools and receive yield, and borrowers will have the possibility to place collateral and get loans. Lending platforms play a significant part in the DeFi ecosystem since they are a real money activity as opposed to meme flows. When engaged, these markets raise interest payments, yield, and fee revenue on the protocol, which connects token value to actual use rather than focus. V1 Protocol Launch V1 Protocol launch is the key trigger of Mutuum Finance. V1 will engage lending, borrowing, deposit tracking and liquidation logic. Such is the point when utility takes the place of speculation. At this stage, investors will reprice tokens since they are used in the system. Mutuum Finance will also award depositors mtTokens, these will be pool positions and will pay APY when borrowing demand is high. This brings in income and makes the protocol have long term users. A buy and distribute model will be activated also after V1. The protocol revenue will be used to purchase MUTM tokens in the market at a share. Such tokens are then given out. This is noted by analysts as a good economic model since it generates real revenue supported by buy pressure. It also changes the speculative demand to cash flow logic. These mechanisms are reflected on price predictions. Some analysts have traced a 15x long-term movement on the existing level of $0.04 when V1 comes out and the market of buying pressure is introduced. It can be demonstrated using models that lending volume and growth in deposits can fund the long term pricing without the use of hype cycles. Investor Transparency Mutuum Finance will be supporting the stablecoins within the lending environment. The significance of stablecoins is that they will form central liquidity holdings to both depositors and borrowers. They eliminate volatility risks and help to maintain stable yield models. The use of Stablecoins has been among the rapidly expanding subsectors in DeFi owing to real money payment needs and universal on-chain finance. Later stages will also include the use of layer 2 networks in the protocol. The layer 2 support is significant to the scaling of the transaction throughput and lowering user expenses. Long term success in the lending markets demands smooth flow of credit and low execution fee. Analysts feel this growth would invite institutional involvement at a later stage in the cycle. Security is one of the interests of Mutuum Finance. The protocol underwent security audits with Halborn , one of the leading blockchain security auditors. Halborn is also reputed to audit high value projects which deal with lending, collateral and liquidation risk. Bug bounty involving smart contract integrity protection has also been announced with a $50,000 bug reward. As V1 nears, as the support of stablecoins is arranged, and the revenue based model takes shape, analysts think the $0.04 area can be the final inexpensive entry point before utility based repricing starts. Only a 15x window may not remain long open in case price targets perform as planned.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-legder-is-set-to-operate-under-federal-oversight-heres-the-latest/,"A shift is taking shape inside the US financial system. It is unfolding through regulatory language rather than market noise. Federal banking authorities have begun granting conditional approvals that bring select crypto-native firms closer to the core of the traditional banking framework. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) highlighted the development in a post connected to an official announcement from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The post points to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) moving toward operation under federal oversight as Ripple advances the process of securing approval for a national trust bank . The attached image reinforces this by detailing the regulatory pathway now taking shape around Ripple’s US operations. THE XRPL IS SET TO OPERATE UNDER FEDERAL OVERSIGHT AS RIPPLE MOVES TOWARD OCC TRUST BANK APPROVAL Documented. pic.twitter.com/UPnYRwv937 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) January 11, 2026 OCC Approval Signals a Structural Shift The OCC confirmed that it has granted conditional approval for the creation of Ripple National Trust Bank, an entity affiliated with Ripple. This approval places Ripple alongside firms such as Circle, BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos, all of which received similar trust bank approvals or transitions. These charters allow firms to operate under federal supervision while providing digital asset custody services. For Ripple, this marks a clear step toward formal integration within the U.S. banking system. A national trust bank operates under direct federal oversight. It follows uniform compliance standards. It answers to the OCC rather than a patchwork of state regulators. This structure aligns Ripple more closely with established financial institutions that require regulated counterparties. What Federal Oversight Means for XRP XRP sits at the center of Ripple’s payment and settlement infrastructure. As Ripple moves toward operating a federally regulated trust bank, the ledger gains a stronger institutional footing. Federal oversight introduces defined compliance standards around custody, reporting, and operational controls. These standards matter to banks, asset managers, and payment providers that require regulatory clarity before deploying capital or infrastructure. The approval does not permit Ripple to take deposits or issue loans. However, it allows Ripple to custody client assets under federal supervision. Custody forms the backbone of institutional participation in digital asset markets. With federal oversight in place, XRP-linked services can align more directly with the expectations of regulated financial entities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Integration With the U.S. Financial System The OCC approval shows a policy environment that now supports regulated digital asset activity inside the federal banking system. OCC leadership stated that welcoming new participants into the national banking framework benefits consumers and financial markets. For Ripple, this environment provides a defined legal structure rather than reliance on regulatory ambiguity. Ripple’s progress toward finalizing its trust bank status brings XRP closer to mainstream institutional use . That positioning strengthens its role in regulated payments, custody, and settlement workflows. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Both altcoins surged over 10% throughout the past trading session, even as investor sentiment remains risk-off and the broader digital asset market continues to trade flat. XCN Soars 15% as Onyxcoin Prepares for South Korea Expansion Data from CoinCodex shows that XCN’s price jumped more than 15% in the past 24 hours. XCN price chart (Source: CoinCodex ) That surge in price comes after the Onyxcoin team said that they are in the process of expanding their presence in South Korea , which has some of the most active traders in the crypto market. In a Jan. 11 X post, the team said that the project’s website is now available in Korean. As Onyxcoin prepares to expand its presence in South Korea, the project also said that it is looking for a second Korean-speaking ambassador to assist with the upcoming expansion in the region. The recent announcement has added fuel to what has been a medium-term bullish rally for XCN. Over the past month, the crypto’s price has soared more than 75%. A large portion of these gains was recorded in the past week, with the altcoin soaring over 56% in the last 7 days. IP Rallies As Story Protocol Looks To Grow Ambassador Count While XCN has managed to soar over 15% in the past 24 hours, it was outperformed by IP, which posted a more than 26% gain during the same period. IP price (Source: CoinCodex ) Data from CoinCodex shows IP trades at $2.56 at the time of writing. The rally came after the team reiterated their goal to grow the project’s ambassador count. “With the new year, new OG standards, and first new OGs, we are ready to grow another major part of the Story community: our ambassadors,” the project’s team wrote on X. That’s after the team welcomed the project’s first “OGs” last week. Crypto Sentiment Still Fearful The strong 24-hour performances posted by XCN and IP stand out because these surges happened while sentiment in the overall crypto market remains fearful. Currently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which is a popular tool used by traders and investors to gauge sentiment in the market, stands on a score of 27/100. This indicates “Fear.” Since the start of the year, the sentiment tool’s readings have oscillated between the low- to high-20s. It did break out to above 40 on Jan. 6 and Jan. 7, which coincided with a relief rally in the market, but has since dropped back down to “Fear” levels. The ongoing cautious sentiment can be seen by the price performances of most of the cryptos in the market in the past 24 hours. Overall, the digital asset space’s capitalization has dropped a fraction of a percentage.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 11:33:28

This did not go unnoticed, especially by the community, who have implie d th e team has something to do with it. The actual crash was linked to rapid sale transactions, which were split into three, totaling around $170,000. That amount was split into individual dumps of $39,540, $45,540, and $85,668, executed in 28 seconds at around 10:22 UTC. Some clai m th is was likely orchestrated by someone looking to farm the 4x trading rewards offered by Binance Alpha . What happened to the $LISA token? The token price fell about $0.165 to as low as $0.02, with some reports claiming it went as low as $0.01 amid trading spikes. Two prominent Chinese KOLs have linked the fall to an on-chain transaction that saw a SafeProxy wallet, 0x358…eC57c, linked to the project deposit 10 million worth of the token, valued at around $1.65 million at the time, into a Binance Alpha wallet around 01:50 UTC. Historically, such transactions signal that a sale is about to occur, and sure enough, about 25 to 30 minutes later, the token price dropped dramatically after the sell-through was completed via limit orders. The sales quickly flooded the market, exploiting the token’s thin liquidity and low real demand. Which was inflated by point farmers rather than real holders. What followed was panic selling as community members rushed to dump their tokens to prevent further losses, turning the dip into a total crash. The community is convinced that the team or an insider had something to do with it, as the initial deposit was reportedly sold via limit orders to obscure the on-chain trail and make tracking near impossible. Despite all the drama, the team has remained quiet, making things worse. Trading volume has also remained elevated in the hours that followed the crash, even as the community lashed out, labeling it a scam or rug. The project built hype with its token mechanics, with 236 Alpha points awarded for 230 tokens on a FCFS basis; however, this seems to have backfired. Why do Binance Alpha tokens experience dumps? The LISA token dump shocked many, but it is not the first project linked to Binance Alpha to experience such a thing. One good example of such a token is the $AB token, a top token on Binance Alpha, that crashed out of the blue in October 2025, falling by 99% from $0.0083 to $0.0000051 within a space of two minutes during the early Asia trading session. Like $LISA, the $AB token dump happened rapidly in a low liquidity environment, which triggered panic selling. Other similar Binance Alpha tokens that saw daily drops exceeding 50% not long after launch include SOMI, U, and LINEA . Community members have been drawing attention to the dumps, but project teams have continued to list despite the pattern, likely because of the short-term visibility Binance Alpha projects enjoy.

57096674,656619,1768217859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57096674.jpeg,"Crypto.com US$250,000 Airdrop Event, Win SOL in Airdrop Arena",https://bitcoinist.com/airdrop-event-win-sol-in-airdrop-arena/,"Crypto.com has launched a fresh rewards campaign inside Airdrop Arena, giving users a new opportunity to earn Solana incentives through simple CRO allocation. The event offers a total pool of US$250,000 in SOL tokens , running from 1 January 2026, 10:00 UTC to 31 January 2026, 09:59 UTC , with boosted point multipliers designed to reward early and active participants. At the center of the campaign is a points-based system that distributes SOL rewards based on user activity over the event period. To kick things off strongly, Crypto.com is giving the first 10,000 users who allocate CRO an exclusive points boost of up to 120% , which can significantly improve reward outcomes compared to later participants. Beyond early access rewards, the campaign includes a second incentive layer. Users who purchase at least 1,500 CRO and transfer it into Airdrop Arena may qualify for a daily points boost of up to 120% , as long as the purchase task is completed before allocating CRO. How to Join the Airdrop Arena Event Participation is handled entirely inside the Crypto.com app and requires no trading. Users can access Airdrop Arena via the Account tab , the Earn tab , or the Supermenu . Once inside, they simply allocate CRO to begin accumulating points throughout the event period. The system is structured to stay low-effort. After allocation, points are earned automatically during the campaign, and the SOL reward pool is divided based on each user’s accumulated points total once the event ends. Reward Distribution and Lockup Conditions After the campaign finishes, Crypto.com will distribute token rewards within 7 days . Users who activate Loot Locker will receive SOL after the lockup period ends, while others will receive rewards directly into their Crypto Wallet based on standard distribution rules. Allocated CRO comes with a 6-month lockup period . Once completed, users can withdraw their CRO, or leave it allocated to continue participating in future Airdrop Arena events automatically. This creates a longer-term participation loop, where CRO holders can stay eligible for ongoing platform campaigns without needing to re-enter each time. Why SOL Rewards Matter in This Campaign Solana has remained one of the most active ecosystems in crypto, with strong attention from developers and investors due to its speed-focused infrastructure and expanding on-chain activity. By using SOL as the reward asset, Crypto.com increases the campaign’s appeal, since users are earning exposure to a top market token rather than a niche incentive asset. Pairing CRO allocation with SOL rewards also gives the event a dual-ecosystem angle, connecting Crypto.com’s native token base to broader market demand around Solana. Airdrop Arena Signals a Push Toward Low-Activity Rewards This campaign fits into a wider trend across exchanges: rewarding longer-term participation instead of encouraging constant trading. Airdrop Arena focuses on consistency and allocation rather than volume, making it especially attractive for users who prefer passive-style reward structures. For CRO holders, the event offers a structured way to earn SOL without selling assets or taking on additional trading complexity. For Crypto.com, it strengthens ecosystem engagement and helps build retention through lockups and recurring event mechanics.

According to recent analysis from investment firm Bernstein, growing opposition from traditional financial institutions now represents the most significant variable affecting the landmark legislation’s passage through Congress. The bill, which cleared the House of Representatives in late 2024, currently undergoes Senate review with proponents targeting first-quarter approval despite escalating industry conflicts. Crypto Market Structure Bill Confronts Banking Sector Resistance Bernstein’s comprehensive analysis reveals that banking industry opposition has intensified dramatically in recent weeks. Consequently, the investment firm now assesses diminished chances for the crypto market structure bill’s successful passage. The current legislative window represents a critical opportunity for establishing comprehensive digital asset regulations. However, traditional financial institutions increasingly voice concerns about specific provisions, particularly those governing stablecoin operations and compensation mechanisms. Investment analysts at Bernstein specifically highlight stablecoin compensation provisions as the primary flashpoint. Banking institutions argue these provisions could undermine traditional payment systems and create regulatory arbitrage opportunities. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency advocates counter that the legislation provides necessary clarity for innovation and consumer protection. This fundamental disagreement has transformed what initially appeared as bipartisan support into a contentious legislative battle with uncertain outcomes. Legislative Timeline and Senate Review Process The crypto market structure bill follows a complex legislative journey that began with committee discussions in early 2024. After extensive revisions and negotiations, the House of Representatives approved the legislation with bipartisan support in November 2024. The bill now advances to Senate review, where Banking Committee members will examine its provisions thoroughly. Proponents originally targeted first-quarter 2025 approval, but Bernstein’s analysis suggests this timeline now appears increasingly optimistic given current opposition levels. Expert Analysis on Regulatory Implications Financial regulation experts emphasize that the crypto market structure bill represents the most comprehensive attempt to date at establishing clear digital asset regulations in the United States. The legislation addresses multiple critical areas including: Jurisdictional clarity between the SEC and CFTC Stablecoin issuance and reserve requirements Consumer protection mechanisms for digital asset transactions Market integrity provisions to prevent manipulation Banking integration pathways for cryptocurrency services Industry observers note that banking sector concerns primarily center on provisions that would allow non-bank entities to issue stablecoins under specific regulatory frameworks. Traditional financial institutions argue this approach could fragment payment systems and create systemic risks. Conversely, cryptocurrency advocates maintain that inclusive frameworks encourage innovation while maintaining appropriate safeguards through regulatory oversight. Historical Context of Financial Innovation Legislation The current debate mirrors historical patterns where emerging technologies encounter resistance from established industries. Similar conflicts emerged during early internet regulation debates in the 1990s and mobile payment system discussions in the 2010s. Legislative experts observe that successful financial innovation legislation typically requires balancing several competing interests: Interest Group Primary Concerns Legislative Priorities Banking Institutions Systemic risk, regulatory parity, payment system integrity Maintaining existing oversight frameworks, limiting non-bank competition Crypto Industry Innovation stifling, regulatory clarity, market access Clear jurisdictional boundaries, inclusive stablecoin frameworks Regulatory Agencies Enforcement authority, consumer protection, market stability Unambiguous statutory authority, adequate resources Consumer Advocates Transparency, fraud prevention, accessibility Strong disclosure requirements, robust enforcement mechanisms This historical perspective reveals that successful legislation typically emerges from negotiated compromises that address core concerns while allowing innovation to proceed. The current crypto market structure bill attempts precisely this balance, but banking industry resistance suggests further negotiations may prove necessary. Global Regulatory Landscape and Competitive Implications International observers closely monitor the United States crypto market structure bill deliberations because outcomes will significantly influence global regulatory approaches. Several jurisdictions, including the European Union with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework and the United Kingdom with its proposed digital asset regulations, have already established comprehensive regulatory regimes. Consequently, delayed United States legislation could disadvantage American firms in the increasingly competitive global digital asset marketplace. Financial analysts emphasize that regulatory clarity directly correlates with investment flows in the cryptocurrency sector. Jurisdictions with clear frameworks typically attract greater institutional investment and foster more robust innovation ecosystems. Bernstein’s analysis specifically notes that prolonged uncertainty could drive cryptocurrency development and investment to more welcoming international markets, potentially diminishing United States leadership in financial technology innovation. Economic Impact Assessment Economic research indicates that comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation could generate substantial benefits including: Increased institutional investment in digital asset infrastructure Enhanced consumer protection through clear legal frameworks Job creation in compliance, technology, and financial services sectors Tax revenue generation from properly regulated transactions Financial inclusion improvements through innovative payment systems Conversely, regulatory uncertainty or restrictive frameworks may produce opposite effects, potentially stifling innovation and driving economic activity offshore. Banking industry concerns about systemic risks must therefore balance against potential economic opportunities that comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation might unlock. Political Dynamics and Legislative Pathways The crypto market structure bill navigates complex political terrain with multiple committees claiming jurisdiction and various interest groups advocating conflicting positions. Senate Banking Committee leadership will determine the legislation’s immediate fate, but other committees including Finance and Agriculture may assert jurisdiction over specific provisions. This multi-committee review process inherently complicates legislative progress, particularly when significant opposition emerges from powerful industry stakeholders. Political analysts identify several potential pathways forward for the crypto market structure bill. These include: Comprehensive revision addressing banking industry concerns while maintaining core objectives Piecemeal approach separating less controversial provisions for individual consideration Extended timeline allowing additional negotiation and stakeholder engagement Alternative legislation focusing specifically on stablecoin regulation as a compromise measure Each pathway presents distinct challenges and opportunities, with Bernstein’s analysis suggesting that banking industry opposition makes comprehensive passage increasingly unlikely without significant concessions. The coming weeks will prove crucial as Senate committees schedule hearings and markups that will determine the legislation’s ultimate form and prospects. Conclusion The United States crypto market structure bill confronts significant challenges as banking industry opposition intensifies during critical Senate review. Bernstein’s analysis correctly identifies this resistance as the primary variable affecting legislative prospects, particularly regarding stablecoin provisions that traditional financial institutions view as threatening. While the legislation represents a crucial step toward regulatory clarity for digital assets, successful passage now requires navigating complex stakeholder concerns and political dynamics. The coming months will determine whether compromise proves possible or whether the United States must await alternative approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. FAQs Q1: What is the current status of the crypto market structure bill? The bill passed the House of Representatives in November 2024 and now undergoes Senate committee review, with proponents originally targeting first-quarter 2025 approval. Q2: Why are banks opposing the cryptocurrency legislation? Banking institutions primarily object to provisions allowing non-bank entities to issue stablecoins, arguing this could fragment payment systems and create regulatory arbitrage opportunities. Q3: What are stablecoin compensation provisions? These provisions establish requirements for stablecoin issuers regarding reserve assets, redemption mechanisms, and consumer protections, which banks believe could disadvantage traditional payment systems. Q4: How does this legislation compare to international cryptocurrency regulations? The United States bill attempts comprehensive regulation similar to the European Union’s MiCA framework, but delayed passage could disadvantage American firms in global markets. Q5: What happens if the crypto market structure bill fails to pass? Continued regulatory uncertainty could persist, potentially driving cryptocurrency innovation and investment to jurisdictions with clearer frameworks while leaving United States consumers with limited protections.

The event comes with a headline incentive, a US$250,000 SOL token reward pool that will be distributed to participants who allocate CRO during the campaign window. The promotion is already live and runs for the full month of January, combining Crypto.com’s CRO ecosystem with Solana, one of the most active layer-1 networks in crypto right now. Instead of pushing high-volume trading, this campaign is built around steady participation, where users accumulate points over time and receive SOL rewards after the event ends. A Straightforward CRO Allocation Reward System The structure behind the campaign is intentionally simple. Users allocate CRO into Airdrop Arena, earn points while the event is active, and then receive a portion of the SOL pool based on how many points they’ve collected. Crypto.com is also rewarding early activity. The first 10,000 users who allocate CRO unlock an exclusive points boost of up to 120%, giving them a clear advantage right from the start. On top of that, users can qualify for a daily points boost of up to 120% when they purchase at least 1,500 CRO and transfer it into Airdrop Arena. Tip: The purchase task needs to be completed before allocating CRO, otherwise the daily boost may not apply. How to Participate Through the Crypto.com App Everything happens inside the Crypto.com app, making the process quick even for casual users. Airdrop Arena can be accessed through the Account section, the Earn tab, or the Supermenu. Once inside the feature, users simply allocate CRO into the event and begin earning points automatically. There’s no need for constant monitoring, no complicated strategy, and no trading requirement, which makes this campaign feel more like passive participation than active speculation. Visit Crypto.com Allocate now and start building points. Campaign Dates and Key Event Details The event runs on a fixed schedule: Event duration: 1 January 2026, 10:00 UTC to 31 January 2026, 09:59 UTC Once the event ends, Crypto.com will calculate each participant’s points total and distribute SOL accordingly. Rewards, Distribution Timeline, and Lockup Rules SOL rewards will be airdropped within 7 days after the campaign concludes. Users who activate Loot Locker will receive their rewards after the lockup period ends. If Loot Locker is not enabled, SOL will be distributed directly to the user’s Crypto Wallet. The CRO allocation itself comes with a long-term condition: allocated CRO is locked for 6 months. After the lockup ends, users can withdraw their CRO or keep it allocated in Airdrop Arena to automatically join future campaigns, which is clearly designed to encourage longer-term engagement instead of short-term participation. Solana Rewards Add Extra Appeal Choosing SOL as the reward asset is not random. Solana remains one of the most watched ecosystems in crypto, supported by ongoing developer activity, memecoin momentum, DeFi growth, and infrastructure expansion. That makes SOL a reward that users actually want to hold, not just a token they instantly dump. By linking CRO allocation with SOL incentives, Crypto.com effectively ties its platform activity to another major chain that continues to attract attention from both retail and serious market participants. Airdrop Arena Reflects a Bigger Exchange Trend This campaign also fits a bigger shift happening across exchanges. Platforms are increasingly moving away from pure volume-driven rewards and instead focusing on loyalty mechanics: time-based campaigns, allocation systems, and engagement incentives that keep users active inside the ecosystem. For CRO holders, the SOL Airdrop Arena offers a way to gain exposure to Solana without selling assets or actively trading. For Crypto.com, it strengthens retention and pushes long-term platform participation through structured lockups and recurring event access.

On-chain data suggests sustained withdrawals from centralized exchanges, reducing tokens available for immediate trading. The trend reflects structured accumulation rather than short-term positioning. As liquidity contracts, SHIB’s price response to demand shifts may become sharper. Exchange Outflows Reduce Sell-Side Liquidity TKResearch Trading reported that Shiba Inu has entered what it described as a tightening supply phase. The firm said SHIB has recorded persistent net outflows from centralized exchanges since December 5. Over that period, investors withdrew roughly 80 trillion tokens from exchange wallets. According to the analysis, total exchange balances fell from about 370.3 trillion SHIB to nearly 290.3 trillion. TKResearch explained that this decline has significantly reduced sell-side liquidity. Tokens moved into private wallets become less accessible for trading, which often reflects accumulation behavior ahead of potential market rebounds. The report added that newly created wallets played a central role in the trend. TKResearch said fresh addresses withdrew approximately 82.04 trillion SHIB from major exchanges over the past 60 days. Exact figures showed 82,043,494,321,205 tokens exiting centralized platforms during that period. Source: X Coinbase accounted for a notable share of the outflows, according to the data. TKResearch noted that much of the accumulation occurred around the $0.0000085 price level. The firm said this pattern points to calculated positioning by larger market participants rather than random retail flows. Wallet Concentration Signals Supply Exhaustion Risks TKResearch also analyzed Shiba Inu’s circulating supply distribution. Of the 589.24 trillion SHIB in circulation, only about 290.4 trillion tokens remain on centralized exchanges. This means less than half of the circulating supply is readily available for open-market trading. Wallet distribution metrics showed rising concentration among large holders. TKResearch reported that the top 100 wallets now control 57% of the total supply, equal to roughly 831.8 trillion SHIB. This share increased by 15.11% over the past 180 days. The analysis also tracked gains among smart money and whale wallets. Smart money holdings grew by 68.27% over six months to 10.01 billion SHIB, according to the report. Whale wallets expanded balances by 428% over the same period, reaching 1.3 billion tokens. Source: X Meanwhile, exchange-held SHIB declined by 23.91% over 180 days. Holdings linked to public figures fell by 4.88% to around 399.92 billion tokens. TKResearch concluded that these shifts point to early signs of supply exhaustion. If demand rises amid shrinking liquidity, SHIB’s price volatility could intensify. At the time of writing, SHIB trades at around $0.00000840, indicating a 3.20% decline in the last 24 hours.

Standard Chartered Crypto Prime Brokerage: Institutional Gateway Standard Chartered’s strategic initiative represents a calculated expansion into digital asset services. According to Bloomberg’s exclusive report, the banking giant will develop this service through SC Ventures, its dedicated innovation and ventures arm. The planned crypto prime brokerage will specifically target institutional clients, offering comprehensive solutions that traditional finance currently lacks for digital assets. This development follows extensive internal research and regulatory consultations across multiple jurisdictions where Standard Chartered operates. Furthermore, the service will provide two foundational offerings: secure custody solutions for digital assets and sophisticated financing arrangements. These services address critical pain points for institutional investors who require regulated, secure infrastructure comparable to traditional securities services. The bank’s entry validates the maturation of cryptocurrency markets and reflects growing institutional demand for regulated crypto exposure. Industry analysts note this move could catalyze similar offerings from other global banks. Prime Brokerage Evolution in Digital Assets The concept of prime brokerage has existed in traditional finance for decades, serving hedge funds, family offices, and institutional investors with consolidated services. However, cryptocurrency markets have historically lacked equivalent institutional-grade infrastructure. Standard Chartered’s entry bridges this structural gap by applying proven financial frameworks to emerging digital asset classes. The bank brings 160 years of financial services experience to a market segment that has struggled with trust and security concerns. Moreover, SC Ventures has established itself as a forward-thinking division since its 2018 launch. The subsidiary previously incubated Zodia Custody, a institutional-grade digital asset custody solution, in partnership with Northern Trust. This existing expertise provides Standard Chartered with crucial foundational knowledge for expanding into broader prime services. The bank’s global presence across 59 markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, positions it uniquely to serve institutional clients seeking regulated crypto access in emerging digital economies. Institutional Adoption Timeline and Market Impact The announcement follows a clear institutional adoption timeline that began accelerating in 2020. Major financial institutions have progressively entered the digital asset space through incremental steps. Standard Chartered’s move represents the logical next phase: comprehensive service offerings rather than singular products. Market data from 2024 shows institutional crypto allocations growing at 47% annually, creating substantial demand for regulated service providers. Additionally, the bank’s decision reflects broader regulatory developments. Multiple jurisdictions, including the UK, EU, and Singapore, have implemented clearer digital asset frameworks over the past two years. These regulatory advancements enable traditional financial institutions to operate crypto services with compliance certainty. Standard Chartered’s extensive compliance infrastructure and risk management frameworks provide institutional clients with confidence lacking in native crypto firms. This trust factor represents a significant competitive advantage in attracting conservative institutional capital. Service Components and Competitive Landscape The planned crypto prime brokerage will offer integrated services designed specifically for professional investors. Custody solutions will leverage Zodia Custody’s technology, which already serves institutional clients with insurance-backed cold storage. Financing arrangements will include margin lending, securities lending equivalents for digital assets, and structured products. These services address the fragmented nature of current crypto institutional offerings, where investors typically must engage multiple specialized providers. Competitively, Standard Chartered enters a market with both crypto-native firms and limited traditional bank participation. The table below illustrates the current competitive landscape: Provider Type Examples Key Advantages Traditional Banks BNY Mellon, JPMorgan Regulatory trust, existing client relationships Crypto-Native Firms Coinbase Prime, Genesis Technical expertise, market specialization New Entrants Standard Chartered Global reach, integrated traditional services The bank’s unique position combines traditional financial credibility with dedicated innovation through SC Ventures. This hybrid approach may appeal to institutions seeking crypto exposure without compromising on compliance standards. Standard Chartered’s emerging markets focus also differentiates it from competitors primarily serving North American and European clients. Risk Management and Regulatory Considerations Standard Chartered’s approach emphasizes rigorous risk management frameworks adapted for digital assets. The bank will implement multi-layered security protocols, including: Multi-signature wallet technology requiring multiple authorized parties for transactions Insurance coverage for digital assets in custody exceeding industry standards Real-time monitoring of blockchain transactions and counterparty exposures Regulatory compliance integration across all jurisdictions of operation These measures address institutional concerns about security, counterparty risk, and regulatory uncertainty. The bank’s experience operating in diverse regulatory environments provides valuable perspective for navigating evolving global crypto regulations. Standard Chartered’s conservative risk culture, developed through decades of international banking, will likely influence its gradual, measured rollout of services rather than rapid expansion. Market Implications and Future Developments The announcement signals accelerating institutionalization of cryptocurrency markets. Standard Chartered’s entry provides validation that could encourage other global banks to expand their digital asset offerings. Market structure may evolve toward more integrated service models resembling traditional finance. This development particularly benefits institutional investors seeking: Consolidated reporting across traditional and digital assets Regulated counterparties for large transactions Integrated risk management frameworks Professional client service standards Furthermore, the bank’s focus on custody and financing addresses two fundamental institutional requirements. Secure custody remains the foundational concern for institutions allocating to digital assets. Financing services enable sophisticated trading strategies and capital efficiency previously difficult to execute in crypto markets. Standard Chartered’s global network could facilitate cross-border digital asset transactions, particularly between emerging markets with growing crypto adoption. Conclusion Standard Chartered’s planned crypto prime brokerage service represents a transformative development for institutional digital asset adoption. Through SC Ventures, the bank leverages its global presence, regulatory expertise, and financial infrastructure to address critical gaps in crypto institutional services. This strategic move validates cryptocurrency’s maturation as an asset class while providing institutional investors with regulated, secure access previously lacking. The Standard Chartered crypto prime brokerage initiative will likely accelerate institutional participation, improve market structure, and establish new standards for digital asset services in traditional finance. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a crypto prime brokerage service? A crypto prime brokerage provides institutional investors with consolidated services for digital asset trading, including custody, financing, and execution. It functions similarly to traditional prime brokerage for stocks and bonds but specifically for cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Q2: When will Standard Chartered launch this service? The service remains in early development stages as of March 2025. Standard Chartered has not announced a specific launch date but indicates the offering will roll out gradually across approved jurisdictions following regulatory approvals and client testing. Q3: How does this differ from existing crypto custody services? While custody is one component, a prime brokerage offers additional services like margin financing, securities lending, and consolidated reporting. Standard Chartered’s offering integrates custody with financing and potentially other services in a single platform for institutional clients. Q4: Which clients can access this service? The service targets institutional clients including hedge funds, family offices, asset managers, and corporations. Retail customers will not have access to these institutional-grade prime brokerage services through Standard Chartered. Q5: How does this affect cryptocurrency market stability? Increased institutional participation through regulated entities like Standard Chartered may improve market stability over time. Institutional involvement typically brings greater liquidity, improved risk management practices, and enhanced market surveillance capabilities.

At the time of writing, 63 of the top 100 coins have gone down over the past 24 hours. Also, the total crypto trading volume stands at $87.2 billion, quite lower than what we’ve been seeing over the past few weeks. TLDR: Crypto market cap is up 0.6% on Monday morning (UTC); 63 of the top 100 coins and 4 of the top 10 coins decreased today; BTC increased by 0.7% to $91,271, and ETH is up 1.2% to $3,128; US prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell; Markets may ‘begin to believe that the Fed is no longer fully insulated from politics’; Bitcoin is sensitive to such institutional risk; Heightened risk aversion supports BTC’s relative downside resilience in the short term; South Korea may be ending its nine-year ban on corporate crypto investment; Coinbase said it would withdraw support for major crypto legislation if the US Senate negotiators add restrictions on stablecoin rewards; US BTC and ETH spot ETFs posted outflows of $249.99 million and $93.82 million, respectively; Investors pulled $750 million from these two ETF categories during the first full trading week of the year; Crypto market sentiment is still decreasing towards the fear zone. Crypto Winners & Losers With the beginning of the new week, at the time of writing on Monday morning, 4 of the top 10 coins per market capitalisation have seen their prices fall over the past 24 hours, while 4 have posted gains in the same timeframe (not taking the stablecoins into account). Bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated by 0.7% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $91,271. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) increased by 1.2%, now trading at $3,128. The category’s biggest gainer is Solana (SOL) , which posted a 3.6% increase to $141. It’s followed by Lido Staked Ether (STETH) , having gone up 1.3% to the price of $3,124. On the red side, the highest drop is XRP (XRP)’s 2.1%, now trading at $2.05. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 2% fall to $0.1368 is next, followed by Binance Coin (BNB)’s 1.2% and Tron (TRX)’s 0.2%, trading at $902 and $0.2977, respectively. When it comes to the top 100 coins per market cap, one posted a double-digit drop. Pol (POL) is down 11.3% to $0.1584. It’s followed by Provenance Blockchain (HASH) , which declined by 9.5% to the price of $0.02155. The rest of the red coins are down below 5% each. At the same time, three coins in this category recorded double-digit increases. Monero (XMR) appreciated 18.1% to $569. Canton (CC) appreciated 10.9%, currently changing hands at $0.1459. It’s followed by MYX Finance (MYX)’s 10.2% to the price of $5.51. Meanwhile, Coinbase said it would withdraw support for major crypto legislation if the US Senate negotiators add restrictions on stablecoin rewards beyond disclosure requirements. This has increased tensions ahead of the markup scheduled for 15 January. The Senate Banking Committee marks up the Market Structure bill next week, and stablecoin rewards remain under debate. Congress already settled this in GENIUS—reopening it now only creates uncertainty and risks the future of the US Dollar as commerce moves onchain. Here’s why… — Faryar Shirzad (@faryarshirzad) January 7, 2026 On the other side of the world, South Korea may be ending its nine-year ban on corporate crypto investment. It’s forming with new guidelines that will permit listed companies and professional investors to trade crypto. ‘BTC is Highly Sensitive to Institutional Risk’ Petr Kozyakov, Co-Founder and CEO at Mercuryo , commented that BTC “has surrendered early gains after breaching the $92,000 mark in Asia trading as the biggest cryptocurrency mirrors leading US tech stocks in a risk-off mode retreat.” Markets appear to be weighing growing tensions between US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and President Donald Trump. Against this backdrop, and amid escalating geopolitical risks, traders are retreating to safe-haven assets such as gold and silver, the CEO writes. “Meanwhile, in the digital token space, the narrative of increasing inflows into privacy coins, which so defined the final months of 2025, is continuing to play out with Monero and Zcash recording gains of 16 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively,” Kozyakov concludes. Bitunix analysts noted that the U.S. federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. From a macro perspective, they write, this is not merely an isolated legal risk. This is “a direct challenge to one of the core assumptions underpinning market pricing: the political neutrality and policy independence of the central bank.” “The key issue is not whether the prosecution ultimately succeeds, but whether markets begin to believe that the Federal Reserve is no longer fully insulated from politics. Once that belief is shaken, global asset pricing frameworks must be reassessed,” the analysts argue. Moreover, “Bitcoin is highly sensitive to such institutional risk. When confidence in dollar credibility and central bank independence is questioned, decentralized assets tend to receive narrative-driven risk premia.” They continue: “In the short term, heightened risk aversion supports BTC’s relative downside resilience; in the medium term, attention should be paid to whether U.S. equities experience a broader systemic correction; over the long term, if political interference in monetary policy becomes structural, Bitcoin’s role as a “non-sovereign risk asset” is likely to be further reinforced.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Monday morning, BTC stood at $91,271. The coin traded mostly sideways for the first part of the past day. It then swiftly dropped to the intraday low of $90,244 before rising to the day’s high of $92,356. It has corrected lower again since. Over the past week, BTC traded in the $89,799 – $94,420 range. Overall, it decreased by 2.1% over this timeframe. A close above $91,520 may open doors for a move to $93,011, followed by $94,800, which would present the next upside test. A failure to hold above the $91,000 level could result in a pullback to $89,241 and $87,921. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,128. After a side-trading period in the $3,095 and $3,104 range, it fell to the day’s low of $3,091 and then jumped to the intraday high of $3,163. However, it has pulled back again. Looking at the 1-week period, we find that ETH decreased by 1.5%. In this timeframe, it traded between $3,068 and $3,292. If ETH manages to close above $3,180, it could see a further increase to $3,250, and then potentially retest $3,300. A move beyond this level would open additional moves toward the $3,380–$3,420 zone. Yet, a drop below $3,100 may lead to a dip below $3,000 as well. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Moreover, the crypto market sentiment is still decreasing, even if slightly, as we’ve seen over the weekend. The crypto fear and greed index has stood at 40 today since Saturday, compared to 41 on Friday. This means it’s still in the neutral zone, though just barely. As this metric drops, the market participants’ caution and concern rise. Most are waiting for further macroeconomic and geopolitical signals that would indicate the market direction. Source: CoinMarketCap ETFs Outflows Continue The US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) closed the week with outflows. On Friday, these funds saw negative flows of $249.99 million . Therefore, the total net inflow pulled back to $56.4 billion. That said, only three funds posted any flows: one inflow and two outflows. Fidelity is the only one in the green, taking in $7.87 million. On the other hand, BlackRock recorded outflows of $251.97 million, while Bitwise let go of $5.89 million. Source: SoSoValue Moreover, the US ETH ETFs also posted negative flows on 9 January. The outflows for the day amounted to $93.82 million . The total net inflow now stands at $12.43 billion. Of the nine funds, two posted outflows. None saw inflows again, the same as on Thursday. BlackRock let go of $83.78 million, while Grayscale saw $10.04 million in outflows on the same day. Source: SoSoValue Meanwhile, investors pulled almost $750 million from the two largest crypto-linked ETF categories during the first full trading week of the year. Also, the BTC support level of $79,000 is also the average purchase price of the US ETFs, per CryptoQuant . Many ETF holders would be at the break-even level if BTC hits this zone. Below that level may lead to losses for institutional investors, potentially leading to sell-offs. GM CryptoQuant reports that the $79,000 level is an important support area for Bitcoin. This level coincides with the average purchase price (realized price) of investors in American Bitcoin ETFs.

The crypto market recorded an increase over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the US stock market closed the Friday session notably higher. By the closing time on 9 January, the S&P 500 was up 0.65%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 1.02%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.48%. They were recovering from drops seen a week earlier. Is this rally sustainable? This is hardly a rally, and many would say it’s a temporary and expected minor increase. Analysts argue that the market is consolidating, meaning that we may see prices go up and down over the next several days, but not really moving in either direction.

That gave it the top spot, pushing Samsung to second place with 19% share, though it wasn’t even close in terms of growth because while Apple saw a 10% jump in shipments compared to the year before, Samsung barely scraped 5%. Total smartphone shipments around the world grew 2% in 2025. That makes two years in a row of growth. The big drivers were financing plans, aggressive marketing, and the rising demand for 5G phones in countries still catching up. In the first half of the year, brands rushed to ship more phones before tariffs kicked in. But those tariffs didn’t hit as hard as people feared, so the second half wasn’t a disaster. Source: Counterpoint The year ended with some parts of the world doing better than others. Japan, the Middle East, and some Asian markets helped balance out the slow demand in the U.S. and Europe. iPhone 17 and upgrade cycle push Apple to a strong Q4 In the last three months of 2025, Apple locked down 25% of the global smartphone market in Q4, which is its highest ever for any quarter. Samsung followed with 17%. “The iPhone 17 series gained significant traction in Q4 following its successful launch, while the iPhone 16 continued to perform exceptionally well in Japan, India and Southeast Asia. This dual momentum was further amplified by the COVID‑era upgrade cycle reaching its inflection point, as millions of users were due for replacement,” said Counterpoint. Counterpoint’s report said millions of people who bought phones during COVID were ready to swap them out in 2025. The timing worked in Apple’s favor. Samsung stayed in second place. Its Galaxy A series did well in the middle price range. The Galaxy Fold7 and S25 sold better than the models before them, especially in the high-end category. Samsung still has problems in Latin America and Europe, but it stayed steady in Japan and its strongest markets. Other brands hold on while supply problems build for 2026 Xiaomi held the third spot with 13% market share, as its sales remain strong in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Its mix of mid-range and flagship phones helped keep things steady. Vivo was next, up 3% thanks to good offline sales in India and a tight product lineup. OPPO dropped 4% because of falling sales in China and the rest of Asia. It did okay in India and the Middle East, but not enough to balance the losses. OPPO is now folding realme into its business. Together, they’ll hold 11% of the market, which puts the combined company in fourth place. Outside the top five, Nothing grew fast; 31% year-over-year. Google followed with 25% growth. Both are small but growing quickly. Tarun Pathak, the research director, said 2026 might be rough. There’s a shortage of DRAM and NAND chips, and prices for parts are already rising. Chipmakers are focusing on AI data centers instead of smartphones. Phone prices are already going up. Counterpoint dropped its 2026 shipment forecast by 3%. Tarun said Apple and Samsung will probably be okay because they have stronger supply chains and sell more expensive phones. Cheaper brands selling to low-income markets might struggle more.

Schiff recently highlighted one of the predictions on X, and labelled it as “worthless.” Gold and silver exploded to fresh all-time highs on Monday in a dramatic surge that veteran investor and known Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff says should worry Americans rather than excite them. In a stark warning on X, Schiff argued that the precious metals’ vertical move is a sign of deepening economic stress and not a routine market rally. “Gold is up over $80, a record high above $4,590. Silver is up over $4, a record high above $84,” he wrote in an X post today. “Prices are melting up for a reason, and it’s not good. While it’s exciting for those of us who own gold and silver, keep in mind that it foretells economic hardship for most Americans,” he added. His comments landed just as global markets confirmed a powerful safe-haven rush into bullion, driven by geopolitical tensions, uncertainty around U.S. monetary policy, and renewed concerns over financial stability. Precious Metals Rip to New Highs According to data from CoinCodex, gold burst above $4,600/oz earlier today, extending a months-long climb fueled by investors seeking safety amid escalating geopolitical risks and deteriorating confidence in the global economic outlook. Similarly, silver jumped to a record high alongside the price of gold. Gold price (Source: CoinCodex ) Since soaring to another high, the price of gold has retraced slightly to trade at around $4,593 at the time of writing. Geopolitical Tensions Add Fuel to the Rally Sharp gains across both metals were also supported by rising tensions in the Middle East, ongoing U.S.–China trade uncertainty, and worries about tariff decisions expected in the coming weeks. Safe-haven demand has subsequently risen consistently across global exchanges, with traders citing recession fears, political instability, and tightening financial conditions as the core drivers behind the surge. Cryptos Slide Amid Precious Metals Rally While gold and silver may have rallied in the past 24 hours, the same cannot be said about prices in the crypto market. Over the last couple of weeks, cryptos have consistently lagged behind precious metals. That trend continued in the past 24 hours. According to CoinCodex, the overall crypto market cap slid a fraction of a percentage throughout the past trading day. The top 10 largest cryptos by market cap contributed to the price slump. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped a fraction, but still trades above the $90K level. Meanwhile, the remaining top 10 cryptos, except for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) , all recorded 24-hour losses. ETH saw a minor uptick in the past 24-hours, while SOL led in terms of gains in the top 10 list with a more than 2% gain during the same period. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple’s XRP suffered the biggest losses in the top 10 list after both of their prices dropped more than 2%.

View counts have returned to levels last seen in early 2021. Industry tracker Benjamin Cowen, founder of ITC Crypto, revealed the downturn using a 30-day moving average of views across multiple prominent crypto YouTubers. According to the data, engagement was down, and Benjamin stated that the decline is not tied to any specific platform. The metric has steadily fallen over the past three months, reaching depths not seen since the early stages of the last major crypto bear market. Crypto YouTube viewership is falling across multiple platforms Viewers today have lost interest in cryptocurrency-related content on YouTube, resulting in a significant drop in viewership on these channels over the past three months. YouTube creators like Tom Crown said he saw the slowest growth on his channel in October because his views, comments, and likes all started falling at the same time. Tom also said that prices kept changing, but that wasn’t enough to attract more viewers, as his engagement remained the same. Bitcoin investor Polaris XBT also noted that fewer people today watch daily updates, react to market news, or participate in online discussions about crypto. Analysts have noted that interest in cryptocurrency has been waning for some time, as fewer people are actively following the market to make informed investments. They have no specific reason for the slowdown, and since it can’t be attributed to a platform or recent event, they attribute it to a change in consumer preferences. Retail investors are pulling back from crypto content Many creators claim that their viewership is below average, despite their channels remaining active and occasionally experiencing slow growth. YouTube creator Jesus Martinez said his channel gained more subscribers and expanded after 2022. However, he says none of his videos received the same level of attention as those created in 2021, when the market was at its peak and engagement was at an all-time high. Other creators say that many retail traders avoid crypto content due to negative experiences. TikTok creator Cloud9 Markets stated that people have also lost a significant amount of money to scams and pump-and-dump schemes, and the projects have often ended up being short-lived. With their trust destroyed, viewers are unlikely to follow a new narrative, fearing they may lose their money again. Market performance also affects where retail investors focus their attention, as they are increasingly turning to gold and other metals after the price of crypto has been dropping for a long time. In 2025, cryptocurrency investments recorded weaker returns for investors, but gold maintained its strength with a stronger performance during the same period. Investors are also tired of long-term stories and strategies that promise future gains, which may take years to materialize. They now want immediate and measurable results, so they don’t spend time on content that doesn’t deliver otherwise. On-chain analytics firm Santiment said sentiment toward Bitcoin is improving. The firm examines how people discuss Bitcoin online, rather than the number of people actively participating, and notes that more people are starting to change their minds about leaving the Bitcoin network. Santiment also stated that sentiment toward Ethereum is uneven and lacks a clear path. Get seen where it counts.

After securing over $15 million in presale funding, building a fast-growing global community, and launching its first live esports product, the project has officially confirmed its TGE and exchange listings on major exchanges for the end of January 2026. This move takes XYZVerse out of presale mode and into full public market participation, opening the door to broader liquidity, open price discovery, and large-scale exposure. XYZVerse approaches this moment with working infrastructure, active engagement, and a clear product narrative already in motion. XYZVerse – the ultimate sports-themed memeverse At its core, XYZVerse is a multi-title esports platform built around competitive play, sports, and blockchain, all powered by the $XYZ token. It combines the viral energy of meme culture with competitive sports of all kinds, be it football, MMA, or Dota 2, creating a platform where players and fans can actively participate rather than simply speculate. 🔥Why XYZVerse Is Getting Attention in the Market of Memecoins A one-of-a-kind concept bringing together crypto, sports, and meme culture — opening the door to one of the largest and most active audiences in Web3 Built-in, playable utility from day one: $XYZ powers real activity across the platform, from joining games and leagues to voting, predictions, digital items, rewards, and on-chain engagement Officially recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project, underlining XYZVerse’s breakout position in the meme-coin space Rock-solid security, with smart contracts audited and verified by Pessimistic and SolidProof A high-conviction upside narrative, with long-term projections pointing toward up to 99,900% growth from early-stage levels Join the ultimate sports memeverse and explore $XYZ as the project approaches its next major milestone. Proof of Utility: The World’s First On-Chain CS2 League XYZVerse isn’t positioning itself on promises alone. It is already delivering real-world utility through its flagship product: the world’s first on-chain Counter-Strike 2 League. The XYZVerse CS2 League is a crypto-powered esports tournament that merges competitive gaming with on-chain infrastructure, demonstrating how the platform operates in practice. Key highlights include: 10 teams will compete in intense 5v5 MR12 matches Teams composed of top KOLs, project founders, and community players, with community participation selected via lottery from Access Pass holders A 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 XYZ prize pool Fan-driven interaction, including map voting, match predictions, and reward-based engagement Digital collectibles and on-chain transparency, ensuring verifiable results and fair distribution Privacy-first options, such as masked play, alongside encouraged co-streaming for broader reach Participation is unlocked through the XYZVerse Access Pass, priced at 100 USDT, which grants: - Voting and prediction rights - Lottery entries to play in the league - Access to exclusive VODs and content - Deeper integration into the XYZVerse ecosystem With an expected 1 million+ views across streams, the CS2 League showcases XYZVerse as a functioning platform — not a theoretical one — and highlights how esports, blockchain, and community engagement intersect in a live environment. Secure your spot now before passes sell out! What Else Makes XYZVerse Special? At its core, XYZVerse is built around the idea that interaction with the platform itself becomes the engine of value creation. Most crypto projects generate income that flows primarily to the team or company. XYZVerse introduces a different model through its Revenue Router — a system that automatically redistributes platform revenue back into the ecosystem. In simple terms: XYZVerse is trying to turn a gaming platform into a self-feeding engine where usage automatically rewards the token and the players instead of just enriching the company. How the Revenue Router Works Whenever XYZVerse generates revenue — through competitions, games, betting mechanics, or other platform activity — that revenue is deterministically routed into three core areas: Token buybacks: A portion of revenue is used to buy $XYZ tokens from the open market, increasing demand. Token burns: Some of the tokens purchased are permanently removed from circulation, gradually reducing total supply. Prize pools and ecosystem growth: Funds are directed toward rewards, tournaments, incentives, and platform expansion to attract new users and retain existing ones. This creates a closed-loop value system: more players and fans lead to more activity, more activity generates more revenue, and that revenue strengthens the token and the platform itself. Sustainability Initiative: Supporting the Token, Rewarding Long-Term Holders Following the Token Generation Event, XYZVerse will activate its Sustainability Initiative, designed to reinforce long-term ecosystem health and align platform success with token holder value. As part of this initiative, 10% of net profits generated by XYZVerse partner projects will be periodically allocated toward buying back $XYZ tokens on the open market. These buybacks are not discretionary or opaque. All purchases are executed through a publicly visible buyback wallet, allowing the community to independently verify transactions and ensuring full transparency. The objective of the Sustainability Initiative is threefold: Support token demand through consistent market buybacks Reduce circulating supply by removing tokens from active circulation over time Reward long-term holders by aligning token dynamics with real revenue generation Rather than relying on inflationary rewards or short-term incentives, XYZVerse’s approach is designed to create a measured, sustainable feedback loop where ecosystem growth directly benefits the token economy. Presale Success and Market Position The XYZVerse presale has shown strong market confidence and support from a vibrant crypto community. The presale began at an initial price of $0.0001 and has since progressed to $0.00715, representing a 71× increase while still in the presale stage. This growth highlights consistent interest from early participants ahead of the project’s transition to public markets. According to project disclosures, a potential listing price of $0.10 has been outlined, positioning the upcoming TGE as a key moment for broader price discovery once the token becomes publicly tradable. From a security and transparency standpoint, the $XYZ token has undergone independent smart contract audits by both Pessimistic and SolidProof, and the core team has completed KYC verification, reinforcing a commitment to operational credibility and user trust. Looking ahead, XYZVerse has announced plans to list on multiple Tier-1 centralized and decentralized exchanges. Dive into XYZVerse presale before the price moonshots! sWhat Comes Next: Expanding the XYZVerse Ecosystem XYZVerse’s long-term vision extends far beyond a single title or tournament.

57097044,656584,1768219209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57097044.jpeg,CEO Of Largest XRP Treasury Company Shares The Real Truth Behind What It Does,https://bitcoinist.com/truth-behind-what-xrp-does/,"Asheesh Birla, the CEO of the largest XRP treasury company , Evernorth, has explained what his company is focused on, even as they continue to accumulate more XRP. Birla also explained what makes XRP stand out from other crypto assets in the market. What The XRP Treasury Company Evernorth Does During an interview on Paul Barron’s Podcast, Birla explained how his company’s approach differs from that of other digital asset treasury companies. He noted that the XRP treasury company helps grow the XRP ecosystem by offering both technical and financial support. The Evernorth CEO highlighted his background in creating products, which enables him and his company to innovate in the DeFi landscape. Furthermore, in addition to building products in the XRP ecosystem, the CEO of the XRP treasury company also mentioned that they deploy capital to earn yields through DeFi protocols on the network. As such, he believes that his company stands out from other digital asset treasury companies , since most other DATs focus solely on providing investors with exposure to crypto assets. Meanwhile, the CEO of the XRP treasury company stated that, in the long run, Wall Street will reward those who build in the ecosystem and provide yields to investors at the same time. It is worth mentioning that Evernorth just partnered with Doppler to advance institutional liquidity and treasury use cases on the XRP Ledger. Both firms are also exploring structured frameworks for deploying XRP at scale. Evernorth is backed by Ripple, which contributed some of its XRP holdings to kickstart the company’s treasury. Birla also praised Ripple, while noting how the company’s acquisitions last year will help push XRP’s institutional adoption. He also highlighted the uniqueness of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), stating that it is well-positioned to meet the DeFi needs of institutional investors. Future Plans For Evernorth Evernorth’s CEO stated that his XRP treasury company plans to build more partnerships, even as it seeks to extend its business model beyond generating yields from DeFi protocols. He hinted that they are already looking to partner with some XRP stakeholders in Japan and South Korea. His company is also working closely with XRP Ledger developers. Birla noted that these developers are currently working on institutional lending on the XRP Ledger , and he believes his company could help by deploying capital and generating yields. Based on their roadmap, the Evernorth CEO is confident his company will remain the leading XRP treasury for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, he predicted that companies with the expertise to build in these crypto ecosystems will be the ones that will stand the test of time, even as he expects some DATs to fail. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.08, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Asheesh Birla|Coinmarketcap|DATs|DeFi|Evernorth|Paul Barron|ripple|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Treasury|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-12 12:00:09

While buyers continue to show up at key levels, the broader structure still points to the possibility of one final downside test before a sustainable move higher can take shape. Wave IV Still Unfinished As C-Wave Pressure Persists Crypto analyst More Crypto Online, in a recent update, explained that Solana’s chart structure still points to the possibility of another downside move before the ongoing correction is fully completed. Within the orange scenario, price action continues to align with a C-wave decline in a broader wave IV correction, keeping the corrective outlook valid as long as the structure remains non-impulsive. Related Reading: Solana Accumulation Narrative Strengthens With Big Institutions, A Rally Imminent? Even when viewed through the alternative white scenario, the current pullback can still be classified as an A-wave, which leaves room for another low before a B-wave recovery begins or before a potential fifth wave to the upside develops. In both interpretations, the analyst noted that the correction may not yet be finished. From a short-term perspective, the chart suggests that Solana could drift lower into the $81 to $90 region. Currently, there are no clear structural signals indicating an immediate bullish continuation, as the absence of impulsive upside movement keeps downside scenarios firmly in play. However, if prices were to turn higher from current levels without setting a new low, the broader structure since January 2025 would start to resemble a triangular consolidation rather than a completed wave IV. This alternative setup would imply extended sideways movement instead of a rapid trend resumption. Until stronger upside momentum appears, the focus remains on the risk of one more corrective low. Controlled Reaction At The 50% Fibonacci Signals Solana Buyer Strength AltCoin Việt Nam stated that Solana’s current price action is showing a strong and reassuring reaction around the 50% Fibonacci level. Instead of breaking down aggressively, the price has been rebounding in a controlled manner, suggesting that buyers are still maintaining influence. From a wave-structure perspective, wave IV does not appear to be rushing toward completion, leaving room for wave C to extend further if the market continues to move in line with the broader rhythm. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Support Post-Gains, Testing Bull Conviction Adding to the bullish bias is the ongoing ETF narrative surrounding Solana. Spot SOL inflows are not arriving in a FOMO-driven manner, but rather through steady accumulation across several sessions. This type of capital flow often reflects longer-term positioning rather than short-term speculation, which explains why the price tends to rebound quickly whenever it revisits key support zones. That said, the outlook is not without invalidation. A sustained move below the 50% Fibonacci level would signal that the current structure has broken down. However, the analyst views the recent pauses as temporary breathers within a broader upward structure, rather than the beginning of a meaningful downtrend.

In a lengthy post published on X early Monday, the Ethereum co-founder explained that the blockchain is meant to support applications that can be used without the fear that functionality will vanish when a company, development team, or infrastructure provider loses interest, shuts down, or gets hacked and loses value. “Even when applications do have functionality that depends on a vendor, Ethereum can help reduce those dependencies as much as possible, and protect the user as much as possible in those cases where the dependencies fail,” Buterin noted . Ethereum has to change update model to pass the walkaway test In the post, Buterin propounded that Ethereum must be able to pass the “walkaway test,” a benchmark for whether a system can continue operating safely and effectively even if its original stewards disappear. He warned that building such resilient applications is impossible if the base layer itself still needs intervention from a central group or its founding developers, a dependence he believes undermines the network’s promise. “But building such applications is not possible on a base layer which itself depends on ongoing updates from a vendor in order to continue being usable, even if that ‘vendor’ is the entire core devs process. Ethereum, the blockchain, must have the traits that we strive for in Ethereum’s applications. Hence, the network itself must pass the walkaway test,” the programmer surmised. Buterin told his followers that if Ethereum is to become independent, it must reach a state where it can effectively stop changing without breaking its value proposition. He referred to this as “ossifiability,” meaning the protocol should be complete enough that changes are optional. “Ethereum must get to a place where we can ossify if we want to . We do not have to stop making changes to the protocol, but we must get to a place where Ethereum’s value proposition does not strictly depend on any features that are not in the protocol already,” he wrote. Buterin lists Ethereum’s technical foundations to survive long-term Buterin doubled down on his sentiments by outlining several technical conditions he claimed Ethereum must satisfy before reaching that stage, putting full quantum resistance at the top of his list. The Ethereum developer is convinced that delaying protections against any future cryptographic threats in pursuit of short-term efficiency will be the death of blockchain technology. According to Buterin, individual users can choose when to upgrade their security practices, but protocols do not have that luxury. “We should resist the trap of saying ‘let’s delay quantum-resistance until the last possible moment in the name of ekeing out more efficiencies for a while longer. Being able to say ‘Ethereum’s protocol, as it stands today, is cryptographically safe for a hundred years’ is something we should strive to get to as soon as possible, and insist on as a point of pride.” Second in his pain points was scalability, which he threw light on by saying Ethereum’s architecture should be capable of handling thousands of transactions per second over time using zero-knowledge EVM validation and data availability techniques like PeerDAS. Ideally, he continued, scaling should lean more on parameter changes than disruptive protocol forks, and those changes should be governed through validator voting mechanisms like those used for adjusting the gas limit. State management, economics and governance in play Away from Ethereum’s throughput, Buterin reiterated the importance of state management, saying the blockchain should employ a state architecture that can function reliably for decades, regardless of how much transaction volumes increase. This includes implementing forms of partial statelessness and state expiry that prevent the network from becoming too burdensome to synchronize or store. He also addressed the community’s most asked issue, asserting that Ether needs a gas pricing schedule that developers and researchers can confidently say is resistant to denial-of-service attacks, both during execution and in zero-knowledge proof generation. Drawing on years of experience with proof of stake on Ethereum and earlier research, he said the system must continue to support ETH as the best trustless collateral, including in governance-minimized stablecoins. “Every year, we should tick off at least one of these boxes, and ideally multiple. Do the right thing once, based on knowledge of what is truly the right thing and not compromise halfway fixes, and maximize Ethereum’s technological and social robustness for the long term,” Buterin concluded.

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-a-large-xrp-price-rally-is-brewing-heres-the-signal/,"Crypto markets rarely move without warning. Before sharp expansions or breakdowns occur, price action often enters a phase of tension where volatility fades, and direction becomes unclear. Experienced traders recognize these moments as pressure-building zones rather than periods of inactivity. XRP has now entered such a phase, and recent behavior suggests the market is approaching a decisive turning point. In a recent post on X, technical analyst ChartNerd pointed to XRP’s short-term chart structure, highlighting price behavior that stands out from recent trading patterns. According to ChartNerd, XRP has displayed unusually tight movement over the past several days, a condition that historically precedes strong directional moves. This compression has drawn attention because it reflects a market that continues to trade actively while refusing to break structure. $XRP : A large move is brewing.. this is unusual price action over the last couple of days.. Something has got to give sooner rather than later.. pic.twitter.com/oUxvdOlIJl — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 11, 2026 Tight Ranges Reveal Market Tension XRP’s recent candles show a narrowing range, with price repeatedly testing both support and resistance without follow-through. Buyers defend downside attempts, while sellers cap upside moves, creating a stalemate. This type of structure signals balance, but it also indicates growing pressure beneath the surface. ChartNerd emphasized that markets cannot remain in this state for long. As orders stack within a confined range, the eventual breakout tends to occur quickly and with strength. XRP has shown this behavior in previous cycles, where extended consolidation phases resolved into sharp impulsive moves rather than slow trends. Volume Stability Strengthens the Signal Volume behavior adds credibility to the setup. XRP has maintained steady trading activity despite the lack of volatility. This combination matters. When price compresses while volume remains stable, it often suggests active positioning rather than disinterest. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ChartNerd noted that the price has failed to break lower despite broader market fluctuations. This resilience implies that buyers continue to absorb selling pressure. In technical analysis, such conditions often align with accumulation phases, where larger participants build exposure quietly before a directional move. Structure Aligns With Historical XRP Moves XRP has a history of resolving low-volatility phases with sudden expansions. Past rallies frequently followed periods where the XRP price moved sideways within tight boundaries, frustrating traders before accelerating rapidly. The current setup closely resembles those historical structures, which makes the present price action unusual but not unfamiliar. Rather than focusing on predictions, ChartNerd stressed the importance of structure. Compression itself acts as the signal. When markets compress this tightly, resolution becomes a matter of timing, not speculation. What Traders Should Monitor Next As XRP continues to coil, traders will likely watch for clear signs of expansion. Larger candles, increased volume, and a decisive break from the current range would signal that the market has chosen a direction. For now, XRP remains locked in balance. Pressure continues to build, volatility remains suppressed, and participation stays intact. According to ChartNerd’s analysis, this combination rarely persists for long. A large move appears to be brewing , and when resolution arrives, it is unlikely to go unnoticed. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The turnaround in sentiment came mainly from investor worries over dropping possibilities of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March following recent macro data releases. U.S. crypto funds lead outflows with $569M weekly loss The United States was the only market to show negative sentiment for crypto funds, recording outflows of $569 million. Month-to-date flows for U.S. crypto funds stood at $133 million despite the weekly losses. Several other countries saw inflows into crypto funds during the week. Germany led positive flows with $58.9 million in weekly inflows, bringing month-to-date and year-to-date totals to $52 million. Canada recorded $24.5 million in weekly gains with $14.7 million month-to-date and $15 million year-to-date. Switzerland attracted $21 million in weekly inflows with $19.5 million month-to-date and year-to-date. Australia posted $4.7 million in weekly gains. France recorded $1.4 million in inflows. The Netherlands attracted $3.2 million. New Zealand saw $0.3 million in gains. Sweden recorded $0.4 million weekly but showed flat month-to-date performance. Brazil, Italy, and Hong Kong all recorded minor outflows or flat activity. Bitcoin crypto funds post $404.7M in weekly losses Bitcoin saw $404.7 million in weekly outflows. The losses occurred despite $112 million in month-to-date and year-to-date inflows. Short-Bitcoin products recorded $9.2 million in outflows. Crypto funds flow by asset Source: CoinShares Bitcoin crypto funds total assets under management reached $140.779 billion. Month-to-date flows of $112 million is a reversal from the strong start to January when products recorded over $1 billion in gains during the first two days. The four-day outflow streak from January 6-9 removed most early-month growth. Ethereum crypto funds recorded $116.1 million in weekly outflows while maintaining $56.9 million in month-to-date inflows and $57 million year-to-date. Multi-asset crypto funds saw $20.8 million in weekly losses. XRP and Solana crypto funds maintain positive flows Positive sentiment remained for XRP crypto funds with inflows of $45.8 million in the week. Month-to-date flows equated to $38.7 million with $39 million year-to-date. Total assets under management for XRP crypto funds were $3.879 million. Solana crypto funds attracted $32.8 million in weekly inflows with $30.2 million month-to-date and $30 million year-to-date. Total AUM reached $3.596 billion. Sui crypto funds recorded $7.6 million in weekly inflows with identical month-to-date totals and $8 million year-to-date. Chainlink products saw $3 million in weekly gains. The Litecoin crypto funds saw flat weekly activity. Zcash saw no flows. Binance products witnessed outflows of $3.7 million. Aave products registered losses of $1.7 million. Provider flows show mixed performance across platforms iShares crypto funds led the pack with $181 million in weekly inflows, bringing year-to-date totals to $517 million.

Momentum is returning, risk appetite is rising, and capital is flowing back into high-upside plays. Right as the market flips bullish, XYZVerse, the world’s first all-sports crypto-based e-platform, is approaching one of its biggest milestones yet: the Token Generation Event (TGE) and $XYZ token listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, scheduled for the end of January 2026. For a project that has spent months building, fundraising, and rolling out live utility, the timing couldn’t be better. XYZVerse at a Glance: A Listing the Market Has Been Waiting For XYZVerse is stepping into the spotlight as a sports-powered Web3 ecosystem that fuses meme-coin energy, real platform utility, and competitive gaming into a single high-impact product built to attract a massive global audience. The project has already proven its momentum, raising over $15 million in its presale and unveiling its flagship on-chain Counter-Strike 2 League featuring a $5.5 million prize pool, set to go live as the ecosystem opens to the public. Why XYZVerse Is Turning Heads🔥 A unique, first-of-its-kind concept at the intersection of crypto, sports, and memes taps into one of the largest and most engaged audiences in Web3 Real, playable utility built in: $XYZ is actively used across the ecosystem to join games and leagues, participate in predictions and voting, unlock digital items and rewards, and power on-chain engagement Officially recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , cementing its status as a standout in the meme-coin space Rock-solid security, backed by audited smart contracts verified by Pessimistic and SolidProof Massive upside narrative, with long-term projections pointing toward up to 99,900% growth from early-stage levels Where XYZVerse Fits: Meme Energy + Sports Utility + Esports Execution XYZVerse is trying to sit at the intersection of both worlds: meme culture (attention engine) sports + esports participation (retention engine) on-chain mechanics (verifiable engagement + reward rails) That positioning is important because it aligns with where late-2025 narratives were heading: memes still matter, but utility is increasingly the filter. The clearest demonstration of this approach so far is XYZVerse’s flagship CS2 League, which moves engagement beyond passive spectatorship and into active participation. Rather than simply watching matches, users are encouraged to return through Access Passes, voting and prediction mechanics, and on-chain reward distribution, creating a repeatable product loop instead of a one-off event. XYZVerse CS2 League: Bringing Esports On-Chain XYZVerse’s CS2 League, the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 esports league, represents one of the earliest large-scale attempts to connect blockchain infrastructure directly with mainstream competitive gaming. The league features: 10 teams competing in intense 5v5 MR12 matches Teams composed of top KOLs, project founders, and community players, with community participation selected via lottery from Access Pass holders A combined 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 $XYZ prize pool Fan-driven interaction, including map voting, match predictions, and digital moment collection Privacy-aware options such as masked play, alongside encouraged co-streaming On-chain transparency across match results, voting, and reward distribution Participation is enabled through 100 USDT Access Passes, which allow fans to vote, predict outcomes, access exclusive content, and collect digital collectibles tied directly to league activity. Every interaction is recorded on-chain, reinforcing transparency and accountability. Industry observers note that this combination of live esports competition and token-driven interaction sets XYZVerse apart from traditional meme projects, which often struggle to sustain engagement once initial attention fades. By embedding utility directly into the viewing and participation experience, the CS2 League offers a practical example of how meme-born projects can evolve into platforms with recurring usage. With an expected 1 million or more cumulative views across streaming platforms, the CS2 League positions XYZVerse at the crossroads of esports visibility and Web3 experimentation — a convergence that could define its next phase as it approaches its public market debut. Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! What Awaits $XYZ in 2026: From Breakout to Moonshot $XYZ is entering 2026 with serious momentum already locked in. Following a presale that surged from $0.0001 to $0.00715, the token has already delivered over 7,000% growth before public trading even begins — a clear signal of sustained demand across multiple stages and market conditions. The countdown toTGE and major exchange listings is on, with $XYZ expected to enter public markets at a starting price of $0.10. The open-market price discovery means that the ceiling is no longer defined by staged pricing. Instead, valuation begins to reflect real demand. Those who secure exposure before the listing benefit from first-mover advantage, while the broader market reacts after $XYZ hits exchanges and momentum accelerates. Price Discovery Mode: Where Momentum Takes Over Post-listing, $XYZ will no longer be constrained by presale mechanics. Instead, price action will be shaped by real-time market forces, including: Deepening liquidity across CEX and DEX platforms Rising trading volume as new buyers enter Explosive sentiment around meme + sports + esports tokens in early 2026 Most importantly, live platform utility, led by the CS2 League converting attention into on-chain demand This is the phase where breakout tokens separate from the pack — and XYZVerse is entering it with multiple engines already running. 🟢Strong Foundation Scenario: Utility Takes Hold Indicative range: $0.12 – $0.18Potential upside from listing: +20% to +80% In this scenario, XYZVerse executes cleanly out of the gate. The CS2 League launches as planned, Access Pass participation remains active, and on-chain interactions begin forming steady, repeat usage. As the market starts pricing in real esports utility rather than pure speculation, volatility stabilizes and $XYZ naturally moves above its listing level. This outcome alone would already place XYZVerse ahead of many meme-origin projects that struggle to retain engagement post-listing. 🔥 Acceleration Scenario: Visibility + Demand Collide Indicative range: $0.20 – $0.30Potential upside from listing: +100% to +200% Here, momentum begins to stack. High engagement across the CS2 League, rising visibility through streams and KOL participation, and growing transactional demand for $XYZ create a feedback loop. As sentiment around meme, sports, and esports tokens turns increasingly bullish in early 2026, XYZVerse benefits directly from all three narratives at once. In this environment, $XYZ could quickly trade at 2–3× its listing price, reflecting a market repricing driven by usage, exposure, and ecosystem activity — not hype alone. 🏆 Breakout Scenario: Ecosystem Momentum Unleashed Indicative range: $0.40 – $0.60Potential upside from listing: +300% to +500% This is the scenario where XYZVerse fully separates from the pack. It assumes the project successfully converts early traction into sustained ecosystem growth: League expansion, early brand and creator partnerships, visible buybacks, and strong community retention all begin reinforcing each other. At this stage, $XYZ starts to be valued less like an early-stage meme token and more like an engagement-driven Web3 platform with recurring activity and real revenue dynamics. Under these conditions, the market can justify a higher valuation bracket — and momentum has room to accelerate further as 2026 progresses.

Aave remains the leading lending hub, expanding available liquidity. On-chain lending is picking up in the new year, signaling robust activity from crypto natives. Lending has drawn in whales, becoming a source of liquidity for the on-chain economies of Ethereum, Solana and a few smaller chains. DeFi lending expanded in the past month, with the strongest growth since the October crash. | Source: Token Terminal Total ecosystem lending grew in the past three weeks, after months of sliding following the liquidation event on October 11, 2025. DeFi lending did not see dramatic liquidations, as the ETH collateral levels were set much lower. Despite this, the worsened market sentiment prevented lending from expanding. Aave and Morpho lead lending expansion Aave and Morpho retained the biggest share of DeFi lending due to their economic models. Aave relied on its legacy status and high liquidity in key vaults, while Morpho expanded due to curated lending pool managers. Aave has also grown its dominance from 8% to over 28% in the past two years, even growing during the bear market. In early 2026, active loans expanded to $36.6B, up $2.1B from December’s levels. This is the highest monthly growth since the drawdown began in October. Aave contributed $1.1B to the growth for the past month, while Morpho expanded its lending by $450M, based on TokenTerminal data. Total liquidatable ETH lending has grown to $2.2B, after spending months at around $1B. Most of the loans on Aave, Sky Protocol and other platforms are liquidatable at levels under $1,800 per ETH, with only a small share of loans above $3,000. Ethereum remains the main lending venue The Ethereum ecosystem remains the main lending venue, gaining support as ETH returned above $3,000. While Solana-based lending is growing, the pace and baseline levels are still much lower compared to Ethereum’s influence. Based on DeFiLlama data, lending protocols lock in $66.91B , with a slow recovery for the past few weeks. Lending growth is not yet exponential, but points to expanding influence for the top protocols. Lending also creates over $28M in weekly fees, boosting Ethereum’s economy. Ethereum increased its value locked to over $72B, up from $64B in November. A recovery of DeFi may also translate into stronger ETH gains. In 2026, the Ethereum ecosystem may also get a boost from treasury company deposits, including staking and liquid staking. The newly issued tokens may be used within the Ethereum ecosystem, depending on the treasury company’s risk appetite. Lending has already displaced DEX trading as the top Ethereum activity, with liquid staking coming in second. Loan activity signals both demand for passive income and demand for additional liquidity. For now, the market is not yet fully recovered, but DeFi activity serves as a signal for an eventual ETH recovery. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $2.04 , consolidating after breaking out of the descending trendline that had previously capped momentum. Well, this breakout signals a potential shift in market structure, suggesting that XRP may be entering the early stages of a bullish reversal. The immediate level of resistance sits at $2.41, marking the next key zone to watch. A decisive break above this level would likely confirm continuation toward higher targets, potentially reigniting broader market optimism. Conversely, failure to sustain demand could expose XRP to downside risk, with support zones in the $1.77-$2.00 range acting as critical buffers for traders. Tektonic highlights that current market dynamics are favorable for bullish continuation. The recent consolidation above the $2.00 demand zone indicates that buyers remain active, absorbing selling pressure and positioning for potential upside. This behavior reflects a classic accumulation phase, where momentum builds quietly before a larger trend emerges. Notably, $2.41 should be given a keen eye because a clean breakout and retest could trigger a sustained uptrend, boosting market confidence. A rejection, however, would put the $2.00 demand zone to the test, which has held strong so far. From a structural perspective, XRP’s price action demonstrates a textbook early-stage bullish reversal. The descending trendline breakout not only removes a key barrier but also signals that market sentiment is gradually shifting in favor of buyers. Momentum indicators support this narrative, suggesting that XRP may have room to extend its gains if demand zones continue to hold firm. Conclusion XRP’s strong defense of $2.00 and breakout above its descending trendline signal bullish potential. Immediate resistance sits at $2.41, while the $1.77–$2.00 zone offers key support.

Analysts expect net income to rise 27% from a year earlier, pushing results to a new quarterly record. TSMC, which of course remains the world’s largest contract chipmaker, is predicted to report T$475.2 billion, or $15.02 billion, in net profit for the three months ended December 31. The estimate comes from an LSEG SmartEstimate, which blends forecasts from 19 analysts and gives more weight to those with stronger track records. Any result above T$452.3 billion would mark the company’s highest quarterly profit ever and extend its run to an eighth straight quarter of profit growth. Last week, the company already reported a 20.45% jump in Q4 revenue, beating market expectations. AI demand and smartphone chips push production and outlook higher Fourth-quarter revenue strength came from full use of advanced chip capacity. TSMC ran its 3-nanometre lines at full tilt, helped by Apple’s iPhone 17 lineup using the A19 chip. AI orders stayed strong at the same time. Galen Zeng, a senior research manager at IDC, said both trends combined to drive the quarter’s performance. He added that demand for AI infrastructure did not cool late in the year. According to IDC, it now expects TSMC revenue to grow 25% to 30% in 2026 in U.S. dollar terms. That is higher than the prior forecast of 22% to 26%. The upgrade is tied to rising orders for AI server accelerators and growing output from the next 2-nanometre process. The company plans to share first-quarter and full-year guidance during its earnings call scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. By market value, TSMC sits at roughly $1.38 trillion, making it Asia’s most valuable listed firm. That valuation is more than double that of South Korean rival Samsung Electronics. The stock’s performance backed that gap. Shares listed in Taipei climbed 44.2% last year, well ahead of the 25.7% gain in the stock market. Investment spending remains heavy. TSMC is putting $165 billion into new chip plants in Arizona. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on a podcast released last week that the company is set to invest more in the country. Trade policy remains a question mark. It is not clear how tariffs under U.S. President Donald Trump will affect TSMC. Taiwan exports to the United States face a 20% tariff, but chips are excluded. Meanwhile, ahead of its Q4 earnings release, Nvidia stock traded at $184.97, down 0.1% on the day. The stock remains above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages at $182.70 and $178.30. Support sits between $178 and $180. Resistance remains near $207, a level rejected in December. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The pullback follows a four-day streak of outflows totalling $1.3 billion which has nearly wiped out the $1.5 billion of inflows recorded during the first two trading days of 2026. The abrupt shift appears closely tied to cooling expectations of a US Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March after recent macroeconomic data suggested inflation may remain more persistent than markets had anticipated. Rate Cut Doubts Weigh on Early-Year Momentum Investor optimism at the start of the year had been underpinned by hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin easing monetary policy early in 2026. However stronger-than-expected economic indicators and firm labour market data have tempered those expectations prompting risk-off behaviour across digital asset investment products. As a result much of the capital that flowed into crypto products during early January has already exited the market, underscoring how sensitive digital assets remain to shifts in macroeconomic outlooks. US Dominates Regional Outflows CoinShares reports regionally the United States accounted for the vast majority of last week’s outflows, with US-listed products seeing $569 million withdrawn. This contrasted sharply with sentiment elsewhere, as several non-US markets continued to attract capital. Germany led inflows with $58.9 million, followed by Canada at $24.5 million and Switzerland at $21 million, highlighting a notable divergence between US and European investor behaviour. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead Asset-Level Withdrawals At the asset level, Bitcoin experienced the largest outflows shedding $405 million over the week. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products also saw $9.2 million in outflows suggesting mixed conviction among bearish investors rather than a clear directional bet against the asset. Ethereum followed with $116 million in outflows, reflecting broader caution toward large-cap digital assets. Multi-asset products recorded $21 million in withdrawals while smaller outflows were seen from Binance- and Aave-linked products, totalling $3.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Select Altcoins Attract Fresh Capital Despite the broader risk-off tone some assets continued to draw investor interest. XRP led inflows with $45.8 million, followed by Solana at $32.8 million and Sui at $7.6 million. These inflows point to selective positioning rather than a wholesale retreat from the market, as investors rotate into assets perceived to have stronger near-term catalysts or relative resilience amid macro uncertainty.

This roadmap, detailed in recent communications and analyzed by industry observers like The Block, outlines the precise conditions required for the world’s leading smart contract platform to operate securely for decades without reliance on its original core development team. Consequently, this vision prioritizes future-proof cryptographic security, radical scalability, and a sustainable economic model, marking a potential final chapter in Ethereum’s foundational development phase. Ethereum’s Self-Sufficiency Roadmap: The Seven Pillars Vitalik Buterin’s framework for a mature, independent Ethereum rests on seven interconnected technical pillars. Each addresses a fundamental challenge that must be solved before the network can enter a stable, “hands-off” state. First, quantum resistance stands as the non-negotiable cornerstone. Buterin explicitly warned against delaying this upgrade for short-term efficiency gains. He argued the protocol must provide unwavering confidence in its cryptographic security for the next century, a stance highlighting the long-term perspective governing this entire plan. Second, scalability must evolve beyond current rollup-centric models to a robust system based on ZK-EVMs and PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling). This combination aims to deliver massive throughput while preserving decentralization and data integrity. Third, a long-term state management system via statelessness is crucial. This would allow validators to verify the chain without storing the entire state, drastically reducing hardware requirements and barriers to participation. Fourth, a fully abstracted account model would simplify user experience and smart contract interaction, removing friction for mainstream adoption. Fifth, the fee market requires a redesign to inherently defend against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks , ensuring network stability under all conditions. Sixth, the consensus layer needs a sustainable Proof-of-Stake structure that balances security, issuance, and validator incentives over an indefinite horizon. Finally, a censorship-resistant block production mechanism is essential to uphold the network’s credibly neutral and permissionless ethos. The Quantum Imperative: Security for the Next Century Buterin placed particular emphasis on the urgency of quantum resistance, a topic gaining traction across the cybersecurity landscape. Quantum computers, while still in early development, pose an existential threat to current public-key cryptography, which secures all digital assets on Ethereum. A sufficiently powerful quantum machine could theoretically break these keys and forge signatures. Therefore, Buterin’s insistence on prioritizing this upgrade reflects a profound commitment to stewardship. “The protocol must provide confidence in its cryptographic security for 100 years,” he stated, framing the issue as a foundational requirement for true longevity. This proactive stance pushes Ethereum to integrate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, such as lattice-based cryptography, well before the threat materializes. Expert Analysis: The Path to a “Finished” Protocol Industry analysts view this outline as Ethereum’s path to becoming a “finished” product. Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, has previously discussed similar long-term horizons, often referring to the concept of “The Scourge” and other endgame challenges. Buterin’s synthesis provides a cohesive checklist. Transitioning to this stable phase means the core protocol would require no further structural changes, only routine maintenance and parameter adjustments. This maturity would allow the current core developers, including Buterin himself, to step back, ensuring the network’s survival and security are not tied to any individual or group. The timeline for this transition remains fluid, dependent on successful research, testing, and community consensus for each technical pillar. Scalability and Sustainability: The ZK-EVM and PeerDAS Vision The scalability solution hinges on the maturation of ZK-EVMs and PeerDAS. ZK-EVMs (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines) use advanced cryptography to generate proofs that transactions are executed correctly, enabling ultra-fast and cheap rollups. PeerDAS is a proposed data availability sampling scheme where nodes only need to check small, random pieces of data to guarantee the whole is available. Together, they aim to solve the blockchain trilemma—achieving scalability, security, and decentralization simultaneously. Furthermore, a sustainable PoS structure involves fine-tuning validator rewards, penalties (slashing), and the overall ETH issuance rate to ensure network security does not come at the cost of excessive inflation or centralization of stake. Buterin’s Seven Technical Conditions for Ethereum Self-Sufficiency Pillar Core Objective Key Technology/Concept 1. Quantum Resistance Secure cryptography against future quantum attacks Post-quantum signature schemes (e.g., lattice-based) 2. Scalability High throughput with decentralization ZK-EVMs, Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) 3. State Management Reduce validator hardware burden Verkle trees & stateless clients 4. Account Abstraction Simplify user & developer experience ERC-4337 and beyond 5. Fee Market Design Prevent network spam and DoS attacks Dynamic base fee & priority fee mechanisms 6. Sustainable PoS Long-term economic security Optimized issuance, slashing, and reward curves 7. Censorship Resistance Guarantee neutral transaction inclusion Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) enhancements The Impact on Developers, Validators, and Users This roadmap carries significant implications for all Ethereum stakeholders. For developers, a stable protocol base means a more predictable environment for building long-term applications. For validators and stakers, statelessness and a sustainable PoS model promise lower operational costs and clearer long-term economics. For end-users, the combination of account abstraction, robust scalability, and unwavering security aims to deliver a seamless, cheap, and trustworthy experience. Ultimately, achieving this vision would represent the culmination of Ethereum’s transition from an ambitious experiment to a global, immutable infrastructure layer, akin to the internet’s TCP/IP protocol. Conclusion Vitalik Buterin’s outline for Ethereum’s self-sufficiency provides a clear, technically rigorous north star for the ecosystem’s development. By prioritizing century-long quantum resistance, scalable architectures like ZK-EVMs, and sustainable economic models, the plan seeks to engineer a blockchain that can stand independently of its creators. This journey toward a stable, unchanging core protocol is the definitive step in Ethereum’s maturation. Successfully navigating this technical roadmap will solidify Ethereum’s position not just as a platform for decentralized applications, but as a permanent, resilient, and self-sustaining pillar of the digital future. FAQs Q1: What does “self-sufficient” mean for the Ethereum network? A1: In this context, self-sufficiency means the Ethereum blockchain could operate securely and correctly indefinitely without requiring structural protocol changes or active development from its original core team, relying instead on a stable, finished codebase and decentralized community maintenance. Q2: Why is quantum resistance so urgent if quantum computers aren’t mainstream yet? A2: Buterin argues for a proactive, long-term security mindset. Transitioning a global blockchain to new cryptography is a complex, multi-year process. Starting now ensures the network is secured well before powerful quantum computers become a practical threat, protecting user assets for decades to come. Q3: How do ZK-EVMs and PeerDAS improve scalability? A3: ZK-EVMs allow layer 2 rollups to process thousands of transactions off-chain and submit a single, cryptographically verified proof to Ethereum. PeerDAS ensures the data for these transactions is available without requiring every node to store it all, enabling high throughput while keeping node requirements light and the network decentralized. Q4: What is a “sustainable Proof-of-Stake structure”? A4: It refers to a carefully calibrated economic model for Ethereum’s consensus layer. This includes setting validator rewards and ETH issuance at a level that adequately secures the network without causing excessive inflation or encouraging dangerous centralization of staked ETH over the very long term. Q5: When might Ethereum achieve this state of self-sufficiency? A5: There is no official timeline. Each technical pillar involves significant research, development, testing, and community governance. The process will likely unfold incrementally over several years, potentially stretching into the late 2020s or beyond, as each complex upgrade is safely deployed.

His comments landed alongside a broader claim from MetaLeX founder Gabriel Shapiro that Ethereum is increasingly a “contrarian bet” versus what much of the venture-backed crypto stack is optimizing for. Shapiro framed the split in ideological terms, saying it is “increasingly obvious that Ethereum is a contrarian bet against most of what crypto VCs are betting on,” listing “gambling,” “CeDeFi,” “custodial stablecoins,” and “’neo-banks’” as the center of gravity. By contrast, he argued, “Ethereum is tripling down on disrupting power to enable sovereign individuals.” Why Ethereum Lacks A Decentralized Stablecoin Buterin’s stablecoin critique starts with what to stabilize against. He said “tracking USD is fine short term,” but suggested that a long-horizon version of “nation state resilience” points to something that is not dependent on a single fiat “price ticker.” “Tracking USD is fine short term, but imo part of the vision of nation state resilience should be independence even from that price ticker,” Buterin wrote. “On a 20 year timeline, well, what if it hyperinflates , even moderately?”That premise shifts the stablecoin problem from simply maintaining a peg to building a reference index that can plausibly survive macro regime changes. In Buterin’s framing, that is “problem” one: identifying an index “better than USD price,” at least as a north star even if USD tracking remains expedient near term. The second issue is governance and oracle security. Buterin argued that a decentralized oracle must be “not capturable with a large pool of money,” or the system is forced into unattractive tradeoffs that ultimately land on users. “If you don’t have (2), then you have to ensure cost of capture > protocol token market cap, which in turn implies protocol value extraction > discount rate, which is quite bad for users,” he wrote. “This is a big part of why I constantly rail against financialized governance btw: it inherently has no defense/offense asymmetry, and so high levels of extraction are the only way to be stable.” He tied that to a longer-running discomfort with token-holder-driven control structures that resemble markets for influence. In his view, “financialized governance” trends toward systems that must continuously extract value to defend themselves, rather than relying on a structural advantage that makes attacks meaningfully harder than normal operation. The third problem is mechanical: staking yield competes with decentralized stablecoins for capital. If stablecoin users and collateral providers are implicitly giving up a few percentage points of return relative to staking ETH, Buterin called that “quite bad,” and suggested it becomes a persistent headwind unless the ecosystem changes how yield, collateral, and risk interact. He laid out what he described as a map of the “solution space,” while stressing it was “not endorsement.” Those paths ranged from compressing staking yield toward “hobbyist level,” to creating a staking category with similar returns but without comparable slashing risk, to making “slashable staking compatible with usability as collateral.” Buterin also sharpened what “slashing risk” actually means in this context. “If you’re going to try to reason through this in detail,” he wrote, “remember that the ‘slashing risk’ to guard against is both self-contradiction, and being on the wrong side of an inactivity leak, ie. engaging in a 51% censorship attack. In general, we think too much about the former and not enough about the latter.” The constraint bleeds into liquidation dynamics as well. He noted that a stablecoin “cannot be secured with a fixed amount of ETH collateral,” because large drawdowns require active rebalancing, and any design that sources yield from staking must reckon with how that yield turns off or changes during stress.

The cryptocurrency has not experienced true price discovery since 2017. That extended period has created conditions many analysts now consider extremely favorable for investors at current levels. According to Bird (@Bird_XRPL), a crypto analyst and developer, “Whether you bought XRP at $0.10 or $2.10, you’re still sitting on a great entry.” Whether you bought XRP at $0.10 or $2.10, you’re still sitting on a great entry.

A close look at its trajectory reveals similar behavior over the past few years. These ranges often prevent it from meaningfully crossing its peak, as it surpassed its previous record in 2025 by just a few cents. Bird notes that this period of suppression has built substantial pressure. The expectation is that once XRP enters a genuine price discovery phase, this pent-up momentum will drive rapid growth. Investors currently holding positions may find themselves in a highly advantageous situation when the market begins this next stage. Bird’s observation emphasizes the rarity of XRP’s current opportunity. “Every price at these levels and below will be seen as an absolute blessing,” he stated. This reflects a broader sentiment that XRP’s historical lows, relative to its potential, represent a strong entry point for both new and existing holders.

Bird anticipates that the cryptocurrency will break into real price discovery during Q1 2026. Once this occurs, he suggests the move will be decisive and sustained. Investors are advised to consider the current levels as highly favorable. Current conditions highlight the importance of timing and market awareness. XRP holders entering at current levels have positioned themselves to benefit from the anticipated breakout. The market’s prolonged consolidation suggests the upward move will be swift once price discovery begins. Bird recently predicted that XRP will hit a new all-time high this month . The asset has already shown positive momentum, and a sharp upward move like that could pave the way for a continued rise. With eight years of historical pressure, the XRP price could explode sooner than many expect. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This pivotal investment, led by venture capital firms XVC and Ikuyo and reported by CoinDesk, signals robust confidence in the firm’s mission to bridge traditional and digital finance. Consequently, the capital injection will directly fuel VelaFi’s ambitious plans for regulatory licensing and banking partnerships in the United States and Asia, marking a strategic leap from its regional base. VelaFi Series B Funding: A Deep Dive into the Deal The $20 million Series B round represents a major milestone for VelaFi and its parent company, Galactic Holdings. Significantly, lead investors XVC and Ikuyo were joined by a consortium of global strategic backers, including e-commerce giant Alibaba, investment firm Planetree, and BAI Capital. This diverse investor profile underscores the broad, cross-industry belief in stablecoin utility. Moreover, the funds have a clear, immediate allocation: securing necessary financial licenses in key markets and advancing bank-related business initiatives. Therefore, this move is not merely an expansion but a calculated effort to build compliant, institutional-grade infrastructure. Stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, require robust technological and regulatory frameworks to function reliably. VelaFi specializes in providing this essential backbone. For instance, their infrastructure likely includes issuance platforms, redemption mechanisms, and compliance tools. This funding enables them to enhance these systems for a global audience. Furthermore, the involvement of investors like Alibaba suggests potential integrations with vast e-commerce and payment ecosystems, adding a layer of real-world utility beyond speculative trading. The Strategic Context of Stablecoin Infrastructure Growth The funding arrives during a period of intense maturation for the cryptocurrency industry. Regulatory clarity, though evolving, is becoming a prerequisite for serious operation. VelaFi’s focus on acquiring licenses in the U.S. and Asia demonstrates a proactive, compliance-first approach. This strategy is critical for gaining trust from banks and financial institutions, which are traditionally risk-averse partners. Additionally, Latin America has emerged as a hotspot for crypto adoption due to currency volatility and underbanked populations. Galactic Holdings, by backing VelaFi, is positioning itself to export this regional expertise to developed markets. Comparatively, other infrastructure providers have also attracted substantial venture capital. For example, firms like Fireblocks and Circle have raised significant sums to build secure custody and payment rails. The table below illustrates recent comparable funding rounds in the sector: Company Focus Area Recent Round (Approx.) Year VelaFi Stablecoin Infrastructure $20M Series B 2025 Circle USDC Stablecoin & Payments $400M+ (Various) 2022-2024 Stablecorp CAD-Pegged Stablecoins $5M Seed 2023 This context shows VelaFi’s round is substantial for a Series B, especially for a firm with a specific geographic and technological niche. The capital will be used to compete in a landscape where regulatory moats and banking relationships are key competitive advantages. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Future Trajectory Industry analysts view this funding as a validation of the “infrastructure layer” thesis in crypto investing. Venture capital is increasingly flowing to foundational businesses that enable applications, rather than to speculative tokens alone. The participation of traditional global investors like Alibaba and BAI Capital indicates a shift. These entities are not purely crypto-native; they seek tangible business use cases. Stablecoin infrastructure for cross-border payments, remittances, and treasury management presents such a case. The timeline for impact is clear. In the next 12-18 months, observers should watch for: License Announcements: Successful applications with regulators in Singapore, Hong Kong, or specific U.S. states. Banking Partnerships: Official collaborations with regional banks in target markets for fiat on-ramps and off-ramps. Product Expansion: New stablecoin-related products or services tailored for institutional clients. Failure to achieve these milestones could signal strategic hurdles, but the current investor vote of confidence suggests a strong execution plan is in place. Conclusion The $20 million Series B funding for VelaFi is a pivotal event with implications beyond a single company’s balance sheet. It highlights the growing convergence of venture capital, traditional finance, and digital asset infrastructure. Strategically, the move enables VelaFi and Galactic Holdings to transition from a Latin American leader to a global contender in the stablecoin infrastructure arena. Ultimately, the success of this expansion will depend on navigating complex regulatory landscapes and forging solid banking relationships. This funding provides the essential fuel for that challenging journey, making VelaFi a firm to watch in the evolving narrative of global fintech and cryptocurrency integration. FAQs Q1: What is VelaFi’s primary business? VelaFi is a stablecoin infrastructure provider. It builds and maintains the technological and operational systems required to issue, manage, and integrate stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar—for businesses and financial institutions. Q2: Who led the Series B funding round for VelaFi? The $20 million Series B round was led by venture capital firms XVC and Ikuyo. Other notable investors included Alibaba, Planetree, and BAI Capital, forming a consortium of global strategic backers. Q3: How will VelaFi use the $20 million in funding? The capital is specifically allocated for two strategic initiatives: first, to acquire necessary financial services licenses in the United States and Asian markets, and second, to develop and launch bank-related business initiatives to bridge digital and traditional finance. Q4: Why is stablecoin infrastructure important? Stablecoin infrastructure is the foundational layer that ensures stablecoins are securely issued, reliably redeemed, and fully compliant with regulations. Robust infrastructure is critical for gaining trust from users, businesses, and especially banks, enabling use cases like cross-border payments and settlements. Q5: What does this funding mean for the parent company, Galactic Holdings? For Latin America-based Galactic Holdings, this successful funding round validates its strategic investment in fintech infrastructure. It provides the resources to scale VelaFi’s proven regional model into major global markets, potentially increasing the group’s overall influence in the digital asset ecosystem.

This substantial transaction, confirmed on January 11, 2025, significantly bolsters the firm’s cryptocurrency reserves. Consequently, Strategy now commands a formidable treasury position of 687,410 BTC, valued at a staggering $51.8 billion. The company’s calculated, long-term approach results in an average acquisition cost of $75,353 per Bitcoin. This acquisition represents one of the largest single corporate Bitcoin purchases recorded, underscoring a pivotal shift in institutional asset allocation strategies. Analyzing the Landmark Bitcoin Purchase Strategy’s latest transaction is not an isolated event but a continuation of a deliberate treasury reserve policy. The firm began accumulating Bitcoin several years ago, methodically building its position during various market cycles. This recent $1.3 billion purchase, executed at an average price near $91,700 per BTC, demonstrates unwavering conviction. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the timing, given current macroeconomic conditions characterized by persistent inflation concerns and geopolitical uncertainty. Historically, corporations like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block have pioneered this asset class adoption. However, Strategy’s scale now positions it as a definitive leader in corporate Bitcoin holdings. Furthermore, the purchase mechanics likely involved over-the-counter (OTC) desks or direct exchange acquisitions to minimize market impact. Such a large order would cause significant price volatility if placed on public spot markets. The firm’s transparency regarding its average purchase price provides a rare window into its investment discipline. For context, the following table compares major corporate Bitcoin treasuries as of early 2025: Entity Total BTC Held Approx. Value (USD) Public Disclosure Date Strategy 687,410 BTC $51.8 Billion January 11, 2025 MicroStrategy ~210,000 BTC ~$15.8 Billion Ongoing Disclosures Tesla ~10,500 BTC ~$790 Million Q4 2024 Filings Block, Inc. ~8,027 BTC ~$604 Million December 2024 This data illustrates Strategy’s dominant position. The firm’s holdings now equate to roughly 3.27% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply, a concentration that highlights its strategic commitment. The Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Phenomenon The trend of corporations allocating treasury reserves to Bitcoin has evolved from a niche experiment to a validated financial strategy. Initially, proponents cited Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency debasement and an uncorrelated store of value. Now, years of real-world testing provide empirical evidence. Companies like Strategy adopt Bitcoin for several core reasons, which financial experts consistently reference: Long-term Capital Preservation: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins contrasts with expansive fiat monetary policies. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin’s price action often demonstrates low correlation with traditional equities and bonds. Balance Sheet Optimization: Holding an appreciating asset can improve corporate equity ratios and book value over time. Technological Forwardness: Signaling alignment with digital innovation and future financial infrastructure. Regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, including the United States with specific accounting standards (like FASB’s fair value accounting for crypto), has reduced adoption friction. Moreover, secure institutional custody solutions from firms like Coinbase Custody, Fidelity Digital Assets, and BitGo now provide the necessary infrastructure for safeguarding such large allocations. This ecosystem maturity directly enables billion-dollar purchases like Strategy’s. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Precedent Financial market specialists emphasize the signaling effect of such a large-scale corporate Bitcoin purchase. Dr. Elena Vance, a professor of FinTech at Stanford Graduate School of Business, notes, “When a firm allocates over $1 billion, it’s a profound statement on asset maturity. This move validates Bitcoin’s role within modern corporate treasury management. It pressures peer CFOs to at least evaluate the asset class.” The transaction likely required approval from Strategy’s board and major shareholders, indicating broad institutional buy-in. From a market microstructure perspective, the purchase removes a substantial amount of liquid supply from the market. This reduction in available coins, known as a supply shock, can create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Historical data shows that previous large corporate announcements have preceded periods of increased retail and institutional interest. However, experts caution against viewing any single purchase as a direct price catalyst, emphasizing Bitcoin’s volatility and sensitivity to broader macroeconomic forces like interest rate decisions and global liquidity conditions. Strategic Implications and Future Trajectory Strategy’s growing Bitcoin reserve carries significant implications for its own financial strategy and the wider corporate landscape. Holding such a large position necessitates robust risk management protocols. These include secure multi-signature custody, detailed accounting treatment, and clear communication with stakeholders. The firm’s average cost basis of $75,353 per BTC is a critical benchmark. It provides insight into the management’s entry strategy and perceived value zones. With the current market price, the holding represents a substantial unrealized gain, which can impact the company’s equity and borrowing capacity. Looking forward, industry observers will monitor several key developments. First, whether other Fortune 500 companies follow with similar, albeit potentially smaller, allocations. Second, how rating agencies and debt markets treat companies with large crypto holdings on their balance sheets. Third, the potential for Bitcoin-backed financing, where firms use their BTC as collateral for low-interest loans without triggering taxable events. This mechanism, pioneered by MicroStrategy, could become a standard tool. Finally, the long-term performance of these corporate treasuries will serve as the ultimate case study for Bitcoin’s efficacy as a reserve asset. Conclusion Strategy’s monumental $1.3 billion Bitcoin purchase marks a definitive chapter in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency. By elevating its holdings to 687,410 BTC, the firm not only secures a major position in a emerging digital asset but also sets a powerful precedent for corporate treasury management. This landmark Bitcoin purchase reflects a calculated bet on Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a non-sovereign store of value. As regulatory frameworks solidify and custody solutions advance, such strategic allocations may transition from bold outliers to standard components of diversified corporate reserves. The financial world will undoubtedly watch Strategy’s journey closely, as it navigates the opportunities and challenges of pioneering this new asset class on an unprecedented scale. FAQs Q1: How much Bitcoin did Strategy buy in this recent purchase? Strategy purchased an additional 13,627 Bitcoin (BTC) for approximately $1.25 billion, as confirmed on January 11, 2025. Q2: What is Strategy’s total Bitcoin holding after this purchase? Following this acquisition, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings amount to 687,410 BTC, with a total market value of roughly $51.8 billion. Q3: What is the average price Strategy paid for its Bitcoin? The company’s average purchase price across all its accumulated Bitcoin is $75,353 per BTC. The recent tranche was bought at an average price near $91,700. Q4: Why are corporations like Strategy buying Bitcoin for their treasuries? Corporations cite reasons including long-term capital preservation against inflation, portfolio diversification, balance sheet strengthening, and positioning for the future of digital finance. Q5: Does this large purchase affect the Bitcoin market price? While a purchase of this size can reduce available supply and signal strong demand, Bitcoin’s price remains influenced by many factors, including global macroeconomics, broader investor sentiment, and overall market liquidity.

While this might look like a major red flag, the decline has yet to significantly impact the XRP price, suggesting that the situation may not be as alarming as it seems. Overview Of Ripple’s XRP Ledger 99% Crash Over the weekend, XRP Ledger transaction activity dropped sharply, falling by approximately 99% within 48 hours. On closer inspection, the decline appears primarily due to timing rather than any major technical issue in the ledger. Usually, cryptocurrency transaction volumes decline over weekends. This is because many institutional traders and market makers reduce their trading or stop entirely on weekends, leading to thinner liquidity and lower payment volumes on the ledger. Related Reading: Ripple’s 100,000 Transactions: Why XRP Investors Are Returning Notably, on-chain data from XRPScans revealed that XRPL’s payment volume between accounts declined from over 1.09 billion on Thursday, January 8, to 166.99 million on Saturday. This represents a massive drop in network usage, showing just how much activity can decrease over a weekend. Payment volume is also yet to recover, falling further to around 137.40 million as of January 11. In addition to volume decline, the number of transactions executed on the XRP Ledger during that time frame also reduced. XRPScans showed that transactions fell from over 2 million on Thursday to 1.8 million on Saturday. This decline in both volume and transfers shows that even small reductions in participation by large accounts or institutional users can significantly affect network metrics. It’s worth noting that the XRP price is still trading above $2 and remains somewhat unaffected by the recent decline in network activity. Although CoinMarketCap data shows its value dropped by more than 4% over the past week, there’s no clear evidence linking this to the recent 99% decline in the ledger. Interestingly, just days before the crash, the XRP Ledger recorded a major increase in whale transactions, each valued at $100,000 or more. This suggests that, despite temporary network fluctuations, the XRP network continues to experience substantial activity and engagement from major holders. XRPL Developer Shares New Update For Ledger Vet, an XRPL dUNL validator and developer, has shared a new update on the XRP Ledger, revealing that a large batch of fixes and amendments is now nearing its activation timer. This marks a critical step for the blockchain network, promising to enhance functionality and security for developers and users. Related Reading: XRP Retrace Is Only Temporary, What Happens Once the Uptrend Resumes Vet has stated that the upcoming changes cover several important features, including TokenEscrow, AMMClawback, Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT), and Price Oracle.

He added that the team is also working diligently to ensure all features operate smoothly, independent of XRP’s current market price.

For the three months that ended on December 31, the Indian software company reported sales of 670.87 billion rupees, or $7.44 billion. This exceeded market experts’ projections of 666.76 billion rupees and represented a 4.9% increase, according to LSEG data. AI services and regional growth drive performance The results showed growth even during a typically slow period when many companies reduce their spending at year-end. TCS stated that its AI-related work now brings in $1.8 billion annually, accounting for roughly 5.8% of total revenue. Business improved in five of the eight regions where TCS operates. The Middle East and Asia led the way with 8.3% growth, while Continental Europe expanded by 3.5%. The most notable change came from North America, which accounts for nearly half of what TCS earns. That market grew for the first time since the July-September period of 2023. “The North America market has risen as the demand slowdown has bottomed out but we expect a gradual recovery as structural weakness continues,” said Ambarish Shah, who follows the company for Systematix. Companies that buy services from India’s $283 billion information technology sector have been careful about spending money on new projects due to worries about the American economy. Worries about the American economy have made them hesitant. Additional concerns include possible U.S. tariffs and a proposed $100,000 fee for work visas. Profits fall short despite revenue gains Despite the revenue increase, TCS saw its profit drop 14% to 106.57 billion rupees. That fell short of the 130.24 billion rupees analysts had forecast. The company pointed to one-time costs from cutting jobs, expenses related to new Indian labor laws that took effect in November 2025, and various legal bills. The value of new contracts signed during the quarter totaled $9.3 billion, down from $10.2 billion in the same period last year. TCS secured eight new deals, the highest number among India’s five largest IT companies, with clients including British grocery chain Morrisons and Danish phone company Telenor. The company announced it will pay shareholders 11 rupees per share, plus an additional special payment of 46 rupees per share. Its stock price in Mumbai rose 1.3% before the results came out.

While the leading blockchain has witnessed sharp growth in several key areas, one area is currently standing out, and that is the economic activity on the network. A Divergence Between Ethereum’s Real Activity And Price With the broader cryptocurrency landscape evolving, Milk Road, a market expert and trader, has revealed that the Ethereum network is showcasing signs of robust strength. When compared to its recent price performance , the leading network subtly conveys a different narrative. Despite the fact that ETH’s market value has occasionally fluctuated or even lagged behind riskier assets, the quantity of economic activity being settled on the blockchain has continued to rise. The disparity highlights a crucial aspect of ETH’s current cycle that its fundamentals are strengthening beneath the surface, while market sentiment is not accurately reflecting it. At the same time, the Ethereum network is being chosen for live deployment by increasing institutional capital. This kind of increases a chain that is becoming less of a speculative asset and more of a financial infrastructure. According to Milk Road, these participants are more focused on uptime, liquidity, settlement certainty, and compliance, which narrows the set of viable networks quickly. Meanwhile, the economic weight placed on Ethereum’s base layer becomes significant as more activity occurs on the chain, increasing transaction volume and fee income. As seen in the past, ETH has had difficulty staying flat for extended periods of time when demand is high. However, the analyst expects the price of ETH to increase as adoption rises . Real Assets Are Swamping The Network According to a report from Leon Waidmann, the head of research at On-Chain Foundation, Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) are quickly emerging as one of Ethereum’s key growth drivers. With real-world assets moving into ETH, the development is bringing traditional finance activity on-chain at a fast rate. This change is more than just buzz as institutional infrastructure, token issuance, and settlement volumes are all growing at the same time, transforming ETH’s status. Data shows that the market cap of stablecoins found on the network is approximately $190 billion, indicating ETH’s growing choice as the major chain for crypto finance . Meanwhile, the total amount of tokenized funds has reached between $6 billion and $7 billion, and is still growing rapidly. Its tokenized commodities have hit over $4 billion, which appears to be still breaking out to new highs. Furthermore, ETH’s tokenized stocks are valued at around $400 million to $500 million, but this is just the beginning. Such a scenario suggests that tokenization of real-world assets may be the foundation of Ethereum’s next significant adoption phase. Considering the robust growth in these areas, Waidmann stated that “ETH is becoming the default settlement layer for real assets .” Waidmann’s claims are not based on simple narratives, but on the fact that the network already works at scale.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum network|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Leon Waidmann|Milk Road|On-chain Foundation|real-world assets|RWAs,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-12 13:30:54

This strategic decision, reported by Unfolded on March 21, 2025, represents a significant maturation point for blockchain infrastructure companies. Consequently, the financial markets are now closely watching this pivotal event. BitGo IPO Details and Strategic Ambitions The reported $201 million target for the BitGo IPO underscores the company’s growth trajectory. BitGo provides institutional-grade custody, trading, and security solutions for digital assets. Therefore, a successful public listing would provide substantial capital for expansion. The funds will likely accelerate technological development and global market penetration. Moreover, this move follows a broader trend of crypto-native firms seeking traditional market validation. Historically, BitGo has established itself as a foundational player. The company pioneered the multi-signature security wallet and serves over 1500 institutional clients. For instance, its client base includes exchanges, funds, and family offices. This established reputation provides a solid foundation for its public market debut. The planned IPO arrives during a period of increased regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States. The Evolving Cryptocurrency Custody Landscape Cryptocurrency custody is the secure storage of private keys controlling digital assets. It is a critical service enabling institutional investment. Traditionally, institutions required regulated, audited custodians before allocating capital. BitGo, along with competitors like Coinbase Custody and Anchorage, has filled this essential role. The sector’s growth directly correlates with institutional adoption rates. The following table compares key metrics among leading custody providers: Provider Year Founded Key Service Regulatory Status BitGo 2013 Multi-sig Custody, Prime Services NY Trust Charter, Multiple SOC 2 Certifications Coinbase Custody 2018 Cold Storage, Staking NY Trust Company Anchorage Digital 2017 Bank-Grade Custody First Federally Chartered Crypto Bank This competitive landscape highlights BitGo’s first-mover advantage. However, the IPO will intensify scrutiny on its financial performance and security protocols. Furthermore, public market investors will demand transparent reporting and robust governance structures. Expert Analysis on Market Impact Financial analysts view the BitGo IPO as a bellwether for infrastructure firms. A successful offering could pave the way for similar companies. Conversely, challenges might signal investor caution toward crypto-adjacent businesses. The $201 million figure suggests careful valuation based on current market conditions. Industry experts note that custody revenue is typically tied to assets under protection and transaction fees. Therefore, BitGo’s prospectus will reveal crucial data on its: Assets Under Custody (AUC): The total value of digital assets secured. Revenue Streams: Breakdown from custody, trading, and lending services. Enterprise Risk Management: Details on insurance coverage and security audits. This data will provide unprecedented insight into the economics of a major crypto custodian. Regulatory experts also emphasize the importance of its compliance framework. BitGo’s New York Trust Charter is a significant asset, demonstrating regulatory engagement. Regulatory Context and Future Trajectory The U.S. securities landscape for crypto firms has evolved significantly. The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved Bitcoin spot ETFs, creating new custody demands. This regulatory progress creates a more favorable environment for a BitGo IPO. The company’s offering will test public market appetite for a pure-play custody business model. Potential impacts of a successful listing are multifaceted: Increased Institutional Trust: Public listing enhances transparency and credibility. Capital for Innovation: Funds can finance new security technologies and services. Market Consolidation: BitGo could acquire smaller competitors to expand its suite. However, the path includes inherent risks. Market volatility, regulatory shifts, and technological threats like quantum computing pose challenges. BitGo’s leadership must navigate these complexities while satisfying public shareholders. The company’s long-term vision likely extends beyond simple custody to becoming a full-service digital asset bank. Conclusion The planned BitGo IPO for $201 million is a defining event for the cryptocurrency industry. It marks a transition for a key infrastructure provider from private to public markets. This move validates the growing institutionalization of digital assets. Moreover, it provides a transparent benchmark for valuing crypto security enterprises. The success of this BitGo public offering will influence investment trends and sector growth for years to come. Ultimately, it represents a vote of confidence in the future of regulated, secure digital asset management. FAQs Q1: What is BitGo and what does it do? BitGo is a leading financial technology company specializing in the secure custody, trading, and financing of digital assets. It provides institutional investors with regulated, insured storage solutions for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Q2: How much does BitGo aim to raise in its IPO? According to reports, BitGo is planning its initial public offering to raise approximately $201 million from public market investors. Q3: Why is a cryptocurrency custody firm going public significant? A public listing for a custody firm signals maturity in the crypto infrastructure sector. It provides transparency, enhances institutional trust, and opens traditional capital markets to businesses built around digital asset security. Q4: What are the main risks associated with the BitGo IPO? Key risks include regulatory changes affecting digital assets, volatility in crypto markets impacting custody revenue, competition from other custody providers, and the technological risk of security breaches. Q5: How does BitGo’s IPO compare to other crypto company listings? Unlike consumer-focused exchanges like Coinbase, BitGo represents a backend infrastructure play. Its success would demonstrate investor confidence in the essential, fee-based services that underpin the broader digital asset ecosystem.

The Chart Looks Strangely Familiar,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-is-btc-quietly-repeating-its-2025-breakout-pattern-the-chart-looks-strangely-familiar/,"Bitcoin is trading near $90,500, and while price action looks calm, the chart suggests something more familiar is forming beneath the surface. The current consolidation closely resembles the structure Bitcoin built in early 2025, just before a major breakout that carried prices sharply higher. This time, the pattern is unfolding at a much higher level. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is priced at $90,578, with daily trading volume around $31.5 bn and a market capitalization above $1.8 tn. Price remains compressed inside a narrowing range, a condition that historically does not persist for long. Bitcoin’s Range Looks Unfinished, Not Weak Bitcoin has spent recent sessions fluctuating between the high-$80,000s and low-$90,000s, repeatedly stalling near resistance at $91,900. This behavior mirrors the March–May 2025 phase, when BTC appeared directionless before breaking above $86,000 and accelerating higher. What matters is not the lack of momentum, but the structure. Buyers continue to step in on dips, while sellers defend the same ceiling. This has created a tightening range that increasingly resembles a symmetrical triangle, a pattern often associated with volatility expansion rather than trend exhaustion. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Analysis: Ascending Support Keeps the Bias Constructive Technically, Bitcoin price prediction seems neutral as BTC continues to print higher lows, supported by a well-defined ascending trendline from January. Price is hovering near the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, both of which have flattened, signaling balance rather than bearish pressure. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators reinforce this view. The RSI is holding in the mid-50s, recovering from earlier weakness without becoming overstretched. This suggests Bitcoin has room to move if buyers regain control near resistance. Key technical signals include: Rising trendline support holding above $90,200 Repeated rejection near $91,900 without breakdown Neutral RSI pointing to stored momentum Flat EMAs indicating consolidation, not reversal What a Break Above $91,900 Could Trigger The $91,900–$92,000 zone remains the key level to watch. A confirmed daily close above this area would complete the current triangle structure and likely open the door to $93,000, followed by the upper range near $94,800. Bitcoin’s mirroring last year’s consolidation vibes. Remember when it chilled between $76K-$86K before blasting off to $125K We’re seeing the same setup: stuck in $84K-$94K and once it smashes through $94K, new ATH incoming Bull run loading… Who’s with me? $BTC $MSTR https://t.co/wa1vCPNbkh pic.twitter.com/yEAq9WPOWs — Against Wall Street (@aganstwallst) January 9, 2026 In 2025, a similar breakout led to gains of more than 40% over the following months. While history does not repeat perfectly, the resemblance suggests Bitcoin may again be building energy rather than topping out. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin.

This emerging trend suggests the market is successfully absorbing supply from these seasoned investors, potentially signaling a new phase in Bitcoin’s market cycle. The analytics firm’s data indicates decreasing net outflows from addresses holding BTC for extended periods, marking a notable departure from previous selling patterns observed during market transitions. Understanding Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Dynamics Glassnode’s analysis focuses specifically on Bitcoin long-term holders, defined as addresses holding BTC for at least 155 days. These investors typically represent the most committed segment of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Their behavior often serves as a reliable market indicator because they generally accumulate during downturns and distribute during price appreciation phases. The current reduction in selling pressure from this cohort suggests several important market developments. Firstly, the decreasing net outflows indicate that the market has absorbed a substantial portion of the supply these holders released. Secondly, this trend suggests that remaining long-term holders are becoming increasingly reluctant to part with their Bitcoin at current price levels. Market analysts interpret this behavior as potential confidence in Bitcoin’s longer-term value proposition despite recent volatility. The transition from distribution to accumulation phases among long-term holders has historically preceded significant market movements. The Mechanics of On-Chain Analysis Glassnode employs sophisticated on-chain metrics to track Bitcoin long-term holder behavior with precision. The firm analyzes wallet addresses, transaction volumes, and holding patterns across the entire Bitcoin blockchain. This data-driven approach provides objective insights into investor sentiment and market structure. The current findings emerge from tracking the net position change of long-term holder cohorts, comparing current outflows to historical patterns across multiple market cycles. Specifically, Glassnode measures the volume of Bitcoin moving from long-term holder addresses to exchanges and other destinations. When this volume decreases consistently over time, it signals reduced selling pressure. The firm’s analysts cross-reference this data with other metrics including exchange balances, miner flows, and institutional activity to provide comprehensive market context. This multi-dimensional analysis helps distinguish between temporary fluctuations and genuine trend changes. Historical Context and Market Implications Examining historical patterns reveals why the easing of Bitcoin long-term holder selling pressure matters significantly. During previous market cycles, similar reductions in selling from this cohort often preceded periods of price stabilization and eventual appreciation. The table below illustrates key historical comparisons: Period Long-Term Holder Behavior Subsequent Market Performance 2018-2019 Bear Market Selling pressure peaked then eased Preceded 2020-2021 bull market 2022 Market Correction Sustained distribution phase Followed by accumulation in 2023 Current 2025 Trend Decreasing net outflows Market absorption phase ongoing This historical perspective provides crucial context for understanding current market dynamics. The easing selling pressure suggests the market is transitioning from a distribution phase to what analysts term an “absorption phase.” During this period, new buyers gradually acquire the Bitcoin that long-term holders previously sold. This process typically creates a stronger foundation for future price movements as ownership transfers from weak to strong hands. Expert Perspectives on Market Absorption Industry experts emphasize several key factors contributing to the current market absorption of Bitcoin supply. Institutional adoption continues to provide consistent demand, with regulated investment vehicles and corporate treasuries accumulating Bitcoin throughout 2024 and into 2025. Additionally, global macroeconomic conditions including inflation concerns and currency devaluation fears have driven sustained retail interest. The maturation of Bitcoin’s infrastructure, including improved custody solutions and regulatory clarity in major markets, has also facilitated this absorption process. Market analysts note that the current absorption phase differs from previous cycles in both scale and composition. The participation of traditional financial institutions has created more diversified demand, potentially leading to different price discovery mechanisms. Furthermore, the development of Bitcoin-based financial products and Layer 2 solutions has expanded utility beyond simple store-of-value applications. These developments may influence how quickly the market absorbs available supply and how this absorption translates into price action. Technical Indicators Supporting the Trend Multiple technical indicators corroborate Glassnode’s findings about easing Bitcoin long-term holder selling pressure. The Realized Cap HODL Waves metric shows decreasing proportions of Bitcoin supply held by short-term holders. Meanwhile, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long-term holders has stabilized near neutral levels, indicating reduced profit-taking behavior. These technical signals collectively suggest a maturing market structure with decreasing sell-side pressure. Key technical observations include: Decreasing exchange inflows from long-term holder cohorts Stabilizing coin days destroyed metrics after previous spikes Increasing illiquid supply as Bitcoin moves to cold storage Reduced volatility in long-term holder net position changes These technical developments occur alongside fundamental improvements in Bitcoin’s network security and adoption metrics. The hash rate continues reaching new all-time highs, demonstrating robust miner commitment despite recent halving events. Active address counts maintain healthy levels, indicating sustained network usage. These combined factors create a more resilient market structure capable of absorbing supply without significant price disruption. Global Market Context and Regional Variations The easing of Bitcoin long-term holder selling pressure unfolds within a complex global market context. Regional variations in regulatory approaches, adoption rates, and economic conditions create diverse selling and buying patterns. In North America, institutional participation dominates absorption, while Asian markets show stronger retail accumulation patterns. European markets demonstrate balanced participation across investor categories. These regional differences contribute to the overall market’s ability to absorb supply from long-term holders without creating excessive price volatility. Regulatory developments in 2024 and early 2025 have significantly influenced market structure. Clearer frameworks in major jurisdictions have reduced uncertainty for long-term holders considering disposition of their Bitcoin. Simultaneously, these regulations have facilitated entry for new institutional participants seeking Bitcoin exposure. This regulatory maturation has created more orderly market conditions where supply absorption can occur gradually rather than through disruptive selling events. Potential Future Scenarios and Market Evolution Based on current trends, market analysts project several potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s evolution following the easing of long-term holder selling pressure. If absorption continues at current rates, the market may experience reduced volatility and more gradual price discovery. Alternatively, if new demand accelerates while supply remains constrained, more pronounced price movements could occur. The balance between these forces will determine Bitcoin’s price trajectory through 2025 and beyond. Several factors could influence future developments: Macroeconomic conditions including interest rate policies and inflation trends Technological developments in Bitcoin’s protocol and Layer 2 solutions Regulatory clarity in remaining major markets Institutional adoption pace among traditional finance entities Global adoption in emerging markets facing currency instability Market participants should monitor these factors alongside on-chain metrics to assess whether the current absorption phase represents a temporary pause or a more fundamental shift in market structure. Historical patterns suggest that successful absorption phases typically last several months before clear directional trends emerge. Conclusion Glassnode’s analysis revealing easing Bitcoin long-term holder selling pressure provides crucial insights into current market dynamics. The decreasing net outflows from these committed investors indicate successful market absorption of previously distributed supply. This development, occurring within the context of sustained institutional adoption and improving regulatory clarity, suggests Bitcoin’s market structure continues maturing. While historical patterns provide useful context, the unique characteristics of the current cycle—including unprecedented institutional participation and global macroeconomic conditions—create new dynamics for market observers to analyze. The ongoing absorption of Bitcoin supply from long-term holders represents a significant phase in the cryptocurrency’s evolution as a global asset class. FAQs Q1: What defines a Bitcoin long-term holder according to Glassnode? Glassnode typically defines Bitcoin long-term holders as addresses holding BTC for at least 155 days. This threshold helps distinguish between transient traders and committed investors who have demonstrated conviction through extended holding periods during various market conditions. Q2: Why does easing selling pressure from long-term holders matter for Bitcoin’s price? Reduced selling from long-term holders decreases available supply on the market. When this occurs alongside sustained demand, it creates favorable conditions for price appreciation. Historically, similar patterns have preceded significant bullish movements in Bitcoin’s market cycles. Q3: How does Glassnode track long-term holder selling pressure? Glassnode analyzes on-chain data including wallet addresses, transaction volumes, and movement patterns. The firm tracks Bitcoin flowing from addresses identified as long-term holders to exchanges and other destinations, measuring net outflows over specific time periods to identify trends. Q4: What other indicators should investors watch alongside long-term holder behavior? Investors should monitor exchange balances, miner flows, institutional activity reports, macroeconomic indicators, and regulatory developments. Combining these factors with on-chain data provides a more comprehensive market view than any single metric alone. Q5: Could the easing selling pressure reverse quickly? While possible, significant reversals typically require substantial changes in market conditions or external events. The gradual nature of the current trend, combined with improving fundamentals, suggests any reversal would likely be preceded by observable changes in other market metrics.

After years of waiting, the whale’s first sale happened on October 2, 2025, just before one of the market’s biggest liquidation events. The whale then sold some of the remaining ETH at the end of November. Later, all the remaining tokens were sold, with one 26,000 ETH deposit to Bitstamp leaving the wallet with a final balance of $23. Even at that level of deposits, the ETH exchange reserves have barely budged. Even with whale selling, for now, the market still absorbs the additional tokens. The reserves on Bitstamp remained near an all-time low, signaling either an OTC trade for the whale. Bitstamp retained around 8.57M ETH in its reserves, down by over 50% since August 2025. Whales remain more bullish on ETH ETH has been predominantly traded by whales, with a mix of profit-taking and accumulation.

Even the OG whale’s selling was compensated by the latest buying from Bitmine , adding 109,504 ETH. The recent whale’s actions may be an attempt to take profits during a relatively liquid time in the market. ETH trading volumes recovered to the higher end of their range at around $20B daily, allowing more selling opportunities. Bitstamp does not offer an ETH premium or staking services, and may simply be used to sell on the spot market. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This development, first reported by Walter Bloomberg, signals the administration’s serious consideration of a Wall Street veteran for the nation’s most influential economic role during a period of significant economic transition. Federal Reserve Chair Selection Process Enters Critical Phase The Federal Reserve Chair appointment process has entered its decisive stage with President Trump’s interview of Rick Rieder scheduled for this week. Consequently, the financial community watches closely as this selection could reshape monetary policy direction for years. The current Fed Chair’s term concludes in February 2026, but presidential nominations typically occur well in advance to ensure smooth transitions. Moreover, this timing allows for Senate confirmation hearings and thorough vetting procedures. Rick Rieder brings substantial Wall Street experience to the interview process. As BlackRock’s CIO of Global Fixed Income, he manages approximately $2.4 trillion in assets. Furthermore, his career spans three decades across multiple financial institutions. Rieder frequently comments on monetary policy through media appearances and published research. His perspectives often emphasize practical market considerations alongside traditional economic indicators. Background and Qualifications of the Leading Candidate Rick Rieder’s professional background presents both strengths and potential considerations for the Federal Reserve Chair role. Previously, he served as head of Global Credit at Lehman Brothers before its 2008 collapse. Subsequently, he joined BlackRock in 2009 during the financial crisis recovery period. His fixed income expertise covers Treasury securities, corporate bonds, and emerging market debt. Additionally, Rieder holds an MBA from Wharton and undergraduate degrees from Emory University. The table below compares key aspects of recent Fed Chairs and Rieder’s profile: Attribute Jerome Powell Janet Yellen Rick Rieder Profile Primary Background Investment Banking/Law Academic Economics Asset Management Previous Fed Experience Fed Governor (2012-2018) Fed Vice Chair/Governor No Fed Experience Market Experience Carlyle Group Partner Limited Direct Experience 30+ Years Wall Street Academic Credentials Juris Doctor Ph.D. Economics MBA Finance This comparison highlights Rieder’s distinctive profile among modern Fed Chair candidates. His selection would mark the first appointment of a sitting asset manager executive to the position. Potential Policy Implications and Market Reactions Financial markets demonstrate particular sensitivity to Federal Reserve leadership changes. Historically, transitions between Fed Chairs create periods of uncertainty until policy preferences become clear. Rieder’s potential appointment raises several important considerations for monetary policy direction: Interest Rate Approach: Rieder has previously advocated for gradual normalization of interest rates following emergency levels Balance Sheet Management: His market experience suggests nuanced understanding of quantitative tightening effects Regulatory Perspective: Asset management background may influence financial stability oversight approaches Communication Style: Extensive media experience could translate to transparent Fed communications Market analysts note that Rieder’s appointment might signal continued focus on market functionality alongside traditional inflation and employment mandates. However, some observers question whether Wall Street experience adequately prepares candidates for the Fed’s broader public responsibilities. Historical Context of Federal Reserve Appointments Federal Reserve Chair selections historically balance multiple considerations including economic philosophy, political alignment, and managerial capability. President Trump’s previous Fed appointments included both conventional choices like Jerome Powell and unexpected nominations like Judy Shelton. The current process occurs against a complex economic backdrop featuring moderate inflation, stable employment, but persistent concerns about fiscal sustainability and financial stability. The Federal Reserve faces several immediate challenges that the next Chair must address: Navigating the final stages of post-pandemic policy normalization Managing the balance between inflation control and employment support Overseeing implementation of Basel III endgame regulations Addressing structural changes in banking and financial markets Maintaining institutional independence amid political pressures These challenges require substantial technical expertise and political skill. Consequently, the interview process likely explores candidates’ approaches to these multidimensional responsibilities. Expert Perspectives on the Selection Process Monetary policy experts emphasize the significance of this selection for long-term economic stability. Dr. Sarah Jensen, former Fed economist now at the Brookings Institution, notes: “The Federal Reserve Chair influences policy for years beyond any administration’s term. The selection criteria should prioritize technical competence, institutional respect, and commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate.” Meanwhile, market strategists focus on potential policy continuity or change. Michael Torres of Global Macro Advisors observes: “Rieder understands market mechanisms deeply, but the Fed Chair role requires balancing market needs with Main Street realities. His interview likely explores this balance specifically.” Political analysts highlight the timing considerations. With President Trump expected to announce his final selection later this month, the Senate confirmation process would begin shortly thereafter. Historical data shows Fed Chair confirmations typically require 2-4 months from nomination to final Senate vote, though contentious nominations can extend this timeline significantly. Conclusion President Trump’s interview with BlackRock CIO Rick Rieder for the Federal Reserve Chair position represents a critical juncture for American monetary policy. This potential appointment could bring substantial Wall Street experience to the nation’s central bank leadership during a period of economic transition. The selection process underscores the enduring importance of the Federal Reserve Chair in shaping economic outcomes for all Americans. Ultimately, the administration’s final decision will influence interest rates, financial regulation, and economic stability for years to come, making this one of the most significant economic policy decisions of 2025. FAQs Q1: When will President Trump announce the final Federal Reserve Chair selection? President Trump is expected to announce his final selection later this month, according to the Walter Bloomberg report. The announcement timing allows for Senate confirmation proceedings before the current term concludes. Q2: What makes Rick Rieder’s background different from previous Fed Chairs? Rick Rieder would be the first sitting asset management executive appointed as Federal Reserve Chair. His career primarily involves managing BlackRock’s fixed income portfolios rather than academic economics, central banking, or commercial banking backgrounds typical of previous chairs. Q3: How might markets react to a Rieder appointment as Fed Chair? Financial markets might initially respond positively to his deep market understanding, though some investors could question potential conflicts of interest from his Wall Street background. Long-term reactions would depend on his actual policy decisions rather than his career history. Q4: What are the main challenges facing the next Federal Reserve Chair? The next Fed Chair must navigate policy normalization, balance inflation and employment goals, implement new banking regulations, address financial market structural changes, and maintain institutional independence amid political pressures. Q5: How does the Federal Reserve Chair appointment process work? The President nominates a candidate, who then undergoes FBI background checks, financial disclosure reviews, and Senate Banking Committee hearings before a full Senate confirmation vote. The process typically requires several months from nomination to final confirmation.

The revelation comes amid a global surge in crypto-related crime , prompting coordinated crackdowns from law enforcement agencies. In late October, enforcement officers raided a red-brick industrial unit in Northampton, seizing thousands of unlicensed Alluvi-branded weight-loss pens, raw chemical ingredients, manufacturing equipment, and £20,000 in cash. A unit on a Northampton industrial estate. | Source: Andrew Fox/The Guardian According to the Guardian, some pens contained retatrutide, a powerful GLP-1 agonist still in clinical trials and unapproved for medical use. Despite the scale, no arrests have been made, and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has not publicly identified who ran the scheme. Crypto Venture Trails Lead to Drug Operation Documents reviewed by The Guardian connect the raided unit to Wholesale Supplements Limited, where Tariq serves as director. Customer order photographs suggest Alluvi products were sold through Ecommerce Nutri Collectiv, a website that later lost payment processing after Stripe terminated services. Companies House records show Ecommerce Nutri Collectiv Limited previously shared an address with Vantage Commercials Group Limited, a company Tariq once operated. The trading name at the bottom of Nutri Collectiv’s website redirects to Paradox Labs, previously known as Paradox Studio, a crypto venture founded by Tariq. Paradox launched Paradox Coin and Paradox Metaverse, a play-to-earn blockchain game that drew accusations of a scam from online critics and investigators. Crypto investigator Stephen Findeisen, known as Coffeezilla, publicly challenged Tariq and his brother in a YouTube interview, questioning the project’s economics and promotional claims. Tariq denied marketing a get-rich-quick scheme. Social media footage linked to Alluvi shows a distinctive bright-green Lamborghini Huracán Spyder, while local residents reported that luxury cars, including a Rolls-Royce, were frequently parked outside the raided unit. Tariq’s former company, Onyx, specialized in high-end car rental and chauffeur services. His driving record includes a 2018 incident in which he was fined £1,185 and banned from driving for 12 months after failing to identify a BMW driver who overtook a Ferrari traveling at over 135mph. He had regained his license days earlier following convictions for drink-driving and driving while disqualified. Crypto Crime Networks Face Global Enforcement Pressure One source with inside knowledge of the illegal weight-loss drug trade described those behind Alluvi as “ nasty ” operators who “made noise from day one.” The pattern mirrors broader criminal exploitation of crypto infrastructure. In November, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office arrested two men linked to the $28 million Basis Markets collapse , a hedge fund that vanished in 2022 after diverting funds to the founders’ wallets. The UK SFO made its first major crypto enforcement move by arresting two men linked to the $28M Basis Markets collapse. #UK #Crypto https://t.co/paiHemobLm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 21, 2025 The crackdown extends beyond crypto ventures into traditional operations using digital assets. Three UK men received 27 years combined for running a dark web drug operation using cryptocurrency. Similarly, in November, South Australia Police filed 800 charges and made 55 arrests in a crypto-linked ring, seizing $37.9 million using FBI evidence. Dr. Piotr Ozieranski told The Guardian that complaint-led regulation moves too slowly. “ At present, it often feels that the worst that can happen is a slap on the wrist ,” he said. “ Meanwhile, the public remains exposed to serious harm .” Medical experts warn that retatrutide has not completed clinical trials, while unregulated injectable drugs may be contaminated, incorrectly dosed, or improperly sterilized. Potential consequences include severe infections, pancreatitis, and dangerous blood-sugar fluctuations. Despite the severity, the MHRA confirmed no arrests have been made and declined to comment on Tariq, citing ongoing inquiries. The Alluvi website remains live, claiming products are unavailable due to “ huge demand ” over the Christmas period. Its Telegram channel continues attracting thousands of members who appear to place daily orders, with rumors suggesting production has shifted locations following the raid. To battle the growing crypto money laundering driven by scams, drugs, and human trafficking, Tether, the issuer of USDT, has partnered with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to strengthen cybersecurity and combat digital assets. Recent enforcement actions also include federal prosecutors charging a Chicago crypto ATM founder with a money-laundering conspiracy that moved $10 million through kiosks, while the Treasury also recently sanctioned 19 entities for crypto scams that defrauded Americans of $10 billion in 2024.

Its price tapped a new historical record, and many analysts believe the rally is far from being over. How Much More? Just a few hours ago, the popular privacy coin reached a fresh all-time high of almost $600, while shortly after it lost some momentum and currently trades at around $577 (per CoinGecko’s data). XMR Price, Source: CoinGecko XMR’s market cap soared beyond $10.5 billion, making it the 18th-biggest cryptocurrency and the undisputed leader in its niche. Zcash (ZEC), which has had its shining moments in recent months, ranks second with a capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion. Logically, the new peak caused numerous industry participants to shift their focus toward the asset. Some praised the record as a major achievement, given that it comes despite XMR’s delisting from multiple exchanges in the past. One of those is Binance, which terminated all services with the token at the start of 2024. X user il Capo of Crypto told their almost one million followers that, similar to gold and silver, XMR may experience short-term corrections but expects it to climb much higher. George predicted an ascent towards the $800-$900 range “sooner than most think,” whereas Greeny envisioned a pump above $1,000. X user Kazi appears to be the biggest optimist, forecasting a rather unrealistic (at least as of the moment) jump to $10,000. Such an increase would require XMR’s market cap to reach approximately $185 billion, nearly equal to Tether’s stablecoin USDT. Pullback on the Horizon? History shows that, in many cases, XMR’s spikes to record highs were quickly followed by painful corrections. In May 2021, the price exploded above $500, but just a few days later, it dropped below $200. A similar pattern was observed in the spring of 2025. The asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) supports the bearish scenario. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of the latest price changes and is used by traders to spot possible trend reversals. It ranges from 0 to 100, and ratios above 70 signal that XMR is overbought and due for a pullback. Conversely, anything below 30 is considered a buying opportunity. As of this writing, the RSI stands at roughly 78.

Key Takeaways: Dubai has banned privacy tokens and anonymity tools in the DIFC to align with global AML and sanctions standards. The regulator has tightened stablecoin definitions, excluding algorithmic models from “fiat crypto token” status. Crypto firms, not regulators, are now responsible for approving and monitoring the tokens they list. The decision is part of a broader overhaul of the emirate’s crypto framework that also narrows the definition of stablecoins and shifts greater responsibility for token approval onto licensed firms. Dubai Shifts Crypto Oversight From Token Approval to Firm Accountability The updated Crypto Token Regulatory Framework, which takes effect on January 12 , reflects a change in approach by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. Rather than maintaining a centralized list of approved crypto assets, the regulator will focus on enforcing global compliance standards and holding firms accountable for the tokens they choose to offer. Under the new rules, privacy tokens are prohibited across trading, promotion, fund activity and derivatives conducted in or from the DIFC. The ban arrives at a time when some privacy-focused assets have seen renewed market attention, but the DFSA said compliance concerns leave little room for flexibility. In addition to banning privacy coins, the framework also prohibits regulated firms from using or offering tools designed to mask transaction data, including mixers, tumblers and other obfuscation services. The move places Dubai closer to the European Union’s stance under MiCA, which has effectively pushed anonymous crypto activity out of regulated markets, while contrasting with jurisdictions such as Hong Kong that still allow privacy tokens in theory under strict licensing conditions. BREAKING: Dubai’s financial regulator has banned privacy tokens across the Dubai International Financial Centre, citing AML and sanctions risks. The updated rules also bar mixers like Tornado Cash. pic.twitter.com/VOUJ5w4bmn — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) January 12, 2026 Stablecoins are another major focus of the revised rules. The DFSA has tightened its definition of what it calls “fiat crypto tokens,” limiting the category to assets pegged to fiat currencies and backed by high-quality, liquid reserves capable of meeting redemptions during periods of stress. Algorithmic stablecoins, which rely on trading mechanisms rather than direct asset backing, fall outside that definition. While algorithmic tokens would not be banned outright, they would be treated as standard crypto assets rather than stablecoins within the DIFC framework. Perhaps the most significant shift is procedural. Instead of approving individual tokens, the DFSA will now require licensed firms to assess, document and continuously review the suitability of the crypto assets they list. The regulator said the change was shaped by industry feedback and recognizes the growing maturity of firms operating in the DIFC. UAE Continues to Attract Crypto Firms The move comes as the UAE continues to position itself as a regional hub for blockchain innovation and crypto finance, with regulatory clarity attracting major global players. As reported, a state-backed investment firm in Abu Dhabi is set to make a $2 billion investment into crypto exchange Binance using USD1, a stablecoin developed by World Liberty Financial — a crypto venture closely tied to the Trump family. Experts claim the UAE is poised to become a key destination for crypto and stablecoin ventures seeking refuge from the European Union’s (EU) newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The regulatory framework, which took full effect on December 30, is creating significant challenges for crypto firms within the 27-member bloc, prompting many to consider relocating, according to industry experts. Among its stringent requirements, small stablecoin issuers must hold 30% of their reserves in low-risk EU-based commercial banks, while major players like Tether face a mandate to maintain 60% or more in similar institutions.

The legislation has a mechanism that allows the government to trace crypto funds via the Tax Identification Number (TIN) and the National Identification Number (NIN). The initiative to make crypto transactions transparent marks a significant step forward by the West African nation, which previously had limited abilities to trace digital asset transactions. The government plans to track crypto funds and match them against income declarations and tax records by attaching the transactions to TINs. Nigeria introduces legislation to curb crypto tax evasion and avoidance The initiative also falls under the country’s new Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The new framework, which took effect on January 1, 2026, is designed to curb tax evasion and avoidance in the crypto space. The Nigerian government stated that the new framework will enable tax authorities to track information on both local and foreign crypto transactions. Nigeria’s plan to track crypto transactions mirrors efforts from other countries, including the UK, which requires crypto asset providers to collect information from their customers. Digital asset providers in Britain collect customers’ names, date of birth, and National Insurance numbers or Unique Taxpayer References for residents, and TINs for non-residents. The Nigerian government issues the TIN (Tax ID) through the Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS) and the Joint Revenue Board (JRB). The government uses the Tax ID to track individuals and businesses for tax administration, enforcement, and compliance. The West African country’s initiative comes as a report revealed that it received approximately $92.1 billion in digital assets between June 2024 and June 2025. The amount represents the total transaction value, which Nigeria hopes to benefit from once taxable. The NTAA 2025 requires Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to file monthly returns to the relevant tax authority. The law also requires the returns to contain the name, address, telephone number, email address, Tax ID, and the national identification number of individual customers. The returns are expected to include the nature of the crypto service provided, transaction dates, the type and value of the digital assets transacted, and the sales value of the cryptocurrency. Any other counterparty involved in the transaction is also required to provide the name, address, telephone number, and email address. The law also revealed that Nigerian tax authorities can request additional information from VASPs, with or without notice. Nigeria requires VASPs to flag and report large or suspicious crypto transactions The Nigerian government added that it expects VASPs to flag and report large or suspicious transactions to both the tax authorities and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU). The initiative boosts the country’s crypto oversight into its anti-money laundering framework. Crypto exchanges in the country are also required to retain Know Your Customer (KYC) records, customer transaction records, and identification data for a minimum of seven years after the last transaction. Nigeria’s income tax law requires taxable individuals in crypto activities to maintain records and books and report digital asset transactions to the relevant tax authorities. Nigeria had previously attempted to tax crypto profits under the Finance Act of 2022. The legislation introduced a 10% tax on profits from virtual assets, but the initiative failed since transactions were hard to link to individuals. The new initiative to track crypto transactions aligns with Nigeria’s Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 2025, which recognizes cryptocurrencies as securities. The regulatory change enabled the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to monitor VASPs, Digital Asset Operators (DAOs), and Digital Asset Exchanges (DAXs). Under the law, the SEC charges non-compliant VASPs approximately $7,026.57 in the first month of default and $702.66 for each subsequent month. VASPs also face the risk of licence suspension or revocation.

The collapse of FTX in 2022 and more recently high profile hacks such as the Bybit incident in early 2025 highlighted the pitfalls of the centralized custody model. These events have shifted the mindset of investors looking to safely store their digital assets. Ultimately, even the most bullish crypto asset can become worthless overnight if they cannot be safely accessed or protected. The phrase “not your keys, not your crypto” is a sentiment that has been echoed, pushing more users to learn about self custody services to securely store their crypto. Many crypto investors have adopted layered custody strategies rather than relying on a single solution. The approach now is multifaceted. This means investors are using various self custody options for various needs. For example, long term holders using hardware wallets for offline cold storage while at the same time using custody setups like multisig or MPC (Multi-Party Computation) based platforms to distribute risk for active funds. This distributed approach to holding funds gives control, convenience and risk management to the user. In this article, we highlight the top five crypto custody services for 2026. Each of these services addresses security from a different angle. The selection criteria is based on the custody model or who holds the private keys, the security infrastructure (hardware, MPC etc.), transparency, ease of use and any trade-offs between user control and third party risk. An important point to note is that “custody” in this context covers the entire security workflow, who controls access to assets and how transactions are authorized. With that in mind, the following are the top five custody services available today for you to secure your crypto assets. ChangeNOW – Best Non-Custodial Custody Flow for Active Asset Management Why it ranks #1 While ChangeNOW is known for its instant cryptocurrency swaps, it enables users to make these trades all without surrendering custody. In simple words, ChangeNOW as a platform does not hold users’ funds. Instead, it’s a platform that enables simple and quick wallet to wallet transactions. Users need not deposit funds as they typically do on a centralized exchange (where the custody lies) to execute trades. Here, you can simply move crypto assets directly between your own wallets and your crypto never leaves your personal custody during the process. Therefore, this non-custodial model offers users a simple way to rebalance portfolios without any third party custodial risks. Another strong point is that users’ privacy, both in terms of funds and identity, are upheld on this platform as ChangeNOW does not require creating an account or keeping a balance to execute swaps. Transparency and speed are at the core of the platform. Rates/fees are displayed clearly before initiating any transactions and swaps are handled within 1-2 minutes. The platform also mentions that 98% of all swaps are completed at the estimated rate or a more favorable rate in a few minutes, with exchange rate deviations kept below 0.5%. The platform also holds a 4.5 rating on Trustpilot, based on nearly 12,500 reviews. Best for: ChangeNOW is a great platform for active asset managers who store crypto across multiple wallets. These users will greatly benefit from the speed and simplicity of repositioning assets without giving up custody. Secondly, as a non-custodial platform, ChangeNOW is suitable for those worried about leaving funds on a centralized exchange with counterparty risks and those who prioritize security while being able to make adjustments to their portfolio on the go. Limitations As it is primarily a transaction facilitator service, the platform is not designed for holding assets. Therefore, users must already know how to set up wallets to send and receive assets. With self custody comes great responsibility. While users retain full control over their assets with no third party oversight, this also means that all the security measures depend on them. Users are responsible for understanding the importance of seed phrases and the necessary security protocols to keep their wallets safe. Ultimately, in the case of a users wallet being compromised, ChangeNOW will not be able to help. Ledger – Best Hardware Custody for Long-Term Storage Why it stands out Ledger is a one of the oldest and most reputed names in the crypto industry, known for its hardware wallets. Established in 2014, Ledger devices have become the gold standard for long term investors looking for the best cold storage option. One of the primary reasons why Ledger stands out is strong security infrastructure coupled with its intuitive Ledger Wallet desktop and mobile application. The ease of use makes it incredibly simple for even beginners. Since the private keys are stored on a physical device, this means your keys never leave your the device and are never exposed to any online threats. All cryptographic keys are stored in a secure element chip on the device. To date, Ledger devices have had no known remote hacks compromising the keys, highlighting their level of security. The Ledger device operates as an offline signer. This means you can initiate transactions via the Ledger Wallet app but it must go through another layer of approval on the Ledger device itself by physically pressing buttons. The transaction data is sent to the device, signed within the secure hardware environment and then returned, all while your private keys stays offline. Finally, the Ledger Wallet app allows management of over 15000 cryptocurrencies across the major networks. This broad support means users can hold a diversified portfolio on one device. Best for Ledger devices are built for cold storage. Therefore a Ledger device is ideal for those users looking to hold their crypto for the long term. That said, Ledger also makes it convenient to move funds with features like bluetooth available on some Ledger devices. This makes it suitable for security-conscious users who may occasionally need to move funds, participate in staking or interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Coinbase Custody – Best Institutional Grade Custodial Solution Why its included Coinbase Custody is the institutional wing of Coinbase launched in 2018 that provides crypto custody services for funds, enterprises and high net worth individuals. Unlike the full non-custodial services mentioned above, Coinbase Custody is fully custodial and regulated provider. This means it takes the full responsibility of their client’s funds and secures it on their behalf. The platform is New York state-chartered trust company and qualified custodian. This gives institutions confidence that meets high standards capital reserves and audits. Assets are held in distributed cold storage wallets, with regular SOC 1 and SOC 2 security audits. Since it is a qualified custodian, using Coinbase Custody can help institutions meet regulatory requirements (for example, U.S. SEC rules for custody of client funds by investment advisers). This regulated and transparent foundation sets it apart from other custodians. Another selling point is that the digital assets it holds are insured (up to $320 million of coverage under its institutional custody insurance policy). This extra layer of protection gives clients some recourse in the event of a catastrophe. Best for Coinbase Custody is best for hedge funds, family offices, asset managers and corporate treasuries looking to hold a significant amount of crypto with a trusted and regulated third party. Coinbase Custody fits that need, providing peace of mind that assets are being handled with bank-level security and oversight. If you are an investor that prefers a professional entity capable of managing the complexity of keys, backups and physical devices, a custodial solution like Coinbase makes sense. Fireblocks – Best Enterprise & MPC-based Custody Why it works Fireblocks is a digital asset custody and transfer platform made for institutional and enterprise use. It is known for its multi-party computation (MPC) service and other advanced technologies. Unlike a traditional custodian, Fireblocks can be seen as more of an infrastructure provider. Fireblocks’ main security is built on MPC wallet technology. In simple terms, MPC splits the private key into multiple secret shares held in different places, so no single device ever has the full key. In order to confirm a transaction it requires a joint signature which greatly removes the risk of a single point of failure. For example, one key shard might be on your server and another on Fireblocks’ secure enclave, a hacker in this scenario would need to breach multiple systems at the same time to get access to a key. The platform also allows organizations to define roles, permissions and approval policies for transactions. You can set multiple team members to approve large transfers, set limits on spending, whitelist addresses. Such granular control means that even internal threats or human errors can be avoided. Best for Exchanges, custodial wallet services, payment companies and corporate treasuries that need to securely manage the flow of large amounts of crypto assets will find Fireblocks invaluable. It’s designed to handle high volumes and integrate with various platforms (via API), making it suitable for fintech apps or trading operations that move crypto around frequently but cannot afford any security lapses. Any situation where multiple parties need shared yet secure access to crypto funds is a good fit. For instance, a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) treasury could use Fireblocks to require multiple members’ approval for transactions, instead of relying on a single hardware wallet held by one person. Trezor – Best Open-Source Hardware Custody Why it’s included Trezor is another renowned hardware wallet company launched in 2014. It’s known as being the first ever commercial crypto wallet and for its commitment to open-source security. Trezor devices, such as the Trezor Model T and the newer Trezor Safe 3, provide a non-custodial way to secure your cryptocurrency by keeping private keys offline. The defining philosophy of Trezor’s approach is transparency – its hardware and firmware are open-source, meaning the code can be reviewed by anyone for potential vulnerabilities. This has earned Trezor a strong level of community trust over the years Trezor has established a strong reputation over the past decade. While there have been proof-of-concept exploits against Trezor devices when attackers have specialized equipment and physical access, Trezor has responded by improving device passphrase options and even introducing a secure element in its latest model (Safe 3) to mitigate certain attacks – all while keeping the firmware open-source. The community’s trust in Trezor comes from this long history of honest communication about security and continuous improvements. Best for If you strongly believe in open-source, trustless systems, Trezor is the hardware wallet that aligns with those values. It’s ideal for users who might be skeptical of closed-source elements in other hardware wallets and who want the maximum transparency about how their keys are managed. It’s also suitable for privacy focused investors. Trezor can be used in ways that minimize data leakage. For instance, you can run the wallet interface offline via the desktop app, or pair it with your own node for Bitcoin to ensure you’re not even trusting Trezor’s servers for transaction data. Custody Comparison Solution Custody Type Key Control Best Use Case ChangeNOW Non-custodial flow User-controlled Secure asset movement Ledger Non-custodial User-controlled Cold storage Coinbase Custody Custodial Platform-managed Institutional custody Fireblocks Hybrid / MPC Shared control Enterprise security Trezor Non-custodial User-controlled Open-source custody FAQs Q: What is the safest crypto custody solution in 2026? There is no single “perfectly safe” option. Every custody method has trade-offs. Hardware wallets for cold storage are among the safest for individuals, while institutions often prefer regulated custodians with insurance. The safest approach is adopting a layered custody solution i.e. cold storage for long-term funds and limited exposure on online non-custodial services for active use. Q: Is non-custodial custody always better? Not always, it depends on the user’s skill and risk tolerance. Non-custodial custody offers full control and removes third-party risk, but all responsibility falls on you. For some users, especially beginners or large holders, custodial or hybrid solutions may be safer. Q: Can investors use multiple custody solutions? Yes, and it’s considered best practice by 2026. Many investors combine cold wallets, custodial platforms, and MPC or multisig tools for different use cases. This diversification reduces the risk of a single point of failure. Q: Why is custody more than just storage? Custody defines who controls assets, how transactions are approved, and how access is recovered. It includes security, governance, recovery, and usability—not just where assets sit. Good custody balances safety with the ability to move and manage funds when needed.",Deep Dive - Crypto|Web3 & Market Insights,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|WALLET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-12 13:52:07

Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability to support the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history.

Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved during this period, reaching above $8 billion, showing significant growth, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February, when the broader trend turned bearish again. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025, which significantly decreased the market capitalization. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached a high price of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and on August 27, it discovered the $50.99 level with changing market dynamics. On September 18, HYPE achieved its ATH at $59.30, and in October, it corrected to $50. At the start of December, the HYPE token price fell to the $31 range. At the start of 2026, the HYPE token is trending near $25, with the broader crypto market still in bearish mode.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZEC|ZRX|USDC|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-12 13:52:45

""In the past week, we acquired 24,266 ETH and still managed to increase our cash position by $73 million,"" continued Lee. ""Bitmine only issues equity selectively and only at a premium to mNAV.

Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the company moves towards unveiling its commercial MAVAN (Made in America VAlidator Network) in 2026. ""Bitmine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world."" ""At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking fee is $374 million annual (using 2.81% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day,"" stated Tom Lee. ""We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN). This will be the 'best-in-class' solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026,"" continued Lee. Bitmine crypto holding reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (MSTR), which owns 672,497 BTC valued at $61 billion.

According to verified on-chain data from analytics firm Onchainlens, this strategic purchase adds 24,266 ETH to Bitmain’s already colossal reserves. Consequently, the company’s total Ethereum holdings now stand at a staggering 4.17 million ETH, valued at approximately $12.9 billion. This move not only reinforces Bitmain’s position as a major crypto whale but also sends a powerful signal about long-term asset strategy within the volatile digital currency space. Analyzing Bitmain’s Monumental Ethereum Purchase Onchainlens, a respected blockchain intelligence provider, first reported this substantial transaction. The data reveals Bitmain’s purchase of 24,266 ETH occurred over the past seven days. Furthermore, this acquisition was executed through the company’s publicly tracked wallet address. The transaction’s timing and scale immediately captured the attention of market analysts globally. Bitmain’s total portfolio now contains 4,167,768 Ethereum tokens. This figure represents one of the largest known corporate holdings of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. To provide context, we can compare this holding to other major entities. For instance, the known Ethereum treasuries of several corporations and funds pale in comparison to Bitmain’s accumulation. Entity Estimated ETH Holdings Approximate Value (USD) Bitmain (BMNR) ~4.17 Million ~$12.9 Billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) ~3.0 Million ~$9.3 Billion U.S. Government (Seized Assets) ~50,000 ~$155 Million This comparison clearly illustrates Bitmain’s dominant position. The company’s strategy appears focused on long-term asset accumulation rather than short-term trading. The Strategic Rationale Behind Institutional Crypto Accumulation Bitmain’s latest move fits a broader trend of institutional adoption. Major firms are increasingly treating top-tier cryptocurrencies like Ethereum as strategic reserve assets. Several key factors likely influenced this decision. First, Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has reduced its energy footprint significantly. This shift aligns with growing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations for large corporations. Second, the Ethereum network serves as the foundational layer for a vast ecosystem. This ecosystem includes decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless other applications. Holding ETH provides indirect exposure to this entire digital economy’s growth. Finally, macroeconomic conditions often drive institutions toward assets perceived as hedges against inflation. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum can fulfill this role in a diversified corporate treasury. Expert Insights on Treasury Diversification Financial analysts specializing in digital assets frequently highlight this trend. “Corporate treasury diversification into crypto is no longer a speculative bet,” notes a report from ARK Investment Management. “It is a calculated strategy for portfolio resilience.” Institutions are not merely buying crypto; they are integrating it into sophisticated risk management frameworks. Bitmain’s purchase exemplifies this mature approach. The company leverages its deep industry expertise to time its market entries. Moreover, its massive existing holdings suggest a profound belief in Ethereum’s underlying technology and future utility. Bitmain’s Evolving Role in the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Historically, Bitmain gained fame as the world’s premier manufacturer of ASIC mining hardware. The company’s Antminer series dominated the Bitcoin mining landscape for years. However, its recent activities reveal a strategic pivot beyond hardware manufacturing. Bitmain is transforming into a multifaceted crypto conglomerate with significant investment arms. This $75.4 million ETH purchase is a clear testament to that evolution. The company’s investment strategy appears to follow several core principles: Long-Term Horizon: Accumulating assets to hold for extended periods, not for quick flips. Network Alignment: Investing in tokens that support and benefit from the ecosystems Bitmain participates in. Risk Mitigation: Diversifying revenue streams away from the cyclical hardware sales business. This approach provides Bitmain with multiple revenue channels. These include mining rewards, hardware sales, and now, substantial capital appreciation from its investment portfolio. The scale of its Ethereum holdings could also grant it considerable influence within that network’s governance processes in the future. Market Impact and Future Implications Transactions of this magnitude inevitably affect market sentiment and liquidity. When a known entity like Bitmain makes a large purchase, it often signals confidence to other investors. This can lead to a positive feedback loop, attracting more capital into the asset. However, analysts caution against reading too much into short-term price movements. The true impact lies in the validation of Ethereum as a legitimate store of value for billion-dollar corporations. Looking ahead, Bitmain’s actions may encourage other technology and mining firms to follow suit. We could see increased transparency in corporate crypto holdings as the practice becomes mainstream. Furthermore, regulatory clarity will play a crucial role in either accelerating or slowing this trend. Clear guidelines from bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would provide the certainty institutions need for larger allocations. Conclusion Bitmain’s $75.4 million Ethereum purchase last week is far more than a simple trade. It represents a strategic deepening of the company’s commitment to the crypto asset class. With total holdings now valued at $12.9 billion, Bitmain has positioned itself as a cornerstone institutional holder of ETH. This move underscores a broader maturation within the cryptocurrency industry, where established players are using their expertise and capital to build formidable, long-term positions. The Bitmain ETH purchase serves as a powerful benchmark for institutional confidence and strategic asset allocation in the digital age. FAQs Q1: How much Ethereum did Bitmain actually buy? According to Onchainlens data, Bitmain purchased 24,266 ETH last week, which was worth approximately $75.37 million at the time of the transactions. Q2: What is the total value of Bitmain’s Ethereum holdings now? Following this purchase, Bitmain holds roughly 4.17 million ETH. With current market prices, this portfolio is valued at approximately $12.9 billion. Q3: Why would a mining hardware company buy so much Ethereum? Bitmain is diversifying its business beyond hardware manufacturing. Holding Ethereum acts as a strategic investment, provides exposure to the ecosystem’s growth, and serves as a potential hedge and long-term store of value. Q4: Does this large purchase affect the price of ETH? While a single $75 million purchase is a small fraction of Ethereum’s daily trading volume, it can positively influence market sentiment. Large, public acquisitions by known institutions often signal confidence to other investors. Q5: Is Bitmain’s Ethereum holding publicly verifiable? Yes. Blockchain analytics firms like Onchainlens track the movement of funds to and from known corporate wallets. Bitmain’s accumulation has been observed and reported through these transparent, on-chain methods.

The multinational banking giant cites Ethereum’s expanding technological infrastructure and growing institutional adoption as primary catalysts for this anticipated surge. Ethereum 2025: The Banking Perspective Standard Chartered’s research division released its comprehensive analysis this week, marking one of the most detailed institutional endorsements of Ethereum’s potential. The bank specifically highlights ETH’s expected outperformance against Bitcoin throughout 2025. This prediction stems from multiple fundamental factors that distinguish Ethereum’s ecosystem. According to their report, Ethereum maintains a commanding position across several critical blockchain sectors. These sectors demonstrate measurable growth metrics that support their bullish outlook. The banking institution established clear price targets based on their analysis. Their immediate projection sets ETH at $7,500 for 2025. Furthermore, they envision a long-term trajectory reaching $30,000 by 2029 and $40,000 by 2030. These figures represent substantial multiples from current trading levels. The bank’s confidence stems from Ethereum’s established network effects and technological roadmap. Fundamental Drivers Behind the Prediction Standard Chartered’s analysts identified four primary pillars supporting their Ethereum forecast. Each pillar represents a distinct area where Ethereum demonstrates measurable superiority or accelerating growth. The bank’s research team compiled extensive data across these sectors to validate their projections. Stablecoin Dominance and Network Effects Ethereum currently hosts approximately 70% of all stablecoin value according to recent blockchain analytics. Major stablecoins like USDT and USDC predominantly operate on Ethereum’s network. This dominance creates powerful network effects that increase transaction volume and settlement activity. The bank notes that stablecoin transactions frequently serve as onboarding mechanisms for traditional finance participants. Consequently, Ethereum benefits directly from this growing adoption curve. Recent quarterly data shows stablecoin settlement on Ethereum exceeding $4 trillion. This figure represents a 45% year-over-year increase. Such transaction volumes generate substantial fee revenue for network validators. They also demonstrate Ethereum’s utility as a global settlement layer. The bank’s analysis suggests this dominance will continue expanding throughout 2025. Ethereum Stablecoin Dominance Metrics (Q4 2024) Metric Value Annual Growth Total Stablecoin Value $140B 32% Quarterly Settlement Volume $4.2T 45% Daily Active Addresses 850,000 28% Network Revenue Share 68% +5% Real-World Asset Tokenization Acceleration The tokenization of real-world assets represents perhaps the most significant growth area for Ethereum. Financial institutions increasingly utilize Ethereum’s blockchain to represent traditional assets. These assets include treasury bonds, real estate, and private equity funds. Standard Chartered specifically highlights this sector’s expansion throughout 2024. Their research indicates tokenized RWAs on Ethereum now exceed $15 billion in total value. Major financial players have initiated substantial tokenization projects on Ethereum recently. For instance, BlackRock launched its BUIDL treasury fund on the network last year. Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan have similarly developed Ethereum-based tokenization platforms. This institutional activity validates Ethereum’s security and compliance capabilities. The bank projects RWA tokenization could reach $100 billion on Ethereum by 2026. DeFi Ecosystem Resilience and Innovation Ethereum continues to host the largest decentralized finance ecosystem despite competition from alternative networks. Total value locked in Ethereum DeFi protocols currently stands above $55 billion. This represents approximately 60% of all DeFi value across all blockchains. The ecosystem demonstrates remarkable resilience through multiple market cycles. Furthermore, ongoing technical upgrades continuously enhance Ethereum’s capabilities. Several key innovations distinguish Ethereum’s DeFi landscape: Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: Networks like Arbitrum and Optimism process millions of daily transactions Institutional DeFi Products: Permissioned pools and compliance-focused protocols Cross-Chain Interoperability: Secure bridges connecting Ethereum to other ecosystems Advanced Financial Instruments: Structured products and derivatives gaining traction Network Throughput and Technical Evolution Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus fundamentally improved its scalability profile. The network now processes approximately 30-40 transactions per second on its base layer. However, Layer 2 solutions collectively handle over 200 transactions per second. This multi-layer architecture enables substantial throughput growth without compromising decentralization. The upcoming Ethereum upgrade, Prague/Electra, will introduce further optimizations. Network activity metrics show consistent growth throughout 2024. Daily transaction counts averaged 1.2 million across all layers. Active addresses regularly exceeded 500,000 daily. These metrics demonstrate robust utilization despite market volatility. The bank’s analysis suggests network effects will strengthen throughout 2025 as adoption increases. Comparative Analysis: Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Standard Chartered’s prediction specifically references ETH outperforming BTC during 2025. This forecast stems from fundamental differences between the two leading cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin primarily functions as digital gold and a store of value, Ethereum operates as a programmable blockchain platform. This functional distinction creates different value drivers for each asset. The bank’s research identifies several comparative advantages for Ethereum: Revenue Generation: Ethereum generates protocol revenue through transaction fees Use Case Diversity: Multiple applications beyond value transfer Developer Activity: Consistently higher developer engagement metrics Institutional Integration: Broader enterprise adoption for business processes Historical performance data shows periods of ETH outperformance typically correlate with: Major network upgrades enhancing capabilities Increased DeFi and NFT activity cycles Institutional adoption announcements Macro environments favoring risk assets Institutional Validation and Market Implications Standard Chartered’s endorsement carries significant weight within traditional finance circles. The bank operates across 59 markets and serves clients in 125 countries. Their cryptocurrency research team includes former regulators and blockchain specialists. This expertise lends credibility to their analysis beyond typical price predictions. Other major institutions have gradually increased their Ethereum exposure throughout 2024. The bank’s report arrives during a period of accelerating institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions has improved substantially. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in several countries created additional investment pathways. These developments collectively support Standard Chartered’s optimistic outlook. Market analysts generally view institutional participation as a key driver for sustained cryptocurrency growth. Risk Factors and Considerations While Standard Chartered presents a bullish case for Ethereum, their analysis acknowledges several risk factors. These considerations provide necessary context for their predictions. The cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile despite growing institutional participation. Regulatory developments could impact certain Ethereum applications differently. Technological competition from alternative smart contract platforms continues evolving. Specific risk factors mentioned in their report include: Regulatory uncertainty regarding certain DeFi applications Potential technical vulnerabilities in smart contracts or protocol upgrades Macroeconomic conditions affecting overall cryptocurrency adoption Competition from other blockchain platforms with different technical approaches Conclusion Standard Chartered’s prediction positions 2025 as a pivotal year for Ethereum’s evolution from emerging technology to established financial infrastructure. Their $7,500 price target reflects confidence in Ethereum’s fundamental strengths across stablecoins, RWA tokenization, DeFi, and network scalability. The banking institution’s analysis provides institutional validation for Ethereum’s growing role in global finance. While cryptocurrency markets remain unpredictable, Standard Chartered’s detailed assessment offers investors a comprehensive framework for evaluating Ethereum’s potential throughout 2025 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What specific price targets does Standard Chartered set for Ethereum? Standard Chartered projects ETH reaching $7,500 in 2025, $30,000 by 2029, and $40,000 by 2030 based on their analysis of fundamental growth drivers. Q2: Why does Standard Chartered believe Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2025? The bank cites Ethereum’s dominant positions in stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, and DeFi, along with measurable network throughput growth, as key factors for potential outperformance. Q3: What are real-world assets (RWAs) and why are they important for Ethereum? Real-world assets are traditional financial instruments like bonds, real estate, or commodities represented as tokens on blockchain. Their tokenization on Ethereum represents growing institutional adoption and could drive significant value to the network. Q4: How does Ethereum’s current stablecoin dominance support Standard Chartered’s prediction? Ethereum hosts approximately 70% of all stablecoin value, generating substantial network activity and fee revenue while serving as an onboarding mechanism for traditional finance participants. Q5: What risks does Standard Chartered acknowledge in their Ethereum prediction? The report mentions regulatory uncertainty, potential technical vulnerabilities, macroeconomic conditions, and competition from other blockchain platforms as factors that could impact their projections.

The divergence intensified after the Department of Justice’s actions against Fed Chair Jerome Powell sparked concerns about central bank independence, with gold climbing 1.72% and silver soaring over 4.5% in 24 hours, while Bitcoin retreated sharply from $92,000 to $90,000 .

Political Interference Triggers Capital Rotation Into Hard Assets The DOJ investigation represents an unprecedented threat to the Federal Reserve’s independence, which has remained intact for 113 years, according to QCP Asia analysts . They warned that any erosion of confidence in central bank autonomy poses a material risk to institutional credibility. Powell explicitly stated that the probe stems directly from his refusal to cut rates when Trump demanded, marking what analysts describe as an open war that has proven exceptionally damaging for risk assets.

Both gold and silver responded as the market’s default hedges against political and institutional instability, with their overnight surge extending already constructive momentum. Bitcoin Fails to Capitalize on Fiat-System Risk Narrative Bitcoin initially participated in the safe-haven rally but failed to sustain a close above $92,000 , retracing sharply toward $90,000 at the European open, a pattern that mimicked much of Q4 2024. The inability to capitalize on bullish narratives shows a structural breakdown Bitcoin has faced since October 10, as optimism around a Q1 breakout has rapidly faded among institutional traders. $BTC price is stuck in a tariff paradox. Even good news on Trump’s tariffs could shake the market. #Bitcoin #Crypto #Tariffs #Trump https://t.co/NiqTRlC1FT — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 12, 2026 QCP analysts observed significant reductions in long-dated call exposure last week, including unwinding of BTC-30JAN26-98k-C and BTC-27FEB26-100k-C positions. Portions of BTC-30JAN26-100k-C were rolled into BTC-27MAR26-125k-C, suggesting traders are pushing out bullish expectations rather than maintaining conviction in a near-term rally. US-hours selling pressure, while less concentrated than prior weeks, remains persistent as uncertainty around supply overhangs continues to cap upside potential. Retail Fear Intensifies as Smart Money Bets on Further Decline Brazilian research firm Investe Mais identified recurring retail capitulation behavior through the SOPR Short Term Holder chart, revealing short-term investors have been selling at a loss over the past 70 days despite Bitcoin’s structural uptrend. Retail sentiment approached Extreme Fear at year-end, with the indicator reaching approximately 0.98, matching levels from November 2022 when Bitcoin traded around $16,000. Source: CryptoQuant While Bitcoin reached higher highs throughout 2024-2025 in a clear uptrend, short-term realizations started declining since breaking the old all-time high, with periodic sales at a loss during high-fear episodes. Smart money traders tracked by Nansen remained net short on Bitcoin for a cumulative $127 million, adding $1.6 million worth of shorts in the past 24 hours alone. Source: Nansen The relative appeal of crypto looks increasingly challenged when set against precious metals’ resilience and equities at all-time highs, compared to Bitcoin’s 30% regression from its 2025 peak. Near-term volatility risks remain elevated ahead of critical macro catalysts, with markets expected to be sensitive to US CPI data on Tuesday and the Supreme Court’s tariff ruling on Wednesday, both of which could further influence cross-asset positioning. “Volatility is coming. A crash is coming. And it won’t be accidental,” Nobler concluded , as traders brace for continued turbulence across risk assets.

They sold 6.8 million shares of their Class A stock and made $1.13 billion. On top of that, they dumped 1.2 million shares of their Variable Rate Series A Stretch Preferred Stock for another $119.1 million. Total? $1.25 billion. Not a cent went elsewhere. They paid $91,519 per coin, including all fees. That pushes their total stash to 687,410 Bitcoins, costing them $51.8 billion altogether. That means their average buy price is now $75,353 per Bitcoin. Strategy still has billions left to throw at Bitcoin As of press time, Strategy still has $10.3 billion ready to go in their stock sale program.That’s just the common stock. There’s more. The board’s also got room to issue billions more in preferred shares: $3.9 billion in more Variable Rate, $20.3 billion in Strike Preferred Stock, $4.0 billion in Stride Preferred, and another $1.6 billion in Strife Preferred. That’s more than enough firepower to keep buying if they want to. Meanwhile, things are getting interesting . David Brickell and Chris Mills from the London Crypto Club dropped some heat in their weekly letter. They said Bitcoin is the best way to bet against the falling US dollar and that it “will regain its throne as the number one performing macro asset in 2026.” They also said Donald Trump will “hand out the candy” before the November midterms, and that the whole thing is basically a test of how people feel about the White House. Traders who bought near the top at $126,000 might sell if the price climbs back to break even. But Brickell and Mills said that might not matter much this time. They wrote: “Onchain analytics now suggest reduced profit taking and consequent supply pressure from whales and long term holders, with realised price gains decelerating.” At the time of this report, Bitcoin was trading just over $91,000, still almost 30% lower than its record high. But this whole thing lines up with what Arthur Hayes said earlier this year. He claimed the combo of free government money and a weak dollar could push Bitcoin up to $200,000 in the first quarter of 2026. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-those-who-laughed-at-xrp-will-disappear-forever-heres-why/,"Few digital assets have endured as much skepticism and persistence as XRP. For years, critics questioned its relevance while supporters focused on its long-term role within global financial infrastructure. As blockchain technology shifts from speculative trading toward real-world utility, this divide has become more pronounced. Recent commentary suggests that sentiment around XRP may be approaching a defining moment. In a post on X, crypto commentator {x} (@unknowDLT) expressed confidence that XRP’s perception will change once its role in institutional settlement becomes widely recognized. His statement reflects a broader view within the XRP community that real adoption, rather than market narratives, will ultimately determine the asset’s legacy. When it is announced that XRP will be used by all the major institutions that make up the financial system to settle transactions globally, I assure you that all those who laughed at XRP, insulted the holders, will disappear forever and cry in hiding. I can't wait to see it. — {x} (@unknowDLT) January 11, 2026 XRP Was Built for Global Settlement XRP’s core design targets one of finance’s biggest challenges: efficient cross-border settlement. The XRP Ledger processes transactions within seconds , charges minimal fees, and operates with low energy consumption. These features directly address the inefficiencies of traditional correspondent banking systems, which often rely on slow, costly, and capital-intensive processes. Unlike networks designed primarily for decentralized applications, XRP focuses on value transfer at scale. This specialization positions it as a bridge asset that can facilitate liquidity between different fiat currencies without requiring pre-funded accounts. Institutional Engagement Continues to Expand Ripple, the company most closely associated with XRP, has spent years developing enterprise-grade payment solutions for financial institutions. Through products such as On-Demand Liquidity, Ripple enables payment providers and banks to use XRP to source liquidity in real time. This approach reduces reliance on nostro accounts and improves capital efficiency. While no official announcement confirms universal adoption by all major institutions, Ripple has documented partnerships and live corridors across multiple regions . Financial institutions continue to test blockchain-based settlement tools, and central banks increasingly explore tokenized payment systems. Supporters like {x} (@unknowDLT) view these developments as steady progress toward broader integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Critics May Be Left Behind Much of the criticism directed at XRP has focused on price action and regulatory uncertainty rather than functionality. During periods of slow market performance, narratives often overshadow underlying development. History shows that infrastructure technologies frequently gain validation only after adoption reaches scale. {x} (@unknowDLT) argues that once institutional usage becomes visible and measurable, dismissive voices may fade. When utility drives demand, market perception tends to adjust rapidly. From Speculation to Utility-Driven Value The conversation around XRP increasingly centers on use rather than ideology. As financial systems modernize, assets that solve real operational problems stand to gain relevance. XRP’s focus on settlement efficiency aligns with this shift . Timelines remain uncertain, and no single announcement will transform the system overnight. However, the broader movement toward blockchain-based settlement continues to accelerate. For XRP supporters, confidence rests on function, not hype. In that context, {x} (@unknowDLT)’s assertion reflects a belief that long-term utility will outlast criticism and redefine how XRP is viewed within global finance.

The company added that authorities had been working on the case for months and reiterated its policy of cooperating with global agencies by freezing illicit or санкtion-linked addresses when legally required. Tether’s Wallet Freezes Accelerate Under Sanctions Pressure The move on Jan. 11 is consistent with Tether’s policy of voluntarily freezing the wallets that the company officially implemented in December 2023 to meet the requirements of the sanctions regime of the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury. Under its terms of service, Tether states it may freeze assets or share user information when ordered to do so or when it determines such actions are reasonable and necessary. Since adopting this approach, Tether has emerged as the most active stablecoin issuer in assisting enforcement efforts. The company’s report and blockchain analytics firm AMLBot statistics indicate that since 2023, Tether has been granted access to block well over 3 billion USDT, collaborating with over 310 law enforcement agencies in 62 locations. Tether and Circle froze $3.3B and $109M crypto in three years, showing major differences in how the two largest stablecoin issuers police illicit funds. #USDT #USDC #Tether #Circle https://t.co/iaWt2lU8Oh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2025 In its estimation of the blacklisted funds around 2023 and late 2025, AMLBot estimates that some $3.3 billion of funds are blacklisted, with approximately 1.75 billion of the funds being linked to Tron-based USDT. The latest asset freeze reflects the growing role of stablecoins in countries facing sanctions and prolonged economic stress, particularly Venezuela and Iran. In both markets, USDT has become a widely used substitute for local currencies, serving everyday payment needs and helping households preserve value amid inflation and banking distrust. Blockchain Analytics Fuel Surge in Wallet Freezes for Sanctions Violators In Venezuela, years of bolivar depreciation and limited access to reliable financial services have pushed individuals and businesses to rely on USDT for transactions ranging from basic services to commercial trade. At the same time, investigations have linked the country’s state-owned oil company to the use of USDT to settle cross-border payments and bypass sanctions. These findings prompted coordinated wallet blacklisting actions by Tether in cooperation with U.S. authorities. Iran has shown similar patterns, with protests and political tension intensified alongside the collapse of the rial; Tron-based USDT emerged as one of the most commonly used digital assets. While stablecoins offer civilians protection against inflation and capital controls, blockchain analysts report that sanctioned entities tied to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard have also moved funds through stablecoin channels. Source: TRMLabs As a result, enforcement actions have increased rather than eased, driving a rise in wallet freezes. Despite frequent attempts to evade sanctions using crypto, asset freezing has become more common because it is viewed by regulators as an effective, targeted tool. Rather than showing failure, evasion efforts have led to tighter coordination, better analytics, and broader information sharing. Source: DefiLlama With the global stablecoin market now valued at roughly $307.8 billion and USDT alone accounting for about 60.7% of that total, enforcement actions carry growing weight. Further growth in crypto asset freezes is expected in 2026, as regulators in the U.S., EU, and other major markets move from drafting rules to enforcing them, aided by stronger blockchain analytics and tighter AML and sanctions controls.

Executive chairman Michael Saylor announced today that the company acquired an additional 13,627 BTC for roughly $1.25 billion, paying an average price of about $91,519 per coin. The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 687,410 BTC, accumulated at a combined cost basis of approximately $51.80 billion. This equates to an average of $75,353 per coin. Strategy’s latest buy also marks one of the firm’s largest single acquisitions since July 2025. Back then, the company bought 21,021 BTC for approximately $2.465 billion, according to Strategy’s website . A Bigger Bet at a Higher Price Today’s announcement of another Bitcoin buy comes after Saylor had teased the buy on X just 24 hours earlier. In a post yesterday, the executive chairman shared a screenshot of the SaylorTracker chart with the caption “₿ig Orange.” Historically, posts with the SaylorTracker chart on Sundays have almost always been followed by announcements of new Bitcoin purchases from the firm. The company has repeatedly framed BTC as both its primary treasury reserve asset and a long-term inflation hedge. This strategy has largely paid off as Bitcoin surged through 2024 and 2025, attracting institutional inflows from Wall Street, sovereign wealth funds, and corporate treasuries. But the timing of this latest purchase is notable. Bitcoin has hovered between $90,000 and $92,000 in early 2026 trading. Since Strategy’s acquisition price for the latest purchase is around $91,519, the current Bitcoin price of around $90,696 means that the company is already standing on an unrealized loss. Despite the short-term paper loss linked to the latest buy, Strategy is still sitting on an unrealized gain of more than 20%, or over $10.42 billion, when including all of the purchases since 2020, data from SaylorTracker shows. Market Reacts: Shares Slide, Then Recover Slightly The market response to the news was mixed. Prior to the announcement, Strategy’s stock had dropped more than 5% during the latest trading session. Following Saylor’s disclosure, shares edged up slightly in pre-market trading today, recovering a fraction of a percentage point. Despite the small gain, MSTR is still down over 65% on the 6-month time frame. A Corporate Bitcoin Titan Strategy’s wager on Bitcoin has transformed the company from a traditional business-intelligence software firm into a pioneering, and sometimes polarizing, symbol of corporate crypto adoption. With more than 687,000 BTC, the firm now controls more than 3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, dwarfing the holdings of any public company, ETF, or sovereign entity. The strategy has delivered significant mark-to-market gains: with Bitcoin trading above $90,000, the company’s holdings are valued at more than $62 billion. This is far above the company’s aggregate cost basis. Still, critics warn that such concentration creates exposure to sudden swings in BTC price, something that investors experienced firsthand during the sharp corrections in 2022 and late 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 14:08:24
57099746,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260781,1768227011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ethereum Price Collapse: Bank of Italy’s Dire Warning Threatens Financial Stability,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bank-italy-ethereum-financial-stability-warning/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price Collapse: Bank of Italy’s Dire Warning Threatens Financial Stability ROME, Italy – The Bank of Italy has issued a stark warning that an Ethereum price collapse could threaten global financial stability, according to a recent research paper that examines systemic risks from cryptocurrency infrastructure. This central bank analysis represents one of the most detailed examinations of how blockchain network failures might transmit shocks to traditional finance. The report specifically highlights how Ethereum’s validator economics create potential vulnerabilities that could cascade through payment systems and stablecoin settlements. Ethereum Price Collapse: Understanding the Central Bank’s Concerns The Bank of Italy’s research paper, published in early 2025, examines extreme scenarios where Ethereum’s native token experiences catastrophic price declines. Central bank analysts specifically warn that because validators receive compensation in ETH, a sharp price drop could trigger mass validator exits from the network. Consequently, this exodus would weaken the blockchain’s security mechanisms and potentially delay block production. Furthermore, the report notes that Ethereum processes billions in daily transaction value, making any disruption particularly consequential. Researchers employed stress-testing methodologies typically used for traditional financial institutions. They modeled various price shock scenarios to assess network resilience. The analysis reveals that Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism creates economic dependencies that differ fundamentally from traditional payment systems. Validators must stake 32 ETH to participate in network security, creating significant exposure to token price volatility. This economic design means network security correlates directly with market confidence in ETH’s value. Financial Stability Risks from Cryptocurrency Infrastructure The Bank of Italy’s warning extends beyond Ethereum’s internal mechanics to examine broader financial stability implications. The report emphasizes that Ethereum serves as critical settlement infrastructure for numerous financial applications. Specifically, the blockchain processes transactions for major stablecoins like USDC and USDT, which maintain multi-billion dollar market capitalizations. Additionally, tokenized assets representing real-world securities increasingly rely on Ethereum’s network for settlement and transfer functions. Analysts identify three primary transmission channels for financial contagion: Payment System Disruption: Stablecoin payment delays could affect commercial transactions Settlement Failure: Tokenized asset transfers might experience processing halts Confidence Erosion: Broader cryptocurrency market panic could spill into traditional markets Historical precedents exist for such concerns. The 2022 collapse of the Terra ecosystem demonstrated how cryptocurrency failures can create market-wide contagion. However, the Bank of Italy’s analysis suggests Ethereum’s centrality creates even greater systemic importance. The network’s role as foundational infrastructure means problems could affect applications built upon it, not just Ethereum itself. Validator Economics and Network Security Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022 fundamentally changed its security model. Validators now secure the network by staking ETH rather than through energy-intensive mining. This system creates direct economic incentives that depend on ETH’s market value. When validators receive rewards in a depreciating asset, their economic rationale for participating diminishes rapidly. The Bank of Italy’s research quantifies this relationship, showing how price thresholds might trigger security degradation. The table below illustrates the relationship between ETH price and validator economics: ETH Price Scenario Annual Validator Return Projected Exit Rate Network Security Impact Current Levels 3-5% Normal churn Minimal 50% Decline 1.5-2.5% Moderate increase Some degradation 90% Decline 0.3-0.5% Mass exits likely Severe compromise Network security depends on maintaining sufficient validator participation. If too many validators exit simultaneously, the remaining participants might struggle to process transactions efficiently. This scenario could create transaction backlogs and increased fees, potentially rendering the network unusable for time-sensitive settlements. Global Regulatory Context and Central Bank Monitoring The Bank of Italy’s research aligns with increasing global regulatory attention on cryptocurrency systemic risks. Multiple central banks and international organizations have expanded their monitoring of digital asset markets in recent years. The Financial Stability Board, International Monetary Fund, and Bank for International Settlements have all published research on cryptocurrency financial stability implications. European regulators have been particularly active following the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Italy’s central bank operates within the European Central Bank’s broader framework for financial stability monitoring. The ECB has previously expressed concerns about cryptocurrency volatility and its potential impact on traditional finance. However, the Bank of Italy’s paper provides more specific technical analysis of blockchain mechanics than previous central bank publications. This detailed approach reflects growing institutional understanding of cryptocurrency infrastructure. Regulatory developments worldwide show increasing convergence on several key principles: Infrastructure Oversight: Greater scrutiny of blockchain networks as critical financial infrastructure Stablecoin Regulation: Specific rules for assets that bridge cryptocurrency and traditional finance Disclosure Requirements: Enhanced transparency about cryptocurrency exposures at financial institutions Stress Testing: Regular assessment of cryptocurrency market shocks on financial stability Historical Precedents and Market Resilience Cryptocurrency markets have experienced several major price collapses without triggering broader financial crises. Bitcoin’s 2018 decline of over 80% and the 2022 market downturn both remained largely contained within digital asset markets. However, the Bank of Italy’s analysis suggests Ethereum’s current role differs significantly from past cryptocurrency market structures. The network’s integration with traditional finance through stablecoins and tokenization creates new transmission channels. Market participants have developed various mechanisms to address volatility concerns. Stablecoin issuers maintain reserve assets and redemption mechanisms. Decentralized finance protocols implement circuit breakers and emergency shutdown procedures. Traditional financial institutions typically limit their cryptocurrency exposures through strict risk management frameworks. Nevertheless, the central bank’s research identifies potential gaps in these protective measures during extreme scenarios. Conclusion The Bank of Italy’s warning about an Ethereum price collapse threatening financial stability represents significant evolution in central bank cryptocurrency analysis. Rather than dismissing digital assets as peripheral, the research acknowledges their growing integration with traditional finance. The analysis specifically highlights how blockchain network economics create novel vulnerabilities that could transmit shocks through payment and settlement systems. While extreme scenarios remain hypothetical, the paper contributes to important discussions about regulating cryptocurrency infrastructure. Financial authorities worldwide will likely incorporate these insights into their ongoing monitoring and regulatory approaches as digital assets continue evolving. FAQs Q1: What specific scenario does the Bank of Italy warn about regarding Ethereum? The central bank examines an extreme scenario where Ethereum’s price collapses dramatically, potentially to zero. This situation could cause validators to exit the network because their ETH rewards would lose value, weakening security and disrupting transactions. Q2: How could an Ethereum problem affect traditional financial stability? Ethereum serves as settlement infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenized assets worth billions. If the network experiences security issues or transaction delays, these financial instruments could malfunction, potentially affecting businesses and individuals relying on them for payments or asset transfers. Q3: What makes Ethereum different from other cryptocurrencies in terms of financial risk? Ethereum’s role as a platform for decentralized applications, particularly stablecoins and tokenized assets, creates deeper connections to traditional finance than purely speculative cryptocurrencies. Its proof-of-stake consensus also creates unique economic dependencies between network security and token value. Q4: Has any central bank issued similar warnings before? Several central banks and international organizations have expressed concerns about cryptocurrency risks generally, but the Bank of Italy’s paper provides unusually detailed technical analysis of specific blockchain mechanics and their stability implications. Q5: What regulatory measures might address these concerns? Potential measures include treating certain blockchain networks as critical financial infrastructure, implementing specific stablecoin regulations, requiring transparency about institutional cryptocurrency exposures, and conducting regular stress tests of cryptocurrency market shocks.

Analysts Weigh In,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-new-crypto-at-0-04-turn-a-500-position-into-a-10x-play-by-2027-analysts-weigh-in/,"The crypto traders tend to pursue the new high-growth token before other people in the market become aware of it. That was the case with Bitcoin in 2013, Ethereum in 2017, and Solana in 2021. However, with capital cycling through the ecosystem once more, analysts are seeking to know whether a low-cost new crypto could generate another significant run in the new cycle. A stock that was trading at $0.04 has joined that discussion and is being assessed on merit and not speculation. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Constructing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a lending and borrowing protocol that is decentralized. The system is designed to facilitate credit markets with users lending and borrowing, posting collateral and yielding transparent rules being executed in an on-chain manner. Mutuum Finance has two lending markets instead of one: pooled markets and direct user markets. The two permit lending and borrowing, though with varying corresponding mechanisms and rate structures. Staged token sale has been used to give access to the MUTM token. It started selling in early 2025 and has gone to the point of selling at $0.01 and has gone as high as $0.04 with more buyers in the process. The amount of tokens distributed at each pricing stage is fixed and then the next tier goes on to the next level. The maximum supply limit is 4 billion MUTM, 45.5% of which should be put on sale. Over 825 million tokens have been sold and holders have reached over 18,800. The amount of funding has already gone up to $19.7 million and is steadily increasing with further allocation. This system has enabled its initial users to establish cost basis levels prior to initial public listing and prior to first functional use. This, according to analysts, is contrary to most launches in which the tokens hit exchanges even before any product is prepared. V1 Launch & Security Stack The development of Mutuum Finance is the first release that has supported token interest. Under the official X-side of the project, the V1 lending protocol will be launched initially in Ethereum Sepolia testnet and only ready to go to the mainnet. This version will switch on live collateral rules, borrowing logic and liquidation processes. The preparation of security has been an outward looking agenda. Mutuum Finance had been audited by Halborn Security and rated 90/100 on the CertiK Token Scan, and offered a $50,000 bug bounty to publicize any vulnerabilities prior to launch. In the case of lending platforms, the steps are important since collateral, liquidation, and oracle pricing are implemented in the form of code, as opposed to the manual systems. Though these factors exist, certain analysts have already given some forecasts of the initial pricing in the market. In a conservative case, they project that MUTM would have a trade of between 0.18$-0.24$ in 2026 in case V1 protocol experiences first borrowing demand. That would indicate a 4.5x to 6x movement on product usage and not hype compared to the current position at $0.04. Growth Catalysts Yield mechanics and token flow are also triggered by the launch of V1. MtTokens are used to represent deposit positions in Mutuum Finance. These tokens get interest which is charged to the borrowers and are modified according to the use of the pool. The protocol allows borrowers to obtain liquidity with a collateral, employing rate variations and risk logic. This develops a real credit market cycle as opposed to a passive token plot. The second stimulus is the buy-and-distribute model. In this system, MUTM is bought on the open market with a fraction of protocol fees and redistributed to users who get invested in the safety module with the stake of mtTokens. Analysts classify this as structural buying pressure and could assist in backing the valuation when the demand to borrow begins to rise.. Lending infrastructure analysts believe that the two characteristics are essential to long-term growth, not early price discovery. Their 2027 long term models put MUTM within a bullish $0.40 to $0.48 band. These characteristics have served to maintain the presence as Phase 7 progresses to its completion.

South Korea Sets Crypto Corporate Investing Limit At 5% South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has drafted guidelines to allow listed companies and professional investors to trade crypto, according to a report from South Korean media outlet BusinessKorea. The FSC shared the draft with a public-private task force on January 6th, and according to a high-ranking financial industry official, authorities are expected to release the final guidelines between January and February. Since 2017, corporate and institutional players in South Korea have been under an effective prohibition from trading and investing in digital assets like Bitcoin, with the government citing speculation and money-laundering risks. The country’s stance began to shift in February 2025, when the FSC announced a plan to gradually allow institutional participation in the space. The latest guidelines are a follow-up to this announcement. South Korea easing up on corporate crypto investments hasn’t come without restrictions, however. Authorities have reportedly set an investment cap of 5% of equity capital, which companies can only deploy into coins inside the top 20 by market cap list. These assets will be determined based on the semi-annual market cap data sourced from the top five domestic digital asset exchanges. Stablecoins tied to the US Dollar, like USDT and USDC, currently fall inside the top 20 list, but whether they will be included as permitted investment targets is still being discussed. While South Korea is planning on a 5% investment cap, other countries like the US or Japan have no such limits on corporate investing. One financial industry insider has raised concerns about the restriction, saying that “investment limit restrictions not found overseas could weaken capital inflow factors and prevent the emergence of virtual currency investment specialist companies.” South Korea has also made other developments related to the crypto industry recently. The East Asian nation is planning to introduce digital asset spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year, looking to investment vehicles active in the US and Hong Kong as reference points. The FSC is also working on the next phase of its digital asset legislation, which could see the establishment of a regulatory framework for stablecoins. As reported by Bitcoinist, the bill has so far been delayed due to a dispute between the FSC and the Bank of Korea (BoK). The BoK, South Korea’s central bank, has been pushing for banks to own at least a 51% stake in any stablecoin issuer seeking approval in the country. While the FSC agrees that financial institutions should be involved in the issuance of won stablecoins, the regulator has raised concerns that a bank majority requirement could limit market participation and innovation.

Solana Network Growth Has Been Declining According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, SOL’s recent price recovery has come despite a drop in the Network Growth. This metric measures the weekly total number of addresses that are coming online on the blockchain for the first time. A wallet comes “online” on the network when it participates in some kind of transfer activity. Thus, the wallets that the Network Growth is counting are the ones that are making their first transaction on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop To $69,000 If Pennant Support Breaks, Analyst Warns When the value of the Network Growth is high, it means that a large number of addresses are being created on the blockchain. Such a trend can be a sign that an influx of users is occurring. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests that there isn’t much new address generation taking place on the network, which can be a potential indication that the chain isn’t attracting fresh investors. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Solana Network Growth over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Network Growth has witnessed a drawdown recently, despite the fact that the SOL price has made some recovery since its December low. This suggests that the bullish price action has been unable to bring fresh attention to the cryptocurrency. Historically, rallies have generally needed the incoming of new investors to be sustainable, as it’s the increased trading activity that provides them with the fuel to go on. In the chart, Santiment has highlighted the case of a rally where this requirement wasn’t met. The Network Growth was initially at a significant level, but as this price surge from 2025 played out, the metric’s value plummeted. This could be a potential factor behind the rally eventually running out of momentum. In late 2024, the opposite conditions were present, as the Network Growth shot up alongside the Solana bull run, implying adoption backed the price appreciation. Considering these past cases, it’s possible that the indicator might have to reverse its trajectory if SOL’s recovery has to last. The latest downward move in the Network Growth is also not the only development SOL is dealing with right now. From the graph, it’s visible that the indicator has gone through a long-term downtrend since its high in November 2024.

SOL Price Solana recovered back to $144 on Sunday, but the coin has retraced to open the week as its price is back at $139.

Xu stressed that transferring account control is against platform rules and stringent KYC and AML responsibilities. In a Sunday X post, the user, who goes by Captain Bunny on social media, stated that OKX froze approximately $40,000 worth of Global Dollar (USDG) stablecoins after activating risk controls connected to four accounts. According to the user, the money was required to pay for his father’s medical bills. The user admitted that the accounts were purchased in late 2023 and were initially validated under the names of other individuals, a tactic frequently employed to circumvent limitations on users in mainland China. The user claimed that OKX’s security mechanisms eventually required facial recognition to access the accounts. Unfortunately, the user was unable to complete the verification process because the accounts were validated under separate identities. Star says account buying breaches KYC, triggers asset freezes After the complaint, Star Xu defended the exchange’s account freezing practices in an X response on Monday. Xu said that if the exchange disregarded account registration identity information, it would be a serious breach of OKX’s obligation to safeguard user assets. He went on to say that platform responsibility would be compromised if account control was transferred to someone else based just on emotional appeals or personal claims on social media. “ Imagine this scenario : If you purchase someone else’s account, and the original account holder subsequently provides valid and complete identity information such as proof of identity, clearly claims ownership of the account, and requests the platform to reset account login and withdrawal permissions.” Star wrote on X in response to the user. Star went on by phrasing a question. In this situation, should OKX put its trust in the person who can demonstrate the identity of the account or in the person who can’t provide any identity information and only makes personal claims? OKX CEO explained that OKX mandates all users to utilize the platform with real-name verification to protect the asset security of platform users and comply with legal regulatory requirements, such as anti-money laundering and anti-fraud measures. He cautioned that buying and selling accounts is a clear violation of the OKX platform service agreement. Star further announced that the platform will activate facial recognition and other identity verification methods in various risk circumstances to stop such infractions and abusive behavior. In compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the platform will implement risk control measures, such as account freezing, when anomalous usage or suspicious account buying and selling conduct is identified. OKX outlines strict conditions for asset clearance and account closure Star said that even though purchasing verified accounts is illegal, the platform might nevertheless assist in clearing the user’s assets if he meets three requirements. First, the sellers of the Know Your Customer (KYC)-passed accounts are required to “explicitly disclaim” possession of the money. Second, there must be no law enforcement inquiries or court freezes on the accounts. Finally, the accounts must offer “verifiable” evidence of funding sources that satisfy legal standards. The platform will only be able to assist with asset clearance and account closure in compliance with the law and regulations if all three requirements are met simultaneously. He confirmed that asset clearing and account closure won’t be allowed until the platform has finished a careful and comprehensive review. Crypto exchanges established KYC to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) rules. This ensured legal operation and user safety. In this case, new users must submit personal information, documentation, and a selfie to begin trading on the majority of exchanges. “Upon verification, the platform service is only for the account’s real-name verified individual. You previously stated that the account’s real-name information belongs to someone else,” OKX said on Sunday in a response to the investor. According to OKX’s help desk, OKX’s cryptocurrency services are only available to those who have completed KYC using their real identities. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Most crypto losses do not occur because of blockchain failures, but because attackers exploit weak personal security practices. Recent events within the XRP ecosystem have reinforced an important reality: self-custody demands constant vigilance, and even experienced users remain exposed if basic safeguards slip. In a post on X, crypto security commentator Xaif drew attention to a serious XRP wallet compromise that highlights this risk. According to the information he shared, a single user lost nearly 70,000 XRP in one unauthorized transaction that was later confirmed directly on the XRP Ledger. The incident immediately raised concern, not because of a network flaw, but because it demonstrated how quickly funds can disappear when wallet security fails. On-Chain Confirmation Points to Wallet Failure Blockchain data confirms that the transaction processed normally on the XRP Ledger, with almost zero network fee and no sign of abnormal behavior. The XRPL executed the transfer exactly as instructed, which confirms that the network itself remained secure. The failure occurred at the wallet level, where attackers gained access to the user’s credentials. SECURITY ALERT – XRP WALLET HACKED A user just lost 69,999 XRP (~$146K) in a single unauthorized transaction. Confirmed on XRPL with almost zero network fee this is NOT a network issue, it’s a wallet security failure. THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE if basic precautions are… pic.twitter.com/56XDNYfLAO — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) January 11, 2026 This distinction matters for XRP holders. When unauthorized transfers happen, compromised private keys or exposed recovery phrases almost always sit at the root of the issue. Blockchains do not differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate intent. They simply execute valid signed transactions. Why XRP Users Remain a Target As XRP grows in visibility and market relevance, attackers increasingly target individual wallets rather than infrastructure. Social engineering remains the most effective method. Scammers impersonate support agents, promote fake airdrops, or clone legitimate-looking XRP and Ripple websites to deceive users into revealing sensitive information. Once a user clicks a malicious link or connects a wallet to an untrusted application, attackers can drain funds instantly. Because blockchain transactions are irreversible, victims rarely recover lost assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Essential Security Practices Cannot Be Ignored Xaif emphasized that incidents like this remain preventable when users follow fundamental security rules. Hardware wallets provide strong protection for large balances because they keep private keys offline. Users should never share seed phrases or private keys, regardless of who makes the request. Verifying website URLs, avoiding random decentralized applications, and ignoring unsolicited messages reduce exposure to scams. Keeping devices and wallet software updated also helps protect against known vulnerabilities. In crypto, urgency often signals manipulation rather than opportunity. A Critical Reminder for Self-Custody Users This incident does not expose a weakness in XRP or the XRP Ledger. Instead, it highlights the responsibility that comes with controlling one’s own assets. Decentralized systems remove intermediaries, but they place full accountability on users. As XRP adoption expands, personal security will remain just as important as market performance. Xaif’s warning serves as a timely reminder that protecting digital assets requires discipline, awareness, and consistent security habits.

This significant move has previously led to notable price changes in the cryptocurrency. The article explores the history of such events and highlights which coins might be primed for substantial growth. Curious investors would surely want to delve deeper. Solana Eyes Potential Growth Amid Steady Climb Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently swinging between about $134 and $144. The coin has room to rise, with resistance just under $150 and $160. A push past these could signal more upside. Solana's price has nudged up around four percent this week and just over five percent in the past month, showing some positive momentum. However, it's still down about 15 percent over six months. If Solana breaks through $149, it could see stronger growth, while $160 could mark a significant upward shift. For now, the current range holds the spotlight, with level $128 providing a safety net. Keep an eye out, as a breakout could lead to notable gains. Conclusion SOL's open interest reaching $8 billion often signals significant price movement. Historical patterns suggest this might lead to either a sharp rise or fall. Investors and traders will closely monitor any changes, as the market has shown strong reactions in the past. This scenario places SOL under intense scrutiny, with many anticipating a notable price shift soon. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This article delves into promising, yet often overlooked projects that show potential to maintain relevance and growth. Discover which emerging coins may be positioned for future success and could be valuable additions to a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio. Cosmos (ATOM) Shows Signs of Potential Recovery Source: tradingview Cosmos (ATOM) is currently trading in a range between $2.33 and $2.74. The coin has been on a recovery path recently, showing a price increase of about 19% over the past month. However, it has still dropped about 45% over the last six months. The nearest resistance level is at $2.92, and if ATOM manages to break it, the next target could be $3.33, potentially offering a growth of over 20% from current levels. The coin's 10-day simple moving average is slightly higher than its 100-day average, hinting at a short-term positive trend. With an RSI index around 45, ATOM seems poised for further upward movement. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Crypto Shows Positive Signs Despite Challenges Source: tradingview The price of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is on the move, currently ranging between nearly $0.27 and $0.32. Over the past month, the coin has climbed over 20%, showing a notable recovery. However, it's still down almost 62% over the last six months. The coin faces resistance at about $0.34, which is a potential upside target. If it breaks this, it could aim for the next resistance around $0.39. This presents a chance for a nearly 22% rise from the current top range. Support levels include $0.24, providing a buffer. The market indicators hint at stable movement with room for short-term boosts. VeChain Faces Challenges But Holds Potential for Rebound Source: tradingview VeChain (VET) has seen a rough patch with a drop of over half its value in six months. Recently, it trades between one and one-fourth cents. The nearest hurdle for a rise is at a bit over one and a half cents. If VeChain clears this, it might aim for a rise of about 65%. However, it's currently under its 100-day moving trend. With a strength score under 50, it’s not yet in strong demand. While recent trends show a downward move, VeChain has the space for a significant bounce back if market conditions improve. Conclusion ATOM, FET and VET are promising projects for long-term crypto portfolios. ATOM focuses on interoperability, making it easier for different blockchains to work together. FET is advancing AI and machine learning technologies, providing innovative solutions. VET is using blockchain to streamline supply chain management, increasing transparency and efficiency. Each of these projects has unique strengths that could ensure their relevance and growth over time. Including them in a long-term crypto strategy could provide stability and potential gains as these projects continue to develop and solve real-world problems.

Data shows that daily address creation fell from 3,169 on January 1 to just 1,100 by January 12, representing a decline of 65.28% in less than two weeks, according to insights from XRP Scan . XRP new addresses created in 2026. Source: XRP Scan Notably, the decrease in XRP accounts appears to be a continuation of the decline seen in 2025. In this context, the Finbold 2025 Cryptocurrency Market Report shows that the token recorded a net decrease of 19,588 addresses in 2025. Overall, XRP ended the year with 7,913,554 addresses. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Implication of XRP decreasing addresses This contraction signals slowing onboarding on the XRP Ledger, a key indicator of organic demand and retail participation. Fewer new addresses point to weaker transaction activity, reduced speculative interest, and limited inflows of fresh capital. The decline follows a brief early-January uptick that peaked around January 5–6 before reversing. Notably, network growth is closely tracked by traders because rising address creation typically supports prices by expanding the user base and transaction demand. A sharp drop, by contrast, often leads to softer price action as buying pressure fades and liquidity tightens, increasing the risk of near-term consolidation or downside unless activity recovers. The trend also mirrors broader market caution, with investors turning more selective at the start of 2026. Absent a rebound in on-chain growth, XRP’s price is likely to remain driven by wider market conditions rather than strong internal network momentum. Indeed, this comes as the token has largely struggled to maintain the $2 support zone. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.06, down more than 2% over the past 24 hours, while the weekly chart shows a decline of over 4%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, at the current price, XRP is sitting almost exactly on its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) near $2.03, suggesting short-term price equilibrium and a lack of clear directional momentum. However, the token remains well below the 200-day SMA at $2.56, indicating the broader trend remains bearish, with longer-term resistance overhead. Meanwhile, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) at 52.7 remains firmly neutral, signaling neither overbought nor oversold conditions.

Over the weekend, Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Finance Minister Ekniti Nitithanprapas met in a high-level meeting of the “Connect the Dots” sub-committee. Together, they laid out a plan to integrate national financial data and fix structural leaks that criminal groups are using to launder money. The strategy entails the creation of a national Data Bureau. This will allow authorities to track suspicious transactions in real-time and develop comprehensive “risk profiles” for several financial activities. Revenue Department considers a new “Specific Business Tax” The Prime Minister’s order is aimed directly at the gold trade. The Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) has been advised to lower the amount of gold bar purchases that must be reported. Previously, only transactions exceeding 2 million baht had to be reported. However, the new directive will create a new limit that will be significantly lower to prevent “smurfing”, the practice of splitting large sums into smaller amounts to evade detection. The SEC also ordered strict enforcement of the “Travel Rule.” This international standard requires all crypto asset providers to identify both the originators and beneficiaries of wallet-to-wallet transfers. PM Anutin stated, “Today, we are not only addressing modern digital threats but also ‘analogue’ financial crimes, Traditional criminal methods are constantly evolving to find new life. We must work as a single, integrated force to protect the public interest and the integrity of our financial system.” Thailand weighs limits on gold speculation to protect the Baht This operation is also a step-up effort to limit speculative gold trading because huge volumes of gold deals have helped push the Thai baht to unusually strong levels. Authorities aim to limit the amount of gold individuals can trade and tighten reporting requirements to prevent excessive gold-related currency flows from distorting the exchange rate and harming exports and tourism. The baht is hovering around its highest level since 2021. The Bank of Thailand governor Vitai Ratanakorn stated that they will integrate a cap on the amount of foreign currencies individuals can transact with money changers at 800,000 baht a day. “The baht’s recent abnormal strength is partly driven by gold transactions conducted in the local currency, particularly trading via Thai-baht-based applications,” Vitai said. To ease the pressure on the baht, leading Thai bullion dealers, who account for about 90% of the market, have proposed to upgrade their online trading platforms to facilitate buying and selling in dollars within the next three to six months. Last year, the baht gained 8%, making it the second-best performer in Asia. This was a result of the dollar’s weakness, and gold’s 65% rally to a series of record highs helped hide weak domestic economic factors. Gold prices vs Thai Baht. Source: Bloomberg Daily gold trading volumes in Thailand have at times exceeded those on the local stock exchange, prompting traders to transact unusually large amounts of US dollars. According to the central bank, at peak periods, gold-related deals accounted for 50%–60% of Thailand’s total dollar trading. According to Kritcharat Hirunyasiri, chairman of MTS Gold Group, total gold trading was estimated at around 10 trillion baht last year, doubling from 2024. Thailand remained a net gold importer last year, importing 180 tons while exporting 110 tons, according to the Thai Gold Traders Association.

In fact, crypto views on the video-sharing platform have dropped to their lowest point since January 2021, according to data first cited by analyst Benjamin Cowen. Based on Cowen’s 30-day moving average for different cryptocurrency YouTube channel views, the dramatic decline accelerated in October last year. Eventually, it spread to other platforms as well, suggesting waning retail interest and participation in a prolonged bear market . YouTube crypto views. Source: Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) Crypto engagement on social media hits record lows Indeed, a similar decline in engagement affected X , too. For example, CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju criticized the social media platform for limiting content pertaining to digital assets, paying special attention to bots that inevitably plague the internet. “With the development of AI, bots have become inevitable.… But it’s absurd that X is more willing to block crypto topics than improve its bot detection systems,” Ju added . This is why ""crypto"" posts are getting banned by the X algorithm. Bots generated 7,754,367 posts yesterday, up 1,224%. pic.twitter.com/xhnlhE1V8D — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) January 10, 2026 The cooling number of interactions everywhere online suggests the numbers are not the result of a mere algorithm change but a more general loss of interest in altcoins. “So it’s not just X and an algorithm change. Viewership to crypto has been dropping across platforms,” Cowen wrote on X. To put things into perspective, Ju’s chart suggests around 7.7 million posts were created in just one day. The number apparently exceeds the usual levels by 1200%, and this proliferation of low-quality content has caused the algorithm to limit visibility for genuine crypto accounts as well. Having observed the new data, traders are left pondering whether the dwindling view counts imply that institutional players and not retail investors have been the primary driving force in the current cycle.

The move has improved the technical structure and placed higher resistance levels within reach. SOL Breaks Above Key Trend Levels SOL has pushed above its 30-day simple moving average at $132.82 and reclaimed the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level near $136.97. These levels had previously capped upside attempts, making the breakout technically significant. The shift is supported by momentum indicators. The MACD histogram has turned positive at +1.39, signaling strengthening bullish momentum and increased buying participation. Momentum Remains Constructive The 14-day Relative Strength Index currently stands at 60.36. This places SOL in bullish territory without indicating overbought conditions, suggesting there is room for further upside if buying pressure persists. Short-term traders are now using the $137 area as a support level, entering on pullbacks and reinforcing the breakout zone. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Resistance Levels and Upside Targets The next resistance to watch lies at $143.04, corresponding with the January 11 high. A clean break above this level would confirm continuation and likely attract additional momentum-driven buying. If $143.04 is cleared, the technical setup opens the path toward the $150 level, which acts as the next major upside target and a psychological milestone. Solana Price Outlook Solana’s break above the 30-day SMA and key Fibonacci level has improved its near-term outlook. With momentum indicators supportive and traders defending the $137 zone, attention turns to $143.04. A successful breakout there would strengthen the bullish case and bring $150 into focus, while failure could result in short-term consolidation above newly reclaimed support.

57101597,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260790,1768232411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Core Maintainer: Critical New Guardian Joins Elite Team for First Time in Two Years,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-core-new-code-maintainer/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Core Maintainer: Critical New Guardian Joins Elite Team for First Time in Two Years In a significant move for the world’s leading cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin Core development team has appointed a new code maintainer for the first time since May 2023. This pivotal addition, reported by crypto outlet Protos, introduces a developer known only by the pseudonym TheCharlatan to the elite group responsible for the Bitcoin protocol’s integrity. Consequently, the team now comprises six members who hold the ultimate authority for merging code into the Bitcoin system, a role fundamental to the network’s security and evolution. Bitcoin Core Maintainer Role: A Gatekeeper of Digital Gold Understanding the gravity of this appointment requires a deep dive into the Bitcoin Core maintainer’s function. Essentially, these individuals act as the final arbiters for the Bitcoin codebase. They review, test, and ultimately decide which proposed code changes from the global developer community get implemented into the official Bitcoin Core software. Therefore, their technical judgment directly impacts the security, stability, and functionality of the entire Bitcoin network, which secures over a trillion dollars in value. Maintainers operate under a strict set of principles: Consensus-Driven: They rarely act unilaterally, instead seeking broad agreement among peers. Security-First: Every change undergoes rigorous scrutiny to prevent vulnerabilities. Backwards Compatibility: Updates must not disrupt the existing network. Historically, this role has been held by renowned figures like Wladimir van der Laan, who served as lead maintainer for nearly a decade. The appointment of TheCharlatan follows a period of stability, marking the first change to this cadre in nearly two years. This deliberate pace underscores the immense responsibility involved. The Enigmatic Newcomer: Who is TheCharlatan? The development community’s revelation of the new Bitcoin Core maintainer came with a characteristic layer of anonymity. The individual uses the pseudonym TheCharlatan, with no further personal or professional details disclosed publicly. This practice is not unusual within Bitcoin’s open-source ethos, where merit and proven contributions often outweigh public identity. However, pseudonymity does not imply obscurity within the developer circles. Typically, a candidate for maintainer status demonstrates years of consistent, high-quality contributions to the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository. They must exhibit deep technical expertise, a flawless understanding of Bitcoin’s consensus rules, and unwavering integrity. The community’s trust is earned through action, not credentials. While TheCharlatan’s public profile remains private, their acceptance by the existing five maintainers signals a strong, pre-established reputation for competence and reliability within the project. Expert Analysis on Maintainer Appointments Industry observers view this appointment as a healthy sign for Bitcoin’s decentralized governance. “The addition of a new maintainer is a routine but vital process for any long-lived open-source project,” explains a veteran blockchain engineer who prefers anonymity due to corporate policy. “It prevents centralization of knowledge and control, ensuring the protocol’s resilience. The two-year gap since the last appointment shows the high bar for entry, not stagnation.” Data from the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository supports this view. The project maintains a robust pipeline of over 100 active contributors, with a smaller subset making regular, significant commits. Elevating a contributor to maintainer status represents the culmination of a lengthy, organic vetting process. This process ensures the network’s stewards are those most deeply aligned with its principles and most capable of defending them. The Expanded Team: Dynamics and Distributed Responsibility With TheCharlatan’s inclusion, the Bitcoin Core maintainer team now officially numbers six. This expansion distributes the critical responsibility of code merging across a wider group, enhancing the system’s redundancy and security. A larger team mitigates the risk associated with individual availability and guards against potential coercion or single points of failure. Recent Bitcoin Core Maintainer Timeline Date Event Significance May 2023 Previous maintainer appointment Last change to the maintainer group before TheCharlatan. April 2025 Appointment of TheCharlatan First new maintainer added in nearly two years, team expands to six. Ongoing Multi-signature code approval Multiple maintainers typically must approve significant changes, ensuring checks and balances. Furthermore, the team operates using a multi-signature scheme for repository access. This means no single maintainer can unilaterally push major changes; cooperation is mandatory. This technical governance model enforces the cultural norm of consensus, making Bitcoin’s development path deliberately slow and conservative—a feature, not a bug, for a system prioritizing security over speed. Implications for Bitcoin’s Future Development The appointment carries tangible implications for Bitcoin’s technical roadmap. Firstly, it increases the project’s human capital and review bandwidth. More maintainers can process a higher volume of pull requests and peer reviews, potentially accelerating the pace of well-vetted, non-controversial improvements. These might include: Performance optimizations Enhanced wallet functionality Improved network efficiency Secondly, it reinforces the project’s decentralized nature against criticism of developer centralization. A six-member team, geographically and jurisdictionally dispersed, represents a more robust defense against external pressure than a smaller group. Finally, it ensures continuity. As long-term maintainers eventually reduce their activity, a pipeline of ready successors like TheCharlatan guarantees the protocol’s stewardship passes smoothly to the next generation of experts. Conclusion The appointment of TheCharlatan as a new Bitcoin Core maintainer is a deceptively routine yet profoundly important event in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores the health and maturity of Bitcoin’s open-source development model, where authority is earned through demonstrated expertise and granted to expand the network’s defensive depth. This first addition to the maintainer team since May 2023 strengthens the decentralized foundation of the world’s premier digital asset, ensuring its code remains in the hands of a capable, vigilant, and growing group of guardians. The Bitcoin Core maintainer role, therefore, remains one of the most critical and least visible positions in all of fintech. FAQs Q1: What does a Bitcoin Core maintainer actually do? A Bitcoin Core maintainer has the final authority to merge code changes into the official Bitcoin software. They review proposals, ensure they meet strict security and consensus standards, and manage the official GitHub repository. Q2: Why is the new maintainer using a pseudonym? Pseudonymity is common in open-source software, especially in cryptocurrency. It allows developers to be judged solely on their code contributions and technical merit, while also providing a layer of personal privacy and security. Q3: How does this appointment affect Bitcoin’s price or security? The appointment has no direct, short-term effect on Bitcoin’s market price. However, it positively impacts long-term network security by decentralizing control over the codebase and ensuring a healthy succession plan for key technical roles. Q4: Who were the maintainers before this change? The Bitcoin Core project has had several maintainers over its history. Prior to TheCharlatan’s appointment, the team consisted of five other developers, whose identities are a mix of known and pseudonymous contributors, following the same merit-based selection process. Q5: Can a maintainer unilaterally change Bitcoin’s rules? No. Maintainers cannot change Bitcoin’s core consensus rules (like the 21 million coin supply) on their own. Their role is to integrate code that the broader community of users and miners must voluntarily adopt. Significant changes require overwhelming network consensus.

A malware botnet named GoBruteforcer is capable of compromising Linux servers and turning them into automated password-cracking nodes, said the cybersecurity company. The hacking program has affected infrastructure used by crypto projects, including database servers, file transfer services, and web administration panels. GoBrut can scan the internet for poorly secured services and attempt to log into services using popular usernames and weak passwords. Once a system is compromised, it is then added to a distributed network that can be remotely accessed by a network of hackers. GoBruteforcer botnet can hack vaguely thought-out passwords According to Check Point’s report published last Wednesday, the botnet can walk past protections in services like FTP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and phpMyAdmin. These programs are used by blockchain startups and decentralized app developers to manage user data, application logic, and internal dashboards. Systems GoBrute has hacked can accept commands from a command-and-control server, dictating which service to attack while supplying credentials for brute-force attempts. The revealed login details are reused to access other systems, steal private data, create hidden accounts, and add to the botnet’s reach. Check Point also mentioned that infected hosts can also be repurposed to host malicious payloads, distribute malware to new victims, or become backup control servers if the core system is experiencing downtimes. Many development teams now, including those from big tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon, use code snippets and setup guides generated by large language models (LLMs) or copied from online forums. Check Point explained that since AI models cannot create new passwords and usually mimic what they have been taught, they make usernames and default passwords very predictable , not changing them fast enough before systems are exposed to the internet. The problem becomes even more dire when legacy web stacks like XAMPP are used, which can expose administrative services by default and provide an easy entry point for hackers. GoBruteforcer campaigns began in 2023, Unit 42 research found GoBruteforcer was first documented in March 2023 by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, which detailed its ability to compromise Unix-like systems x86, x64, and ARM architectures. The malware deploys an Internet Relay Chat bot and web shell, which attackers use to keep their remote access. In September 2025, researchers at Lumen Technologies’ Black Lotus Labs found that a portion of infected machines linked to another malware family, SystemBC, were also GoBruteforcer nodes. Check Point analysts compared the password lists used in attacks against a database of roughly 10 million leaked credentials and found an overlap of about 2.44%. Based on that overlap, they estimated that tens of thousands of database servers could accept one of the passwords used by the botnet. Google’s 2024 Cloud Threat Horizons report found that weak or missing credentials were responsible for 47.2% of initial access vectors in breached cloud environments. Blockchain and AI reconnaissance expose private data, research finds In instances where GoBrute was traced in cryptocurrency environments, network hackers used crypto-themed usernames and password variants that matched naming conventions from blockchain projects. Other campaigns targeted phpMyAdmin panels linked to WordPress sites, a service for project websites and dashboards. “Some tasks are clearly sector-focused. For example, we observed an attack that used crypto-themed usernames such as cryptouser, appcrypto, crypto_app, and crypto. In these runs, the passwords used combined the standard weak list with crypto-specific guesses such as cryptouser1 or crypto_user1234,” Check Point said, mentioning examples of passwords. Check Point identified a compromised server being used to host a module that scanned TRON blockchain addresses and queried balances through a public blockchain API to identify wallets holding funds. “The combination of exposed infrastructure, weak credentials, and increasingly automated tools. While the botnet itself is technically straightforward, its operators benefit from the number of misconfigured services online,” the security company wrote.

The study, based on data from the internal intelligence system Outset Data Pulse , highlights structural shifts in how crypto audiences discover content, particularly through AI-powered interfaces. While overall traffic growth remains modest, the report points to deeper changes in discovery, compliance-driven trust, and competitive positioning within the European crypto media landscape. Traffic Growth Masks In-Quarter Volatility as Regulation Reshapes Audience Preferences On a quarterly basis, total crypto media traffic across Europe grew by approximately 4%. However, this aggregate figure conceals significant instability within the quarter itself. Across Q3 2025, the total number of visits declined by roughly 13%, indicating sharp fluctuations in audience attention. This volatility suggests that growth is increasingly uneven and sensitive to external factors, rather than driven by steady organic expansion. The image is sourced from Outset PR Blog The regulatory frameworks might have formed the broader backdrop of these shifts. The MiCA framework that saw active implementation in Q3 could have accelerated user preference for compliant, structured, and transparent media sources. At the same time, DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) reinforced expectations around institutional-grade standards, reliability, and operational maturity. Given the impact of these frameworks, the audience appeared to favor outlets able to demonstrate consistency, credibility, and regulatory alignment — particularly in Western Europe. Traffic Leaders and Regional Differences Beyond rough numbers on traffic dynamics, the report by Outset PR reflected that five countries led European crypto media traffic in Q3 2025. These were: France The Netherlands Germany Russia Poland The image is sourced from Outset PR Blog Interestingly, the drivers behind growth differed by region. In Western Europe, scale and search visibility played a central role. Larger publishers benefited from strong SEO performance and broader discovery funnels. In Eastern Europe, traffic patterns were more loyalty-driven. Crypto-native audiences relied heavily on familiar brands and direct access rather than exploratory discovery. Discovery Remains Concentrated for Crypto-Native Media For crypto-native publishers specifically, traffic sources remain highly concentrated: Organic search: ~46% of total visits Direct traffic: ~42% of total visits This split reflects a stable core audience with strong brand loyalty, but also limited diversification in discovery channels. GenAI Discovery Casts Structural Impact GenAI-powered discovery remains a secondary traffic source for European crypto media — but its influence is no longer negligible. Key findings from Q3 2025: 82 out of 200 crypto-native outlets (41%) recorded measurable traffic from AI-driven interfaces Estimated 510.85K GenAI-driven visits across the quarter GenAI traffic accounted for 0.76% of total crypto-native traffic Critically, GenAI made up 13.07% of total referral traffic The image is sourced from Outset PR Blog While absolute volumes remain limited, GenAI has become a meaningful component of the referral layer. Its role is not about scale yet, but about redistribution. Mid-Tier Publishers Gain Ground Through Structure Top-tier crypto media outlets continue to dominate total reach through brand recognition and loyal readership. However, the report highlights a clear pattern among mid-tier publishers. These outlets increasingly compete through strict format discipline, evergreen content, and early exposure to AI-driven discovery surfaces. Rather than chasing volume, these publishers optimize for durability and machine-readability — attributes that appear to align well with emerging AI referral mechanisms. What the Data Signals The Outset PR report points to a gradual reconfiguration in Europe’s crypto media traffic: Regulation is reshaping trust and visibility Discovery remains narrow, but AI-driven referrals are quietly embedding themselves into the ecosystem Competitive advantage is shifting toward structural consistency rather than short-term reach For crypto media outlets operating in Europe, the next phase appears less about chasing traffic spikes and more about building formats, compliance alignment, and content architecture that remain discoverable across both human and machine-led interfaces.

The headlines revived questions about central bank independence and added tension to an already sensitive policy backdrop, with investors weighing how political pressure could shape rate decisions and communication. The reports centered on Powell’s prior Senate testimony and a Federal Reserve building renovation project. As the story spread, it added a new layer of uncertainty for investors already watching inflation trends, labor data, and the timing of the Fed’s next moves. Officials offered limited public detail early in the day. Still, the episode quickly became a dominant market narrative because it touched the credibility of the Fed and the stability of monetary policymaking. Subpoenas Tied to Senate Testimony and Renovation Project Media reports said DOJ investigators served grand jury subpoenas tied to Powell’s June testimony to the Senate. The questions reportedly related to statements about a renovation of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters and surrounding project details. The development drew attention because it introduced legal risk around a sitting Fed chair. It also raised concerns that legal scrutiny could become a channel for political influence over the central bank. Powell, according to separate reporting, described the inquiry as politically motivated and framed it as pressure aimed at the Fed. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve did not expand on the matter publicly, and initial official responses remained narrow. Political Pressure Becomes a Central Market Theme The episode landed amid an intensifying political fight over interest rates, inflation, and the cost of living. As a result, investors treated the Powell reports as a test of whether the Fed can operate without interference. Analysts and market participants also focused on precedent. A criminal inquiry tied to testimony could affect how future Fed leaders communicate with Congress and how markets interpret official guidance. For now, the practical impact remains unclear because the scope of the subpoenas and the timeline for the inquiry have not been fully detailed publicly. However, the headlines already reintroduced a core question for markets: whether monetary policy can stay insulated from partisan conflict as the next policy decisions approach.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 15:50:05

Now, traders are watching its behavior around a key support level that once triggered a major rally. XRP Returns to 21-Month EMA Support In 2017, XRP broke out from a multi-year triangle, held above the 21-month EMA, and then climbed sharply in early 2018. Analyst JD pointed out that the token is now showing a near-identical pattern. It has broken out from a large triangle and is currently bouncing off the same 21-month EMA. The setup has raised expectations that XRP might follow the same path as before. Currently, the price movement suggests that the asset could be setting up for another strong move if the pattern holds. JD explained, “In 2017, we broke out from triangle, consolidated for over a year, retested 21M EMA… then parabolic in Jan 2018.” Strong Rally Fades at Resistance XRP recently jumped from below $1.90 to $2.41 within a week, driven by increased ETF inflows and reduced token supply on exchanges. However, the rally lost momentum, and the asset has since retraced to $2.07 at press time. The 24-hour volume stands at over $2.88 billion, with the price slipping slightly in the last 24 hours and almost 3% over the past week. Analyst ChartNerd noted , “ $XRP has a job on its hands, ” referring to strong resistance levels ahead. Both the Weekly 20 EMA and the mid-line of the Gaussian channel are sitting near $2.26. These indicators are now acting as resistance. “Fail to push up/break them, then we resort back to multi-month support,” they added. Meanwhile, XRP is also reacting to former triangle support, now testing it as resistance. Another analyst, Javon Marks, shared that XRP’s current structure matches its 2017 breakout. Back then, the token exceeded its measured move target. “ XRP can be in route to its measured move target above $16.5, ” he said, which would represent a 663% move from current levels. $XRP , in its 2017 breakout structure, not only surged to its measured move target but also well above.

This view is based on structure alone, without considering outside market forces. The path ahead depends on how XRP handles resistance and whether volume continues to support upward pressure. Market Conditions Remain Mixed CryptoWZRD noted that XRP’s daily candle closed indecisively. “ A move above the $2.1000 resistance is a bullish territory, ” the analyst said , adding that Bitcoin’s next move may guide the market direction. There are also signs of caution. Ali Martinez pointed out a possible gravestone doji forming, which can signal weakness. At the same time, whale activity has slowed. A report from CryptoPotato said large XRP transfers jumped during the price surge but have since dropped off. This may suggest less participation from major holders.

DOGE’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex ) The early part of the week saw minor volatility with brief upward spikes, but selling pressure dominated from January 8 onwards. By the end of the period, the price stabilized at lower levels, indicating sustained bearish sentiment. Dogecoin Price Eyes Uptrend After Breaking Above 50-Day Moving Average The 1-day chart shows Dogecoin trading within a descending channel, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, signaling a prolonged downtrend. Recently, the price has moved above the 50-day moving average (MA 50), which often acts as a dynamic resistance in downtrends. This breakout above the MA 50 suggests a potential reversal in momentum, indicating that sellers are losing control and buyers may be stepping in. The support zone around $0.12–$0.13 has held firm, reinforcing the base for a possible upward move. Source: X Analyst Carter highlights several upside targets as Dogecoin attempts to climb toward the resistance zone. Key levels to watch include $0.153, $0.182, $0.206, $0.240, and $0.280, which coincide with historical resistance points and areas of high trading volume. If the breakout sustains, these targets represent potential profit-taking points for traders. The chart also suggests a sell opportunity near $0.28, marking a strategic exit as Dogecoin approaches the upper boundary of the resistance zone. Dogecoin Shows Early Signs of Trend Reversal Meanwhile, Cantonese Cat, an analyst on X, suggests that the Dogecoin daily chart shows a clear shift in trend. For months, the price was consistently hugging the lower half of the Bollinger Bands, signaling persistent bearish pressure and weak buying interest. The moving average acted as resistance during this downtrend, and price action remained mostly below it, confirming the dominance of sellers. This prolonged period of low momentum suggested the market was oversold but lacked the catalyst for a sustained reversal. Source: X Recently, however, Dogecoin has broken this pattern, moving above the midline of the Bollinger Bands with increased upward momentum. This shift indicates a potential trend reversal, as the price now exhibits stronger bullish behavior and respect for support levels rather than consistently pressing lower. Traders may interpret this change as a sign that the downtrend has lost strength, and the market could be entering a consolidation or early-stage uptrend phase, signaling renewed interest from buyers.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 15:53:29
57101909,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260793,1768233311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Sharps Technology’s Strategic Leap: Partnering with Coinbase to Run a Solana Validator,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sharps-technology-coinbase-solana-validator/,"BitcoinWorld Sharps Technology’s Strategic Leap: Partnering with Coinbase to Run a Solana Validator In a significant institutional endorsement of blockchain infrastructure, Nasdaq-listed Sharps Technology announced a pivotal partnership with cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase to operate a Solana validator. This strategic move, reported by The Block on March 21, 2025, involves the company delegating a substantial portion of its 2 million SOL holdings to a validator node managed by Coinbase. Consequently, this collaboration marks a major step for traditional finance entities directly participating in decentralized network security. Sharps Technology and Coinbase Forge a Solana Validator Alliance The partnership between Sharps Technology and Coinbase represents a convergence of traditional finance and crypto-native infrastructure. Sharps Technology, a known strategic investor in Solana’s native token, SOL, is leveraging its substantial holdings to actively support the network. By choosing Coinbase as its validator operator, the company taps into proven institutional-grade security and compliance frameworks. This delegation model allows asset holders to contribute to network consensus without managing the complex technical operations themselves. Validator operations are fundamental to proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana. These nodes are responsible for processing transactions and creating new blocks. In return for this service and for staking their tokens as collateral, validators earn rewards. The involvement of a publicly-traded company like Sharps Technology provides several key benefits: Enhanced Network Security: Large, committed stakes make the network more expensive to attack. Institutional Credibility: Public company participation signals maturity to broader markets. Revenue Diversification: Staking provides a yield on digital asset holdings. Furthermore, this deal follows a growing trend of institutions moving from passive investment to active blockchain participation. It also reflects Coinbase’s expansion beyond exchange services into critical blockchain infrastructure, a sector often called “staking-as-a-service.” The Mechanics and Impact of Large-Scale SOL Delegation Delegation is a core feature of the Solana protocol. It allows SOL holders to assign their staking power to a validator of their choice without transferring custody. Sharps Technology’s plan to delegate part of its 2 million SOL is a considerable commitment. To contextualize this stake, we can examine its potential influence. Metric Detail Context Total SOL Staked (Approx.) ~400 Million SOL Network-wide staked supply Sharps Technology’s Holdings 2 Million SOL Reported company treasury Delegated Portion Undisclosed (Significant) Enough to impact validator ranking Potential Annual Yield ~5-7% APY Current Solana staking rewards A delegation of this size can immediately boost a validator’s ranking within Solana’s leader schedule. This schedule determines which validators produce blocks and when. Therefore, the Coinbase-operated validator receiving this delegation will likely see its influence and reward earnings increase significantly. This dynamic creates a symbiotic relationship: Coinbase provides enterprise-grade operation, while Sharps provides the economic weight. Expert Analysis on Institutional Validation Trends Industry analysts view this partnership as a logical evolution. “We are witnessing the professionalization of staking,” notes a blockchain infrastructure report from Galaxy Digital in Q4 2024. “Public companies and regulated entities are seeking partners that offer not just technical reliability, but also robust risk management, insurance, and regulatory compliance.” Coinbase, as a publicly-traded U.S. company, fits this profile precisely. The move also mitigates a common concern in proof-of-stake networks: stake concentration. While delegating to a large operator like Coinbase increases its share, it brings the stake under a highly visible and regulated entity. This contrasts with anonymous validators, whose actions are harder to audit. From a network health perspective, reputable institutional validators can enhance resilience against coordinated attacks or sudden exits. For Sharps Technology, the calculus extends beyond yield. Active participation in validation aligns the company’s fortunes directly with the security and success of the Solana network. It transforms their SOL from a speculative asset into a productive, income-generating tool that supports the ecosystem they have invested in. This is a profound shift from passive holding to active stewardship. Regulatory and Market Implications for 2025 This announcement arrives amid an evolving regulatory landscape for staking services in the United States. The SEC’s stance on whether staking constitutes a security offering remains a focal point. Coinbase’s involvement as the operator is particularly noteworthy because of its ongoing legal and regulatory engagements. The company likely conducts extensive due diligence to ensure its staking services comply with applicable laws. For the market, this partnership serves as a strong signal of institutional confidence. It demonstrates that sophisticated investors are engaging with blockchain networks at the operational level. This could encourage other public companies or institutional funds holding crypto assets to explore similar arrangements. The potential impacts are multifaceted: Capital Inflow: More institutional capital may flow into staking, reducing liquid supply. Validation Competition: Increased demand for high-quality validator services. Network Effects: A more secure and institutionally-backed network attracts more developers. Moreover, the partnership validates Solana’s positioning after its recovery from the 2022 network outages. It shows that major institutions are confident in its technical roadmap and long-term viability. This vote of confidence, especially from a Nasdaq-listed entity, can positively influence broader market perception. Conclusion The partnership between Sharps Technology and Coinbase to run a Solana validator is a landmark development in cryptocurrency’s institutional adoption. It moves beyond simple asset accumulation to active, responsible participation in network infrastructure. By delegating a significant portion of its 2 million SOL holdings, Sharps Technology is leveraging its investment to secure the Solana blockchain while generating yield. Simultaneously, Coinbase strengthens its position as a leading infrastructure provider beyond trading. This collaboration highlights the maturing synergy between traditional finance and decentralized protocols, setting a precedent for how public companies can interact with and support the blockchain ecosystems they believe in. The success of this Solana validator venture will likely be closely watched as a model for future institutional blockchain engagement. FAQs Q1: What is a Solana validator? A Solana validator is a computer server that runs software to participate in the network’s consensus mechanism. It processes transactions, creates new blocks, and helps secure the blockchain. Validators earn rewards for this service, funded by network inflation and transaction fees. Q2: What does ‘delegating SOL’ mean? Delegation allows SOL holders to assign their tokens to support a specific validator without transferring ownership. The holder retains custody of their SOL but grants the staking power (and associated voting rights) to the validator. The holder earns a portion of the validator’s rewards, minus a commission fee. Q3: Why would a public company like Sharps Technology run a validator? Running a validator, or delegating to one, allows the company to generate yield (staking rewards) on its digital asset holdings. It also demonstrates active support for the Solana network’s security and health, which can enhance the long-term value of its investment. It represents a shift from passive holding to active ecosystem participation. Q4: What role does Coinbase play in this partnership? Coinbase acts as the validator operator. It provides the technical infrastructure, 24/7 monitoring, security protocols, and compliance oversight required to run a high-performance, reliable validator node. Sharps Technology delegates its SOL to this Coinbase-operated node. Q5: How does this affect the Solana network? This large-scale delegation increases the amount of SOL staked with a reputable, institutional validator. This enhances network security by making it more costly to attack. It also signals strong institutional confidence, which can attract further development and investment to the Solana ecosystem.

The sale, which had been progressing smoothly, became entangled in confusion after late-stage contract adjustments and conflicting announcements. The situation was compounded by activity on a related Polymarket prediction market, where traders wagered on the total commitments of the ICO, resulting in a reported loss of approximately $73,000 for a single participant. ICO Confusion Hits Trove Markets After Extension Announcement Trove Markets initially announced on January 11 that the ICO had crossed $11.5 million in raised funds, showing strong interest well above the original $2.5 million target. The team confirmed that all participants would receive pro-rata refunds and $TROVE tokens ahead of the token generation event scheduled for January 20. In a follow-up post the same day, Trove Markets clarified that the ICO would be extended by five days to January 16, citing a desire to ensure fair distribution to real users and long-term community members. This announcement, however, quickly created confusion, with traders unsure whether the sale would end as initially planned or be extended. Within hours, the team issued a correction, stating that the extension was a mistake. The ICO would end as originally scheduled, and the raised amount of $11.5 million would stand. In their announcement, Trove acknowledged that the initial extension decision was influenced by feedback from early supporters and large allocators who wanted more participants onboarded. The team admitted this approach had inadvertently sidelined the broader community and disrupted the commitments already made, emphasizing that the focus would now shift to product delivery and mainnet launch. Timing of Polymarket Trades Fuels Dispute Over Trove Sale Extension Around the same time, unusually large buy orders appeared in the Polymarket event “Trove public sale total commitments?” which allowed traders to bet on the total amount raised. Reports and screenshots shared on social media indicated that orders ranging from 100,000 to 300,000 shares were placed near the bottom of the order book, with some alleging these came from wallets linked to Trove Markets.

In response, a pseudonymous team member, “Unwise,” explained that the extension decision had been made under pressure with around 25 minutes remaining in the ICO.

One of the most observed assets in the previous cycles was Cardano (ADA). It was unique due to its research-based and technological approach. Nonetheless, price action may change the focus where the critical levels cannot be broken and the market is turning into another stage. Smaller new tokens relating to product milestones may be of interest in such times to traders who may be interested in possible gains associated with usage and not narrative itself. A low-cost crypto is one of the names that have slipped into this discussion and has demonstrated a significant price movement before its initial product release. With Cardano tests validating levels and market members scanning fresh catalysts, the new token has now been initiated into more conversations among traders with short-term price move consideration and long-term usage patterns. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is a popular smart contract platform that has a robust community and roadmap of active development. ADA is trading at less than $0.50, which has been repeatedly opposed in the past few weeks. Its market value is still large, so it is one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies. Although it is the biggest and has a vibrant ecosystem, the price has been unable to consistently push beyond the significant levels of resistance. Technical charts indicate that ADA has been bouncing up and down in the $0.52 to $0.58 band numerous times. This hints at the fact that the demand has not been re-energized at higher levels in the bigger crypto cycle. A big market cap token frequently requires new impetuses that are powerful to open up the costly changes. Price action may be stifled over a long period of time without those events. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the new cryptoprojects that are widely noticed. It is a non-centralized finance protocol constructing a lending and borrowing structure on Ethereum. The objective is to enable users to put assets into liquidity pools and get yield according to the demand to borrow, and to enable borrowers to get access to capital with collateral according to the established risk policies. Mutuum Finance is currently undergoing presale which has been going through a number of systematic price stages. The phases have a predetermined number of tokens and price. The token started with a value of $0.01 and has been going up to $0.04 in the present stage and this represents about 300% increase as compared to the first level. Over 18,800 holders and exceeding $19.7 million have been raised and over 825 million tokens have been already sold in the presale allotment. The build-out has involved security. Mutuum Finance has undergone smart contract audit by Halborn Security , a reputable company in blockchain code audits. It also scored 90/100 Token Scan by CertiK and published a 50K bug bounty before rolling out protocols. These measures are usually demanded in the systems where the management of collateral and liquidation implementations are urgently needed. Differences in Structure and a $750 Contrast A lack of progress in the price of Cardano below $0.50 reveals some shortcomings by traders aiming at the short to medium price action. The market size of ADA should be accessibly liquid and with great catalysts in order to overcome resistance and go back in the upwards direction. In the absence of such factors, making percentage gains is more difficult than smaller tokens in the initial stages that can react more quickly to changes in demand. Mutuum Finance is at an alternate stage of life. Its presale has been a consistent involvement and not a peak, and its token structure is pegged on a product that will come to live use when the lending markets come into force. As an illustration, buying 18,750 MUTM of the Mutuum Finance at the present price of $0.04 would require purchasing a $750 investment in the financial instrument. First mover that joined on lower levels have already experienced a relevant advancement in the previous levels of pricing. The usage metrics like the deposited liquidity, the volumes of borrowing, and the activity of the yield may start influencing the valuation of the token as mutuum finance establishes the framework and proceeds to the first actual lending markets. This is unlike the case of ADA where the price movement is still pegged on the announcement of network adoption and the macro market trends. V1 Launch and Phase 7 Importance The impending V1 protocol release is one of the major milestones of Mutuum Finance. As per the official X version of the project, V1 will be launched in the Sepolia testnet prior to mainnet. The lenders are in a position to provide assets in live liquidity markets and borrowers can avail credit according to stipulated rules once V1 is active. Liquidation logic and collateral handling can be measured in an actual use setting. One more important phase is presale phase 7. It is second only to the confirmed listing price and allocations in this stage are filling much faster than the previous ones. When it becomes tightened in terms of structure pricing, players in it normally perceive that distribution is being distributed to the end. A closer proximity to the point of staged pricing allows newer players to have fewer entry points at the low prices and can position earlier cost basis positions more favorably. Since Cardano is holding within the range near $0.50, traders seeking alternative structures, and usage-based growth are considering Mutuum Finance. This new crypto is on the roadmap, with the phases slowly approaching the launch, and with a working product under its belt, it is making top crypto-conversations in the next wave of crypto innovation.

ADA lost over 60% of its value over the past 12 months, sliding from a yearly high of $1.3245 to lows near $0.3512. Price weakness coincided with fading investor attention, as Google Trends data shows search interest falling to its lowest level in five years. What drove such a sharp disconnect between Cardano and the broader crypto narrative? Broader Crypto Weakness Set the Tone Cardano’s decline tracked a wider pullback across the digital asset market during 2025. Bitcoin fell over 6% over the same period, while Ethereum dropped roughly 11%. Total crypto market cap contracted by more than 8%, tightening liquidity across altcoins. ADA maintained a strong correlation with sector-wide moves, which amplified downside pressure during risk-off periods. As market momentum slowed, capital rotated toward assets with stronger near-term catalysts. Ecosystem Growth Concerns Weighed on Sentiment Attention also shifted to Cardano’s on-chain fundamentals. Data from DefiLlama shows total value locked on the network falling below $250 million. That figure places Cardano behind newer ecosystems such as Monad and Katana, despite its longer presence in the market. Source: DeFiLlama Observers also noted Cardano’s limited exposure to the real-world asset tokenization sector, which has grown to nearly $20 billion in value. As a result, narratives around ecosystem stagnation gained traction and reduced speculative interest. Institutional Participation Remained Limited Institutional activity offered little support during the downturn. Only Grayscale submitted an application for a spot ADA exchange-traded fund, while firms such as BlackRock, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary avoided the asset. This lack of institutional engagement contrasted sharply with growing interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Without fresh inflows from large asset managers, ADA struggled to regain visibility during periods of market recovery. Liquidations Accelerated the Downtrend Market structure weakened further after a major liquidation event on October 10, when nearly two million traders exited leveraged positions across crypto markets. Cardano felt the impact through declining derivatives activity. Futures open interest dropped from over $1.95 billion in September to about $646 million. Deleveraging reduced volatility but also limited upside participation, keeping price action subdued through the final months of the year. Forecast Points to Potential Rebound Despite ongoing weakness, CoinCodex projects a possible recovery into 2026. Coincodex forecasts ADA rising by about 52% to $0.5916 by April 12, 2026. Technical indicators currently show bearish sentiment, while the Fear and Greed Index sits at 27, signaling fear-driven conditions. Source: CoinCodex Over the last 30 days, Cardano posted 10 green days with moderate volatility near 5.5%. These metrics highlight fragile confidence rather than capitulation. Technical Structure Shows Early Stabilization From a chart perspective, ADA has started forming higher lows after defending a key horizontal support zone. Price now approaches descending resistance, creating a potential inflection point. A confirmed breakout could open a path toward the $0.52–$0.55 range, while rejection may trigger another test of recent lows. As 2026 approaches, traders continue to watch whether structure or sentiment leads the next move.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 16:00:29
57102168,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=893632,1768233630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57102168.jpeg,Polycule silence fuels rug pull accusations after reported hack,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polycule-polymarket-bot-goes-offline/,"With no updates from the Polycule team and users still unable to withdraw their funds, competitors have already started to declare what Polycule described as a hack incident as a “rug pull” almost one week since the project went mute. When Polycule, one of the largest automated trading bots for the Polymarket prediction market platform, announced on January 7, 2026, that it had been hacked, affecting approximately $230,000 in user funds, the incident appeared to be another unfortunate but not uncommon security breach in the frontier world of cryptocurrency infrastructure. The team promised patches and a security audit by the weekend. It is also committed to compensating affected users through treasury funds. However, as of Monday, January 12, 2026, with no updates from the team, competitors have declared Polycule a rug pull and have started to launch promotional campaigns to capture displaced users. Was Polycule hacked or rugpulled? Ryan Chi, founder of rival platform Insiders.bot, moved to shape the narrative. In a post on X, he wrote , “Today, a group member shared news that one of the largest trading bots, Polycule @pmx_trade, has been confirmed to have rugged.” Chi later went on to state that the platform has not shared any news since the weekend, users cannot withdraw their funds, and described the incident in the same sentence as a suspected case of “rug pull and run.” Within the same post, Chi announced that his platform would offer a 50% discount on first-month memberships to affected Polycule users, positioning Insiders.bot as the ecosystem’s rightful heir. “Now that Polycule has fallen, someone must fill this gap in the ecosystem,” Chi wrote. “I believe we are the right ones to do it.” Insiders.bot’s X account announced lower fees and discount codes for impacted users while describing the situation as “unfortunate” but framing those “who remain” as rebuilding the space. Insiders.bot had posted earlier that it had nothing to do with Polycule’s hack, adding that none of its founders are the purported hacker. How safe are trading bots on prediction markets? Automated trading bots are a segment of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but the sector remains largely unregulated, with inherent custodial risks. Recent reports show that dozens of bots are now quietly farming Polymarket’s short-term Bitcoin markets, many generating monthly profits in the tens of thousands. The success has intensified competition among bot providers, creating powerful incentives to eliminate rivals. What actually constitutes a rug pull, however, is more complex than community usage suggests. While the operational silence from Polycule following its hack announcement is very much similar to troubling patterns in previous DeFi exploits, legitimate projects have faced similar accusations during extended downtime or technical difficulties. Will affected users get compensated? For affected users, the lack of clarity offers little comfort. Those seeking to document holdings in hopes of potential recovery have shared wallet addresses publicly, though no recovery mechanism currently exists. Insiders.bot has asked those affected to register their losses, adding that they will share compensation within one to two weeks. However, it can be said that the incident has already damaged confidence in third-party Polymarket bots , with some users declaring that they will avoid automated services entirely. Also, the absence of clear authority in this space creates an opening for both innovation and exploitation, and in some cases allows competitors to serve as judge, jury, and beneficiary when projects falter. Until Polycule breaks its silence or independent analysis provides clarity, users who are already left to speculate may continue to lean more towards Mr. Chi’s conclusions.

For traders, identifying subtle signals early can make the difference between capturing significant gains and being caught on the sidelines. XRP, one of the most actively traded digital assets , is currently at such a pivotal moment. Its short-term price action suggests that careful observation is crucial before the next decisive move. In a recent post on X, The JWK Show highlighted the current technical landscape for XRP, emphasizing a critical support level at $2.0655. According to the analyst, XRP must hold above this level to maintain bullish momentum. Falling below it could expose the asset to increased selling pressure, while holding firm preserves the potential for a subsequent upward move. Key Support Holds the Market Together Support levels serve as the foundation for market structure, signaling where buying pressure historically outweighs selling pressure. XRP’s $2.0655 mark has acted as a floor in recent sessions, absorbing downward moves and preventing further losses. Maintaining this level signals that buyers are actively defending the price, keeping the bullish setup intact. Xrp price update !!!! Xrp must continue to stay above $2.0655 We are waiting for a buy signal on the daily timeframe That’s it folks Stay tuned !!!! pic.twitter.com/6JsiumxLzk — The JWK Show (@TheJWKShow) January 11, 2026 If XRP breaches this support, it could trigger stop-loss orders and accelerate selling, undermining confidence in the short-term trend. Conversely, holding above it provides stability, giving the market time to consolidate before generating a potential buy opportunity. Daily Timeframe Buy Signals Are Crucial The JWK Show emphasized monitoring the daily chart for a confirmed buy signal. Daily timeframes offer a broader perspective than intraday charts, filtering out minor fluctuations and revealing clearer trend direction. Waiting for a verified daily signal ensures that traders do not enter positions prematurely, reducing exposure to false breakouts or short-term volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical indicators, including moving averages, trendlines, and momentum oscillators, often guide the confirmation of buy signals. Once XRP aligns with these conditions, market participants can enter with greater confidence, knowing the broader trend supports upward movement. Strategic Patience for the Next Move XRP remains at a critical juncture where price action and technical structure must be respected. Traders should exercise patience, allowing the daily chart to confirm a clear signal before committing capital. This measured approach balances risk management with opportunity, ensuring that actions respond to verified market structure rather than speculation. In summary, XRP must maintain support above $2.0655 while waiting for a reliable daily buy signal . Following The JWK Show’s guidance, traders who monitor these conditions carefully position themselves to capitalize on the next significant price movement while minimizing unnecessary risk.

The market experienced four consecutive days of net withdrawals, which surged to roughly $1.3 billion, erasing the $1.5 billion that entered products during the first two trading days of January. CoinShares attributed the change in direction largely to growing concerns that the Federal Reserve is less likely to deliver an interest rate cut in March, following stronger-than-expected recent macroeconomic data. XRP, Solana Defy Broader Slump In the latest edition of Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, CoinShares revealed that Bitcoin was the most affected asset, as products linked to the cryptocurrency saw $405 million leave during the week. At the same time, short-Bitcoin products also registered $9.2 million in outflows, which was indicative of a lack of consensus among investors on near-term price direction. Ethereum-based products also faced significant selling pressure, with $116 million outflows, while multi-asset strategies saw $21 million exit. Smaller declines were observed in products tied to Binance and Aave, which saw $3.7 million and $1.7 million leave, respectively. On the other hand, several altcoin investment products continued to attract fresh capital. XRP led the group as it drew $45.8 million, followed by Solana with $32.8 million and Sui with $7.6 million. Chainlink also saw renewed interest and added $3 million over the past week. From a regional perspective, the recent pullback in digital asset investment products was overwhelmingly driven by the United States, while investor activity outside the US remained net positive, though at much smaller scales. The US saw $569 million leave digital asset products. Contrastingly, Germany recorded the strongest inflow of $58.9 million, followed by Canada with $24.5 million and Switzerland with $21 million. Smaller gains were reported in Australia with $4.7 million, the Netherlands with $3.2 million, France with $1.4 million, Sweden with $0.4 million, and New Zealand with $0.3 million. “Push-Out of Bullish Expectations” This cautious approach has been visible in recent price action. QCP Capital, for one, said recent Bitcoin price action reflects ongoing pressure and limited upside in the near term. While the asset initially rose alongside gold and silver during early Asian trading as the US dollar weakened, the move quickly faded. Bitcoin failed to maintain levels above $92,000 and retreated during the European session. In doing so, the crypto ended up repeating a pattern seen several times in the fourth quarter of last year. According to QCP, BTC has repeatedly struggled to hold gains even when supported by narratives that would normally be considered positive. The firm also identified changes in options markets, where traders reduced some bullish long-dated call positions and rolled others to later expiries. This means that expectations for higher prices have been delayed. Continued selling during US trading hours, lingering supply pressures, and rising macro uncertainty are still weighing on prices, as near-term volatility risks remain high ahead of US economic and legal developments.

Together, the data point to changing network conditions and renewed trader activity, even as price remains well below prior highs. Ethereum gas fees stay lower as builders watch costs Ethereum gas fees stayed comparatively low in early 2026, after years of sharp spikes that made onchain activity costly during peak periods.

As a result, he said the network now looks more practical for traditional finance firms that want to build and scale on Ethereum. The chart Rand shared shows elevated fee spikes through 2021 and 2022, followed by a long decline and flatter readings through 2023 to 2026. The latest data point on the right edge sits near 0.434, while earlier peaks rose far higher.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $92,000 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This surge represents a critical psychological and technical threshold for the asset, fueling widespread analysis and discussion among institutional and retail investors alike. The move signals a robust bullish phase, potentially setting the stage for further exploration of uncharted price territory. Bitcoin Price Breakthrough: Analyzing the $92,000 Milestone The ascent past $92,000 is not an isolated event. Consequently, it follows a period of sustained accumulation and reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. Market data from on-chain analytics firms like Glassnode indicates a notable decrease in Bitcoin transfers to exchange wallets, a metric often associated with impending sell-offs. Simultaneously, the supply held by entities with minimal selling history continues to reach new highs. This fundamental shift in holder behavior creates a supply shock, a primary catalyst for rapid price appreciation. Furthermore, the breakthrough coincides with increased network activity and rising transaction fees, underscoring robust underlying demand. Technical and Macroeconomic Drivers of the Rally From a technical perspective, the rally above $92,000 confirms a breakout from a multi-week consolidation pattern. Key moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day, have acted as dynamic support, propelling the price upward. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), while elevated, has not yet entered the extreme overbought territory that typically precedes sharp corrections, suggesting room for continued momentum. On a macroeconomic scale, several interconnected factors are providing tailwinds. Persistent concerns about global inflationary pressures continue to drive interest in Bitcoin’s perceived store-of-value properties. Additionally, evolving regulatory clarity in major economies and the accelerating adoption of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are funneling unprecedented institutional capital into the market. Expert Commentary and Market Sentiment Financial analysts and cryptocurrency veterans are closely dissecting this move. Many point to the convergence of technical strength and favorable macro conditions as a classic setup for a sustained bull market. “The breach of $92,000 is significant because it represents the overcoming of a major liquidity zone,” notes a market strategist from a leading digital asset fund. “The market has efficiently absorbed sell-side pressure at this level, which now transitions from resistance to support.” Sentiment indicators, such as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, have shifted decisively into ‘Greed’ territory, reflecting growing retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). However, seasoned traders caution that while the trend is bullish, volatility remains an inherent feature of the cryptocurrency landscape. Historical Context and Future Trajectory To understand the potential implications, it is instructive to view this rally within Bitcoin’s historical cycles. Previous bull markets have been characterized by parabolic advances followed by significant drawdowns. The current price action shares similarities with mid-cycle rallies observed in past epochs, where price discovery accelerates after breaking key all-time highs. The following table compares key metrics from previous cycle peaks to the current environment: Cycle Peak Price (USD) Market Cap Dominance Google Trends Score 2017 ~$20,000 >65% 100 2021 ~$69,000 ~40% 75 Current (2025) >$92,000 ~52% 55 This data suggests current retail interest, as measured by search volume, is more tempered compared to prior peaks, potentially indicating a healthier, less speculative advance. Key levels to watch now include: Immediate Support: The previous resistance zone around $88,000 – $90,000. Near-term Target: The psychologically significant $100,000 level. On-chain Watch: Miner outflow and exchange net position changes. Conclusion Bitcoin’s surge above $92,000 marks a definitive chapter in its 2025 market narrative. This achievement stems from a powerful confluence of technical breakout, strong on-chain fundamentals, and supportive macroeconomic trends. While the path forward will inevitably include volatility, the breach of this key level reinforces Bitcoin’s position at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. Market participants will now monitor whether this Bitcoin price milestone solidifies as a foundation for the next leg up toward the historic $100,000 threshold. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to rise above $92,000? The rally is driven by multiple factors: a technical breakout from consolidation, reduced selling pressure from long-term holders (supply shock), sustained institutional investment via ETFs, and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty favoring hard assets. Q2: Is Bitcoin in a bull market? Current price action, on-chain data, and market structure strongly indicate Bitcoin is in a bull market phase, characterized by higher highs and higher lows, with increasing dominance over the broader cryptocurrency sector. Q3: Could the price crash after this rally? While sharp pullbacks are common in volatile asset classes, the fundamental backdrop remains strong. A healthy market often experiences corrections; a crash typically requires a shift in core drivers like macro policy or network security. Q4: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The move above $92,000 sets a new all-time high, surpassing the previous record of approximately $69,000 set in November 2021. This represents a significant milestone in Bitcoin’s price discovery journey. Q5: What should investors do now? Investors should adhere to their personal risk management strategies. This includes considering dollar-cost averaging, securing profits according to a plan, and never investing more than they can afford to lose. Conducting independent research is paramount.

The company’s new platform, World Liberty Markets, is now live, giving people a way to borrow and lend crypto directly with each other. The whole thing runs on their own USD1 stablecoin, which already has a $3.4 billion market cap, and it also supports WLFI, Ethereum, tokenized Bitcoin, USDT, and USDC. The company says President Donald Trump is “co-founder emeritus.” That line is right there on their homepage, not buried in the fine print. The launch adds more fuel to what they’ve been building since last year, and it’s clear they want USD1 everywhere. Binance, which helped create the token, recently added new trading pairs. MGX, an investment firm out of Abu Dhabi, even used USD1 to grab a $2 billion stake in Binance. Platform supports lending, borrowing, and more assets coming Zak Folkman, one of the co-founders, said the platform will support more assets soon. Real-world stuff too. “We have a lot of partnerships that will be coming online in the next several weeks,” he said. That includes real estate, prediction markets, and more exchanges. He wouldn’t give exact names, but World Liberty has already talked before about tokenizing Trump family properties. The tech under the platform is built by Dolomite, a third-party crypto lending system. Zach Witkoff, the company’s CEO, said it adds more ways to use USD1.“We think it can be huge, we think users are going to love it,” he said. The company is also planning a mobile app with this lending feature baked in, and they’ve been floating the idea of a debit card where people can spend USD1 and earn loyalty rewards. The WLFI token also plays a role. It started off as a non-transferable governance token, but the company made it tradable. That gave them another way to raise money. No fluff, just sales. And it worked. WLFI now trades, while USD1 keeps pulling in new use cases. World Liberty files for bank charter amid rampant expansion Five days ago, WLTC Holdings LLC, tied to the company, filed an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The goal is to create World Liberty Trust, a federal trust bank made for stablecoins. If approved, this new bank will handle digital custody and allow users of other stablecoins like USDT and USDC to swap into USD1 directly. Zach said the charter would provide “a clear federal framework for custody, reserve management, and fiduciary oversight. And over time, that can enable more direct institutional participation, stronger consumer protections, and general use in regulated payment and settlement flows; always subject to supervisory approval.” Legacy banks aren’t happy. They see this as a way to get federal approval without playing by full bank rules. It’s a growing trend. These crypto firms are going after limited charters to get through the door. Last year, Coinbase filed for one. Ripple, BitGo, and Paxos already got conditional approvals. World Liberty is just the latest one trying it. The company says if they get approval, they’ll be able to go after institutional clients, like exchanges and funds. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Strategy has acquired 13,627 BTC for ~$1.25 billion at ~$91,519 per bitcoin. As of 1/11/2026, we hodl 687,410 $BTC acquired for ~$51.80 billion at ~$75,353 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD $STRE https://t.co/bIbPbFAbTa — Strategy (@Strategy) January 12, 2026 The purchase further cements the firm’s position as the largest corporate holder of bitcoin globally and continues its long-running strategy of using capital markets activity to accumulate the digital asset. Total Holdings Reach 687,410 BTC As of January 11, Strategy reported aggregate bitcoin holdings of 687,410 BTC, acquired for a total cost of approximately $51.80 billion. The company’s average purchase price across all holdings stands at $75,353 per bitcoin, according to the filing. The latest acquisition comes despite recent volatility in bitcoin prices and a broader pullback in digital asset investment products, signalling Strategy’s continued conviction in bitcoin as a long-term treasury reserve asset. Purchases Funded Through Equity and Preferred Stock Issuance The filing shows that the bitcoin purchases were funded using proceeds from the sale of shares under the company’s at-the-market (ATM) programmes, including both common and preferred equity. During the same period, Strategy sold 1,192,262 shares of STRC, its Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, generating $119.1 million in net proceeds. In addition, the company sold 6,827,695 shares of MSTR Class A common stock, raising $1.13 billion in net proceeds. No shares were sold during the period from its other preferred stock offerings, including STRF, STRK, and STRD, though significant issuance capacity remains available across these instruments. Capital Structure Supports Ongoing Bitcoin Accumulation As of January 11, Strategy reported substantial remaining capacity for future issuance, including more than $20.3 billion under STRK, $4.0 billion under STRD, $3.9 billion under STRC, and $1.6 billion under STRF. The company also retains over $10.2 billion of availability under its MSTR common stock programme. The structure allows Strategy to continue accessing capital opportunistically while spreading financing across common equity and multiple layers of preferred stock with varying dividend features. A Long-Term Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Strategy’s disclosure reinforces its position that bitcoin remains the core asset on its balance sheet. While the company’s average acquisition price is well below recent market highs, the pace and scale of accumulation underline its willingness to deploy significant capital regardless of short-term price movements. With nearly 700,000 BTC now held, Strategy’s balance sheet has become one of the most concentrated institutional expressions of long-term bitcoin exposure in global markets.

The asset has posted a minor daily gain but is down 1% over the past week. Analysts are now watching technical signals, especially the RSI, which has dropped below a level that often reflects strength in trend cycles. RSI Drops Below 60, Trend at Risk The monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped under 60, raising questions about the current phase of the cycle. Analyst Egrag Crypto expected it to stay above that level, saying, “I expected RSI to hold above 60 and continue toward the 80–90 cycle-top zone.” They added, “We are now in the neutral-to-slightly bearish zone. This area often acts as a decision zone, not a final verdict.” While the RSI is starting to curve upward, momentum remains uncertain. Egrag noted that reclaiming 60 could bring the bull cycle back into play. If not, the structure may shift toward deeper consolidation, with the next RSI support around 38. $92K Still Capping Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin briefly reached $92,400 on Monday, but soon withdrew. That action was short-lived, and it coincided with the resurgence of tension between US President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Powell. Since then, BTC has fallen back under the threshold of $92,000. The $92,000 level remains a key hurdle. Until the asset breaks and holds above it, the chance of a return to the yearly open price increases. Prior analysis also pointed to a possible move toward $70,000 if downside pressure builds in the weeks ahead. Moreover, Bitcoin continues to trade above a short-term ascending trendline and the 21-day moving average. This structure is helping the price hold its ground near $90,000. Michaël van de Poppe noted, #Bitcoin stabilizes and is performing quite well, despite global uncertainties. The recipe remains the same: Hold above the 21-Day MA and starts grinding up towards the $94.000 resistance zone. With everything that’s happening, it’s even strengthening the use case of $BTC . pic.twitter.com/HdEYv0YrPH — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 12, 2026 The $94,000 level is the next clear resistance. A break above that may open the way toward $100,400 and higher zones. Below current levels, a breakdown would weaken the bullish setup. Price Range Limits Momentum for Now Crypto analyst CryptosBatman described BTC’s current move as stuck inside a weekly inside bar pattern. He explained , “The market is super boring right now… price is moving within the highs and lows of the weekly candle from 17th November.” Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Q1 often brings stronger price action for Bitcoin. He noted, “ The last time it did awful was in 2018… Q1 does tend to be quite good, especially in recent years. ” Traders remain focused on whether BTC can hold above support or if another leg lower is next.

This substantial movement, first identified by the on-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens, represents one of the largest single transfers involving the politically-connected DeFi protocol this year and immediately sparked intense scrutiny across cryptocurrency markets. The transaction’s timing, scale, and participants offer a compelling case study in modern decentralized finance mechanics and institutional crypto asset management. World Liberty Financial and the WLFI Token Ecosystem World Liberty Financial operates as a decentralized finance protocol that has garnered attention both for its technological framework and its notable leadership. The platform’s development is reportedly guided by members of the Trump family, introducing a unique intersection of political legacy and digital asset innovation. Consequently, the WLFI token serves as the native governance and utility asset within this ecosystem. Analysts track several key functions for the token: Governance Rights: Token holders can participate in protocol upgrade proposals and parameter changes. Fee Accrual: A portion of protocol-generated fees is distributed to staked WLFI tokens. Collateral Utility: The token functions as approved collateral within the protocol’s lending modules. Prior to this transfer, on-chain data indicated that the sending address held a substantial portion of the token’s circulating supply, suggesting a direct link to the protocol’s treasury or a core development entity. Market observers consistently monitor such wallets for signals about protocol strategy and liquidity management. Jump Trading’s Role as a Crypto Market Maker Jump Trading represents a titan in the algorithmic and high-frequency trading space, with its crypto division, Jump Crypto, establishing itself as a pivotal liquidity provider and venture investor within the digital asset industry. The firm’s receiving address, identified through previous transaction patterns and industry intelligence, is known to facilitate several critical market functions. Firstly, Jump provides deep liquidity across centralized and decentralized exchanges, enabling efficient price discovery and asset transfer. Secondly, the firm often engages in over-the-counter (OTC) deals for large token blocks, minimizing market impact for substantial trades. Furthermore, Jump Crypto participates actively in blockchain infrastructure development and governance, particularly in ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum. The involvement of a sophisticated player like Jump Trading suggests the $83.1 million WLFI transfer was likely a structured transaction rather than a simple spot market sale. Such moves typically involve negotiated terms, potential vesting schedules, or specific liquidity provisioning agreements designed to stabilize the token’s market presence. Analyzing the Transaction’s Market Impact and Timing Blockchain explorers confirm the transaction occurred in a single block, settling with standard Ethereum network gas fees. The sheer size—500 million WLFI—represents a meaningful percentage of the token’s total circulating supply, which data aggregators estimate to be in the low billions. Immediately following the transfer, social sentiment analysis tools recorded a spike in discussion volume across cryptocurrency forums and social media platforms. However, initial market price data showed remarkable stability for the WLFI token, with less than a 2% fluctuation in the hours following the on-chain revelation. This price resilience indicates several possibilities. The transfer may have been part of a pre-arranged, non-market OTC deal where Jump Trading acquired the tokens at a fixed price. Alternatively, Jump could be acting as a liquidity partner, receiving the tokens to methodically provide sell-side depth on exchanges without crashing the market. The stable price action contrasts with typical ‘whale dumps’ that cause immediate double-digit percentage declines, suggesting advanced risk management and execution planning by both parties. Regulatory and Political Context for DeFi Protocols The transaction occurs within an evolving regulatory landscape for decentralized finance. Global financial authorities, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and international bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), have increased scrutiny on DeFi governance tokens and the movement of large sums. Protocols with identifiable leadership teams, like World Liberty Financial, often face more direct regulatory attention than fully anonymous projects. The political dimension adds another layer, as transactions linked to high-profile families may attract examination from both financial regulators and political oversight committees. Industry compliance experts note that large transfers to registered and regulated entities like Jump Trading (which operates licensed entities in multiple jurisdictions) can be a strategic move. It potentially brings the token into a more formalized regulatory perimeter, enhancing its legitimacy for future institutional adoption. This context is crucial for understanding the long-term strategy behind the move, which may extend beyond immediate liquidity needs. Comparative Analysis of Similar Large-Scale DeFi Transfers Historical precedent provides valuable insight. The table below compares this transfer to other notable large movements in the DeFi sector over the past 18 months. Protocol Token Amount (USD) Recipient Type Market Outcome World Liberty Financial WLFI $83.1M Market Maker (Jump) Minimal Volatility Acala Network ACA $120M Venture Capital Firm +5% (Next 7 Days) Euler Finance EUL $65M Decentralized Exchange Treasury Liquidity Increase Frax Finance FXS $95M Strategic Partner Wallet Sideways Trading The data suggests that transfers to established liquidity providers like Jump often correlate with subsequent periods of increased trading volume and price stability, rather than immediate appreciation or depreciation. The market interprets these moves as professionalization of the token’s liquidity profile. Technical Mechanics and Blockchain Evidence On-chain analysts employ multiple methods to attribute wallet addresses. For this transaction, the sending address was linked to World Liberty Financial through a history of interactions exclusively with the protocol’s smart contracts, including deployments, upgrades, and treasury management functions. The receiving address exhibits patterns classic to Jump Trading’s operations: frequent, high-volume interactions with known Jump-affiliated addresses, consistent provision of liquidity on specific decentralized exchanges, and participation in governance votes for projects where Jump is a known investor. While absolute certainty in pseudonymous blockchain attribution is challenging, the cumulative evidence from transaction history, counterparty analysis, and industry sourcing creates a high-confidence link. The transaction itself used a standard ERC-20 transfer function, costing a negligible fee in Ethereum’s native currency. No complex smart contract interaction accompanied the transfer, indicating a straightforward asset movement rather than a swap, stake, or wrap action. This simplicity supports the OTC deal hypothesis. Conclusion The $83.1 million WLFI transfer from World Liberty Financial to Jump Trading underscores the maturation of decentralized finance infrastructure. This event demonstrates how large-scale asset movements now involve sophisticated intermediaries to manage market impact. The transaction highlights the growing interplay between DeFi protocols with distinctive governance models and traditional pillars of financial market microstructure like proprietary trading firms. For observers, the key takeaway is the market’s muted reaction, signaling increased resilience and professional handling of liquidity events within the crypto asset class. The World Liberty Financial and Jump Trading transaction will likely serve as a reference point for how politically-associated digital asset projects manage treasury diversification and institutional relationships in a complex regulatory environment. FAQs Q1: What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI)? World Liberty Financial is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Its native WLFI token provides governance rights and utility within its ecosystem. The project has reported connections to the Trump family through its leadership. Q2: Why is Jump Trading receiving these tokens significant? Jump Trading is a major, regulated market maker and liquidity provider in cryptocurrency markets. Its involvement suggests a move towards professional liquidity management for the WLFI token, potentially improving its market stability and accessibility for larger traders. Q3: Did this large transfer cause the WLFI price to crash? No, initial market data showed minimal price impact, with volatility under 2%. This stability suggests the transfer was likely a pre-negotiated over-the-counter (OTC) deal or part of a structured liquidity agreement, not a direct market sell order. Q4: How do analysts know the wallets belong to these entities? On-chain analysts use pattern recognition, tracing historical transactions, interactions with known smart contracts, and correlations with publicly disclosed addresses. While not 100% definitive, consistent behavioral evidence creates high-confidence attribution. Q5: What does this mean for the future of the WLFI token? The transfer to a sophisticated entity like Jump Trading could indicate upcoming initiatives such as enhanced exchange listings, deeper liquidity pools, or new institutional product offerings built around the token. It generally signals a move towards greater market integration.

The case centers on ClothOff, an application that has operated for more than two years despite being removed from major app stores and banned from most social platforms. This legal battle demonstrates how technological advancements outpace regulatory frameworks, leaving victims with limited recourse against anonymous international operators. Deepfake Porn Lawsuit Highlights Systemic Enforcement Gaps The complaint, filed in October 2024 by the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic at Yale Law School, represents an anonymous New Jersey high school student identified as Jane Doe. Her classmates allegedly used ClothOff to create sexually explicit deepfake images from her Instagram photos. Since the original photos were taken when she was 14 years old, the AI-modified versions constitute child sexual abuse material under federal law. However, local authorities declined to prosecute, citing evidentiary challenges in obtaining data from suspects’ devices. Professor John Langford, co-lead counsel in the lawsuit, explains the jurisdictional complexities. “ClothOff is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands but we believe it’s run by individuals in Belarus,” Langford states. “It may even be part of a larger global network.” This international dimension complicates legal proceedings significantly, as serving notice to defendants requires navigating multiple legal systems with varying cooperation standards. The Technical and Legal Landscape of Deepfake Platforms ClothOff represents a specific category of AI tools designed exclusively for generating non-consensual intimate imagery. Unlike general-purpose AI systems, its singular function creates distinct legal implications. The platform remains accessible through web interfaces and Telegram bots despite removal from official app stores, demonstrating the resilience of such services in decentralized online spaces. Several key factors contribute to enforcement difficulties: Jurisdictional ambiguity: Operators leverage international boundaries to evade accountability Technical infrastructure: Distributed hosting and cryptocurrency payments obscure ownership Legal classification: While CSAM is universally illegal, platform liability remains unclear Evidentiary challenges: Digital evidence requires specialized forensic collection methods Contrasting Legal Approaches to General vs. Specific AI Tools The ClothOff case presents different legal questions than those surrounding general-purpose AI systems like xAI’s Grok. Langford clarifies this distinction: “ClothOff is designed and marketed specifically as a deepfake pornography generator. When you’re suing a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it gets more complicated.” This differentiation affects First Amendment analysis and platform liability standards. General-purpose AI systems enjoy stronger constitutional protections because they have legitimate applications beyond harmful content generation. However, systems like ClothOff that are exclusively designed for creating non-consensual intimate imagery operate outside First Amendment protections according to legal experts. The 2023 Take It Down Act specifically prohibits deepfake pornography, but enforcement against platforms rather than individual users remains challenging. International Regulatory Responses to AI-Generated Abuse Global approaches to regulating AI-generated non-consensual content vary significantly. Indonesia and Malaysia have blocked access to Grok entirely, while United Kingdom regulators have opened investigations that could lead to similar restrictions. The European Commission, France, Ireland, India, and Brazil have taken preliminary regulatory steps. In contrast, no U.S. regulatory agency has issued an official response to the proliferation of such tools. This regulatory patchwork creates enforcement challenges, particularly when platforms operate across multiple jurisdictions. International cooperation mechanisms exist for child sexual abuse material, but they often move slower than the technology evolves. The table below illustrates key differences in legal approaches: Jurisdiction Primary Approach Key Legislation United States Platform liability with intent requirement Take It Down Act, Section 230 European Union Horizontal regulation of AI systems AI Act, Digital Services Act United Kingdom Case-by-case platform investigation Online Safety Act 2023 Southeast Asia Access blocking for non-compliant platforms Various national cybersecurity laws The Evidentiary Hurdles in Digital Abuse Cases Law enforcement agencies face substantial challenges when investigating AI-generated abuse. The New Jersey case demonstrates how digital evidence collection requires specialized technical expertise that many local departments lack. Furthermore, the anonymous nature of online platforms complicates identification of both perpetrators and victims. Professor Langford notes the particular difficulty with platforms like ClothOff: “Neither the school nor law enforcement ever established how broadly the CSAM of Jane Doe and other girls was distributed.” This distribution uncertainty affects both criminal prosecution and civil damages calculations. Additionally, the rapid evolution of AI technology means that evidentiary standards and forensic techniques constantly require updating. Platform Design and Legal Accountability Standards Legal experts emphasize that platform design decisions significantly affect liability determinations. Systems specifically engineered to produce illegal content face different legal scrutiny than general-purpose tools with inadequate safeguards. The distinction between willful ignorance and reasonable precaution shapes many legal arguments in this emerging field. Langford explains the legal reasoning: “Reasonable people can say we knew this was a problem years ago. How can you not have had more stringent controls? That is a kind of recklessness or knowledge, but it’s a more complicated case.” This standard applies differently to specialized versus general platforms, creating a complex legal landscape for victims and their advocates. Conclusion The New Jersey deepfake porn lawsuit against ClothOff illuminates the substantial legal and technical barriers victims face when seeking justice for AI-generated abuse. While child sexual abuse material remains universally illegal, platform accountability mechanisms lag behind technological capabilities. The case demonstrates how jurisdictional complexities, evidentiary challenges, and First Amendment considerations create enforcement gaps that specialized platforms exploit. As AI technology continues advancing, legal systems worldwide must develop more responsive frameworks that balance innovation with protection against digital harm. The ClothOff litigation may establish important precedents for holding specialized deepfake platforms accountable, but significant legal evolution remains necessary to address this growing problem effectively. FAQs Q1: What is the ClothOff app and why is it controversial? ClothOff is an AI-powered application specifically designed to create non-consensual deepfake pornography. It has generated controversy because it targets individuals without consent, often creating child sexual abuse material when applied to images of minors. Q2: Why has the New Jersey lawsuit progressed slowly? The lawsuit has faced multiple delays due to jurisdictional challenges. Defendants operate internationally with incorporation in the British Virgin Islands and suspected management in Belarus, making legal service and enforcement complicated across borders. Q3: How does this case differ from legal actions against general AI systems? ClothOff faces different legal standards because it’s designed exclusively for creating harmful content. General AI systems like Grok have legitimate applications, making First Amendment protections stronger and liability standards higher for proving platform knowledge or intent. Q4: What are the main legal obstacles to shutting down platforms like ClothOff? Primary obstacles include international jurisdiction issues, anonymous operation through cryptocurrency and decentralized hosting, evolving First Amendment interpretations, and the difficulty of proving platform intent versus individual user misconduct. Q5: How are different countries responding to AI-generated non-consensual content? Responses vary significantly: some Southeast Asian nations block access entirely, European regulators investigate under new AI legislation, while U.S. approaches rely more on existing laws with higher intent requirements for platform liability.

Sentiment was also dampened by persistent outflows from spot crypto ETFs, which kept investor interest in check. The total cryptocurrency market cap dropped below $3.2 trillion and was down slightly over 1% at the time of writing. While overall market sentiment remained within the lower end of the ‘neutral’ zone, the mood reflected a clear sense of caution. Only a few altcoins among the top 100 managed to stay in the green, with just two posting double-digit gains. Most others ended the day with losses or minimal movement, underscoring the selective nature of the current rebound. Why is Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin’s rally to an intraday high of $92,356 early in the day was largely sparked by an extraordinary political showdown between the Federal Reserve and the Department of Justice. Following news that broke late Sunday, investors reacted to a video statement from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who revealed he had been served with grand jury subpoenas. This unprecedented friction initially triggered a flight to safety, with many market participants rotating into decentralized assets as a hedge against the perceived threat to central bank independence. During this morning surge, Bitcoin and privacy-centric tokens like Monero found strength as the market weighed the implications of a criminal investigation into the sitting Fed Chair. The bullish momentum hit a ceiling later in the afternoon as the focus shifted from political drama to the cold reality of upcoming monetary policy. While the DOJ investigation created short-term volatility, the safe-haven narrative was eventually overtaken by broader macroeconomic concerns ahead of the January 28 Fed meeting. Recent economic indicators, including a strong labour market and resilient services activity, have significantly lowered the probability of a rate cut in March. This shift toward a “higher for longer” interest rate environment helped the dollar regain its footing, naturally putting downward pressure on high-risk assets like Bitcoin. Adding to the price retreat was a notable lack of support from institutional buyers. According to recent data from CoinShares, global crypto investment products saw approximately $454 million in net outflows over the past week, effectively wiping out much of the enthusiasm seen at the start of the year. As Wall Street participants moved to rebalance their portfolios and lock in profits from the initial Trump Trade, the absence of fresh spot ETF inflows allowed Bitcoin to drift back toward the $90,000 support level. This area remains a vital line in the sand for the current market structure, as bulls look to defend this floor to avoid a deeper slide into the mid-$80,000 range. Will Bitcoin price go up? On X, the conversation over the last 24 hours has been a tug-of-war between those eyeing a local top and those betting on Bitcoin’s role as a political hedge. “Over the past 6 Asian session pumps, 4 out of 6 were fully retraced. The last two times price pumped into a Monday, it marked a local top and fully reversed the move, giving back even more. We’re once again pumping into Monday. Keep the Jan 13th pivot in mind,” pseudonymous crypto analyst LP wrote in a recent X post. Bitcoin price chart. Source: LP on X. Looking at the bigger picture, analyst CrypNuevo drew attention to the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), identifying the $97,400 level as a likely destination for a relief rally before the market potentially explores lower ground. See below. BTC/USDT 1-day price chart. Source: CrypNuevo on X. While he identified the $97,400 mark as a key objective for a relief rally, he expects Bitcoin to eventually return to the low $80,000s. Fellow market watcher Roman also projected a similar trajectory but set a slightly lower target at $76,000, after which he expects “a decent bounce.” “I think it’s coming soon,” the analyst wrote while sharing the chart below. BTC/USDT weekly chart. Source: Roman on X. Meanwhile, according to an analysis shared by fellow market analyst CryptoELITES, the Bitcoin price was approaching a crucial support on the BTC/BTC.D ratio chart. According to the analyst, if this ratio successfully bounces off the multi-year ascending support line, it confirms that Bitcoin is entering a period of significant relative strength compared to the rest of the market. A confirmed move higher from this 1.540 level would signal that Bitcoin is likely to lead the next major leg of the cycle, potentially invalidating any immediate hopes for an altseason. BTC/BTC.D ratio chart. Source: CryptoELITES on X. At press time, Bitcoin was trading a little over $91,600, with gains of roughly 1% on the day. Right now, $90,000 stands as the closest support level that the flagship crypto must hold to prevent further downside and generate the momentum for a relief rally. Top altcoin gainers for the day The altcoin market cap rose nearly 3% to $1.41 trillion earlier in the day before losing most of its intraday gains and settling at $1.37 trillion at press time. Market sentiment around altcoins appears to be cooling off, as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index that market watchers use to gauge the performance of the altcoin market in comparison to Bitcoin. At press time, the metric showed a reading of 31, down from 49 where it stood at last Thursday. For context, a reading at or above 75 is usually taken as a sign of a true altcoin season at play, while a reading at or below 25 suggests Bitcoin’s dominance over the market. Ethereum (ETH) initially rallied from $3,100 to an intraday high of $3,165 before losing most of its momentum and dropping to $3,114 when writing. XRP (XRP), BNB (BNB), Tron (TRX), and Dogecoin also tipped slightly red with losses of 1-2% respectively. Solana (SOL) bucked its peers with gains of 2% today. Story (IP) outpaced the other altcoins with gains of 27.5%, supported by a surge in interest from Asian traders. Investors also responded to a technical breakout from a cup and handle pattern that had been forming since early December last year. Monero (XMR) followed with gains of nearly 13%, largely due to renewed market interest in privacy-related protocols and crypto assets, and capital rotation from Zcash (ZEC), which is undergoing a governance crisis after several of its core developers resigned en masse following a dispute with its overseeing nonprofit board, Bootstrap. As for Aerodrome (AERO), which posted gains of over 4% on the day, likely as a result of speculative trading, alongside other factors such as ongoing programmatic buybacks by the project team and rising futures market activity.

Why XRP Could Benefit?,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-sends-vital-letter-to-sec-crypto-task-force-why-xrp-could-benefit/,"Crypto researcher Ripple Bull Winkle (@RipBullWinkle) has drawn attention to Ripple’s latest move. Before markets could react, Ripple submitted a formal letter to the SEC Crypto Task Force dated January 9, 2026. The letter addressed the digital asset market structure and ongoing regulatory work in the U.S. Ripple spoke from experience earned through years of direct engagement with U.S. regulators and courts. The letter addressed the digital asset market structure at a moment when Congress and regulators are refining definitions. Ripple acknowledged pending legislation, including the CLARITY Act of 2025 , and emphasized that SEC guidance will intersect with those efforts. Good Morning Before I can even have my coffee Ripple sends a letter to the SEC Crypto Task Force pic.twitter.com/2V9EyNoEVO — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) January 12, 2026 Why Ripple Rejects Decentralization Tests Ripple urged regulators to abandon decentralization as a legal standard. The company wrote that decentralization is “not a binary state” and warned that relying on it creates “intolerable uncertainty.” Instead, Ripple supported frameworks grounded in enforceable promises and contractual rights. This position directly supports XRP. XRP trades actively on secondary markets without granting holders equity, revenue rights, or legal claims on Ripple. By separating the asset from any past transaction, Ripple reinforced the argument that XRP itself is not a security . A Clear Line Between Promises and Assets Ripple emphasized that securities law should regulate promises while they exist, not assets forever. The letter stated that “securities laws regulate enforceable rights, not shared economic interest.” Once a promise ends, the asset should trade freely. This principle aligns with how XRP functions today. XRP holders rely on market dynamics, liquidity, and utility. They do not hold contractual claims against Ripple. That distinction strengthens XRP’s position in secondary markets and supports regulatory clarity . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Secondary Markets and Capital Raising Boundaries Ripple also addressed capital raising. It argued that privity between buyer and issuer defines when securities laws apply. In exchange trading, that relationship is absent. The company described blind bid and ask markets where buyers and sellers remain unknown to each other, and the issuer acts as one participant among many. This is important for XRP, as the letter reinforced that secondary trading does not convert an asset into a security. It compared crypto markets to commodities and other mature markets where high volume does not trigger securities oversight. Why XRP Benefits From Ripple’s Position Ripple closed by endorsing fit-for-purpose disclosures and reaffirming engagement with regulators. The company relied on established law, court reasoning, and lived regulatory experience. For XRP, the message was simple. A regulatory model based on legal rights aligns with XRP, since XRP holders receive no enforceable claims against Ripple.

Six-Figure Returns Take Shape in APEMARS Stage 3 With 22,367% ROI as FLOKI and BABYDOGE Consolidate",https://timestabloid.com/top-meme-coin-to-buy-now-six-figure-returns-take-shape-in-apemars/,"The meme coin market has reached a familiar stage in its cycle. Well-known names like Floki and Baby Doge Coin continue to benefit from recognition, exchange access, and loyal communities, which make them reliable reference points for sentiment. At the same time, experienced investors are beginning to look beyond what is already established and back toward where pricing is still being formed. That shift is why APEMARS has started to enter the conversation around the top meme coin to buy now. APEMARS is currently in its live presale, with Stage 3 priced at $0.00002448 and a projected $0.0055 listing price, creating a 22,367% differential between early entry and launch valuation. From an analyst’s perspective, that gap matters more than short-term headlines. Add in the ability to stake tokens after joining the presale, with rewards activating two months post-listing, and the setup begins to look less like a speculative bet and more like a timing-based allocation. While Floki and Baby Doge represent where meme coins have already been, APEMARS is increasingly being evaluated for where the next wave of upside could realistically start. APEMARS Stage 3 Is Quietly Becoming the Top Meme Coin to Buy Now APEMARS is entering the market at a point most meme coins only reach after the easy money is already gone. The presale is live, Stage 3 is active, and pricing is still early enough to matter. At $0.00002448, APEMARS is sitting far below its projected $0.0055 listing price, creating a 22,367% upside window from Stage 3 alone. That kind of spread is exactly what experienced investors look for before momentum turns public. What makes this moment different is timing. Stage 3 is not just another round; it’s the phase where attention starts building while pricing remains low. The countdown does not pause, and if demand fills the stage before time runs out, the system automatically moves to the next stage at a higher price. That means hesitation is literally priced in. For anyone searching for the top meme coin to buy now, this is the stage where early positioning still feels possible, but not for much longer. Why APEMARS Has the Kind of Structure Meme Coins Need to Explode One reason analysts are taking APEMARS seriously is its burn mechanism, which is directly tied to the presale journey. At key mission checkpoints, unsold presale tokens are permanently removed from supply. This is not a vague promise or a future idea. It is built into the structure of the presale itself. As stages progress, available supply tightens, and later buyers enter at higher prices with fewer tokens in circulation. That combination is what historically creates strong post-launch price pressure. The second driver is the multi-stage presale design. APEMARS follows a fixed, mission-style progression where each stage represents a step closer to launch. Prices increase stage by stage, not based on hype, but by design. Stage 3 buyers benefit from both early pricing and full participation in the journey ahead, while later stages gradually compress upside. This kind of structure is why early meme coin entries often outperform, not because they are lucky, but because the math favors them. Together, the burns and staged pricing give APEMARS something many meme coins lack: controlled scarcity before launch, not after it. A Simple $1,000 Scenario Many Investors Are Already Considering Let’s keep this simple. A $1,000 entry at the current Stage 3 price of $0.00002448 secures a position that looks very different once you compare it to the $0.0055 listing price. On paper, that gap reflects the 22,367% Stage 3 upside, the kind of move that turns small early allocations into six-figure outcomes when momentum aligns. Nothing is guaranteed in crypto, but this is the exact type of setup that people later describe as “obvious in hindsight.” By the time it feels comfortable, Stage 3 will be gone, and the pricing will no longer tell the same story. How to Buy APEMARS in the Live Stage 3 Presale Buying into APEMARS is designed to be straightforward. You start by visiting the official presale page and connecting your wallet. Once connected, you choose the cryptocurrency you want to use, enter the amount, and apply a referral or bonus code if you have one. After confirming the transaction, your APEMARS tokens are immediately visible in your dashboard, reflecting your participation in the current stage. FLOKI: Utility Meets Volatility FLOKI, trading near $0.000052 with a market cap approaching $482 million and daily volume above $28 million, remains one of the most talked-about mid-cap meme assets in the space right now. Recent price action shows some pullback after rally attempts, including a short-term retreat on January 8, where technical indicators signaled profit-taking pressure and a modest drop from resistance levels. This reflects traders adjusting positions after recent strength and underscores the broader market’s current risk appetite. Unlike some pure hype tokens, FLOKI has tried to carve out differentiated positioning with utility-oriented initiatives spanning NFT gaming (Valhalla), DeFi products under its “FlokiFi” umbrella, education platforms, and marketplace ecosystems strategies that aim to blend meme culture with longer-horizon engagement. This dual identity keeps it in focus for those evaluating which liquid name might sustain community attention through multiple cycles. Across the ecosystem, whales have shown renewed activity, with data showing a 950% spike in large FLOKI transactions on Ethereum last week, suggesting institutional or semi-institutional actors are watching the token even as retail interest softens temporarily. Baby Doge Coin: Deflationary Mechanics Meet Community Loyalty Further down the market cap rankings but still drawing community notice is Baby Doge Coin, with a market capitalization near $119 million and a circulating supply of hundreds of quadrillions of tokens. Like many retail-favored meme assets, BABYDOGE’s price performance over recent sessions has shown modest weakness relative to broader crypto indices, drifting slightly lower over the past week. Despite this, Baby Doge has maintained solid trading volume (over $5 million in 24-hour turnover), which speaks to persistent participation from dedicated holders. Deflationary mechanics, re tokens are gradually burned through transactional activity, continue to be a narrative focal point for the project, positioning it as a community-centric store of memes and downward pressure on supply when swaps occur. Final Thoughts: Where Smart Meme Coin Money Is Pausing to Look Floki and Baby Doge Coin remain important benchmarks in the meme coin market, backed by liquidity, scale, and established communities. But their recent trading patterns also reflect a familiar cycle dynamic: once a meme coin is widely known, its biggest gains often depend more on broader market momentum than early positioning. That shift is why conversations around the top meme coin to buy now are gradually changing. Rather than chasing assets that are already discovered, investors are paying closer attention to where pricing is still forming. APEMARS sits in that early window, with its Stage 3 presale live at $0.00002448 and a projected $0.0055 listing price, creating a 22,367% Stage 3 upside gap driven by timing rather than hype. History shows that these quieter moments, when established names feel comfortable and early setups feel uncertain, are often where the next wave of returns begins.

What is the top meme coin to buy now? The top meme coin to buy now depends on whether an investor prefers established liquidity or early pricing. Coins like Floki and Baby Doge offer recognition, while newer presale projects such as APEMARS attract attention for asymmetric entry pricing before public market discovery begins. 2. Is APEMARS presale live right now? Yes, APEMARS is currently in its live presale phase at Stage 3.

How does APEMARS compare to Floki and Baby Doge Coin? Floki and Baby Doge Coin are established meme assets with existing market caps and exchange liquidity. APEMARS differs by being in a presale phase, where pricing is still forming, and upside is driven by early participation rather than broader market momentum. 4. Can meme coins still deliver high returns in 2026? Meme coins can still deliver strong returns when entered early and during price discovery phases. Historically, the largest gains have occurred before widespread awareness, which is why presales and early-stage structures are closely monitored by investors. 5. How do I buy APEMARS during the presale?

Purchased tokens appear in the user dashboard, reflecting participation in the current presale stage. Summary The meme coin market continues to evolve as investors compare established names like Floki and Baby Doge Coin with early-stage presale opportunities. While large-cap meme coins provide familiarity and liquidity, attention is increasingly shifting toward structured presales where pricing remains low. APEMARS is currently live in Stage 3 at $0.00002448 with a projected $0.0055 listing price, creating a 22,367 percent upside window from Stage 3. This contrast highlights how early timing, controlled supply mechanics, and staged pricing influence long-term return potential. For investors searching for the top meme coin to buy now, balancing proven market leaders with emerging presale setups has become a central strategy in the current cycle.

The acquisition brings the company’s total holdings to over 4.17 million ETH, which equals about 3.45% of the total Ethereum supply. BitMine, led by Tom Lee, is now the largest ETH treasury holder in the world. The vote will determine whether BitMine shareholders approve the issuance of additional shares, enabling continued ETH purchases. The final deadline for votes is Sunday at 11:59 p.m. EST, with the company’s annual meeting set for January 15 in Las Vegas. Tom Lee urged shareholders to approve the proposal, which would raise the ceiling on authorized shares. He explained that BitMine issues shares only at a premium to adjusted net asset value, which he says protects investors and increases ETH exposure. As Coinpaper reported , BitMine raised its cash reserves by $73 million last week, supporting its treasury and staking strategy. BitMine Boosts Staking and ETH Buying The latest ETH acquisition follows a 32,977 ETH purchase the previous week. The firm is expanding its staking operations, with over 1.25 million ETH now staked through various providers. According to investor Ted Pillows on X, BitMine has staked $3.3 billion in Ethereum over the last three weeks, generating an estimated $92.7 million annually at a 2.81% yield. Lee continues to share a bullish outlook on Ethereum, projecting near-term prices between $7,000 and $9,000 by the end of January. As Coinpaper outlined , he suggested that ETH could rise as high as $22,000 if Bitcoin reaches $250,000. He also cited Ethereum’s increasing role in finance and its long-term correlation to Bitcoin performance. Meanwhile, VanEck’s Ethereum price prediction has resurfaced across social media. The investment firm previously outlined a bearish scenario where ETH could drop to $300, though its 2030 base and bull cases put ETH at $22,000 and $154,000, respectively. Concurrently, daily Ethereum activity has continued to strengthen. According to Merlijn, the trader, Ethereum is entering a late-stage Wyckoff accumulation pattern, with structure building before a breakout. He suggested a potential rally to $12,000 if the current setup holds. This bullish sentiment has been buoyed by Ethereum averaging 1.87 million daily transactions, surpassing its 2021 DeFi peak. These active addresses are above 728,000, and new address creation reached its highest level since 2018, which is a precursor of a bull rally.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 17:15:27

The move, tracked by blockchain analytics platform Arkham, represents one of the most significant SHIB withdrawals recorded in recent days. Source: Arkham The receiving address carries the ”Ethereum First Funder” designation, indicating its presence on the network since the early days of Ethereum. Despite its historical footprint, the wallet's recent activity pattern indicates a marked strategic shift toward accumulating meme coins. Portfolio Composition Shifts Dramatically The whale's current holdings total $2.54 million, with 410 ETH comprising the primary position. Following the latest withdrawal, SHIB now occupies the second-largest position in the portfolio at over $408,000. This allocation represents a deliberate concentration in the meme coin sector. Arkham's balance tracking reveals the wallet's rapid growth trajectory. The portfolio value surged from less than $500,000 to its current $2.5 million mark within a two-month period. The SHIB acquisition serves as the most recent driver of this expansion. The timing of the withdrawal coincides with broader market weakness in SHIB. The token declined 2.83% over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.00000842 at the time of writing. This suggests the whale perceives current price levels as an accumulation opportunity rather than a deterrent. SHIB’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex ) Technical Levels Draw Attention SHIB recently attempted to break through the $0.00000900 resistance level but failed to sustain momentum above that threshold. The token now trades just above critical local support zones that technical analysts are monitoring closely. Market observers have identified $0.00000699 as a key support level that could provide downside protection. On the upside, resistance sits at approximately $0.00001102 and $0.00001203. These price points represent areas where SHIB has historically faced selling pressure during previous rallies. Should the whale's entry point prove well-timed and SHIB reaches the identified resistance levels, the position could generate unrealized gains between $160,000 and $200,000. This potential return assumes the token can reclaim previous highs without significant dilution of the position.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|SHIB|TRADING|ARKM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 17:17:51

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170. In November, and December the decline continued with SOL ending the year at the $125 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-12 17:22:09
57103731,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260820,1768238711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Apple Google AI Partnership: Revolutionary Gemini Integration Powers Siri’s Long-Awaited Transformation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/apple-google-gemini-siri-partnership/,"BitcoinWorld Apple Google AI Partnership: Revolutionary Gemini Integration Powers Siri’s Long-Awaited Transformation In a landmark announcement that reshapes the artificial intelligence landscape, Apple has officially confirmed its partnership with Google to power core AI features including Siri using Google’s Gemini technology. This strategic collaboration, confirmed on December 15, 2025, represents a significant departure from Apple’s traditional vertical integration approach and signals a new era for consumer AI experiences across Apple’s ecosystem. Apple Google AI Partnership Details and Strategic Implications Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year agreement where Apple will utilize Google’s Gemini foundational models and cloud infrastructure. According to joint statements from both companies, this partnership follows extensive evaluation of competing technologies from OpenAI and Anthropic. The deal, reportedly valued at approximately $1 billion annually, provides Apple with access to Google’s most advanced AI capabilities while maintaining non-exclusive terms. This collaboration marks a pivotal moment for Apple’s AI strategy. Historically, Apple has prioritized complete control over its hardware and software integration. However, the company faced increasing pressure as its AI offerings, particularly Siri, lagged behind competitors like ChatGPT and Google Assistant. The partnership enables Apple to accelerate its AI roadmap while continuing development of its proprietary Apple Intelligence platform. Technical Integration and Privacy Framework Apple emphasizes that the Google Gemini integration will maintain the company’s stringent privacy standards. Much of the AI processing will continue to occur on-device, with cloud-based operations handled through Apple’s privacy-preserving infrastructure. This hybrid approach balances advanced AI capabilities with Apple’s commitment to user data protection. The technical implementation involves several key components: On-device processing: Core AI functions will run locally on Apple devices Private Cloud Compute: More complex tasks will use Apple’s secure servers Gemini API integration: Google’s models will power specific advanced features Federated learning: Privacy-preserving model improvements across devices Siri Transformation Timeline and Expected Features Apple has confirmed that the long-awaited Siri overhaul will launch in spring 2026. Previous delays in releasing the “more personalized Siri” voice assistant stemmed from technical challenges and privacy considerations. The Gemini-powered Siri will feature significantly enhanced capabilities including: Feature Category Expected Improvements Timeline Conversational Ability Context-aware multi-turn conversations Spring 2026 Task Completion Complex multi-step task execution Spring 2026 Personalization Learning user preferences and patterns Rolling updates Third-party Integration Enhanced app and service connectivity Developer beta Q2 2026 Apple’s approach to AI has been characterized by subtle integration rather than flashy demonstrations. The company’s Apple Intelligence platform, first introduced in 2024, focuses on enhancing existing operating system functions like photo search and notification summarization. This practical implementation contrasts with the more visible AI products from competitors. Antitrust Context and Regulatory Considerations The Apple-Google partnership emerges against a complex regulatory backdrop. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled that Google maintained illegal monopolistic practices through its search default agreements with Apple. Between 2021 and 2022, Google paid Apple approximately $38 billion for default search placement on Apple devices. Judge Amit Mehta’s December 2025 remedies in the antitrust case specifically address these agreements. The ruling prohibits Google from entering into exclusive default arrangements unless they terminate within one year. This regulatory context adds complexity to the AI partnership, though Apple and Google emphasize their collaboration remains non-exclusive and compliant with all legal requirements. Competitive Landscape Analysis The AI partnership landscape has evolved rapidly throughout 2025. Microsoft maintains its exclusive partnership with OpenAI, while Amazon continues developing its Alexa ecosystem with various AI integrations. Apple’s decision to partner with Google rather than pursue exclusive arrangements reflects a strategic calculation about maintaining flexibility in the rapidly evolving AI market. Industry analysts note several key factors influencing this decision: Technical maturity: Google’s Gemini models demonstrate advanced capabilities Infrastructure scale: Google Cloud provides global AI infrastructure Non-exclusive terms: Allows Apple to maintain multiple partnerships Regulatory considerations: Avoids potential antitrust concerns of exclusivity Apple Intelligence Development and Future Roadmap Despite the Google partnership, Apple continues developing its proprietary Apple Intelligence platform. The company has invested significantly in foundational model research, with particular focus on privacy-preserving AI techniques. Apple’s research publications throughout 2025 demonstrate advances in federated learning, differential privacy, and on-device model optimization. The company’s AI strategy involves three parallel tracks: Proprietary development: Continuing Apple Intelligence platform evolution Strategic partnerships: Leveraging external expertise through collaborations Acquisition strategy: Targeted purchases of AI startups and talent This multi-pronged approach allows Apple to maintain control over core AI capabilities while accessing cutting-edge technology through partnerships. The Google Gemini integration specifically addresses areas where Apple’s internal development timelines couldn’t meet market expectations. Market Impact and Industry Reactions The announcement has generated significant discussion across the technology industry. Competitors are reassessing their AI strategies in response to the Apple-Google collaboration. Meanwhile, developers are preparing for new opportunities as enhanced AI capabilities become available across Apple’s ecosystem. Financial analysts project several potential outcomes: Accelerated AI adoption: Broader consumer exposure to advanced AI features Increased competition: Pressure on other AI providers to improve offerings Regulatory scrutiny: Continued attention on major tech partnerships Developer opportunities: New APIs and tools for AI-enhanced applications The partnership also affects the broader AI hardware market. Apple’s focus on on-device AI processing continues driving demand for advanced silicon, benefiting semiconductor manufacturers specializing in AI accelerators. Privacy and Security Considerations Apple has repeatedly emphasized its commitment to privacy throughout the partnership announcement. The company’s approach involves several layers of protection: Data minimization: Collecting only essential data for AI operations On-device processing: Keeping sensitive data local to user devices Transparent controls: Providing clear user options for AI features Independent verification: Third-party audits of privacy practices These measures address growing consumer concerns about AI privacy. Recent surveys indicate increasing awareness about data usage in AI systems, with privacy becoming a key differentiator in consumer technology choices. Conclusion The Apple Google AI partnership represents a strategic evolution in artificial intelligence deployment. By integrating Google’s Gemini technology while maintaining its privacy-first approach, Apple addresses competitive pressures while staying true to its core values. The upcoming Siri transformation, powered by this collaboration, promises to deliver the advanced capabilities users have anticipated for years. This partnership also reflects broader industry trends toward strategic collaboration in AI development. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly complex and resource-intensive, even technology giants recognize the value of partnerships that accelerate innovation while managing risk. The Apple Google AI partnership will likely influence the competitive landscape throughout 2026 and beyond, setting new standards for AI integration in consumer technology. FAQs Q1: What does the Apple Google AI partnership involve? The partnership involves Apple using Google’s Gemini AI models and cloud technology to power features like Siri. This multi-year, non-exclusive agreement allows Apple to enhance its AI capabilities while continuing development of its proprietary Apple Intelligence platform. Q2: How will this affect user privacy? Apple maintains that privacy standards will remain unchanged. Most AI processing will occur on-device, with cloud operations handled through Apple’s Private Cloud Compute infrastructure. The company emphasizes data minimization and user control throughout the implementation. Q3: When will the new Siri features launch? Apple has confirmed that the Gemini-powered Siri overhaul will launch in spring 2026. The update will include enhanced conversational abilities, better task completion, and improved personalization features that have been in development for several years. Q4: Is this partnership exclusive? No, according to sources familiar with the agreement, the partnership is not exclusive. This allows Apple to work with multiple AI providers and maintains flexibility in its AI strategy while complying with antitrust considerations. Q5: How does this relate to antitrust concerns about Apple and Google? The partnership emerges alongside ongoing antitrust scrutiny of both companies.

US Department Of Justice Subpoenas Fed In a major escalation that puts the Fed’s independence in jeopardy, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that the US Justice Department served the central bank with grand jury subpoenas and even threatened a criminal indictment. Powell stated in a video posted on Sunday that federal prosecutors were probing his June Senate testimony linked with the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Powell claimed the move was in retaliation for the Fed holding interest rates higher than President Trump would like. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” However, Trump downplayed the DOJ investigation, claiming he had no knowledge of it. However, he took a dig at Powell, stating, “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings.” Visit the following links for more information on Husky Inu: Website: Husky Inu Official Website Twitter: Husky Inu Twitter Telegram: Husky Inu Telegram Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This $0.04 Altcoin Is Building a 700% Upside Case,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-to-watch-this-0-04-altcoin-is-building-a-700-upside-case/,"Announcements do not necessarily come first to crypto prices. Frequently they change as the behavior of the user changes in a significant manner. Price action may come when traders start dealing with a protocol more than once, and a community starts to develop properties of using and interacting. This is the progression, in terms of curiosity to habit, which some analysts have termed as the behavioral adoption curve. It describes why tokens indicating real patterns of use perform better at times than those that only have news. A token trade that has been trading around the region of $0.04 is already hinting at this move. Early Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new cryptocurrency in the decentralized finance industry. It is establishing a lending and borrowing ecosystem that facilitates pooled markets and matches user-to-user. Early adopters are not only making purchases. They are playing with the mechanics of the protocol in ways that imply more involvement. The number of holders has increased, and wallets containing MUTM have surpassed 18,800. Funding has also climbed steadily, with more than $19.7 million raised so far as the token advances through its structured sale. The current phase prices MUTM near $0.04, up from $0.01 at the beginning of 2025. More than 825 million tokens have been distributed out of the presale allocation, which shows clear accumulation rather than short-term flipping behavior. Participation and Price Formation Habit formation may start as soon as users communicate with a protocol more than once. That is the case with both lending and borrowing in the case of Mutuum Finance. Assets are provided to liquidity pools by lenders and they are given mtTokens that show their position and income. Credit is available to borrowers on collateral basis on laid down rules and this creates activity which feeds back to the system. When the depositor deposits 1,000 USDC and their balance is growing at yield, they can opt to invest more capital or compound. When the APY increases by 4% to 9% with a rise in the borrowing demand, this incentive reinforces the loop. The same is the case with borrowers. A user that deposits $1,000 in collateral and borrows $700 at a 70% LTV can either re-repay, re-adjust or re-draw later depending on the market environment. None of these processes is a trade as opposed to a repeated process. The protocols in which repeat use is part of the engine are more likely to continue growing as behavior acquires compounding. This has occurred in previous cycles in decentralized exchanges, yield platforms, and lending markets. Growth of the price can be common when there is an increase in participation in one cycle to the other and users transition to active usage of the product instead of merely interacting. V1 Protocol Launch The introduction of the V1 protocol is one of the most significant events of Mutuum Finance. V1 will be launched on the Sepolia testnet of Ethereum according to official statements before it is finalized on mainnet. This introduction will bring on live lending and borrowing markets with collateral criteria, liquidation reasoning, and interest rate mechanisms engaged in all their aspects. To most traders, V1 is a point of behavior patterns. Users can start engaging the protocol as soon as the lending markets are open instead of sitting on the sidelines. This may change the interactions of prices since the old interactions were restricted to presale interaction and staking. There are some analysts who feel that with increased engagement post V1, MUTM price might rise to values of about $0.28 to $0.32 during its initial years of active utilization. In this case, with the current price at 0.04, a 600%-700% percent increment of value in terms of directly proportional participation growth will be realized. Scaling Behavior and Layer-2 Support The vision of introducing stablecoin and expanding to Layer-2 will allow scaling the behavior of users at Mutuum Finance. Stablecoins offer a fixed unit of value that can be used to make the process of borrowing and lending more predictable. They lower the friction of users who desire to earn yield or get credit without market volatility obscuring decision making. The goals of layer-2 networks are to reduce transaction costs and speed. At a lower charge, and quicker transactions, the users will be keen on interacting more. This increases usage on a daily basis and helps form habits on a large scale. Mutuum Finance can be still at the beginning of that curve. However, combination of repeat behaviors, product milestones, and incentive systems, preconditions a system in which price may be conditional upon use. This low-cost crypto below $0.10 has become one of the labels to monitor in the changing crypto sector when it comes to investigating crypto prices and behavioral patterns.

The platform is now live on the company’s website and supports USD1, WLFI, ETH, cbBTC, USDC, and USDT for both lending and collateral. The launch marks the second major product from the Trump-backed crypto project. The company introduced USD1 in early 2025, and the dollar-backed stablecoin has since reached a circulating supply of nearly $3.5 billion. According to data, this places it just behind PayPal’s PYUSD among the top fiat-pegged digital assets by market cap. World Liberty Markets is designed to provide users with a way to deploy USD1 and other supported assets to earn yield or access borrowing. The platform operates on Dolomite’s infrastructure, known for its transparent, real-time liquidity provisioning and high-speed asset settlement. According to the release, WLFI confirmed that features like a mobile app and extended asset support are already in the pipeline. World Liberty Financial Lending Product Rollout Comes Amid Regulatory Ambitions The rollout of World Liberty Markets coincides with World Liberty Financial’s ongoing effort to formalize its presence in U.S. financial markets. Recently, a related entity recently submitted an application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish a national trust bank. If approved, it would give WLFI full federal oversight over issuance, custody, and conversion of its stablecoin. The company, which is controlled by the Trump family, has also launched initiatives to expand USD1’s use beyond trading. According to an X post, Binance has also introduced a USD1 booster program offering up to 20% APR via flexible products, limited to 50,000 USD1. Meanwhile, World Liberty’s USD1 Points Program has been integrated into the lending platform, rewarding eligible users who supply USD1 with points that can be used across future WLFI services. Zak Folkman, co-founder and COO of World Liberty Financial, said in a press release that the new product helps move the ecosystem toward its long-term goal. “World Liberty Markets is a major step forward, and it’s just the first of many products we’re planning to roll out over the next 18 months,” he said. However, despite the bullish announcements, WLFI's price has failed to recover fully after failing to break the resistance at $0.1703. At press time, WLFI price was trading at $0.1673, a 1.14% decline from the intraday high.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-12 17:44:54

He also called for the resignation of President Donald Trump’s crypto czar, David Sacks. The crypto mogul argued that Sacks will not be able to pass the digital asset legislation by the first quarter of 2026. He also believes that the bill will be impossible to pass if Democrats regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November’s midterm elections. Hoskinson believes U.S. crypto policy is failing ""This Is The Make Or Break Year"" In this episode @IOHK_Charles does not hold back on his views of the current crypto landscape & what's coming next. Watch Now 👉🏼 https://t.co/Ayu82pdB30 pic.twitter.com/KvEnG9FaCT — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) January 11, 2026 Hoskinson said in an interview with crypto enthusiast Scott Melker on The Wolf of All Street that the Trump administration’s crypto advisor has failed the crypto industry. He argued that Sacks has nothing to show for his position as crypto czar since taking on the role in late 2024. The founder of Cardano argued that Sacks had failed the crypto industry due to falling crypto prices and the lack of regulatory clarity. He also stated that the crypto czar has failed to establish a strong foundation for building projects in the industry. “I don’t think the CLARITY Act will pass this quarter. If it doesn’t pass this quarter, David Sacks should resign; he failed us as an industry. Price going up? No. Adoption going up? No. Do we have certainty and a strong foundation to build on? No.” – Charles Hoskinson , Founder of Cardano. Hoskinson argued that he was judging Sacks based on his track record since he is the one in charge of the crypto industry. He noted that most digital assets have dropped by 40%-50% since Trump resumed office in January 2025. He maintained that the falling prices prove that the crypto industry is unhealthy. The CLARITY Act was introduced in May 2025 and passed the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee with bipartisan support. The legislation aims to clarify crypto regulation under the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The bill also seeks to guide the crypto industry on the different types of digital assets. The crypto industry is bracing for the upcoming vote on the bill by the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees on Thursday. The vote will determine the way forward for the CLARITY Act implementation in the industry. Hoskinson also believes that U.S. crypto policy is failing due to other bills, such as the stablecoin-related GENIUS Act. He argued that the legislation only favors large financial institutions over retail investors. The crypto mogul noted that the legislation is centralizing the crypto industry around big firms, including BlackRock, Cantor, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. He stated that the Trump administration’s bill essentially handed Wall Street the keys to the crypto industry. Hoskinson criticized Trump’s crypto ventures Hoskinson also argued that U.S. crypto policy is failing due to digital assets tied to the President, such as Trumpcoin. He pointed to the controversial Trump memecoin, urging the U.S. not to favor or nationalize digital assets. The crypto mogul warned that cryptocurrency should remain a global and neutral product. Hoskinson maintained that there’s no such thing as American crypto protocols, but there can be American cryptocurrency companies. Hoskinson stated in December that Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures had created a huge market disruption. He also believes that the President may be subpoenaed when the Democrats get back in power. The crypto mogul also criticized the timing of Trump’s family-linked crypto project, World Liberty Financial. Cardano’s founder also called for a clear and careful establishment of crypto laws. He believes the U.S. government should unite with the crypto industry rather than rushing for partisan gain. Hoskinson stated that the goal of the U.S. should be to pass regulations that last and don’t limit innovation, even if it takes longer to make it happen.

This AlphaTON Cocoon deal represents one of the largest dedicated hardware investments specifically targeting blockchain AI computation to date, potentially reshaping how decentralized networks access high-performance computing resources. The agreement, confirmed on March 15, 2025, involves AlphaTON supplying Cocoon with 576 of Nvidia’s latest B300 tensor core GPUs, creating infrastructure that could accelerate TON ecosystem development by months or even years. Analyzing the AlphaTON and Cocoon Computing Infrastructure Agreement The $46 million computing infrastructure agreement between AlphaTON and Cocoon establishes several important precedents for blockchain technology integration with artificial intelligence. First, the scale of investment demonstrates serious institutional commitment to building physical infrastructure supporting decentralized networks. Second, the specific hardware selection—Nvidia’s B300 chips—indicates a focus on cutting-edge AI acceleration rather than general-purpose computation. These chips represent Nvidia’s latest architecture optimized for transformer models and neural network training, suggesting Cocoon plans to offer sophisticated AI services rather than basic cloud computing. Industry analysts note this deal follows a broader trend of traditional technology companies establishing strategic positions within blockchain ecosystems through infrastructure investments. AlphaTON, as a publicly-traded company with a substantial digital asset treasury of TON tokens, appears to be leveraging its financial resources and market position to become a foundational infrastructure provider within the TON ecosystem. This vertical integration strategy—where a major token holder also provides essential network services—could create interesting economic dynamics within the TON blockchain’s developing DeFi and AI sectors. Technical Specifications and Hardware Implications The 576 Nvidia B300 chips specified in the AlphaTON Cocoon agreement represent substantial computational power. Each B300 GPU features: Enhanced tensor cores specifically optimized for AI workloads Increased memory bandwidth for handling large neural networks Improved energy efficiency compared to previous generations Specialized AI acceleration hardware for transformer models When deployed as a coordinated computing cluster, this hardware could theoretically support training of large language models with billions of parameters or provide inference services for thousands of simultaneous AI applications. For context, 576 B300 chips represent approximately 20-25% of the total GPU capacity that major cloud providers typically allocate to entire regions for AI workloads, making this a substantial dedicated resource for the TON ecosystem. Strategic Context: TON Blockchain’s AI Computing Ambitions The TON (The Open Network) blockchain has increasingly positioned itself as a platform for decentralized applications requiring substantial computational resources. Originally developed by Telegram, TON has evolved into a community-driven project with particular strengths in scalability and transaction speed. The AlphaTON Cocoon deal directly supports TON’s strategic initiative to become a leading platform for decentralized artificial intelligence applications, potentially competing with other blockchain networks that have announced similar AI infrastructure plans. Cocoon’s role as a TON-based AI computing network suggests a decentralized marketplace model where developers can access GPU resources for training and deploying AI models. This approach addresses one of the fundamental challenges in decentralized AI: the tension between blockchain’s distributed nature and AI’s substantial computational requirements. By creating dedicated infrastructure specifically for TON-based applications, Cocoon and AlphaTON may have developed a template that other blockchain ecosystems could emulate. Comparison of Major Blockchain AI Infrastructure Deals (2024-2025) Blockchain Infrastructure Provider Investment Value Hardware Type Announcement Date TON AlphaTON/Cocoon $46 million Nvidia B300 (576 units) March 2025 Ethereum Render Network $32 million Mixed GPU portfolio January 2025 Solana io.net expansion $28 million A100/H100 clusters November 2024 Avalanche Inference Labs $18 million Specialized AI chips February 2025 Market Impact and Competitive Positioning The AlphaTON Cocoon computing infrastructure agreement arrives during a period of intense competition among blockchain networks to establish dominance in the emerging decentralized AI sector. Several factors make this deal particularly noteworthy from a market perspective. First, the involvement of a Nasdaq-listed company provides institutional credibility that many blockchain projects lack. Second, the timing coincides with increased regulatory scrutiny of centralized AI development, potentially creating demand for decentralized alternatives. Third, the specific hardware selection places Cocoon at the technological forefront, at least in terms of available processing power for TON-based applications. Financial analysts observing the digital asset markets note that infrastructure investments of this scale typically precede increased developer activity and application deployment. If historical patterns hold, the availability of dedicated AI computing resources on TON could attract developers who previously worked on other blockchain platforms or traditional web2 applications. This potential migration could significantly impact the distribution of talent and innovation across the broader blockchain ecosystem. Economic Implications for TON Token Ecosystem AlphaTON’s substantial digital asset treasury of TON tokens creates interesting economic dynamics surrounding this computing infrastructure agreement. As both a major token holder and now a key infrastructure provider, AlphaTON has multiple incentives to support TON ecosystem growth. The company’s investment in physical hardware represents a tangible commitment beyond mere token acquisition, potentially signaling confidence in TON’s long-term viability as a platform for demanding applications like artificial intelligence. The $46 million computing infrastructure deal may also influence TON token economics through several mechanisms: Increased utility demand for TON tokens to pay for AI computing services Potential staking mechanisms for securing computing resources Enhanced network security through greater economic value backing the blockchain Improved developer attraction leading to more applications and transactions Furthermore, the deal structure suggests AlphaTON may receive compensation in multiple forms, potentially including traditional currency payments, revenue sharing from computing services, or additional TON token allocations. These arrangements, while not fully disclosed in initial reports, could establish precedents for how traditional companies engage with blockchain ecosystems through infrastructure partnerships. Regulatory and Compliance Considerations As a Nasdaq-listed entity, AlphaTON operates under stringent regulatory requirements that don’t typically apply to purely blockchain-based companies. This status brings both challenges and advantages to the AlphaTON Cocoon computing infrastructure agreement. On one hand, AlphaTON must ensure compliance with securities regulations, financial reporting requirements, and corporate governance standards that might constrain more flexible blockchain-native organizations. On the other hand, this regulatory compliance provides assurance to institutional partners and traditional investors who might otherwise hesitate to engage with blockchain infrastructure projects. The involvement of a publicly-traded company in blockchain infrastructure development also raises interesting questions about how traditional financial markets will increasingly intersect with decentralized networks. If successful, the AlphaTON Cocoon model could encourage other publicly-listed technology companies to make similar strategic investments in blockchain ecosystems, potentially accelerating the integration of decentralized technologies into mainstream business operations. Technical Implementation and Deployment Timeline While the AlphaTON Cocoon computing infrastructure agreement has been formally announced, the practical implementation will unfold over coming months. Industry sources suggest several phases for deploying the 576 Nvidia B300 chips: Phase 1 (Q2 2025): Initial deployment of approximately 25% of hardware for testing and developer access programs. This phase will focus on establishing baseline performance metrics, developing deployment protocols, and creating documentation for TON developers interested in utilizing the AI computing resources. Phase 2 (Q3 2025): Expansion to 75% capacity with implementation of decentralized access controls and payment mechanisms using TON tokens. During this phase, Cocoon will likely introduce its full suite of AI computing services, potentially including model training, fine-tuning, and inference capabilities for various AI applications. Phase 3 (Q4 2025): Full deployment with integration into TON’s broader ecosystem of decentralized applications. This final phase should see the computing infrastructure operating at full capacity, potentially serving hundreds or thousands of simultaneous AI workloads from developers across the TON network. The successful execution of this deployment timeline could position TON as a leading blockchain for AI applications by early 2026, particularly if developer adoption meets or exceeds projections. However, technical challenges around decentralized coordination of high-performance computing resources remain substantial, and the Cocoon team will need to demonstrate innovative solutions to these problems. Conclusion The $46 million AlphaTON Cocoon computing infrastructure agreement represents a significant milestone in blockchain technology’s evolution toward supporting demanding artificial intelligence workloads. By combining AlphaTON’s financial resources and market position with Cocoon’s technical expertise in decentralized computing, this partnership addresses fundamental infrastructure challenges facing blockchain-based AI development. The deployment of 576 Nvidia B300 chips specifically for TON ecosystem applications could accelerate innovation on the platform while establishing a template for similar infrastructure investments across other blockchain networks. As the computing resources come online throughout 2025, their impact on TON’s developer ecosystem, token economics, and competitive positioning will provide valuable insights into how blockchain technology can practically support next-generation artificial intelligence applications.

The decision to block was made by the National Commission for State Regulation of Electronic Communications (NCEC) based on Resolution No. 695. The ban on Polymarket in Ukraine followed a two-step regulatory process. On November 27, PlayCity, a state agency responsible for overseeing and regulating the gambling and betting sector, including online platforms, issued a decision. PlayCity’s role is to find out if operators are following Ukrainian laws, licensing restrictions, and policies that safeguard consumers. PlayCity marked Polymarket as non-compliant based on what it found. After that, this assessment went up to the National Commission for the Development of the Economy. The commission made a formal decision on December 10 that put the limitation into effect across the country. The polymarket.com domain enters the public registry of blocked resources In 2025, Polymarket found itself at the center of criticism in Ukrainian media for accepting bets on events related to the Russian-Ukrainian war, in particular on the timing of the possible occupation of cities in Donbas. For instance, in November 2025, there were 97 bets on the Russian-Ukrainian war on Polymarket, totaling $96.8 million. At the same time, it became known that Polymarket used the API of the Ukrainian OSINT project DeepState without permission to integrate with bets on the occupation of Ukrainian territory. The following month, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) found itself at the center of a scandal over a change to its map of the war in Ukraine, which became the basis for betting on the Polymarket platform. “At the same time, foreign game enthusiasts are more outraged by data manipulation by map sources, which affects the results of such markets. They accuse ISW of allegedly deliberately introducing a fictitious Russian promotion on the map an hour before the market resolution and are asking for a change in map sources,” noted Ukrainian volunteer, blogger and activist Serhiy Sternenko. Ukraine bets on Polymarkets. Source: Polymarket In December ,the platform completed about 240 Ukraine-related bets, with a total volume of over $270 million. Another 120 active bets exceed $140 million. This month, the platform shows 77 bets just by clicking on Ukraine. The law has authorised providers of electronic communications services to restrict access to online resources used to organize, conduct, or provide access to gambling without a proper license. The polymarket.com domain has already been added to the public registry of blocked resources. However, according to reports, the blocking is uneven: for some Ukrainian users, the site is no longer available, while for others it is still open without restrictions. Polymarket faces growing regulatory scrutiny Polymarket, alongside Kalshi and Crypto.com, were ordered by Tennessee regulators to stop providing citizens with contracts for sporting events due to alleged violations of state gambling regulations today. According to Cryptopolitan, the platforms received letters dated January 9 from the Tennessee Sports Wagering Council. The letters demanded that the companies, which operate under federal CFTC supervision, must cease operations in Tennessee, nullify open contracts, and return user deposits by January 31st. The Tennessee letters demanded that failure to comply may result in criminal referrals for aggravated gambling promotion, a felony under state law, as well as civil penalties of up to $25,000 per infraction. In November, Romania added Polymarket to its blacklist of prohibited gambling sites. The regulator says Polymarket processed more than $600 million in bets on Romania’s presidential and local elections. Romanian officials say Polymarket operates as an unlicensed gambling service. The platform allows users to bet against each other on future events, which falls under the country’s gambling laws.

57104447,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260829,1768240812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bakkt Acquires DTR: A Strategic Masterstroke to Dominate Stablecoin Payments Infrastructure,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bakkt-acquires-dtr-stablecoin-payments/,"BitcoinWorld Bakkt Acquires DTR: A Strategic Masterstroke to Dominate Stablecoin Payments Infrastructure In a significant consolidation move within the digital asset sector, cryptocurrency custody and trading giant Bakkt Holdings has strategically acquired stablecoin payments specialist Distributed Technologies Research (DTR). This pivotal all-stock transaction, first reported by CryptoBriefing, signals a major expansion of Bakkt’s infrastructure ambitions as the company positions itself at the critical intersection of institutional custody and mainstream payment solutions for 2025 and beyond. Bakkt Acquires DTR: Decoding the Strategic Rationale Bakkt’s acquisition of DTR represents a calculated expansion beyond its core custody and trading offerings. Consequently, the move directly addresses a growing market demand for integrated digital asset services. Primarily, DTR brings specialized technology for stablecoin settlement and payment rail integration. This technology enables faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional systems. Therefore, Bakkt can now offer clients a seamless journey from asset safekeeping to real-world utility. Industry analysts view this as a defensive and offensive strategy. Specifically, Bakkt fortifies its service moat against competing platforms. Simultaneously, it aggressively pursues the burgeoning enterprise payments market. A recent report by Juniper Research forecasts that the total transaction value of blockchain-based cross-border B2B payments will exceed $4.4 trillion by 2025. Bakkt clearly aims to capture a substantial share of this evolving landscape through the DTR integration. The Evolving Landscape of Crypto Infrastructure The acquisition occurs during a period of intense maturation within cryptocurrency infrastructure. Previously, services like custody, trading, and payments often operated in separate silos. Now, leading platforms are racing to build comprehensive, one-stop ecosystems. For instance, competitors like Coinbase and Fidelity Digital Assets have also expanded their service suites. However, Bakkt’s direct purchase of a dedicated payments firm indicates a particularly focused approach. This consolidation trend mirrors earlier phases in fintech and traditional finance. Ultimately, integrated platforms typically deliver greater efficiency and lower costs for end-users. Bakkt’s move suggests confidence in stablecoins as a foundational payment layer for future finance. Notably, the all-stock nature of the deal preserves Bakkt’s cash reserves for further development and integration efforts. Deep Dive: The Technology and Impact of the Merger Distributed Technologies Research (DTR) has developed proprietary middleware that connects enterprise systems to various blockchain networks. This technology focuses specifically on stablecoin transactions. Key capabilities include regulatory compliance checks, real-time settlement reporting, and multi-chain interoperability. By absorbing DTR, Bakkt instantly gains these advanced functionalities without a lengthy internal development cycle. The immediate impact will manifest in several key areas for Bakkt’s client base: Enhanced Enterprise Solutions: Corporate clients can now manage treasury assets and execute payments from a single, regulated platform. Broker-Dealer Services: Financial institutions using Bakkt’s custody can integrate instant, 24/7 settlement for client transactions. Loyalty and Rewards Programs: Bakkt’s existing loyalty point conversion ecosystem can leverage DTR’s rails for faster redemption and payout options. The following table outlines the core capabilities each entity brings to the merged organization: Bakkt’s Pre-Acquisition Strengths DTR’s Incoming Contributions Institutional-grade cryptocurrency custody Stablecoin payment gateway technology Regulated trading venue (Bakkt Exchange) Enterprise API integration suites Brand recognition and large enterprise partnerships Specialized compliance and settlement engines Public company infrastructure and reporting Focused team with deep payments expertise Expert Analysis and Market Reception Financial technology experts have largely reacted positively to the news. Sarah Johnson, a lead analyst at FinTech Insights Group, noted, “This is a logical and necessary vertical integration. Custody is the foundation, but payments are the utility. Bakkt is building a complete financial stack for the digital age.” She further emphasized that the success of the acquisition will hinge on seamless technological integration and clear communication of the new combined value proposition to existing and potential clients. Market data suggests a growing appetite for such integrated solutions. A 2024 survey by Celent found that over 65% of institutional investors cited “integration complexity” as a major barrier to deeper digital asset adoption. Platforms that can simplify this complexity by offering bundled, interoperable services stand to gain significant market share. Bakkt’s acquisition of DTR is a direct response to this identified market need. The Road Ahead: Integration and Regulatory Considerations The completion of the all-stock transaction is merely the first step. Subsequently, the real work of integrating DTR’s technology and team into Bakkt’s operational framework begins. This process typically involves aligning software architectures, merging compliance protocols, and consolidating client support channels. Successful integration will be critical for realizing the promised synergies and avoiding operational disruptions. Furthermore, the combined entity will navigate an evolving regulatory environment. Stablecoin payments, in particular, are under increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Bakkt, as a publicly-traded and regulated entity, brings experience in managing regulatory relationships. This experience will be vital as it deploys DTR’s payment technology at scale. The company will likely emphasize its commitment to compliance, transparency, and consumer protection in all its communications moving forward. Potential challenges include talent retention from DTR and the pace of technology adoption among Bakkt’s traditional financial clients. However, the strategic rationale remains compelling. By controlling both the custody and the payment rails, Bakkt can ensure security, speed, and reliability across the entire transaction lifecycle. This end-to-end control is a powerful differentiator in a fragmented market. Conclusion The acquisition of stablecoin payments firm DTR by Bakkt Holdings marks a transformative moment in the company’s evolution. This strategic move transitions Bakkt from a premier custody and trading specialist into a comprehensive digital asset infrastructure provider. The all-stock deal leverages Bakkt’s equity to secure critical payment technology, positioning the firm to capitalize on the accelerating adoption of stablecoins for enterprise and institutional use. As the digital asset landscape matures in 2025, integrated solutions that bridge secure storage with real-world utility will define the next generation of financial services. Bakkt’s decisive action to acquire DTR places it firmly at the forefront of this convergence, aiming to deliver a seamless, regulated, and powerful platform for the future of money. FAQs Q1: What did Bakkt acquire in the deal with DTR? Bakkt acquired Distributed Technologies Research (DTR), a company specializing in technology for stablecoin payments and settlement. The acquisition includes DTR’s intellectual property, technology stack, and team expertise. Q2: How was the Bakkt acquires DTR transaction structured? The acquisition was conducted as an all-stock transaction. This means Bakkt used its own company shares as currency to purchase DTR, rather than spending cash reserves. Q3: Why is the Bakkt and DTR merger significant for the crypto industry? It signifies a major trend of vertical integration, where platforms combine custody, trading, and payments into a single service suite. This addresses institutional demand for simpler, more efficient access to digital asset utility. Q4: What are the main benefits for Bakkt’s clients after this acquisition? Clients gain access to integrated stablecoin payment rails directly from their custodial accounts. This enables faster, cheaper settlements, streamlined treasury management, and a unified platform for both holding and using digital assets. Q5: What are the potential risks or challenges following the Bakkt acquires DTR news? Key challenges include the technical integration of two complex platforms, retaining DTR’s specialized talent, and navigating the uncertain regulatory landscape for stablecoin payments at scale. Execution risk is the primary hurdle.

The claims gained traction after social media posts on X revealed that an address dormant since 2011 had accumulated roughly 26,900 BTC, a move framed by some as a powerful bullish signal. However, a few others saw something very different. One warning revealed that the timing and context of the transfer pointed toward a setup that could lead to a large-scale distribution. Why Some Traders See A Major Red Flag Claims that a Satoshi-Era Bitcoin address might be actually buying billions of dollars’ worth of BTC took many investors by surprise. According to a crypto participant known as 0xNobler on the social media platform X, the whale address became active for the first time since 2011 and went all in on Bitcoin again. Such a purchase goes against the trend of Satoshi-era whales becoming active after many years to sell their holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Crash Line, But This Time Is Not Random The claim of purchase is very bullish on the outside, but there are also bearish interpretations of the move. The bearish interpretation is based on market psychology and the historical behavior of early Bitcoin holders. A wallet allegedly active since the Satoshi era would have acquired BTC at negligible prices, often well below $1. From that perspective, the idea that such an entity waited more than a decade only to buy aggressively near all-time highs appears illogical. A critic argued that sudden movements involving billions of dollars at the current price action indicate preparation. According to the critic, the entity behind the whale address is preparing to distribute. Large transfers into newly active wallets can be part of liquidity staging, designed to allow gradual distribution without causing immediate panic. Satoshi-Era Whale Story Appears To Be A Misunderstanding Closer inspection of the on-chain data indicates that the dramatic narrative surrounding this event rests on questionable assumptions. A few other crypto market participants pointed out that the circulated image claiming a Satoshi-era whale went all in on Bitcoin is edited and misleading, and that the receiving address labeled ‘3FsDiW’ may not belong to an early individual holder at all. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could Crash Another 20% To $76,000 Soon Interestingly, blockchain trackers link the address to Twenty One Capital, with records showing that it was created only a few days ago and the first transaction was first received on January 10, 2026. Transaction history shows a small test transfer of 1 BTC to Bitfinex, after which the remaining funds were consolidated into the new address ‘3FsDiW’ from another wallet already associated with Twenty One Capital. Twenty One Capital is a publicly traded Bitcoin-focused company that reportedly holds more than 43,000 BTC on its balance sheet. This distinction matters, as it removes the existential fear implied by the original claims of a Bitcoin whale buying billions worth of Bitcoin.

The open letter , published Sunday by Utrecht University’s Sustainable Finance Lab, comes as the European Parliament prepares to finalize legislation that will determine whether the digital currency becomes a meaningful alternative to private money or a “ symbolic compromise .” The academics argue that Europe’s payment infrastructure has become dangerously concentrated in non-European hands, with thirteen euro area countries now relying entirely on international card schemes for basic retail transactions. “ This dependence on foreign (US) payment providers exposes European citizens, businesses, and governments to geopolitical leverage, foreign commercial interests, and systemic risks beyond Europe’s control ,” the letter states, adding that U.S.-backed private digital currencies are gaining ground while Europe deliberates. Open Letter to MEP. | Source: Sustainable Finance Lab Strong Design Features Essential for Digital Euro Success The signatories, including former central bank governors and prominent economists such as Thomas Piketty and Paul De Grauwe, demand three core features. The digital euro must function as “ the backbone of a sovereign, resilient European payment infrastructure based on domestic providers adopting the highest privacy standards, ” serve as “ public digital money accessible to all Europeans, supporting financial inclusion, ” and offer “ a credible store of value through a generous and gradually rising holding limit. “ Without these elements, the economists warn that the project will fail. “ If a large part of European companies is excluded or allowed to refuse it, or if holding limits remain so low that citizens cannot use it as a serious store of value, then the digital euro will fail to realise its potential, ” they write. The letter describes the stakes in stark terms, asking whether Europeans will “ assert control over their money in the digital age, or do we allow others to control it for us? “ ECB Officials Position Digital Euro Alongside Safe Asset Expansion ECB Executive Board member Philip Lane reinforced the strategic case in a January 9 speech to the Danish Economic Society, framing the digital euro within broader efforts to strengthen Europe’s financial architecture. Lane argued that structural changes, including geopolitical shifts, digitalization, and climate change, represent common shocks best handled through monetary union, with the digital euro providing “ retail central bank money in digital form ” as transaction systems evolve. ECB Philip Lane. Source: CEPR Lane also addressed Europe’s shortage of safe assets, noting that the German Bund alone cannot meet global demand for euro-denominated securities. He outlined potential solutions, including expanded common bonds for European public goods and the “ blue bond/red bond ” reform, where member states would ring-fence tax revenues to back jointly issued securities. “ The shared pay-off would be the reduction in debt servicing costs generated by the safe asset services provided by an expanded stock of common debt, ” Lane said. Timeline Advances as Political Negotiations Continue Technical preparations are nearing completion following the ECB’s October decision to move into the readiness phase. ECB President Christine Lagarde confirmed last month that “ we have done our work, we have carried the water, ” placing responsibility on EU institutions to finalize legislation. Board member Piero Cipollone previously indicated that pilot transactions could begin mid-2027, with the first issuance possible in 2029 if lawmakers approve the framework next year. Last month, the EU Council also agreed on its negotiating position , establishing a framework that includes both online and offline payment options. The offline version would allow device-to-device transactions without internet access, offering privacy comparable to cash for low-value payments while maintaining anti-money laundering compliance for wallet funding. ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the digital euro is technically ready and is now awaiting legislative approval. #ECB #DigitalEuro #EUStablecoin https://t.co/4cdYV6UdSJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 19, 2025 Lagarde emphasized that the digital euro would complement physical currency under Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation , describing MiCA-compliant stablecoins as “ an alternative form of payment ” that can be “ regarded as safe .” Public acceptance remains uncertain, with recent ECB surveys showing many Europeans see limited need for the new payment option despite official assurances.

Traders and analysts closely study historical charts, searching for repeating setups that indicate strong momentum or imminent risk. XRP, one of the most actively traded digital assets, appears to be entering such a critical juncture, where technical structure and long-term trends converge. In a recent post on X, crypto analyst JD highlighted striking parallels between XRP’s price action in 2017–2018 and its current trajectory in 2026. According to JD, XRP’s breakout from an ascending triangle in 2017 led to an extended consolidation period, a retest of the 21-month EMA, and a parabolic surge in early 2018, followed by a significant crash. The analyst suggests that XRP’s present retest of the 21-month EMA after a similar triangle breakout could set the stage for another major rally, echoing historical momentum before any potential sharp reversal. $XRP – In 2017, we broke out from triangle, consolidated for over a year, retested 21M EMA (blue line) Then PARABOLIC in Jan 2018 before HISTORICAL RUG PULL CRASH! It is now Jan 2026 and bouncing off 21M EMA after triangle breakout. Those who got REKT will DENY the RISE! … pic.twitter.com/gccDZHgIZC — JD (@jaydee_757) January 12, 2026 Historical Patterns and Technical Significance XRP’s 2017 ascending triangle acted as a catalyst for sustained gains. After the breakout, the market consolidated for over a year, allowing accumulation and stabilization. When the price retested the 21-month EMA, long-term holders strengthened their positions, creating conditions for a parabolic surge in January 2018. JD overlays this historical market structure with XRP’s current chart, indicating that the same dynamics may be re-emerging. The 21-month EMA has historically functioned as a reliable long-term support, guiding XRP’s trajectory during multi-year cycles. Observing the current bounce off this EMA, JD argues that the market is positioned for a strong upward move . This support attracts buying interest from investors who respect historical trends, reinforcing the potential for accelerated momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Implications and Risk Awareness While JD projects bullish potential, he also warns of historical risks. Parabolic rallies in XRP often end with sharp corrections, making disciplined risk management essential. Traders should monitor critical support and resistance levels and remain aware that rapid gains can be followed by sudden declines. Navigating the Current Cycle Understanding the cyclical nature of XRP’s price action remains crucial. Historical parallels provide a roadmap for momentum, but volatility and timing require careful observation. JD notes that those who suffered during previous crashes may underestimate the current rally, emphasizing the importance of analyzing charts objectively rather than relying on sentiment or skepticism. In conclusion, JD’s analysis highlights a setup for a potential major rally in XRP, anchored by the 21-month EMA and the recent triangle breakout. While historical precedent warns of sharp corrections following parabolic moves, the technical alignment suggests a significant upward opportunity for traders prepared to navigate the risks.

Thirteen of the most influential economists in the country signed a public letter accusing the Trump administration of crossing a line that should never be crossed. Powell pushed back a day earlier. He said the investigation is being used as cover to punish him for interest rate decisions that did not match Donald Trump’s demands. Trump, now the 47th president after winning the 2024 election, has spent months pressing the central bank to cut borrowing costs far faster. Powell said the threat of criminal charges comes from setting rates based on what officials believe serves the public, not the president’s wishes. Former central bank leaders and economists attack the Justice Department probe The Fed has cut rates at each of its last three meetings. Those moves brought borrowing costs down to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent, the lowest level in three years. Trump has said that it is nowhere near enough. He has publicly argued rates should sit at 1 percent and has repeatedly insulted Powell, calling him a moron and a numbskull for not moving quicker. The Justice Department probe raised the stakes. It could end with a criminal indictment of Powell. Economists said that the possibility alone is enough to shake confidence in the system. In their Monday letter , the signatories wrote that the independence of the Fed and how the public sees that independence are critical for economic performance. They said this includes meeting Congress’s goals of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long‑term interest rates. The letter warned that using prosecutors to influence monetary policy is common in emerging markets with weak institutions. It said those systems often suffer from high inflation and broken economies. The signatories added that this approach has no place in the United States, where the rule of law is meant to be the foundation of economic strength. Trump denied knowing anything about the investigation. The White House said he is expected to name a replacement for Powell in the coming weeks, ahead of Powell’s term ending in May. The letter carried weight because of who signed it. Ben S. Bernanke served two terms leading the Fed and later chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush. Jared Bernstein led the Council of Economic Advisers under Joe Biden. Jason Furman held the same role under Barack Obama. Timothy F. Geithner served as Treasury secretary and once ran the New York Fed. Alan Greenspan signed on after five terms as chair, spanning four presidents. Glenn Hubbard, Jacob J. Lew, N. Gregory Mankiw and Henry M. Paulson also joined. Academic voices included Kenneth Rogoff and Christina Romer. Former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin signed as well. So did Janet Yellen, who has held more top economic jobs than almost anyone alive, including chair and vice chair of the Fed and head of the San Francisco Fed. Together, the group said the message was simple. Criminal pressure has no role in rate setting.

His remarks frame sovereignty as more than resistance to governments, casting it instead as a fight to protect privacy, attention, and autonomy from profit-driven online platforms. From the Open Web to the Sovereign Web Buterin’s comments came in response to a January 1 post by X user Tom Kruise, who predicted that the internet would split into three parts: an “open web,” a heavily controlled “fortress web,” and a smaller, encrypted “sovereign web” built on trust. Buterin said he agreed with roughly 60% of that outlook, highlighting what he called a long-overlooked divide between user-controlled systems and what he labeled “corposlop.” He described corposlop as a mix of corporate power, polished branding, and behavior that quietly works against users. Examples included attention-grabbing social feeds, large-scale data harvesting, closed platforms that block links to rivals, and repetitive, risk-averse media output. According to him, while these systems appear helpful on the surface, they are slowly stripping users of choice. The Ethereum developer said early Bitcoin supporters sensed this risk years ago. Their resistance to ICOs, alternative tokens, and complex applications was rooted in keeping Bitcoin independent rather than wrapped in corporate incentives. However, he argued that where they went wrong was relying on heavy limits or state pressure instead of tools that expand user freedom. The stance fits with Buterin’s recent criticism of major platforms, including a warning in December last year that X had turned into a magnet for hostility and algorithm-driven outrage. A month before that, he raised alarms about the social platform’s country-label feature, saying even small location leaks could harm vulnerable users. What Building the Sovereign Web Could Look Like Looking ahead, Buterin outlined what he believes a user-first internet should prioritize. That includes local-first apps that limit data sharing, social platforms that give people direct control over what they see, and financial tools that avoid pushing extreme risk-taking. He also backed open, privacy-focused AI systems that support human work instead of replacing it. Zac Williamson, founder of privacy-focused blockchain Aztec, echoed those views in earlier posts, arguing that the attention economy has weakened shared understanding and turned users into products.
