BNB Could Find a Deal with the United Arab Emirates, Similar to Toncoin As it is known, Toncoin (TON) announced today that it has entered into a collaboration with the United Arab Emirates and that those who make a payment of $ 35,000 and stake $ 100,000 in TON for three years will have a golden visa valid for 10 years in the United Arab Emirates. The development in question was also retweeted by Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram, the company behind Toncoin. Related News: BREAKING: This Altcoin Has Reached an Agreement with the United Arab Emirates and Will Grant Gold Visas to Token Holders After this, Binance founder Chanpeng Zhao evaluated the development and said that if this is true, they will try a similar initiative for BNB. In other words, in the near future, BNB holders can receive a golden visa from the United Arab Emirates if they pay a certain amount of money and additionally stake their BNB for a certain period of time. Of course, this depends on whether Changpeng Zhao and other BNB officials reach an agreement with the United Arab Emirates. However, Changpeng Zhao is still not sure about the authenticity of Toncoin’s announcement. According to Zhao, such an initiative should have come with a government partnership and announcement. Zhao said that it could still be true, but he has not received direct confirmation. *This is not investment advice.

However, these purchases have had no major impact on the price of the leading digital asset. This has sparked concerns among market participants. Many are wondering why BTC has been stuck within a tight range since it hit an all-time high (ATH) in late May. A recent report by the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant revealed the reason for the weak price momentum despite persistent institutional demand, which analysts say is currently not enough. BTC Stalls Despite Institutional Demand According to CryptoQuant, BTC purchases from U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries belonging to firms like Strategy have declined this year compared to the period from November to December 2024. ETF purchases have decreased from 86,000 BTC in early December to 71,000 BTC in mid-May, and are currently at 40,000 BTC. The trend represents a 53% decline over this period. At the same time, Strategy’s acquisitions have also dropped from 171,000 BTC in December to 16,000 BTC currently. This shows a 90% plunge over the period. Although institutional purchases and ETF flows have kept BTC above $100,000 for a while, further declines could slow price gains. This could be exacerbated by the fact that ETF and institutional buys represent a fraction of the overall BTC demand, which seems to be contracting. At the market’s peak in December, ETF and institutional purchases represented 33% of total Bitcoin demand growth. These entities purchased no more than 257,000 BTC out of the total 771,000 BTC. This indicated that the Bitcoin market had a bigger and unobservable demand coming from other sources. Overall Demand is Contracting Currently, the overall demand for BTC is contracting , having declined by 895,000 BTC over the last 30 days. This metric needs to expand for a sustainable price rally to occur. However, the demand level from institutions right now is not enough to trigger that expansion. CryptoQuant stated that Bitcoin’s annual growth chart reflects how ETF and institutional purchases account for only a portion of demand. Apparent demand has also contracted by 857,000 BTC, significantly offsetting the expansion of ETF and institutional demand (377,000 BTC and 371,000 BTC, respectively). “The bottom line is that ETFs and MSTR’s Bitcoin purchase, while overall positive for Bitcoin price gains, are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs,” the market intelligence firm added.

But is this optimism justified, or is it another echo of hype in an already volatile market? JacktheRippler’s Bold Forecast JacktheRippler is known for his high-conviction predictions and passionate advocacy for XRP. In past statements, he has envisioned XRP reaching triple- and even four-digit price levels, suggesting that holders could see life-changing wealth. #XRP IS ABOUT TO PRINT MULTI MILLIONAIRES! pic.twitter.com/FsFlMa5hBk — JackTheRippler ©️ (@RippleXrpie) July 6, 2025 He had previously made headlines by declaring that 100 XRP could one day be worth $1 million, a projection that assumes XRP reaching $10,000 per token, an extreme but symbolic figure of his confidence in the asset’s future potential. His most recent statement echoes that same belief, suggesting that XRP is about to create a new wave of multimillionaires. While many in the XRP community share his enthusiasm, market analysts advise investors to balance hope with realistic expectations. Institutional Interest and Market Momentum XRP’s current valuation reflects not only investor sentiment but also growing institutional interest. Analysts from Bitget have predicted that XRP could reach $5 by late 2025 , driven by institutional adoption, Ripple’s expanding partnerships, and integration into cross-border payment systems. Ripple’s push for a U.S. banking charter, the launch of RLUSD stablecoin, and increasing engagement with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) add weight to the asset’s long-term value proposition. However, technical indicators show mixed signals. XRP has recently faced resistance above $2.30 and is vulnerable to downside pressure if it fails to hold above $2.20. Some analysts warn that if bearish patterns take hold, XRP could retrace to $1.60 or lower. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Can XRP Create Multimillionaires? JacktheRippler’s assertion depends heavily on XRP achieving unprecedented price levels. To become a multimillionaire solely from XRP, an investor would need to hold a significant amount of the asset—or the price would need to skyrocket well beyond previous highs. A realistic target of $5 to $10 per XRP could deliver substantial returns, but it may not be enough to “print” multimillionaires unless backed by large holdings. Still, if key catalysts align, such as a favorable SEC resolution , the approval of XRP-based ETFs, and broader adoption of Ripple’s technology, then XRP’s upside could surprise even cautious investors. In this scenario, early believers like JacktheRippler may be proven right. JacktheRippler’s statement captures the high hopes and bullish sentiment that continue to surround XRP. While the road to creating multimillionaires is uncertain and depends on regulatory and market-driven factors, the potential for significant gains remains. XRP is at a critical juncture, and whether it fulfills its boldest forecasts or not, it is poised to play a major role in the evolving crypto-financial ecosystem.

Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024.

In October 2023, SPX’s value spiked to $0.023 under bullish control, which was a considerable growth trajectory, but still, it remained far from market attention. December of 2023 saw a low price of $0.008, which was quite low as compared to the price in October as per crypto market historical data. SPX6900 saw a stagnating price movement from January to May 2024, only to rise periodically to $0.015. In September 2024, SPX6900 gained an enormous 5600% from September 12 to October 14, reaching $0.913, resulting in a massive market capitalization. The token made higher spikes till November 7, 2024, adding significantly to its market cap; however, the token’s price has deteriorated afterwards. On November 21, SPX6900 stooped to $0.450, losing 50% of its value, which made holders cautious. However, the token regained its lost value and ended the year at $0.856. The meme token entered January 2025 with a price tag of $0.866, but it soon jumped to $1.55 as its circulation and acceptance increased.

Scott said, “President Trump’s going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don’t move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level.” Those letters are expected to go out Monday. Trump warns trading partners with Monday letter deadline Scott made clear that August 1 isn’t a suggestion or another deadline to kick down the road. “We are saying this is when it’s happening,” he said. “If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that’s your choice.” Scott rejected the idea that this was just another extension or political posturing. The 90-day pause that Trump announced in April, after revealing sharp new tariffs on most major partners, expires this Wednesday. The clock is out. The temporary pause was originally meant to give time for renegotiations. But that window’s closed now. “They’ll start to pay on August 1. The money will start to come into the United States on August 1, in pretty much all cases,” Trump told reporters on Friday. Scott confirmed those payments will start unless something changes this week. Asked if any deals are close, Scott hinted at movement but didn’t name countries. “I would expect to see several big announcements over the next couple of days,” he said. That would put any major updates right before the Wednesday cutoff.

Ethereum Eyes $4,000 as Bullish Momentum Builds Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength as it approaches the psychological $4,000 barrier, supported by growing optimism in the broader crypto market and increasing institutional interest.

Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Amid Growing Demand The project is in Phase 5 presale that is currently selling tokens at $0.03.

47663381,https://thecoinrise.com/galaxy-digitals-mike-novogratz-issues-bold-bitcoin-call/,1751839204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/47663381.jpeg,Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz Issues Bold Bitcoin Call,https://thecoinrise.com/galaxy-digitals-mike-novogratz-issues-bold-bitcoin-call/,"Mike Novogratz, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Galaxy Digital, has made a bold call to investors in the cryptocurrency space. In response to a post on X, Novogratz claimed that there is growing pressure on Jerome Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. This, he maintained, could impact the country’s fiat currency value, hence the need to invest in crypto. Mike Novogratz On Political Interference and Bitcoin as Safe Haven Notably, Novogratz says market participants need to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, as a hedge. He believes that Bitcoin will serve as a safe haven asset for investors if the U.S. dollar weakens due to political pressure on Powell or reckless monetary policy. Given that Bitcoin is decentralized with a limited supply, Novogratz has urged investors to “Buy BTC” as it will become more valuable in the future. According to the Bitcoin advocate, Bill Pulte’s call for Powell’s removal from office, an influential figure with political clout, will not end well. He considers the call to be heading in a financially dangerous direction. Primarily, Novogratz believes that politicizing the Federal Reserve could lead to rate cuts that would negatively impact the dollar. However, such a move to undermine the Fed supports his advocacy for Bitcoin. Is Political Tensions Threatening the Fed’s Independence? For clarity, Jerome Powell’s reluctance to further cut interest rates has sparked hostility towards him. Some Republicans in the U.S. are calling for his resignation . This includes Bill Pulte, who claims there is evidence incriminating Powell. Regardless, Novogratz considers the allegations against Powell as characteristic of a “ Banana Republic move ” which could further weaken the nation’s currency. According to Novogratz, potentially, the move could reduce confidence in U.S. institutions or trigger political instability. Powell had earlier emphasized that interest rate decisions must be based on facts and data, not political predispositions. Amid mounting pressure, some in the financial sector have argued that if Powell gives in, it could compromise the Federal Reserve’s independence. Community Reacts to Novogratz’s Call However, reactions have trailed Novogratz’s post on social media. A user, John Lilic, opines that nothing justifies using $2.5 billion for a renovation. Another user, Jefferson, alleged that Powell was not factual with Congress on the renovation and might face grave issues.

With fresh presales, important tech rollouts, and ETF launches, a few stand out as the best crypto to buy right now. This list skips empty hype and focuses on real signals that matter. From scalable projects to major upgrades, these four choices show what real growth can look like. If you’re ready to get in early on what could bring strong gains through 2025, start with this rundown of the best crypto to buy right now: BlockDAG, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. 1. BlockDAG: Limited-Time $0.0016 Entry Fuels Massive User Rush BlockDAG sits firmly among the best crypto to buy right now, thanks to its $0.0016 offer that runs until August 11. The project has raised over $332 million so far and sold more than 23.6 billion coins. With a locked-in $0.05 launch price, buyers can aim for gains of up to 3,025%. That’s a solid draw for anyone searching for the best crypto to buy right now. Unlike many presales, BlockDAG (BDAG) already has real traction. Its X1 mining app has over 2 million active users. The hardware side is on track, too, with the X30 and X100 mining rigs shipping on July 7, followed by the X10 on August 15. Its upcoming listings on big exchanges like MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, and LBANK add extra trust. On top of that, security audits from CertiK and Halborn confirm the project’s solid foundation. With short-term price drivers and a working ecosystem, BlockDAG stands out as the best crypto to buy right now for anyone wanting a fair entry with big upside. 2. Solana: ETF Approval and 2 M Stakers Fuel Momentum Solana (SOL) is back on the radar as one of the best cryptos to buy right now, especially after launching its U.S. staking ETF on July 2. This new REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF lets buyers tap into SOL’s staking rewards, which is a first in the U.S. for crypto funds. SOL’s network growth adds to its case as the best crypto to buy right now. Wallets holding over 0.1 SOL have reached 11.4 million. Plus, Sol Strategies, a fund focused on Solana, is aiming for a Nasdaq uplisting, boosting trust in the ecosystem. Prices have bounced to around $149.55 after dipping to $145. If SOL can break through the $157–160 resistance, analysts expect more upside. Strong infrastructure and new financial products make Solana a clear pick among the best crypto to buy right now. 3. XRP: EVM Sidechain and Smart Supply Moves XRP’s price action might look calm, moving around $2.19 between $2.15 and $2.20, but its fundamentals tell a different story. Ripple completed its July 1 escrow shuffle, unlocking 500 million XRP and relocking 400 million to manage supply. What really makes XRP one of the best cryptos to buy right now is the live launch of the XRPL EVM sidechain. This upgrade brings Ethereum-like smart contracts to XRP’s network, opening up new use cases. Analysts predict XRP could push above $3 if the ETF market gains wider approval. While a climb to $5 will take more time, the building blocks are there. With smart contract support, careful supply controls, and real use cases, XRP deserves its spot on any list of the best crypto to buy right now. 4. Dogecoin: Loyal Community and Breakout Pattern Ahead Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to attract attention as one of the best cryptos to buy right now, trading at around $0.163 after rebounding from $0.157 support. Technical charts show a double bottom pattern, which many see as a bullish signal. If DOGE breaks through the $0.175 – $0.180 range, it could target $0.192 – $0.205 next. If not, it might slide back toward $0.138 – $0.150. Despite the lack of major tech updates, its loyal community keeps it strong among the best crypto to buy right now. Some chart watchers believe DOGE could touch the $1 mark again, with projections up to $1.17 based on Fibonacci patterns. A bounce from its long-term support adds weight to the argument that Dogecoin remains the best crypto to buy right now for traders who like big swings. In Summary BlockDAG, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin each stand out as the best crypto to buy right now because they bring more than just price swings; they have clear user traction, strong tech upgrades, and solid community support. Whether you want early-stage potential like BlockDAG’s $0.0016 entry or proven projects like SOL, XRP, and DOGE, timing is key. Watch their roadmaps, track their levels, and position smartly for the next big run.

But behind every decentralized bet is a cryptocurrency making it all work. In 2025, the top coins are built for scalable, fair, and fast blockchain gambling. In this review, we break down the best cryptos for betting in 2025 chosen for their real-world utility, low transaction costs, network stability, and widespread adoption across Web3 gambling ecosystems. 1. USDT (Tether): The Reliable Stablecoin for Betting Tether (USDT) is the go-to cryptocurrency for players who want consistency. As a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, USDT eliminates price volatility, allowing users to wager with confidence that their bankroll’s value won’t shift with the market. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Accepted across most Web3 casinos and sportsbooks Available on multiple chains: Ethereum, Tron, BNB Chain, Polygon, and more Near-instant transfers with minimal fees, especially on TRC-20 and BEP-20 networks Ideal for casual bettors, high-volume players, and professional sharps Whether you're placing single bets or streaming real-time wagers, USDT offers stable value and broad utility—making it the foundation for scalable and low-risk gambling. 2. ETH (Ethereum): The Engine of Fair, Smart-Contract Betting Ethereum remains the smart contract king, powering thousands of decentralized gambling apps (dApps) and casinos. With ETH, every bet can be automated, provably fair, and trustless—no human interference, no rigged games. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Smart contract support for provably fair games and trustless payouts Compatible with all major DeFi wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) Layer 2 scaling (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism) reduces gas costs significantly Integrated with a broad ecosystem of prediction markets and GameFi dApps ETH is ideal for players who want transparency and fairness baked into the code, not just promised in the terms and conditions. 3. SOL (Solana): Ultra-Fast, Ultra-Cheap Bets at Scale Solana has exploded in popularity due to its lightning-fast throughput and ultra-low fees, making it perfect for high-frequency, micro-betting, or mobile-first casino environments. It’s also fueling a new wave of lightweight Web3 gambling apps. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Transaction speed: 65,000+ TPS, confirmed in seconds Fees: Fractions of a cent, ideal for small, rapid wagers Growing number of Solana-native casinos and sportsbooks Smooth mobile UX and easy integration with Phantom wallet SOL gives players a real-time gambling experience, even during network congestion, without burning through fees. 4. TRX (Tron): A Quiet Giant for Cost-Efficient Gambling Tron may not make headlines daily, but it's a powerful tool for cost-effective blockchain betting. Thanks to extremely low transaction costs and its popularity among gambling dApps, TRX is the currency of choice in regions where affordability matters most. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Minimal fees, even for high-frequency play Widely used in TRON-based betting platforms and lotteries Fast transaction confirmations Seamless USDT support via TRC-20 TRX is excellent for players in emerging markets or anyone seeking fast and frictionless transactions with no surprises. 5. BNB (Binance Coin): Utility Meets Liquidity BNB has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem beyond Binance. On BNB Chain (BSC), it supports a thriving set of gambling dApps that combine low gas fees with smart contract capability. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Ultra-low transaction fees on BSC Hundreds of BNB-powered casinos and sportsbooks Excellent DeFi wallet support and user liquidity Supports BEP-20 stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and BUSD BNB blends utility and user familiarity, making it a smart bet for seasoned DeFi gamblers.

With community sentiment, viral trends, and celebrity brand power driving short-term price action, investors are asking the obvious: which one has the momentum to pull ahead? This analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , a crypto-native communications agency specializing in narrative positioning and performance-led media strategy. OFFICIAL MUSK (MUSK) Eyes a Leap Beyond Its Resistance Source: tradingview OFFICIAL MUSK (MUSK) is currently trading between five ten-thousandths of a cent to roughly two thousandths of a cent. It's trying to push past the nearest resistance of about three-thousandths of a cent. If successful, it might jump towards a strong point almost midway to a half-cent. This move would mean a potential growth of several times the current price. However, hitting its second resistance could imply a massive spike, nearly multiplying its value by about seven times. The coin's movement depends on breaking these levels, as its averages suggest a promise for upward shifts if momentum continues. Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) Holds Steady Amid Turbulent Crypto Market Source: tradingview OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) trades between $8.66 and $9.65 today. Its price has slipped over 21% in the past month. Yet, it has climbed almost 130% over six months. This shows both volatility and growth potential. If TRUMP pushes past the resistance level at just over $10, a steady path to $11 could boost its value by around 15%. Its current statistics suggest a neutral market vibe, neither overbought nor oversold. While the coin's journey has been rocky, its recent performance hints at potential gains if the broader market strengthens. Traders eye support at just over $8, which could act as a safety net for now.

Conclusion The battle between OFFICIAL MUSK and OFFICIAL TRUMP highlights how meme coins now move in step with public narratives, political sentiment, and online engagement. While both tokens have carved out distinct audiences and market behavior, sustained traction will depend on how well each community mobilizes. As the meme coin cycle matures, projects looking to stay ahead will need more than a recognizable name. Narrative precision, timing, and visibility across high-impact media channels are quickly becoming essential.

Grab the Next 1000x Meme Coin — Get Ready for $AGNT Listing Now Dogecoin's Journey: Is the Meme Coin Ready for a Comeback? Dogecoin began in 2013 as a joke, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the ""Doge"" meme. Created by engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to Bitcoin. Despite its playful origins, Dogecoin has grown into a significant cryptocurrency with a dedicated community. Using the Scrypt algorithm, Dogecoin operates on a peer-to-peer network with an unlimited supply. Its faster block time allows quicker transactions than Bitcoin. Celebrity endorsements, especially from Elon Musk, have boosted its popularity and kept it in the public eye over the years. Historically, Dogecoin has been volatile. It hit an all-time high in May 2021 during a hype-driven rally but has since experienced fluctuations. By 2025, it continues to be influenced by market trends and the enthusiasm of its supporters. Price predictions for Dogecoin are mixed. Some forecasts see potential growth, like CoinCodex's projection for significant increases by 2030. Others are more cautious, noting competition from other cryptocurrencies and possible regulatory challenges. Long-term predictions range from moderate gains to ambitious highs. In today's market, Dogecoin still appeals to many. Its strong fan base and cultural impact keep it relevant. While it faces challenges, its unique story and widespread recognition make it a coin to watch. As the crypto landscape evolves, Dogecoin's journey is far from over. Shiba Inu's Journey: From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a meme coin hoping to mimic Dogecoin's hype. It gained quick fame thanks to mentions by Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on Ethereum, SHIB began as a simple payment token but soon expanded its ambitions. The creators launched a decentralized exchange and an NFT project, adding real utility to SHIB. These moves attracted more users and set SHIB apart from other meme coins. The ecosystem grew with ventures into the metaverse, games, and merchandise. By 2025, SHIB has experienced notable price movements. After its rise in 2021, it hovered around $0.00001. Predictions suggested it could reach up to $0.0000526 by 2025. This reflects optimism about SHIB's projects and community support. Bullish indicators point to potential growth, but competition is fierce. New meme coins like BONK and PEPE pose challenges. SHIB's evolution and innovation are key to maintaining its market position. SHIB's future hinges on its ambitious projects and community. While past performance isn't a guarantee, developments up to 2025 indicate SHIB could stay influential in the crypto world. PEPE Coin: The Meme That Took Over the Crypto World In the early 2000s, a cartoon frog named Pepe, created by Matt Furie, became an internet sensation. This meme has now evolved into a cryptocurrency sensation known as PEPE Coin. Embracing its meme origins, PEPE Coin has captured the hearts of many with its simplicity and strong community spirit. PEPE is a deflationary meme coin built on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. The project's goals are straightforward and fun, summarized in three phases: Meme, Vibe and HODL, and Meme Takeover. Unlike others, PEPE doesn't make lofty promises. It stays true to its meme roots, focusing on community and transparency. By 2024, PEPE had soared to an all-time high of $0.00002825. After this peak, it faced a significant correction, losing about 68.59% of its value. This volatility is typical in the crypto world, especially for meme coins. However, the dedicated community believes in its potential for a rebound. Looking ahead, various predictions paint an optimistic future for PEPE. By 2025, forecasts suggest it could reach up to $0.000055. Predictions for 2030 are even more hopeful, with some expecting the coin to hit as high as $0.000159. By 2050, there's speculation that PEPE could achieve remarkable heights, reflecting its enduring appeal. PEPE Coin's blend of meme culture and crypto technology makes it a unique player in the market. Its simple approach and strong community support position it well in the current cycle. While the crypto space is unpredictable, PEPE's journey shows that a meme can become a movement. Bonk (BONK): Solana's Meme Coin with Big Dreams Bonk (BONK) is a meme cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain. Launched in December 2022, it brings fun and community to Solana's fast, low-cost network. Unlike Solana's native token SOL, which also handles governance, BONK focuses solely on user transactions. BONK offers liquidity and simple transfers within Solana. Its straightforward purpose attracts users seeking easy transactions without governance complexities. As alternatives to Ethereum gain traction due to fees and speed, BONK positions itself as a user-friendly option. Since launch, BONK's price has grown significantly. In the bull market after its release, the token surged alongside SOL. By 2025, BONK had increased over 770% from its initial price, showing strong community interest. Currently, BONK seems attractive due to promotions and benefits for Solana users. But some experts warn about its anonymous founders and simple white paper. Potential investors should research thoroughly due to these concerns. Future price predictions vary. Some forecasts suggest BONK could reach $0.00009368 by the end of 2025, with continued growth in following years. By 2030, optimistic projections place BONK much higher, indicating potential for long-term gains. Conclusion While established memecoins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK have attracted many traders, their short-term potential appears limited. As the market evolves, investors may seek alternatives that offer greater opportunities for significant gains. Enter Codename:Pepe crypto, the ultimate undercover agent bringing true intelligence to the crypto scene. Unlike others, it doesn't pretend—it provides real assistance in making money amid the meme coin frenzy.

47665795,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=761334,1751841947,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47665795.jpeg,BRICS pushes AI data rules as it remains yet to make any progress on de-dollarization,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/brics-ai-rules-no-progress-de-dollarization/,"Leaders from BRICS met in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday and demanded controls on how artificial intelligence uses data, while still getting nowhere on the cross-border payments system they’ve been promising since 2015. According to Reuters , the bloc released a draft statement calling for protection against unauthorized data scraping and demanding fair compensation from tech companies training AI on unlicensed content. These demands come as AI models built by US and European firms continue to mine global content with little oversight or payment. The two-day BRICS summit included multiple closed-door meetings on AI and digital regulation. But behind that digital talk was yet another stall-out on a bigger goal: removing the US dollar from trade between BRICS nations. Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, along with the newer members like Iran, have now spent a decade floating a cross-border payments system. Brics fails to deliver on payment system after decade of talk At the summit’s opening in Brazil, BRICS members recommitted to the so-called BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative, which has been under discussion since 2015. They assigned finance ministers and central bank heads to continue debating it. A survey from Brazil’s central bank was circulated, but no decisions were made, and no deadlines were set. The delay comes as President Donald Trump’s policies hammer the global position of the dollar. The greenback had its worst Q1 performance since 1973. Trump’s trade war and pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve rattled investors and weakened confidence in American assets. With Wall Street bleeding, emerging markets had a clear opening, but BRICS couldn’t act fast enough. All ten BRICS nations have agreed on the need for non-dollar trade, but technical issues keep getting in the way. Three officials said central banking infrastructure in some member states is still not ready. Integrating systems between countries with non-convertible currencies, like Iran’s rial or Russia’s ruble, has slowed everything. And sanctions on Russia and Iran have raised legal and compliance concerns for the rest of the bloc. Even deciding how to share the cost of new infrastructure is causing friction. Two officials said there’s disagreement on how to build, pay for, and govern any shared payment network. The bloc’s recent expansion only made things harder. One member said some countries don’t even believe the benefits of a unified system are worth the cost. Their existing bilateral trade deals work just fine without extra tech. None of the officials wanted to speak publicly, but confirmed that progress will remain slow. China expands yuan as Trump issues 100% threat While others drag their feet, China is pushing ahead. Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China, announced new plans to expand the yuan’s reach. In a recent speech, Pan said China’s financial markets would open further to global investors. Beijing is also launching its first domestic currency futures, aimed at competing with products in Chicago and Singapore. Its payment system, CIPS, is now expanding to include more foreign banks. Trump, now in his second term in the White House, isn’t staying quiet. He’s threatened to slap 100% tariffs on any BRICS country that tries to bypass the dollar in trade. That threat has added urgency to talks within BRICS, but hasn’t stopped them. Officials said the dollar-retirement discussions are still going — even if painfully slow. The bloc also introduced a proposal for the New Investment Platform (NIP), meant to ease reliance on dollar-denominated financing. But it’s already stuck in early-stage debates. A document seen by Bloomberg allegedly showed that countries can’t agree on how to run it or what exactly it would fund. “Given the variety of approaches and proposals raised, and the complex nature of the issues involved, further technical dialogue will be essential,” the document said. Brazilian official Tatiana Rosito, who works in the Finance Ministry, said the goal is to avoid converting through dollars when trading. “Banks say that, depending on the period in which you carry out the operation, they may need to use the rate converting renminbi to dollars,” Tatiana said in an interview. “But the goal in the end is you one day don’t have it.” Tatiana added that with enough volume in trade and investments, it may become possible to have direct rates between local currencies like real-renminbi, real-rupee, and real-rand. But there’s no timeline. No commitment. Just hypotheticals. The BRICS statement also pointed out that interest rate hikes in wealthy economies are deepening debt crises in developing ones. “High interest rates and tighter financing conditions worsen debt vulnerabilities in many countries,” it said. To address this, BRICS announced a Multilateral Guarantees Initiative called BMG, which will be rolled out inside the New Development Bank (NDB). The program won’t need new capital contributions for now. Its goal is to boost credit access in member nations and across the Global South, especially those struggling to raise funds in hard currency markets.

So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million.

ONDO Price Structure & POL Charts Signal July Breakouts,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-buyer-battles-unlocks-50m-coins-daily-ondo-price-structure-pol-charts-signal-july-breakouts/,"The crypto space is heating up fast, and traders are chasing every signal with urgency. Right now, the ONDO price structure and POL price update are flashing setups that could lead to serious gains. ONDO has defended its support zone around $0.55 and looks ready to pop, while POL is clinging to the crucial $0.18 level that could trigger a breakout toward $0.21. But the real excitement is building around BlockDAG (BDAG) . With its $0.0016 presale entry locked until August 11 and 50 million BDAG coins up for grabs daily through its Buyer Battles, BlockDAG isn’t just catching attention, it’s creating serious urgency. With $332 million already raised, this might be the best crypto to buy now before the next leg up. ONDO Eyes $1 as Key Price Level Holds Firm The ONDO price structure has held strong support at $0.55, a level that’s shaping up as a launchpad. With consolidation tightening, traders are betting on a breakout toward $0.70 if volume picks up. Momentum is building. If ONDO pushes past nearby resistance at $0.80, it could open the door for a rally toward $1. The current price structure looks solid, and holding above $0.55 keeps the bullish scenario in play. All eyes are on whether the breakout fires this week or next. POL Sets Up for a July Rally With $0.18 in Focus According to “World Of Charts,” the POL price update shows a clear bullish setup forming. The token is holding just above $0.18, and if that support sticks, traders could see a 12% to 13% move toward the $0.21 level. That target lines up with a key descending trendline and the appearance of a rounded bottom pattern. But it all hinges on $0.18. If POL stays above it, the setup remains intact. If it drops below, the breakout case fades. The next few candles are critical for traders aiming to ride a fast upside move. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Creates Daily Winners! Forget the usual presale routine, BlockDAG is changing the game. Its Buyer Battles feature brings live action into the mix, turning every day into a fresh opportunity. Each day, 50 million BDAG coins are set aside. If they aren’t fully bought, they go straight to the top buyer of the day. That’s right, the person who times it best or buys most during a given day can walk away with tens or even hundreds of thousands of BDAG. And with the presale price fixed at $0.0016 until August 11, far below the $0.05 launch rate, the ROI potential is massive. So far, BlockDAG has pulled in over $332 million and sold more than 23.6 billion coins. Traders are already using strategies like stacking smaller buys or pouncing during low-volume windows to win those daily rewards. This isn’t about how much you spend, it’s about how smart you are when you spend it. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11 is closing in fast. With the presale window narrowing, FOMO is hitting hard. Even if you don’t win the daily battle, you still lock in BDAG at its cheapest rate. That’s why so many are calling this one of the most unique and rewarding entries in the market right now. Closing Thoughts The ONDO price structure has held strong at $0.55, keeping the path open toward $0.70 and possibly $1. At the same time, the POL price update suggests a 12% to 13% breakout to $0.21, if it holds firm above $0.18. But BlockDAG is doing more than showing signals; it’s delivering results in real time. With over $332 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and a unique Buyer Battles setup offering 50 million BDAG in daily rewards, this presale isn’t slowing down. Add in the $0.0016 limited-time price and the August 11 Global Launch release, and it’s clear why many see BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy now .

47666859,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73571,1751842995,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Bollinger Bands Signal Incoming Big Pump,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-bollinger-bands-signal-incoming-big-pump/,"XRP is on the verge of what could be a significant price move , as one of the most reliable technical indicators—the Bollinger Bands—has tightened to levels not seen since November 2024. This signal, highlighted by renowned analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO, is now capturing the attention of traders and investors across the crypto space. In a chart shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO pointed out that XRP is currently trading in the narrowest range since its explosive breakout in late 2024. That historical move saw XRP rally from below $0.70 to over $3.00 in just weeks. With a similar pattern forming now, speculation is growing that a new rally may be imminent. Tight Bollinger Bands: A Signal of Imminent Volatility Bollinger Bands are designed to measure market volatility. When these bands contract sharply, forming what’s known as a “squeeze,” it signals that price volatility has dropped to unusually low levels. This often precedes a large breakout as the market builds momentum behind the scenes. The #XRP Bollinger Bands are extremely tight. BIG PUMP INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/btbtZkR8pb — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 6, 2025 Currently, XRP’s Bollinger Bands on the 3-day chart are the tightest they’ve been in over eight months. Historically, this kind of compression has led to dramatic price shifts, most often in the direction of the prevailing trend. With XRP maintaining strength above the $2.00 level, many analysts believe an upward breakout is the most likely outcome. Echoes of November 2024’s Rally The current setup bears a striking resemblance to the consolidation seen just before XRP’s massive rally in November 2024. At that time, the market also experienced a period of unusually low volatility, followed by a surge that took XRP to multi-year highs. Now, in July 2025, the same pattern is unfolding. The price has been trading within a narrow band between $2.00 and $2.50, and the Bollinger Bands have once again constricted, suggesting that another major move is around the corner. As history often rhymes in financial markets, traders are paying close attention to what could be the start of a new bullish wave. Strong Fundamentals Reinforce the Setup Beyond the chart signals, XRP’s ecosystem has continued to grow in strength. Ripple’s recent developments, particularly the launch and integration of RLUSD, have added new layers of utility for the digital asset. RLUSD, Ripple’s fully-backed stablecoin, is now accepted as collateral by Hidden Road , a leading institutional prime broker. This positions XRP as a key component in cross-margin trading strategies that bridge traditional and digital finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Such real-world utility and institutional adoption bolster investor confidence and provide a strong foundation for long-term growth. As more financial platforms explore the integration of XRP and RLUSD into their liquidity models, the asset’s market relevance continues to deepen. Anticipation Builds Across the Crypto Market With XRP holding firm and Bollinger Bands signaling suppressed volatility, market sentiment is becoming increasingly bullish. Traders are now watching closely for a decisive breakout above the $2.50–$2.70 range, which could ignite a surge of momentum and trigger widespread buying interest. STEPH IS CRYPTO emphasized that this kind of setup rarely goes unnoticed for long. The market is coiling, and a breakout, likely to the upside, may be just a matter of time. XRP Poised for a Breakout All signs are pointing to an imminent move for XRP . The tightening of Bollinger Bands, historical patterns, and growing ecosystem utility form a compelling bullish narrative. As traders prepare for the next leg of price action, one thing is clear: XRP is not a token to ignore right now. A major breakout may be just around the corner.

The swift sellout underscores strong community interest and bullish sentiment surrounding the project. Source: Codename:Pepe X account Next on the roadmap is the Token Generation Event (TGE) and exchange listing. Within the community, anticipation is building that $AGNT could soar as much as 1000x from its presale launch price.

According to its developers, the AI framework is designed to: Spot Emerging Meme Coins Analyze Market Sentiment Deliver Actionable Trading Insights Optimize Automated Trading The development team is actively enhancing both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the platform evolves in tandem with the broader crypto ecosystem.

Grab the Next 1000x Meme Coin — Get Ready for $AGNT Listing Now TRON Takes Off: Why TRX Is the Crypto to Watch in 2025 and Beyond TRON is a public blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. It's open-source and works smoothly with Ethereum. This means developers can easily move their apps from Ethereum to TRON. The platform aims to make transactions fast and cheap, giving users and developers a better experience. TRON uses a Proof-of-Stake system. This involves 27 super representatives who validate transactions and earn rewards. New blocks are added every three seconds, much faster than some older blockchains. This speed allows TRON to handle more transactions efficiently. In early 2018, TRX, the coin that runs on the TRON network, hit an all-time high of $0.3004. Then, in December 2024, it surged nearly 100% to reach $0.4407. Although it has dipped since then, many are hopeful. With Donald Trump's second term, there's buzz about crypto growth. His World Liberty Financial platform bought $4.66 million worth of TRX in January 2025. Experts have positive predictions for TRX. By the end of 2025, it could reach up to $0.45. In 2026, it might climb to $0.60, and by 2030, it could hit $1.20. These numbers suggest strong potential for growth. TRON's technology and recent developments make it stand out in the crypto market. Its fast transactions and compatibility with Ethereum position it well for future success. Many are considering TRX as a promising investment in the current market cycle. Binance Coin's Future: Will BNB Soar Again? Binance Coin (BNB) powers the Binance exchange, one of the world's largest crypto platforms. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum network, BNB moved to the Binance Smart Chain for better speed and lower fees. It helps users trade hundreds of tokens and pay for services like travel and loans. BNB has strong potential due to its many uses. Binance buys back and burns BNB tokens each quarter, reducing supply and possibly increasing value. The coin also benefits from the popularity of new meme coins on the platform, boosting trading volumes since 2024. In December 2024, BNB hit an all-time high of $793.35. Although it dipped slightly, it's still up 135% over the past year. Analysts like Altcoin Sherpa believe BNB can break past previous highs due to strong trading patterns. However, some experts, like W.E. Messamore, caution about regulatory challenges that could impact its growth. The current market cycle shows promise for BNB. Predictions suggest it could surpass $1,000 in 2025 and reach up to $1,600 by 2026. By 2030, forecasts vary widely, with some expecting prices over $7,000. The long-term outlook depends on factors like market trends and regulatory developments. Overall, BNB's performance and growth potential make it a coin to watch. Its expanding use cases and Binance's strong position in the market could lead to new heights in the years ahead. Conclusion In the current bull run, established coins like TRX and BNB may offer limited short-term gains. Their growth is steady but might not match the rapid returns that newer projects can achieve. Codename:Pepe crypto presents a compelling opportunity for those seeking maximum profits. It leverages real artificial intelligence to identify promising meme coins, predict market trends, and provide early trading signals. With a capped supply and a community-driven model, it offers the potential for significant returns and active participation in its mission.

BNB, the native coin of the Binance ecosystem, has proven its worth by supporting a vast array of utilities on the Binance exchange and beyond. It continues to hold significant promise despite regulatory hurdles and market fluctuations.

The state-run newspaper RIA Novosti reported that the ministry is working on the plan with the Federal Tax Service and the Ministry of Digital Development. The registry, the ministry claims, will serve as a central database of all the equipment used for cryptocurrency mining in the nation. Crypto Mining Rigs: Russians Must Register Hardware Russia’s Deputy Minister of Energy, Petr Konyushenko, told RIA Novosti that the ministry has sent its draft document to regions with high levels of crypto mining activity. A power station in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Lodo27 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Konyushenko said the registry will let Moscow “precisely identify” who in the nation is “using electricity to mine cryptocurrencies.” This will allow regulators and tax officials to ensure miners are complying with mining-related laws. It will also help boost tax revenues, the ministry claimed. Konyushenko said: “This is a step toward legalizing the industry and reducing illegal energy consumption.” While legal crypto mining is on the rise in Russia, so too is the illegal sector. Scores of industrial crypto miners are known to be operating all across the country. Many use illegal connections to power grids. And others use subsidized power intended for residential households to power their data centers. The database will require all miners to submit rig serial numbers and device models. They will also have to submit details on other mining-related equipment. The Energy Ministry and the Industry Ministry first proposed creating a national crypto mining equipment registry back in February this year . A Russian crypto miner shows off his equipment. (Source: Chudesniy Kitai!/RuTube) Critics Unsure About Ministry Plans Government officials said a unified registry of “equipment without which cryptocurrency mining is impossible” was needed. The idea is not without its vociferous critics. These include the lawmaker Anton Gorelkin, one of the architects of Russia’s crypto mining laws. Gorelkin said it was “unclear how exactly this registry will help combat illegal mining.” He added that Moscow already has the “necessary tools to identify miners who use electricity illegally.” Legalize Black-market Rigs, Says Lawmaker The lawmaker also explained that Moscow needed to focus its efforts on helping miners legalize crypto mining equipment bought using sanctions-evading “shadow schemes.” Russia is regularly switching off mobile internet connections in large swaths of the country for security reasons https://t.co/Hv1uW7cWzn — Bloomberg (@business) July 3, 2025 This would help miners “legalize” mining rigs they buy on the black market and “quickly add them to the registry,” Gorelkin said. The media outlet RBC reported that officials (including customs officers) are considering issuing an “amnesty” for crypto miners who have “no other choice” than to buy rigs through underground channels in a bid to evade sanctions regimes. Earlier this month, police in Sayansk announced they had shut down an illegal crypto mining farm fitted with 240 mining rigs. Officers said the farm was using enough electricity to power 2,000 apartments. Also this month, police in St. Petersburg said they seized an undisclosed number of crypto mining rigs operating in a warehouse in an industrial zone near the iconic Mitrofanievsky Highway.

Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are both expected to formally withdraw their appeals, a move that would bring immediate finality to Judge Analisa Torres’s landmark 2023 ruling. As highlighted by Jungle Inc Crypto News on X, this outcome requires no further court action. Once the appeals are dropped, the case is over, no retrial, no revisions, and no delays. Judge Torres’s Ruling Becomes Final Judge Torres’s ruling in July 2023 delivered a partial win for both sides. The judge ruled that XRP is not a security in itself, and Ripple’s sales of XRP on secondary markets through programmatic means did not constitute a breach of securities laws. However, the court found that Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP were unregistered securities offerings. This split decision gave both the SEC and Ripple grounds to appeal. If Ripple and the SEC drop their appeals, it’s over. Judge Torres’s ruling becomes final immediately — no retrial, no revisions, no extra steps. Marc Fagel (former SEC Regional Director) confirmed: The moment the appeals are withdrawn, her decision stands as law. … pic.twitter.com/9Q4aMNLvSn — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) July 5, 2025 Following a denied settlement attempt, Ripple and the SEC seem poised to move by dropping their appeals. Once the appeals are formally withdrawn, Judge Torres’s opinion becomes the final word on the matter. No further input or signature from the judge is necessary. The ruling becomes legally binding and will stand as a precedent in future cases involving digital assets. No More Legal Delays or Courtroom Drama As Jungle Inc Crypto News succinctly stated, “No more delays. No more court drama.” This sentiment captures the relief that many XRP holders and industry participants feel after years of legal uncertainty. The end of the appeals process marks the legal resolution of a case that began in December 2020 and sent shockwaves across the crypto sector. The decision will no longer be subject to modification or reversal. Ripple can now operate without the overhang of active litigation, and XRP can move forward with its legal status clearly defined in the United States. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Defining Moment for XRP and U.S. Crypto Regulation With the case concluding, Judge Torres’s ruling will become a foundational legal reference in future disputes over how U.S. securities laws apply to digital assets. The distinction her court made—that the manner of token sales matters more than the token itself- could shape regulatory enforcement and even influence how lawmakers draft future crypto legislation. For XRP, this could pave the way for renewed exchange listings, deeper institutional adoption, and enhanced global integration into payment systems. For Ripple, the decision affirms its business model while clearing a major regulatory hurdle, positioning the company to accelerate its operations and partnerships. What Happens Next? At this stage, all that remains is for Ripple and the SEC to submit their notices of appeal withdrawal. Once filed, the case will be formally closed, and no further legal proceedings will follow. As Jungle Inc Crypto News pointed out, “Her decision stands as law,” signaling a definitive end to years of courtroom battles. With both parties now ready to move on , this moment marks a rare sense of closure in an industry often marked by regulatory ambiguity. For Ripple, for XRP holders, and the broader crypto ecosystem, dropping the appeals will represent not just the end of a case, but the beginning of a new chapter.

Infrastructure platforms are gaining prominence for their groundbreaking solutions, while a fresh player is capturing attention through viral trends. This piece delves into how these entities are influencing the market during this bullish surge. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Hyperliquid: Revolutionizing DeFi with Speed and Zero Fees Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform transforming decentralized finance (DeFi). It has built its own Layer 1 blockchain from the ground up, focusing on speed and scalability. With its unique HyperBFT consensus mechanism, transactions are fast and secure.

As a self-funded project, Hyperliquid stays true to its vision without outside influence. In today's market, where speed and low costs matter, Hyperliquid's features make it an attractive option. Its focus on efficiency and transparency sets it apart in the DeFi space.

By blending the reliability of traditional finance with the efficiency of blockchain technology, Ondo tokenizes stable, income-generating real-world assets. This means high-grade financial products become accessible to more people.

While many cryptocurrencies face ups and downs, Ondo's focus on real-world assets and compliance could make it an attractive option for those interested in both traditional finance and blockchain innovation.

At the same time, another digital asset is making waves with a $14 million presale amid shifting market trends. XYZVerse is gaining traction as investors reevaluate their positions. This situation highlights changing dynamics in the crypto market and raises questions about what comes next. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.

The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with excitement over XYZVerse, a potential game-changer in the meme coin sector which is showing signs of significant growth, with a presale already hitting the $14 million mark.

With aims to drive real-world adoption and incentivize XRP integration across borders, the initiative signals a bold push to solidify XRP’s utility. But with price action lagging behind the headlines, investors are left wondering: will this global expansion translate into a meaningful price surge, or is XRP’s rally already priced in? XRP Poised for Potential Gains Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between a little over $2, showing some lively movement. Recent data suggests the price could rise, challenging its nearest resistance at just under $2.50. The coin has climbed nearly 4% over the past week and more than 8% over the month. However, its six-month performance has seen a slight downturn of over 6%. If it breaks resistance, XRP could target under $2.80, marking a potential climb of roughly 20% from its current price range. With a steady Relative Strength Index above 70, XRP exhibits strong momentum, signaling possible continued growth. Conclusion XRP’s technicals hint at strength, but its price still hovers below key resistance levels. The global reach of the Accelerator program may unlock broader adoption, yet price movement will ultimately depend on sustained momentum and market sentiment. If XRP can build on recent gains and clear resistance, the next leg upward may follow—but until then, traders remain cautious, watching closely to see if utility will finally ignite a breakout.

While the broader market remains cautious, a handful of meme coins are quietly gaining momentum—showing early technical signs of life and community interest. In this article, we spotlight BOME, Turbo, and Popcat—three meme tokens with breakout potential that could ride the next big wave in this high-risk, high-reward corner of crypto. BOME Eyes Potential Surge Amid Current Price Movements Source: tradingview The cryptocurrency BOOK OF MEME (BOME) is currently oscillating between $0.001395 and $0.001761. It's on the edge of breaking its nearest resistance at $0.0018943. Should it pass this mark, optimism suggests a climb to around $0.0022603, marking a potential growth of over 20%. With the coin riding above its 10-day moving average but below the 100-day, there's a mixed sentiment in the market. Still, if it dips, the nearest support stands strong at $0.0011623. While the MACD hovers near zero, traders are closely watching for signs of bullish momentum. The balance between hold and fold is delicate, as any shift could lead to rapid movement. Turbo (TURBO) Shows Slow Growth but Eyes Higher Levels Source: tradingview Turbo , currently priced between three to four-tenths of a cent, is inching upwards. Its recent performance saw a slight dip of over two percent in the last week and month, with a drop of about sixty-four percent over six months. However, Turbo has potential upside, especially if it breaks past the nearest resistance around four-tenths of a cent. Achieving the next resistance point could mean an increase of around thirty percent. The market indicators, with RSI and Stochastic hovering above 50, suggest moderate buying interest. If Turbo taps into its potential, continuing upward could push it closer to half a cent, marking notable growth from its current range. Popcat (POPCAT) Eyes Potential but Faces Challenges Source: tradingview Popcat (POPCAT) has seen some better days, currently trading within the low $0.30 range. It's inching closer to a resistance level just below $0.40 but struggles to maintain momentum. The recent price slide has brought a decline of over 10% in a month and more than 65% over six months. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) under 50, the coin shows a lack of strong buying interest. However, should POPCAT break past $0.37, it could aim for the $0.44 mark, signaling a potential gain of over 20%. For now, traders are wary, keeping an eye on both support levels just below a quarter and $0.15 as fallback points. Conclusion While the meme coin space is famously unpredictable, BOME, Turbo, and Popcat each show glimmers of promise under current conditions. With key resistance levels in sight and growing market attention, even modest surges could trigger wider momentum. As history has shown with coins like PEPE, all it takes is a spark—making these three meme tokens worth watching closely in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin price was trading at $109,200, while the market cap of all coins jumped to over $3.37 trillion. The crypto market rose after Donald Trump announced a new deadline on when new tariffs will take place. This announcement helped to allay fears that the trade war would escalate this week. This article provides a forecast for some of the top cryptocurrencies like Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), Bonk (BONK), and Floki (FLOKI). Hedera Hashgraph price technical analysis HBAR price chart | Source: TradingView The Hedera Hashgraph price has been under pressure in the past few months as it plunged from a high of $0.40 in November to the current $0.1600 today. This decline happened as the stablecoin supply in the network plunged. On the positive side, the HBAR price bottomed at $0.1236, where it formed a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $0.2290. A double bottom is one of the most bullish reversal patterns in technical analysis. Hedera Hashgaph price has also formed a falling wedge pattern, comprising of two descending and converging trendlines. Like the double-bottom, the wedge is a popular bullish reversal sign. HBAR price has now moved above the upper side of the falling wedge, and is attempting to flip the 100-day Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other altcoins have all pointed upwards. Therefore, Hedera will likely continue rising as bulls target the next key resistance level at $0.2290, the neckline of the double bottom. A drop below the support at $0.1236 will invalidate the bullish HBAR forecast.

Bonk price has moved close to he neckline at $0.00002568, its highest level on May 11. It has also jumped above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level, while the Relative Strength Index has moved to the overbought point at 70. Bonk’s surge has occurred in a high-volume environment, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.3 billion. Its volume was significantly higher than other top altcoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Therefore, the Bonk token will likely continue rising as bulls target the neckline at $0.00002568. A break above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the 50% retracement level at $0.00003453. Floki price forecast Floki price chart | Source: TradingView Floki was another top-performing cryptocurrency as it jumped by over 16% in the last 24 hours. This rally occurred in a high-volume environment, with the 24-hour metric surging to nearly $200 million. The daily chart shows that the Floki price was trading at $0.00008710 on Monday, higher than this month’s low of $0.000059, its lowest level on June 22 this year. Fkoki has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern whose two lines are nearing their confluence level. Additionally, the RSI has moved above the neutral point of 50, while the MACD indicator is poised to cross the zero line. Therefore, the token will likely have a bullish breakout above the psychological point at $0.00010. A move above that level will point to more gains, with the next point to watch being at $0.0001238, up by 43% from the current level. A drop below the key support level at $0.000059 will invalidate the bullish forecast.

NEW YORK – July 7, 2025 – Plume , the first full-stack chain and ecosystem purpose-built for real world asset finance (RWAfi), has announced a strategic integration with TRON to launch SkyLink across the TRON Network. TRON’s vast global user base, which generates some of the highest stablecoin volume and transaction throughput in crypto, now has direct access to asset-backed yields from tokenized U.S. Treasuries, private credit, and other real-world financial products issued on Plume. This marks a major development for TRON, historically known as the leading decentralized payments and settlement network in emerging markets. With SkyLink now live, stablecoins circulating on TRON can be natively deployed into RWA yield strategies and institutional-grade investment assets – while expanding Plume’s reach to one of the largest and most active DeFi user bases in the world. “TRON is one of the most systemically important networks in crypto today – moving billions in stablecoins daily across global economies,” said Chris Yin, CEO of Plume. “This integration allows Plume to leverage TRON’s leading settlement network and provide broader access to real-world assets and real yields. SkyLink launching on TRON will enable more users and institutions to preserve dollar liquidity while earning sustainable returns.” SkyLink is Plume’s omnichain RWA yield distribution protocol, enabling secure, permissionless access to institutional-grade financial products across chains. Leveraging LayerZero’s SyncPools architecture, SkyLink ensures that yield is streamed continuously and transparently to users’ wallets via mirrored YieldTokens, while underlying liquidity remains locked on each native chain – including TRON. “TRON is built for speed, scale, and accessibility, and this collaboration with Plume brings a new dimension to that mission,” said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for the TRON DAO. “By integrating SkyLink, we’re enabling users around the world to access compliant and institutional-grade, dollar-denominated investment products like treasuries, corporate bonds, and structure credit directly from their wallets or custodians, unlocking a new era of financial empowerment through DeFi.” SkyLink’s mirrored YieldTokens enable continuous, onchain yield streaming while preserving liquidity on each native network. Powered by LayerZero’s SyncPools architecture, SkyLink ensures omnichain compatibility, unified compliance standards, and native composability across supported ecosystems – including Solana, TRON, Sui, Soneium, Injective, Omni Network, and more.

The US president said, “I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.” Trump also dismissed the third party idea completely, saying third parties have “never succeeded in the United States” because “The System seems not designed for them.” His warning? Third parties only lead to “complete and total disruption and chaos,” and Trump said the country already had enough of that from Democrats. Elon announced the America Party on Saturday, claiming Americans want something new. He said his research showed voters preferred a new party by “a factor of 2 to 1.” He blamed both Republicans and Democrats for waste and corruption and called the US a “one-party system.” Trump is not impressed. He called the Republican Party a “smooth running machine” and said it had just passed the biggest bill of its kind “in the history of our country.” That legislation, signed last week, killed the federal electric vehicle mandate. It was one of Trump’s longtime campaign goals. Trump slams Elon over EV mandate, NASA request, and party betrayal Trump made it clear the bill would let Americans choose what kind of cars they drive, be it gas, hybrids, or whatever tech comes next. He reminded Elon that this rollback wasn’t new, saying , “It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had.” Trump said he even asked Elon if he knew the mandate would be removed, and Elon supposedly said he didn’t mind. Trump called that “very surprising” after Elon gave him a “total and unquestioned Endorsement.” Then Trump brought up an older request from Elon: asking that a close friend run NASA. Trump said the man was talented but was “a blue blooded Democrat who had never contributed to a Republican before.” Trump added, “Elon probably was, also.” He said it was inappropriate to put a friend of Elon’s, who was also in the space business, in charge of NASA, especially since NASA plays a major role in Elon’s companies. Trump said his priority was to “protect the American Public.” Feud leads to threats, polls drop, and party divide grows On June 28, Elon had tweeted, “The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country.” He called it “political suicide for the Republican Party.” On June 30, Trump pushed back and said he would use DOGE, a regulatory program that Elon once headed, to look into Elon’s business contracts with the federal government. By July 1, Elon made it personal. He said he would financially support Rep. Thomas Massie’s reelection campaign. Massie voted against Trump’s bill. Trump then told reporters that same day he’d “take a look” at deporting Elon. Meanwhile, Dmitry Novikov, a Russian politician, told TASS that Russia could offer Elon political asylum if things escalated further, but did add that Elon probably wouldn’t need it. As of now, Elon hasn’t said anything about that. Meanwhile, a YouGov polling showed Elon’s net favorability among Republicans dropped 20 points in June, the lowest he’s ever scored with that group in their records. Still, he’s gaining interest elsewhere. A poll from Quantus Insights in early July showed almost 40% of Americans said they would support Elon’s new party. It’s unclear how that translates to actual votes, but it rattled both major parties. Inside the MAGA camp, some were celebrating the split. A separate YouGov poll found that most Republicans sided with Trump in the feud, while most Democrats didn’t pick a side. When voters were asked how they felt about Elon’s attack on the GOP-backed bill, 56% said they agreed with him. Only 17% disagreed. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon said on his War Room show that Elon might get “flipped” by Democrats, so Democratic California Congressman Ro Khanna urged his party to court Elon, saying it could benefit them in the long run.

But rather than chasing past peaks, many are focusing on coins that are rising in price along with strong project work and community support. From usage in daily life to larger network growth, it is time to look at the highest potential cryptos in 2025 that may shape the upcoming cycle. This list covers Aptos, Shiba Inu, Hyperliquid, and BlockDAG, all showing action-driven growth. Among them, BlockDAG continues to stand out with its utility, milestones, and pricing benefits. The keyword highest potential cryptos in 2025 is crucial here, as these coins define that term perfectly. 1. BlockDAG: Historic Presale That Has Pulled in Over $332M! BlockDAG is moving ahead fast, with its price fixed at $0.0016 until the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. This is the lowest cost offered since Batch 1. Over 23.5 billion BDAG have been sold, raising a total of $332 million. Its mining products include the X1 mobile mining app, which has over 2 million active users, and rigs like X30/X100 shipping on July 7 and X10 coming on August 15. These are forming its main mining base. Security checks are complete with Halborn and CertiK audits, while major listings are planned on MEXC, LBANK, XT.com, CoinStore, and BitMart. Its beta testnet has also gone live, featuring no-code tools, easy contract deployment, and weekly token distributions. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their holdings since batch 1, and the team targets a $0.05 listing. This means those buying at the $0.0016 price are set to see 3025% gains at launch. With all these factors together, BlockDAG (BDAG) is among the highest potential cryptos in 2025 that one should follow closely. 2. Aptos Progresses with Real-World Asset Adoption Showing clear upward signs this July, Aptos trades at around $4.73, touching intraday highs of $4.84 and lows of $4.43. Recent price action broke through resistance between $5.00–$5.06, and if it maintains this zone, a rise to $5.35 is possible. Beyond its chart, Aptos is expanding into Real-World Assets (RWA), crossing $540 million in exposure and ranking in the top 3 chains for RWA. On-chain activity includes BlackRock funds and PACT Protocol. Product growth is also visible as Aptos Labs and Jump Crypto develop Shelby, a decentralized hot storage system that will work with Ethereum and Solana while keeping Aptos as the central L1. DeFi usage is also strong, with Echo Protocol securing $878 million TVL. These solid moves ensure Aptos remains among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. 3. Shiba Inu Strengthens with Community and AI Plans With a strong bounce to $0.0000119 this week, Shiba Inu recorded a 5.7% daily gain, touching intraday highs of $0.00001197 and lows of $0.00001132. Whale wallet activity has risen by 40%, and total wallet count with non-zero balances is now at 1.45 million. However, 66.7% of holders remain at a loss, suggesting growth potential if momentum continues. Its lead dev Shytoshi Kusama has hinted at a “Jul-AI” campaign, with new AI updates planned. Ecosystem actions include Shibarium rollups, ongoing token burns, metaverse zone expansion, and upgrades to ShibaSwap features. Although price movements have been choppy, a breakout above $0.0000119–$0.000014 is expected if momentum strengthens. It remains a part of the highest potential cryptos in 2025 because of its loyal community and renewed development. 4. Hyperliquid Grows with DEX Volume and Tools Trading between $39.80–$40.60 now, Hyperliquid has recovered well from recent dips below $33. Its June DEX volume reached $11.4 billion, nearly double April’s figures, while TVL has increased to $1.8 billion. Leading the on-chain perpetuals space, Hyperliquid beats dYdX, Aevo, and GMX in speed and fees, processing 100,000 orders per second with sub-second settlement. Big players are noticing this growth. HYLQ Strategy purchased around 3,600 HYPE tokens at $39.6, while Lion Group Holding raised $600 million for a HYPE Treasury. Future upgrades like the CoreWriter tool and opt.fun leveraged trading could further strengthen use. While slightly below its all-time high of $45.6, a rise above $41.50 may drive another strong move. Hyperliquid’s volume strength and upgrades make it one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025. To Sum Up! Aptos is building real-world asset use and new protocols, Shiba Inu is driving AI upgrades and community support, and Hyperliquid is expanding with volume and infrastructure. But BlockDAG stands apart with clear pricing benefits, rewards strategy, and broad product progress. Its current $0.0016 price until August 11th, strong miner community, and upcoming listings place it among the highest potential cryptos in 2025 that could set new standards before full launch The post 4 Highest Potential Cryptos in 2025 According to Top Analysts: Aptos, SHIB, Hyperliquid & BlockDAG! appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Token Presale and ICO Insights|BlockDAG,EN,0,0,SHIB|APT|TRADING|MINING|ZRX,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-07-07 01:00:50

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins a new trading week, bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $109K, up 0.8% in the last week or 4.5% in the last month, according to CoinDesk market data. In an era of continued sizeable BTC buys from Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), sustained BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) inflows , and more companies adopting a BTC treasury strategy , one has to wonder why bitcoin's price hasn't shot past all-time highs. A new report from CryptoQuant spells it out: all of this institutional action isn't making up for a general decline in spot demand for BTC. ""The annual growth of bitcoin demand shows a similar picture: ETFs and MSTR purchases are a portion of bitcoin demand, overall demand contraction is more than offsetting these purchases, and the acceleration of overall demand growth is what drives price rallies,"" CryptoQuant wrote in a recent report. CryptoQuant points out that over the last 30 days, there's been a contraction in demand for BTC to the tune of -895K. To make things worse, compared to December, ETF and MSTR buys are slowing. In the last month of the year, ETFs bought 86,000 BTC and MSTR 171,000, while in the last month, those numbers are down significantly. ETFs only purchased 40K BTC, while MSTR bought 16 K. BTC is stuck in a consolidation phase, and demand isn't there to fuel a breakout, CryptoQuant writes. One additional data point for proof of slowing demand is BTC's nearly empty mempool , which demonstrates how little retail spot demand the market has. The question is if institutional buys continue to slow, how much resistance will it put on BTC's price? SkyBridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci is on the record for saying that the BTC treasury trend — a reliable source of demand for bitcoin — will fade. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea,” Scaramucci said during an interview with Bloomberg last week. “So, you know, it will fade.” “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now,” Scaramucci continued in the interview. “I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies.” Meanwhile, Standard Chartered remains a BTC bull , with the bank maintaining its $200K price target for the world's largest digital asset. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin consolidated above $108,500 over the weekend, then surged from $108,327 to $108,620 in the last hour, with $108,200-$108,300 now supporting the uptrend. ETH: Ethereum rallied from $2,520.45 to $2,558.63 on July 6, with trading volume spiking to 272,352 ETH, finding support at $2,510 amid global economic tensions, while $1.1 billion in June ETH ETF inflows and record whale accumulation signal potential for a breakout despite resistance near $2,600. Gold: Gold surged 1.91% to $3,336.61 last week, driven by a weakening dollar, 91.5% odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, looming tariff threats, and a 73% spike in China’s gold imports Nikkei 225: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.26% after the White House continued with its mixed messages on tariffs.

The 5th presale stage of Mutuum Finance is over 60% sold out already. The project has raised more than $11.8 million and acquired 12,700 investors. Mutuum Finance has an estimated ROI of 17,820% according to early predictions. This means that it may reach a price of up to $10.7 after its launch. With investors going on a search of the best crypto to invest in now, Mutuum Finance is gaining serious grounds as one of the standout cryptos to invest in. Dogecoin Holds Strong at $0.17 as Bulls Keep Momentum Alive Dogecoin (DOGE) has already recovered, losing momentum and price action around the support point of $0.15 and now is trading around $0.17. Although the market volatility has hit DOGE recently, the cryptocurrency has not been mired down by it and the current movement is bullish which could lead to an upcoming short-term rally. Nevertheless, should the price fall below the $0.15 mark then the support can be sought at the price around the $0.13 mark. Mutuum Finance is a newer utility-oriented project that some investors are considering as they seek the next breakout project in that regard, as Dogecoin takes advantage of the community energy. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Now Over 60% Filled Mutuum Finance presale Phase 5 is underway and gaining strong momentum. Already over 12,700 investors have come aboard the project and raised $11.8 million, which is testimony to its growing hype. With Phase 5 having crossed the 60% mark, price increases are imminent. Buying now guarantees investors the lowest possible price for maximum ROI when the token goes live. Mutuum Finance Launches 50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance in its focus on security and transparency has even initiated its official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK with a reward value of 50,000 USDT. The reward is given in four categories, critical, major, minor and low where there is coverage and reward for all types of vulnerabilities. This is another aspect that reflects the proactive approach of Mutuum Finance towards establishment of trust in the form of strong infrastructure and beneficial security. The Mutuum Finance $100,000 Giveaway The project has already been audited by CertiK and is leading towards the realization of the huge adoption and those who buy right now will benefit most in the future. On top of that, the platform is hosting an amazing $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky people will receive $10 000 each. Dogecoin is maintaining its position above the 0.15 mark and building toward breakout past $0.20. Having exceeded 12,700+ investors with the raise at more than $11.8 million, and Phase 5 now already over 60% sold out, the numbers speak of themselves. With a CertiK security audit, a massive $50k bug bounty, and a strong dual lending paradigm Mutuum Finance is not only promising, it is delivering. Early investors will be looking forward to an estimated 17,820% ROI with the price reaching $10.70. With a dynamic $100,000 giveaway now is the moment to join in.

The drop hit as Bitcoin blew through resistance and ended the June 29 week with its highest weekly close ever. The action split risk markets in two. Stocks went down, crypto went up. As per usual, the trigger came straight out of Washington after President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that new tariffs will begin August 1, not July 9 as markets had priced in. The news sent US stock futures into a tailspin Sunday night. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 146 points, down 0.32%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.39% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.42%. Trump didn’t make the announcement alone. Standing beside him was Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who told reporters, “Tariffs go into effect Aug. 1. But the president is setting the rates, and the deals, right now.” Trump nodded in agreement, ending the market’s weekend hopes. The update came after days of guessing by investors and left Wall Street hanging just as they were coming off a strong week. Bitcoin makes history as ETF inflows build Bitcoin managed to stay above $108,500 before closing Sunday at over $109,000, according to data from CoinGecko. Over the past month, nearly 50,000 BTC moved into US spot ETFs, signaling strong institutional demand. Based on their flow-to-price model, the next major target sits at $117,000. That model has tracked closely with price action in previous cycles, especially during aggressive ETF accumulation. Market analysts are calling it “whale games,” as large buyers quietly accumulate while retail watches from the sidelines. While Bitcoin moved up, metals moved down. Gold, which had gained almost 2% last week, gave back ground and hovered around $3,325 per ounce on Monday. It’s still up over 25% in 2025 and is sitting just under $170 shy of its April record. ETF inflows and central bank demand have kept gold up this year, but short-term traders pulled back after the White House announcement. S&P 500 loses steam after tariff delay creates confusion Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the new tariff date during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” earlier Sunday. “If there’s no deal, tariffs go back to April 2 levels on August 1,” he said. That announcement set expectations that major duties could return unless a breakthrough is made in trade talks. Most investors had planned around tariffs starting this week. That now looks wrong. The original 90-day pause from April’s “reciprocal” tariffs was set to expire Tuesday, with an EU agreement deadline hitting Wednesday. If no deal is struck with the European Union, tariffs up to 50% on EU goods are expected. Last week’s stock rally came from the belief that Trump wouldn’t actually follow through with the most extreme tariff threats. That optimism collapsed. Still, some traders are holding out hope. They believe US firms will beat weak earnings expectations if they can show they’re ready to handle tariffs. The US Dollar Index dipped slightly to 96.90, while China’s Renminbi fell 0.07% to 7.1656. The Japanese Yen also slipped to 0.0069, with a minor move of +0.0000090. Other currencies, including the euro, pound, and ruble, are also trading just below neutral. Silver, unlike gold, ripped to $37.225, the highest price seen in nearly 14 years. That spike stood out in a market dominated by selling pressure.

As the meme coin market matures, seasoned investors are no longer just chasing hype. They’re strategically accumulating assets with early-stage signals, community momentum, and long-term upside. While the noise often surrounds tokens that have already peaked, the real opportunities in 2025 may lie in projects building silently but steadily. This article covers the four best meme coins for 2025, each of which is showing signs of whale accumulation through increasing on-chain volume, smart money interest, or gated access mechanisms. One of these coins hasn’t even launched publicly yet, but is already generating excitement in private groups and whitelist circles. If you’re looking to get ahead of the crowd, now is the time to take a closer look. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Built for Whales Who Move Early MoonBull is quickly becoming a standout in early-stage crypto circles. Designed for degen traders and early adopters, this Ethereum-based meme coin has launched an invite-only whitelist that has attracted quiet interest from crypto insiders. Instead of rushing to market with public listings and hype-driven noise, MoonBull is taking a more disciplined, scarcity-driven approach, one that has caught the attention of crypto whales looking to position themselves early. MoonBull’s whitelist gives early members access at the lowest price tier available, along with exclusive staking rewards, bonus allocations, and private updates about the upcoming roadmap. What makes this especially appealing is the fact that no public information about the launch date or tokenomics will be released. Access is available only through the whitelist right now, where users submit their email and are notified privately about Stage One. This stealth-focused rollout is exactly the kind of move that signals strength to early-stage investors and analysts. MoonBull is already being listed as one of the best memecoins for 2025 due to its unique approach to launch strategy and supply control. For traders and whales looking to front-run a high-conviction entry, MoonBull’s quiet but coordinated launch is gaining serious attention. With the limited whitelist filling fast, many are calling it one of the most promising early-access plays of the year. Get whitelisted or miss your shot at what could become one of the best memecoins for 2025 before the crowd catches on. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Still Holds Weight Dogecoin continues to be one of the most recognizable assets in the entire crypto space. Originally launched in 2013 as a playful alternative to Bitcoin, Dogecoin has evolved from a meme to a symbol of community-powered momentum. With no maximum supply and a decentralized development team, DOGE has maintained a consistent presence on major exchanges and across social media platforms. What sets Dogecoin apart is its long-standing community loyalty and ongoing relevance in mainstream culture. Despite the emergence of newer projects, DOGE still sees consistent trading activity, whale transfers, and inclusion in large-scale portfolios. The project remains a go-to choice for traders looking for meme exposure with high liquidity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogecoin makes this list of the best memecoins for 2025 because of its continued ability to command attention and maintain value in both bullish and sideways markets. Whales recognize its staying power, and DOGE remains a core holding in many long-term meme coin strategies. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme to Ecosystem Shiba Inu has transformed itself from a meme coin into an expansive decentralized ecosystem. Since its launch in 2020, SHIB has developed a range of products and services including its own decentralized exchange, NFT integrations, staking pools, and even a metaverse initiative. Built on Ethereum, Shiba Inu has evolved far beyond its meme roots while keeping the branding and appeal that made it go viral in the first place. The SHIB community, known as the ShibArmy, is among the most dedicated in crypto. This active and well-coordinated user base has been a key factor in the token’s sustained visibility and growth. As development continues across ShibaSwap, Shibarium, and its DeFi utilities, the project continues to draw institutional interest. Why did this coin make it to this list? Analysts include SHIB among the best memecoins for 2025 not just for its popularity but for the scale of its roadmap. Whales are watching the expansion closely, particularly as the project continues to bridge meme culture with long-term DeFi functionality. Shiba Inu is no longer just a meme, it’s a serious player in the Ethereum ecosystem. 4. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): The AI Meme Project Catching Early Eyes Goatseus Maximus, or GOAT, is one of the more unconventional projects gaining quiet traction. Created by an AI bot called Truth Terminal, GOAT is a Solana-based meme coin that merges artificial intelligence with cultural commentary. With its unique branding, evolving meme format, and algorithmically influenced governance, the project has become a dark horse in the meme coin race. GOAT is built around the idea of real-time narrative generation, using AI not only to shape marketing but also to dynamically adapt token behavior based on community interaction. This blend of machine-driven evolution and meme culture is attracting a specific kind of investor: one who values tech disruption and early ecosystem innovation. Why did this coin make it to this list? Analysts point to GOAT as one of the best memecoins for 2025 due to its AI integration and nontraditional roadmap. Whale wallets have started appearing on-chain, with gradual accumulation reflecting quiet confidence. With Solana’s growing meme coin scene and GOAT’s outlier concept, this token could become one of the most intriguing narratives of the year. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, the best meme coins for 2025 are Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, GOAT and MoonBull. The meme coin space in 2025 is far more sophisticated than it was just a few years ago. Today’s winners aren’t necessarily the loudest; they’re the ones building quietly, with focused communities, strategic rollouts, and innovative positioning. Whether it’s Dogecoin holding its ground, Shiba Inu expanding its empire, or GOAT experimenting with AI-based governance, each of these tokens offers a different lens on what makes a meme coin valuable in today’s market. MoonBull , however, stands in a category of its own. Its private whitelist, limited early access, and stealth strategy make it one of the most talked-about contenders in the best memecoins for 2025 list. While others push for mass exposure, MoonBull is letting exclusivity do the work. For whales and early traders seeking a low-entry, high-upside opportunity, the clock is ticking. This is the phase before the frenzy, and only a few will be in before the stampede begins.

The comment, a thinly veiled dig at Apple’s failed decade-long, $10 billion Project Titan, was followed by an impressive flex: more than 289,000 orders for the SUV were placed within an hour, surpassing demand for the SU7 sedan introduced in March 2024. Xiaomi founder jabs Apple while celebrating record-breaking EV orders Where Apple faltered, Xiaomi has soared , solidifying Lei’s legacy, boosting Xiaomi’s market value, and shaking up the tech and auto sectors. Apple’s abandoned pursuit of a fully autonomous vehicle underscored the missteps of moonshot ambitions. At the same time, Xiaomi’s grounded, pragmatic approach — blending Tesla- and Porsche-inspired designs with its signature affordability — has proved more effective. China’s mature EV ecosystem gave Xiaomi an edge Apple never had: abundant subsidies, a robust charging infrastructure, and a ready supply chain. Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight, said Lei and Xiaomi’s charisma, brand recognition, and ecosystem cannot be underestimated. He continued to say that young consumers who are already loyal to Xiaomi naturally consider it when buying EVs. Still, car manufacturing poses far greater challenges than smartphones or gadgets, from regulatory compliance to geopolitics. Xiaomi is charting new territory as one of the first tech giants to go full-scale into car production. Unlike Apple’s high-concept, constantly shifting EV goals, Lei took a focused and frugal approach, calling carmaking his “last entrepreneurial project.” Xiaomi’s journey included tapping into China’s automaking talent pool, visiting companies like Geely and Great Wall, and poaching top talent from BAIC, BMW, and SAIC-GM-Wuling. Among the hires was Hu Zhengnan, formerly of Geely, credited as key to the SU7’s development. Behind the scenes, Xiaomi pursued aggressive recruitment and built deep ties across the EV supply chain. It invested over $1.6 billion in over 100 component manufacturers between 2021 and 2024, from lidar to voltage converters, ensuring control and insulation from the supply chain disruptions that once plagued its smartphone business. Xiaomi even constructed its own EV plant, bypassing the contract manufacturing route of peers like Nio and Xpeng. The decision reflects lessons from early Xiaomi, where strained supplier relationships — including a near-break with Samsung — forced Lei to negotiate over red wine to mend ties personally. Can Xiaomi compete with Tesla and BYD? Yet Xiaomi’s ascent hasn’t been without criticism. The SU7 has been dubbed the “Porsche Mi” for its familiar design, and SAIC’s vice president reportedly slammed Xiaomi’s approach as “shameless.” A fatal March accident involving the SU7 while its assisted-driving system was active led to government scrutiny and a rare period of silence from Lei. Even so, the SU7 remains a top seller. Xiaomi’s loyal fanbase — known as “Mi Fans” — continues to drive sales. “A significant number of older buyers are purchasing the SU7 for their children,” said Rosalie Chen of Third Bridge, highlighting the model’s trust factor. For 2025, Xiaomi has raised its delivery target to 350,000 vehicles, fueled by the SUV’s popularity and the newly introduced YU7. Starting at $30,100 for the SU7 and $35,000 for the SUV, Xiaomi’s vehicles are price-competitive with Tesla’s offerings . Its EV unit is projected to become profitable in the second half of 2025. Yet the scale of Xiaomi’s operation is small when compared with giants such as BYD (with 4.3m EV and hybrid sales in 2023), Tesla (1.78m), or Toyota (10.8m in all markets globally). Having no offering in the mainstay sub-$20,000 market, which firms like BYD currently control, would see Xiaomi become a boutique brand for the rich, much like Tesla Still, Lei is in an expansionist mood globally. He has recently said that Xiaomi could start overseas car sales as soon as 2027, from an R&D center in Munich with potential launches in Germany, Spain, and France, even as tariffs on Chinese EVs go up in the US, the EU, and Turkey. Lei has acknowledged that Xiaomi is a late entrant to the auto business. But, he said, there is always potential for latecomers in a technology- and innovation-driven market.

This came after US President Donald Trump said on Friday, July 4, that he plans to speak with China on Monday or Tuesday this week about a potential TikTok agreement . He mentioned that the United States almost agreed to sell the TikTok short-video app. TikTok suspended its deal with the US amid Trump’s tariff policies imposed on China Earlier this year, an agreement was made that involved the creation of a new company in the US to handle TikTok’s operations in America. Moreover, American investors would be the majority owners and have access to the short video app. According to reports from reliable sources, TikTok formulated a strategy to introduce the new app to the United States app stores as early as September 5. This followed Trump’s extension of the sales of the US operations of TikTok last month until a deadline of September 17 for China’s ByteDance. TikTok users will eventually need to download the new app to continue using the service, though the current app will be functional until March of next year. The report added that this timeline could shift. This new app has piqued the interest of the searchers. Some are curious about whether their followers and posts will transfer over immediately or later or if they should start from scratch once they get to the new accounts. Others ask why it is called “M2” along with other questions . As for the TikTok deal, Trump said he anticipates “starting a dialogue” with China on Monday or Tuesday, perhaps with President Xi or a representative. They were very close to a deal, he said. However, TikTok suspended this deal after China said it would not finalize the agreement in light of Trump’s declaration of heavy tariffs on Chinese goods. In response, Trump mentioned that the United States would likely need to get a deal approved by China. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When asked about his confidence in China’s willingness to agree, Trump responded that he was not completely sure, but anticipated they would. Based on his argument, President Xi and he have a strong relationship; therefore, he believed this deal would benefit both countries. Trump relaxed export controls on China, creating room for a bigger deal Time has expired for some of the United States’ trading partners seeking to strike deals before President Trump’s July 9 deadline for tariffs to return to the higher levels originally suggested. Trump said that letters will start going out to countries to inform them of the tariff rates they will encounter when exporting to the US, which will take force on August 1. Others of like character will succeed in the first 10 or 12 letters sent. Following the deadline, Trump mentioned they will have complete coverage by the ninth. He further stated that the tariffs will vary, some around 60% or 70%, while others at 10% or 20%. In the meantime, the Trump team has concentrated on securing trade deals, though it has been able to nail only three deals so far. Scott Bessent, a United States Secretary of the Treasury, indicated that about 100 partners are on the hook for a minimum “reciprocal rate” of 10% as soon as this week and has said he is expecting a “flurry” of deals to get done between now and the deadline. For China’s case, the United States has relaxed export controls on China for chip design software and ethane, further indicating that trade tensions are easing between the two countries after they reached an agreement in May on a plan to work towards a bigger deal. This Restrictions had been put in place only weeks ago. As a result of the relaxed export controls in China, software companies like Synopsys and Cadence said they would resume selling their tools for designing chips to Chinese customers. This positive outlook signals that Trump might strike a deal with China concerning the sales of TikTok’s US operations.

Saturday night on Truth Social, Trump called Elon a train wreck and said it makes him sad that he is embarrassing himself publicly. Elon had accused Trump of abandoning the center and posted a poll asking his followers if he should form a new party to represent “the 80 percent in the middle.” When the poll closed, about 80% voted yes. So he went ahead and launched it unofficially… at least for now. Elon targets Republican defectors after bill passes Before the announcement, other players tried to pull Elon into their projects. Andrew Yang, speaking to Politico Magazine, said he had wanted to form a political party with Elon or get his support for the Forward Party. Elon had endorsed Yang’s presidential run back in 2020, but no deal was made. Steven Nekhaila, chair of the Libertarian National Committee, also reached out last week, but Elon still didn’t engage. Instead, Elon stayed focused on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the same bill that triggered his split from Trump. As the bill neared a vote in the Senate, Elon promised that if it passed, he would not only move forward with forming the America Party, but also back primary challenges against Republican lawmakers who voted in favor of it. When the bill passed the House of Representatives on July 3, he followed through. He dropped another poll on X, then revealed a loose electoral strategy, blasting both major parties as a single “uniparty” failing to offer real policy differences. Despite Elon’s massive personal fortune, pushing the America Party into the national conversation won’t be easy. The Washington Post pointed out that Elon failed to influence the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court election, and his work at the Department of Government Efficiency has damaged his reputation in some circles. Getting ballot access in all states will be a massive legal grind. Public support for him has also dipped, adding more uncertainty to the project. Adding to the complications, Elon was born in South Africa, which makes him constitutionally ineligible to run for the US presidency. He hasn’t said who will lead the America Party or what its internal structure will look like. As of now, it’s just Elon, Bitcoin, and an audience of people tired of choosing between two parties he no longer wants anything to do with.

BlockDAG (BDAG): Record-Breaking Presale with Room to Grow Many in the crypto space are searching for platforms that offer real utility rather than just short-term buzz. BlockDAG (BDAG) is steadily gaining attention by focusing on meaningful development and allowing early participants to take an active role in its progress. It goes beyond being just another coin by creating opportunities for users to engage directly with the network. At this stage, BlockDAG invites people to join through hands-on testing and task-based participation. From exploring the Beta Testnet and deploying smart contracts to identifying bugs, users can earn BDAG while contributing to the platform’s advancement. It’s a direct way to take part in building something with a long-term focus. The current price of $0.0016 is among the lowest since the initial presale phase and is valid through August 11, when the much-awaited GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With over $332 million raised so far, BlockDAG is gaining steady momentum and presents strong potential for those examining top altcoins for long-term growth. 2. Litecoin (LTC): Staying Relevant with Practical Strength Often called “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin is showing in 2025 why that label still makes sense. Its quick transactions and low fees keep it useful for daily transfers, especially as more users seek function over flair. The potential use of MimbleWimble for added privacy gives Litecoin a renewed reason to stay on the radar for long-term watchers. Litecoin may not grab headlines like newer names, but it continues to operate as a fast and dependable network. At a time when many platforms are slowing down or costing more, LTC maintains its efficiency. For those focusing on top altcoins for the long run, Litecoin remains a simple and steady option that performs reliably. 3. XRP: Stable Use in Real Finance Builds Confidence XRP has been making progress in 2025, helped by improved legal clarity after years of uncertainty. With a rising number of partnerships and use in cross-border payments, it is gaining attention for its actual utility rather than just price movement. That progress matters to those looking for consistent value. Even with a mixed market, XRP has remained on track. It’s helping financial services move funds faster and at lower costs, showing real-world function. For people aiming to hold solid assets, XRP is positioning itself among the top altcoins for long-term strategy, thanks to its focused and practical role in finance. 4. Cardano: Advancing Through Careful Development Cardano takes a different route by sticking to a slow, research-driven model. Instead of rushing features, it continues to build with care. In 2025, its approach is starting to pay off as Hydra scaling and new smart contract projects roll out across the platform. Cardano’s strength lies in its steady work. It avoids noise and instead moves with clear planning. ADA is appealing to those who prefer patience and development over hype. For anyone thinking about top altcoins for the long term, Cardano stands out with a clear foundation and ongoing technical progress tied to real-world goals. Picking Altcoins with Long-Term Potential To wrap it up, staying focused on the future means recognizing early signs of strength. While crypto markets shift often, some altcoins show lasting qualities. Litecoin remains fast and affordable. XRP is gaining use through financial networks and steady legal progress. Cardano grows by staying focused on research and real application. All three are showing reasons to remain confident. Alongside them, BlockDAG is growing rapidly, having raised $332 million across 29 presale phases. With the price at $0.0016 until August 11, it still offers one of the lowest entry points. Those watching top altcoins for long-term gains may want to take note. BlockDAG’s current momentum could lead to something much larger.

ETH is now back above $2,550 and might soon aim for more gains. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $2,550 level. The price is trading above $2,565 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains supported above the $2,520 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,520 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $2,550 resistance zone and entered a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,636 swing high to the $2,475 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,565 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,600 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,636 swing high to the $2,475 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,620 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,720 resistance. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,750 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,550 level. The first major support sits near the $2,520 zone. A clear move below the $2,520 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social account Sunday evening in the U.S. His statement came as leaders of the BRICS countries attended a summit in Brazil. The group covers Russia, China, Brazil, South Africa, India, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Ethiopia, Iran, and Indonesia. BRICS considers itself a forum for “political and diplomatic coordination” among Global South countries, working together across a wide range of issues. With China’s President Xi absent, Premier Li represented China at the gathering, and Vladimir Putin participated via video link. In a separate announcement, Trump said that letters would begin going out Monday covering details of the specific tariff levels each country will face and any trade agreements the administration has reached. According to Trump, these letters will set clear deadlines for negotiations and commitments. He added that the US is on the verge of several trade deals. Other nations will be officially notified of their higher tariffs by 9th July, and the new, elevated rates are scheduled for August 1. When asked for details, Commerce Secretary Lutnick said to reporters that the increased tariffs would be kicking in on 1st August, while Trump was “setting the rates and the deals right now.” Earlier, in April, Trump outlined a base rate of 10 percent on most imports, with additional duties reaching as high as 50 percent on certain products. He then postponed the implementation of any rates above the 10 percent base until 9th July, giving countries an extra three weeks to strike agreements with Washington. A number of trade deals are expected soon US Treasury Secretary Bessent, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, said that a series of significant trade announcements could be expected soon. He noted that talks with the EU have progressed well. Bessent also explained that Trump plans to send letters to about 100 smaller trading partners to inform them that without an agreement, their tariffs will revert to the higher levels initially set for 2nd April and then delayed till 9th July. “If you don’t move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level,” he said, adding that these deadlines should spur rapid deals. Since coming back to the Oval, Trump’s tariff measures have ignited an international trade dispute, unsettling financial markets along with prompting many governments to seek protective measures or new agreements, both with America and among themselves. Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council at the White House, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that there could be some flexibility for countries making sincere progress in negotiations. “There are deadlines, and there are things that are close,” he said, suggesting that if talks continue successfully, Trump might allow extensions past the August 1 deadline. Trump himself has repeatedly indicated that India is near an agreement and has expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal with EU, while staying doubtful about the prospects of a trade pact with Japan. In Southeast Asia, Thailand has moved quickly to avoid a looming 36 percent tariff. Meanwhile, an Indian news channel, CNBC-TV18, reported Sunday that New Delhi and Washington are expected to decide on a modest trade agreement within the upcoming 24 – 48 hours.

The buzz emerged after Toncoin (TON), the native token of The Open Network, unveiled an innovative staking-based Golden Visa program . According to TON’s claims, participants can secure long-term residency by staking crypto, rather than meeting the income thresholds. Applicants who stake $100,000 worth of TON for three years and pay a one-time $35,000 processing fee would be eligible for a 10-year golden visa, TON said. Source: TON Per a WAM news agency report , the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) refuted the claims. The three authorities warned against engaging with such unverified offers spreading online. Update: UAE gov has confirmed you can’t get a Golden Visa by investing in crypto. Bummer for $TON buyers, it’s ~6% down from today’s high and the news came out around an hour ago. https://t.co/G2BydgTMFJ pic.twitter.com/LXxcqyh2ZE — Sanjay (@SanjayWeb3) July 6, 2025 The SCA emphasized that crypto investments are governed by established frameworks and are “unrelated” to golden visa eligibility. The agency urged investors to obtain official information from credible sources to avoid misinformation. Similarly, Dubai’s VARA denied the claims, strongly urging crypto investors to deal exclusively with fully licensed and regulated companies. The company TON is neither licensed nor regulated by VARA, the firm confirmed. UAE Golden Visa Eligibility Don’t Include Crypto Investors According to the ICP, golden visas are issued adhering to officially approved frameworks and criteria, which don’t include crypto investors . “Eligible categories include real estate investors, entrepreneurs, exceptional talents, scientists and specialists, top students and graduates, humanitarian pioneers, and frontline workers.” The golden visa enables foreign nationals to live, work, and study in the UAE, with durations ranging from 5-10 years. Further, investors can receive long-term residency if they have public investments worth 2 million UAE dirham ($544,000) or more. CZ Questions TON’s Golden Visa Claims Following TON’s tout over the UAE long-term visa, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao posted on X, questioning whether the speculation is true. “I have not been able to verify with an official source yet,” he wrote, before the authorities released the joint statement. Is this real? It would be awesome IF it is true. But I got conflicting info so far. Some say: this is just so that they charge you $35k to pass your application to an agent, who usually only charge $1k fee. The website seems to give the impression that ""$35k + $100k… https://t.co/u3mySnObWu — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) July 6, 2025 “This program would be awesome if it was true,” he said. “If it is real, we will definitely try to get it on BNB too.” Additionally, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov reposted TON’s announcement on X from a crypto influencer, adding more to the speculation. However, commenting on Durov’s retweet, CZ said, “I like to trust but verify.” “I’d expect something like this to have a government partnership, and announcement.” TON Shot 10% Briefly, Fell Back 6% The Open Network’s native token TON surged 10% on Sunday, following the announcement, only to fall back 6% on Monday after the UAE authorities refuted the claims. TON rose to $3.05 on Sunday, recovering recent market losses. The surge, however, was short-lived. Per Coin Market Cap data , the token plunged within hours to 6% and is trading at $2.83 at press time.

The crypto world is also keeping an eye on major moves. Solana is holding steady at the $143 support level, showing strong signs as momentum builds. Meanwhile, Avalanche is in the spotlight with a steady recovery and fresh on-chain activity, bringing hope to the market. But what really has people talking is BlockDAG (BDAG) . The project has caught attention thanks to its strong link between blockchain use and real-world activity. With a smart Web3 strategy, BlockDAG is doing more than just creating hype. It is bringing new ways for sports fans to connect through digital ownership and interactive content, thanks to its recent partnership with the Seattle Seawolves. Thanks to $332 presale and a growing community, BlockDAG stands out as a project blending usefulness with clear traction. Solana Holds Firm At $143 With Pointing Growth Solana continues to show strength, keeping its ground above $143. This key support level is backed by technical signals that hint at a possible upward path. A bullish MACD crossover has been spotted, which many see as a sign of shifting momentum. This type of pattern often marks the start of positive price movement, especially when steady price action backs it up along with market interest. The present chart pattern fits with Solana’s known bullish trend. The coin has kept a solid base at $143, blocking attempts at downward moves and forming a base for a rise. If this pattern stays in place and buying activity increases, the next resistance point might come into play sooner than expected. Avalanche Eyes $26 With Signs Of Recovery Avalanche has started to turn heads as it shows signs of a possible reversal after moving sideways near its support areas. Technical indicators such as the RSI point out that AVAX might have been oversold, leaving room for a potential push higher. Experts are focusing on the $23 resistance mark, with hopes that momentum could drive the price closer to $26 if positive sentiment holds. Current forecasts for Avalanche point to a slow but stable recovery. Expectations are that the price may settle in the $18 to $20 range over the short term. In the medium term, the outlook is for a steady climb, helped by active on-chain use and user interest. The expansion of Avalanche’s subnet features and wider use in real-life cases could also give added support to this move. BlockDAG Joins Seattle Seawolves As Blockchain Partner! BlockDAG has teamed up with Major League Rugby’s Seattle Seawolves to create a fresh way for fans to connect with the sport using blockchain. This effort aims to bring exclusive digital items, Seawolves-branded NFTs, and shared media content to rugby followers, opening up new ways to engage with the team. As part of this deal, the BlockDAG logo will be seen across official Seawolves online spaces like their site and social channels. A co-branded monthly video series will also roll out, offering match forecasts, player highlights, and deeper looks at the team through player-led clips. This move is not just about adding technology. It is focused on giving true value to fans and helping them feel part of the team’s story. BlockDAG’s growing role in sports ties in with its strong push in crypto. The project has already raised $332M during its presale, with 23.4 billion coins sold. BlockDAG is now in batch 29, priced at $0.0276. Early batch 1 buyers have gained 2,660% so far. At this time, BlockDAG offers a special chance to buy at $0.0016 as part of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, giving people one of the lowest prices seen since the early stages. Summing Up! While Solana shows clear technical strength and Avalanche works on steady gains, BlockDAG brings something extra. Through its link with the Seattle Seawolves, BlockDAG is combining blockchain with community ties. This gives fans digital ownership options and tools linked directly to real sports events. BlockDAG is backed by firm presale results and rising ROI. The project is proving that blockchain can offer real value in everyday life. For those looking at long-term impact and actual user activity, BlockDAG provides a clear example of how useful technology meets growing adoption.

This is a strong sign that the bull market is still going strong, despite recent ups and downs in the crypto market. For months, some experts predicted the market was heading for a long downturn. But the charts and market signals continued to show strength. Important support levels held firm, large investors kept buying, and overall market liquidity kept rising. What’s Happening Now? At the moment, Bitcoin is trading around $109,428. The market has been moving sideways for the past few days, with Bitcoin bouncing between important price zones. To start a new upward rally, the price needs to break past $112,000. If that happens, Bitcoin could enter price discovery mode, where new record highs are possible. The price indicators show there’s still room for growth, and Bitcoin’s momentum remains positive. While the market isn’t likely to jump straight to new highs overnight, a steady climb is expected, followed by periods of correction and consolidation. Key Price Levels to Watch Resistance: $110,000 to $112,000 Support: $103,000 to $105,500 As long as Bitcoin stays above its support levels, the market remains in a healthy position. A break above $112,000 could open the doors to the next big rally. Why This Matters Now This strong weekly close comes at an important time. The U.S. Congress is preparing for Crypto Week starting July 14, where important crypto laws and market rules will be discussed. These decisions could bring new clarity for crypto markets and attract large amounts of money from investors. Many expect a possible rally in late July, a dip in August, and another strong move in September or October.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-07 04:05:21
