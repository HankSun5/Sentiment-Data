BNB Could Find a Deal with the United Arab Emirates, Similar to Toncoin As it is known, Toncoin (TON) announced today that it has entered into a collaboration with the United Arab Emirates and that those who make a payment of $ 35,000 and stake $ 100,000 in TON for three years will have a golden visa valid for 10 years in the United Arab Emirates. The development in question was also retweeted by Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram, the company behind Toncoin. Related News: BREAKING: This Altcoin Has Reached an Agreement with the United Arab Emirates and Will Grant Gold Visas to Token Holders After this, Binance founder Chanpeng Zhao evaluated the development and said that if this is true, they will try a similar initiative for BNB. In other words, in the near future, BNB holders can receive a golden visa from the United Arab Emirates if they pay a certain amount of money and additionally stake their BNB for a certain period of time. Of course, this depends on whether Changpeng Zhao and other BNB officials reach an agreement with the United Arab Emirates. However, Changpeng Zhao is still not sure about the authenticity of Toncoin’s announcement. According to Zhao, such an initiative should have come with a government partnership and announcement. Zhao said that it could still be true, but he has not received direct confirmation. *This is not investment advice.

However, these purchases have had no major impact on the price of the leading digital asset. This has sparked concerns among market participants. Many are wondering why BTC has been stuck within a tight range since it hit an all-time high (ATH) in late May. A recent report by the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant revealed the reason for the weak price momentum despite persistent institutional demand, which analysts say is currently not enough. BTC Stalls Despite Institutional Demand According to CryptoQuant, BTC purchases from U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries belonging to firms like Strategy have declined this year compared to the period from November to December 2024. ETF purchases have decreased from 86,000 BTC in early December to 71,000 BTC in mid-May, and are currently at 40,000 BTC. The trend represents a 53% decline over this period. At the same time, Strategy’s acquisitions have also dropped from 171,000 BTC in December to 16,000 BTC currently. This shows a 90% plunge over the period. Although institutional purchases and ETF flows have kept BTC above $100,000 for a while, further declines could slow price gains. This could be exacerbated by the fact that ETF and institutional buys represent a fraction of the overall BTC demand, which seems to be contracting. At the market’s peak in December, ETF and institutional purchases represented 33% of total Bitcoin demand growth. These entities purchased no more than 257,000 BTC out of the total 771,000 BTC. This indicated that the Bitcoin market had a bigger and unobservable demand coming from other sources. Overall Demand is Contracting Currently, the overall demand for BTC is contracting , having declined by 895,000 BTC over the last 30 days. This metric needs to expand for a sustainable price rally to occur. However, the demand level from institutions right now is not enough to trigger that expansion. CryptoQuant stated that Bitcoin’s annual growth chart reflects how ETF and institutional purchases account for only a portion of demand. Apparent demand has also contracted by 857,000 BTC, significantly offsetting the expansion of ETF and institutional demand (377,000 BTC and 371,000 BTC, respectively). “The bottom line is that ETFs and MSTR’s Bitcoin purchase, while overall positive for Bitcoin price gains, are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs,” the market intelligence firm added.

But is this optimism justified, or is it another echo of hype in an already volatile market? JacktheRippler’s Bold Forecast JacktheRippler is known for his high-conviction predictions and passionate advocacy for XRP. In past statements, he has envisioned XRP reaching triple- and even four-digit price levels, suggesting that holders could see life-changing wealth. #XRP IS ABOUT TO PRINT MULTI MILLIONAIRES! pic.twitter.com/FsFlMa5hBk — JackTheRippler ©️ (@RippleXrpie) July 6, 2025 He had previously made headlines by declaring that 100 XRP could one day be worth $1 million, a projection that assumes XRP reaching $10,000 per token, an extreme but symbolic figure of his confidence in the asset’s future potential. His most recent statement echoes that same belief, suggesting that XRP is about to create a new wave of multimillionaires. While many in the XRP community share his enthusiasm, market analysts advise investors to balance hope with realistic expectations. Institutional Interest and Market Momentum XRP’s current valuation reflects not only investor sentiment but also growing institutional interest. Analysts from Bitget have predicted that XRP could reach $5 by late 2025 , driven by institutional adoption, Ripple’s expanding partnerships, and integration into cross-border payment systems. Ripple’s push for a U.S. banking charter, the launch of RLUSD stablecoin, and increasing engagement with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) add weight to the asset’s long-term value proposition. However, technical indicators show mixed signals. XRP has recently faced resistance above $2.30 and is vulnerable to downside pressure if it fails to hold above $2.20. Some analysts warn that if bearish patterns take hold, XRP could retrace to $1.60 or lower. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Can XRP Create Multimillionaires? JacktheRippler’s assertion depends heavily on XRP achieving unprecedented price levels. To become a multimillionaire solely from XRP, an investor would need to hold a significant amount of the asset—or the price would need to skyrocket well beyond previous highs. A realistic target of $5 to $10 per XRP could deliver substantial returns, but it may not be enough to “print” multimillionaires unless backed by large holdings. Still, if key catalysts align, such as a favorable SEC resolution , the approval of XRP-based ETFs, and broader adoption of Ripple’s technology, then XRP’s upside could surprise even cautious investors. In this scenario, early believers like JacktheRippler may be proven right. JacktheRippler’s statement captures the high hopes and bullish sentiment that continue to surround XRP. While the road to creating multimillionaires is uncertain and depends on regulatory and market-driven factors, the potential for significant gains remains. XRP is at a critical juncture, and whether it fulfills its boldest forecasts or not, it is poised to play a major role in the evolving crypto-financial ecosystem.

Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024.

In October 2023, SPX’s value spiked to $0.023 under bullish control, which was a considerable growth trajectory, but still, it remained far from market attention. December of 2023 saw a low price of $0.008, which was quite low as compared to the price in October as per crypto market historical data. SPX6900 saw a stagnating price movement from January to May 2024, only to rise periodically to $0.015. In September 2024, SPX6900 gained an enormous 5600% from September 12 to October 14, reaching $0.913, resulting in a massive market capitalization. The token made higher spikes till November 7, 2024, adding significantly to its market cap; however, the token’s price has deteriorated afterwards. On November 21, SPX6900 stooped to $0.450, losing 50% of its value, which made holders cautious. However, the token regained its lost value and ended the year at $0.856. The meme token entered January 2025 with a price tag of $0.866, but it soon jumped to $1.55 as its circulation and acceptance increased.

Scott said, “President Trump’s going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don’t move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level.” Those letters are expected to go out Monday. Trump warns trading partners with Monday letter deadline Scott made clear that August 1 isn’t a suggestion or another deadline to kick down the road. “We are saying this is when it’s happening,” he said. “If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that’s your choice.” Scott rejected the idea that this was just another extension or political posturing. The 90-day pause that Trump announced in April, after revealing sharp new tariffs on most major partners, expires this Wednesday. The clock is out. The temporary pause was originally meant to give time for renegotiations. But that window’s closed now. “They’ll start to pay on August 1. The money will start to come into the United States on August 1, in pretty much all cases,” Trump told reporters on Friday. Scott confirmed those payments will start unless something changes this week. Asked if any deals are close, Scott hinted at movement but didn’t name countries. “I would expect to see several big announcements over the next couple of days,” he said. That would put any major updates right before the Wednesday cutoff.

Ethereum Eyes $4,000 as Bullish Momentum Builds Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength as it approaches the psychological $4,000 barrier, supported by growing optimism in the broader crypto market and increasing institutional interest.

Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Amid Growing Demand The project is in Phase 5 presale that is currently selling tokens at $0.03.

47663381,https://thecoinrise.com/galaxy-digitals-mike-novogratz-issues-bold-bitcoin-call/,1751839204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/47663381.jpeg,Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz Issues Bold Bitcoin Call,https://thecoinrise.com/galaxy-digitals-mike-novogratz-issues-bold-bitcoin-call/,"Mike Novogratz, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Galaxy Digital, has made a bold call to investors in the cryptocurrency space. In response to a post on X, Novogratz claimed that there is growing pressure on Jerome Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. This, he maintained, could impact the country’s fiat currency value, hence the need to invest in crypto. Mike Novogratz On Political Interference and Bitcoin as Safe Haven Notably, Novogratz says market participants need to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, as a hedge. He believes that Bitcoin will serve as a safe haven asset for investors if the U.S. dollar weakens due to political pressure on Powell or reckless monetary policy. Given that Bitcoin is decentralized with a limited supply, Novogratz has urged investors to “Buy BTC” as it will become more valuable in the future. According to the Bitcoin advocate, Bill Pulte’s call for Powell’s removal from office, an influential figure with political clout, will not end well. He considers the call to be heading in a financially dangerous direction. Primarily, Novogratz believes that politicizing the Federal Reserve could lead to rate cuts that would negatively impact the dollar. However, such a move to undermine the Fed supports his advocacy for Bitcoin. Is Political Tensions Threatening the Fed’s Independence? For clarity, Jerome Powell’s reluctance to further cut interest rates has sparked hostility towards him. Some Republicans in the U.S. are calling for his resignation . This includes Bill Pulte, who claims there is evidence incriminating Powell. Regardless, Novogratz considers the allegations against Powell as characteristic of a “ Banana Republic move ” which could further weaken the nation’s currency. According to Novogratz, potentially, the move could reduce confidence in U.S. institutions or trigger political instability. Powell had earlier emphasized that interest rate decisions must be based on facts and data, not political predispositions. Amid mounting pressure, some in the financial sector have argued that if Powell gives in, it could compromise the Federal Reserve’s independence. Community Reacts to Novogratz’s Call However, reactions have trailed Novogratz’s post on social media. A user, John Lilic, opines that nothing justifies using $2.5 billion for a renovation. Another user, Jefferson, alleged that Powell was not factual with Congress on the renovation and might face grave issues.

With fresh presales, important tech rollouts, and ETF launches, a few stand out as the best crypto to buy right now. This list skips empty hype and focuses on real signals that matter. From scalable projects to major upgrades, these four choices show what real growth can look like. If you’re ready to get in early on what could bring strong gains through 2025, start with this rundown of the best crypto to buy right now: BlockDAG, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. 1. BlockDAG: Limited-Time $0.0016 Entry Fuels Massive User Rush BlockDAG sits firmly among the best crypto to buy right now, thanks to its $0.0016 offer that runs until August 11. The project has raised over $332 million so far and sold more than 23.6 billion coins. With a locked-in $0.05 launch price, buyers can aim for gains of up to 3,025%. That’s a solid draw for anyone searching for the best crypto to buy right now. Unlike many presales, BlockDAG (BDAG) already has real traction. Its X1 mining app has over 2 million active users. The hardware side is on track, too, with the X30 and X100 mining rigs shipping on July 7, followed by the X10 on August 15. Its upcoming listings on big exchanges like MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, and LBANK add extra trust. On top of that, security audits from CertiK and Halborn confirm the project’s solid foundation. With short-term price drivers and a working ecosystem, BlockDAG stands out as the best crypto to buy right now for anyone wanting a fair entry with big upside. 2. Solana: ETF Approval and 2 M Stakers Fuel Momentum Solana (SOL) is back on the radar as one of the best cryptos to buy right now, especially after launching its U.S. staking ETF on July 2. This new REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF lets buyers tap into SOL’s staking rewards, which is a first in the U.S. for crypto funds. SOL’s network growth adds to its case as the best crypto to buy right now. Wallets holding over 0.1 SOL have reached 11.4 million. Plus, Sol Strategies, a fund focused on Solana, is aiming for a Nasdaq uplisting, boosting trust in the ecosystem. Prices have bounced to around $149.55 after dipping to $145. If SOL can break through the $157–160 resistance, analysts expect more upside. Strong infrastructure and new financial products make Solana a clear pick among the best crypto to buy right now. 3. XRP: EVM Sidechain and Smart Supply Moves XRP’s price action might look calm, moving around $2.19 between $2.15 and $2.20, but its fundamentals tell a different story. Ripple completed its July 1 escrow shuffle, unlocking 500 million XRP and relocking 400 million to manage supply. What really makes XRP one of the best cryptos to buy right now is the live launch of the XRPL EVM sidechain. This upgrade brings Ethereum-like smart contracts to XRP’s network, opening up new use cases. Analysts predict XRP could push above $3 if the ETF market gains wider approval. While a climb to $5 will take more time, the building blocks are there. With smart contract support, careful supply controls, and real use cases, XRP deserves its spot on any list of the best crypto to buy right now. 4. Dogecoin: Loyal Community and Breakout Pattern Ahead Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to attract attention as one of the best cryptos to buy right now, trading at around $0.163 after rebounding from $0.157 support. Technical charts show a double bottom pattern, which many see as a bullish signal. If DOGE breaks through the $0.175 – $0.180 range, it could target $0.192 – $0.205 next. If not, it might slide back toward $0.138 – $0.150. Despite the lack of major tech updates, its loyal community keeps it strong among the best crypto to buy right now. Some chart watchers believe DOGE could touch the $1 mark again, with projections up to $1.17 based on Fibonacci patterns. A bounce from its long-term support adds weight to the argument that Dogecoin remains the best crypto to buy right now for traders who like big swings. In Summary BlockDAG, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin each stand out as the best crypto to buy right now because they bring more than just price swings; they have clear user traction, strong tech upgrades, and solid community support. Whether you want early-stage potential like BlockDAG’s $0.0016 entry or proven projects like SOL, XRP, and DOGE, timing is key. Watch their roadmaps, track their levels, and position smartly for the next big run.

But behind every decentralized bet is a cryptocurrency making it all work. In 2025, the top coins are built for scalable, fair, and fast blockchain gambling. In this review, we break down the best cryptos for betting in 2025 chosen for their real-world utility, low transaction costs, network stability, and widespread adoption across Web3 gambling ecosystems. 1. USDT (Tether): The Reliable Stablecoin for Betting Tether (USDT) is the go-to cryptocurrency for players who want consistency. As a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, USDT eliminates price volatility, allowing users to wager with confidence that their bankroll’s value won’t shift with the market. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Accepted across most Web3 casinos and sportsbooks Available on multiple chains: Ethereum, Tron, BNB Chain, Polygon, and more Near-instant transfers with minimal fees, especially on TRC-20 and BEP-20 networks Ideal for casual bettors, high-volume players, and professional sharps Whether you're placing single bets or streaming real-time wagers, USDT offers stable value and broad utility—making it the foundation for scalable and low-risk gambling. 2. ETH (Ethereum): The Engine of Fair, Smart-Contract Betting Ethereum remains the smart contract king, powering thousands of decentralized gambling apps (dApps) and casinos. With ETH, every bet can be automated, provably fair, and trustless—no human interference, no rigged games. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Smart contract support for provably fair games and trustless payouts Compatible with all major DeFi wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) Layer 2 scaling (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism) reduces gas costs significantly Integrated with a broad ecosystem of prediction markets and GameFi dApps ETH is ideal for players who want transparency and fairness baked into the code, not just promised in the terms and conditions. 3. SOL (Solana): Ultra-Fast, Ultra-Cheap Bets at Scale Solana has exploded in popularity due to its lightning-fast throughput and ultra-low fees, making it perfect for high-frequency, micro-betting, or mobile-first casino environments. It’s also fueling a new wave of lightweight Web3 gambling apps. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Transaction speed: 65,000+ TPS, confirmed in seconds Fees: Fractions of a cent, ideal for small, rapid wagers Growing number of Solana-native casinos and sportsbooks Smooth mobile UX and easy integration with Phantom wallet SOL gives players a real-time gambling experience, even during network congestion, without burning through fees. 4. TRX (Tron): A Quiet Giant for Cost-Efficient Gambling Tron may not make headlines daily, but it's a powerful tool for cost-effective blockchain betting. Thanks to extremely low transaction costs and its popularity among gambling dApps, TRX is the currency of choice in regions where affordability matters most. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Minimal fees, even for high-frequency play Widely used in TRON-based betting platforms and lotteries Fast transaction confirmations Seamless USDT support via TRC-20 TRX is excellent for players in emerging markets or anyone seeking fast and frictionless transactions with no surprises. 5. BNB (Binance Coin): Utility Meets Liquidity BNB has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem beyond Binance. On BNB Chain (BSC), it supports a thriving set of gambling dApps that combine low gas fees with smart contract capability. Benefits for Blockchain Gambling: Ultra-low transaction fees on BSC Hundreds of BNB-powered casinos and sportsbooks Excellent DeFi wallet support and user liquidity Supports BEP-20 stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and BUSD BNB blends utility and user familiarity, making it a smart bet for seasoned DeFi gamblers.

With community sentiment, viral trends, and celebrity brand power driving short-term price action, investors are asking the obvious: which one has the momentum to pull ahead? This analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , a crypto-native communications agency specializing in narrative positioning and performance-led media strategy. OFFICIAL MUSK (MUSK) Eyes a Leap Beyond Its Resistance Source: tradingview OFFICIAL MUSK (MUSK) is currently trading between five ten-thousandths of a cent to roughly two thousandths of a cent. It's trying to push past the nearest resistance of about three-thousandths of a cent. If successful, it might jump towards a strong point almost midway to a half-cent. This move would mean a potential growth of several times the current price. However, hitting its second resistance could imply a massive spike, nearly multiplying its value by about seven times. The coin's movement depends on breaking these levels, as its averages suggest a promise for upward shifts if momentum continues. Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) Holds Steady Amid Turbulent Crypto Market Source: tradingview OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) trades between $8.66 and $9.65 today. Its price has slipped over 21% in the past month. Yet, it has climbed almost 130% over six months. This shows both volatility and growth potential. If TRUMP pushes past the resistance level at just over $10, a steady path to $11 could boost its value by around 15%. Its current statistics suggest a neutral market vibe, neither overbought nor oversold. While the coin's journey has been rocky, its recent performance hints at potential gains if the broader market strengthens. Traders eye support at just over $8, which could act as a safety net for now.

Conclusion The battle between OFFICIAL MUSK and OFFICIAL TRUMP highlights how meme coins now move in step with public narratives, political sentiment, and online engagement. While both tokens have carved out distinct audiences and market behavior, sustained traction will depend on how well each community mobilizes. As the meme coin cycle matures, projects looking to stay ahead will need more than a recognizable name. Narrative precision, timing, and visibility across high-impact media channels are quickly becoming essential.

Grab the Next 1000x Meme Coin — Get Ready for $AGNT Listing Now Dogecoin's Journey: Is the Meme Coin Ready for a Comeback? Dogecoin began in 2013 as a joke, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the ""Doge"" meme. Created by engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to Bitcoin. Despite its playful origins, Dogecoin has grown into a significant cryptocurrency with a dedicated community. Using the Scrypt algorithm, Dogecoin operates on a peer-to-peer network with an unlimited supply. Its faster block time allows quicker transactions than Bitcoin. Celebrity endorsements, especially from Elon Musk, have boosted its popularity and kept it in the public eye over the years. Historically, Dogecoin has been volatile. It hit an all-time high in May 2021 during a hype-driven rally but has since experienced fluctuations. By 2025, it continues to be influenced by market trends and the enthusiasm of its supporters. Price predictions for Dogecoin are mixed. Some forecasts see potential growth, like CoinCodex's projection for significant increases by 2030. Others are more cautious, noting competition from other cryptocurrencies and possible regulatory challenges. Long-term predictions range from moderate gains to ambitious highs. In today's market, Dogecoin still appeals to many. Its strong fan base and cultural impact keep it relevant. While it faces challenges, its unique story and widespread recognition make it a coin to watch. As the crypto landscape evolves, Dogecoin's journey is far from over. Shiba Inu's Journey: From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a meme coin hoping to mimic Dogecoin's hype. It gained quick fame thanks to mentions by Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on Ethereum, SHIB began as a simple payment token but soon expanded its ambitions. The creators launched a decentralized exchange and an NFT project, adding real utility to SHIB. These moves attracted more users and set SHIB apart from other meme coins. The ecosystem grew with ventures into the metaverse, games, and merchandise. By 2025, SHIB has experienced notable price movements. After its rise in 2021, it hovered around $0.00001. Predictions suggested it could reach up to $0.0000526 by 2025. This reflects optimism about SHIB's projects and community support. Bullish indicators point to potential growth, but competition is fierce. New meme coins like BONK and PEPE pose challenges. SHIB's evolution and innovation are key to maintaining its market position. SHIB's future hinges on its ambitious projects and community. While past performance isn't a guarantee, developments up to 2025 indicate SHIB could stay influential in the crypto world. PEPE Coin: The Meme That Took Over the Crypto World In the early 2000s, a cartoon frog named Pepe, created by Matt Furie, became an internet sensation. This meme has now evolved into a cryptocurrency sensation known as PEPE Coin. Embracing its meme origins, PEPE Coin has captured the hearts of many with its simplicity and strong community spirit. PEPE is a deflationary meme coin built on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. The project's goals are straightforward and fun, summarized in three phases: Meme, Vibe and HODL, and Meme Takeover. Unlike others, PEPE doesn't make lofty promises. It stays true to its meme roots, focusing on community and transparency. By 2024, PEPE had soared to an all-time high of $0.00002825. After this peak, it faced a significant correction, losing about 68.59% of its value. This volatility is typical in the crypto world, especially for meme coins. However, the dedicated community believes in its potential for a rebound. Looking ahead, various predictions paint an optimistic future for PEPE. By 2025, forecasts suggest it could reach up to $0.000055. Predictions for 2030 are even more hopeful, with some expecting the coin to hit as high as $0.000159. By 2050, there's speculation that PEPE could achieve remarkable heights, reflecting its enduring appeal. PEPE Coin's blend of meme culture and crypto technology makes it a unique player in the market. Its simple approach and strong community support position it well in the current cycle. While the crypto space is unpredictable, PEPE's journey shows that a meme can become a movement. Bonk (BONK): Solana's Meme Coin with Big Dreams Bonk (BONK) is a meme cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain. Launched in December 2022, it brings fun and community to Solana's fast, low-cost network. Unlike Solana's native token SOL, which also handles governance, BONK focuses solely on user transactions. BONK offers liquidity and simple transfers within Solana. Its straightforward purpose attracts users seeking easy transactions without governance complexities. As alternatives to Ethereum gain traction due to fees and speed, BONK positions itself as a user-friendly option. Since launch, BONK's price has grown significantly. In the bull market after its release, the token surged alongside SOL. By 2025, BONK had increased over 770% from its initial price, showing strong community interest. Currently, BONK seems attractive due to promotions and benefits for Solana users. But some experts warn about its anonymous founders and simple white paper. Potential investors should research thoroughly due to these concerns. Future price predictions vary. Some forecasts suggest BONK could reach $0.00009368 by the end of 2025, with continued growth in following years. By 2030, optimistic projections place BONK much higher, indicating potential for long-term gains. Conclusion While established memecoins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK have attracted many traders, their short-term potential appears limited. As the market evolves, investors may seek alternatives that offer greater opportunities for significant gains. Enter Codename:Pepe crypto, the ultimate undercover agent bringing true intelligence to the crypto scene. Unlike others, it doesn't pretend—it provides real assistance in making money amid the meme coin frenzy.

47665795,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=761334,1751841947,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47665795.jpeg,BRICS pushes AI data rules as it remains yet to make any progress on de-dollarization,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/brics-ai-rules-no-progress-de-dollarization/,"Leaders from BRICS met in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday and demanded controls on how artificial intelligence uses data, while still getting nowhere on the cross-border payments system they’ve been promising since 2015. According to Reuters , the bloc released a draft statement calling for protection against unauthorized data scraping and demanding fair compensation from tech companies training AI on unlicensed content. These demands come as AI models built by US and European firms continue to mine global content with little oversight or payment. The two-day BRICS summit included multiple closed-door meetings on AI and digital regulation. But behind that digital talk was yet another stall-out on a bigger goal: removing the US dollar from trade between BRICS nations. Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, along with the newer members like Iran, have now spent a decade floating a cross-border payments system. Brics fails to deliver on payment system after decade of talk At the summit’s opening in Brazil, BRICS members recommitted to the so-called BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative, which has been under discussion since 2015. They assigned finance ministers and central bank heads to continue debating it. A survey from Brazil’s central bank was circulated, but no decisions were made, and no deadlines were set. The delay comes as President Donald Trump’s policies hammer the global position of the dollar. The greenback had its worst Q1 performance since 1973. Trump’s trade war and pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve rattled investors and weakened confidence in American assets. With Wall Street bleeding, emerging markets had a clear opening, but BRICS couldn’t act fast enough. All ten BRICS nations have agreed on the need for non-dollar trade, but technical issues keep getting in the way. Three officials said central banking infrastructure in some member states is still not ready. Integrating systems between countries with non-convertible currencies, like Iran’s rial or Russia’s ruble, has slowed everything. And sanctions on Russia and Iran have raised legal and compliance concerns for the rest of the bloc. Even deciding how to share the cost of new infrastructure is causing friction. Two officials said there’s disagreement on how to build, pay for, and govern any shared payment network. The bloc’s recent expansion only made things harder. One member said some countries don’t even believe the benefits of a unified system are worth the cost. Their existing bilateral trade deals work just fine without extra tech. None of the officials wanted to speak publicly, but confirmed that progress will remain slow. China expands yuan as Trump issues 100% threat While others drag their feet, China is pushing ahead. Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China, announced new plans to expand the yuan’s reach. In a recent speech, Pan said China’s financial markets would open further to global investors. Beijing is also launching its first domestic currency futures, aimed at competing with products in Chicago and Singapore. Its payment system, CIPS, is now expanding to include more foreign banks. Trump, now in his second term in the White House, isn’t staying quiet. He’s threatened to slap 100% tariffs on any BRICS country that tries to bypass the dollar in trade. That threat has added urgency to talks within BRICS, but hasn’t stopped them. Officials said the dollar-retirement discussions are still going — even if painfully slow. The bloc also introduced a proposal for the New Investment Platform (NIP), meant to ease reliance on dollar-denominated financing. But it’s already stuck in early-stage debates. A document seen by Bloomberg allegedly showed that countries can’t agree on how to run it or what exactly it would fund. “Given the variety of approaches and proposals raised, and the complex nature of the issues involved, further technical dialogue will be essential,” the document said. Brazilian official Tatiana Rosito, who works in the Finance Ministry, said the goal is to avoid converting through dollars when trading. “Banks say that, depending on the period in which you carry out the operation, they may need to use the rate converting renminbi to dollars,” Tatiana said in an interview. “But the goal in the end is you one day don’t have it.” Tatiana added that with enough volume in trade and investments, it may become possible to have direct rates between local currencies like real-renminbi, real-rupee, and real-rand. But there’s no timeline. No commitment. Just hypotheticals. The BRICS statement also pointed out that interest rate hikes in wealthy economies are deepening debt crises in developing ones. “High interest rates and tighter financing conditions worsen debt vulnerabilities in many countries,” it said. To address this, BRICS announced a Multilateral Guarantees Initiative called BMG, which will be rolled out inside the New Development Bank (NDB). The program won’t need new capital contributions for now. Its goal is to boost credit access in member nations and across the Global South, especially those struggling to raise funds in hard currency markets.

So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million.

ONDO Price Structure & POL Charts Signal July Breakouts,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-buyer-battles-unlocks-50m-coins-daily-ondo-price-structure-pol-charts-signal-july-breakouts/,"The crypto space is heating up fast, and traders are chasing every signal with urgency. Right now, the ONDO price structure and POL price update are flashing setups that could lead to serious gains. ONDO has defended its support zone around $0.55 and looks ready to pop, while POL is clinging to the crucial $0.18 level that could trigger a breakout toward $0.21. But the real excitement is building around BlockDAG (BDAG) . With its $0.0016 presale entry locked until August 11 and 50 million BDAG coins up for grabs daily through its Buyer Battles, BlockDAG isn’t just catching attention, it’s creating serious urgency. With $332 million already raised, this might be the best crypto to buy now before the next leg up. ONDO Eyes $1 as Key Price Level Holds Firm The ONDO price structure has held strong support at $0.55, a level that’s shaping up as a launchpad. With consolidation tightening, traders are betting on a breakout toward $0.70 if volume picks up. Momentum is building. If ONDO pushes past nearby resistance at $0.80, it could open the door for a rally toward $1. The current price structure looks solid, and holding above $0.55 keeps the bullish scenario in play. All eyes are on whether the breakout fires this week or next. POL Sets Up for a July Rally With $0.18 in Focus According to “World Of Charts,” the POL price update shows a clear bullish setup forming. The token is holding just above $0.18, and if that support sticks, traders could see a 12% to 13% move toward the $0.21 level. That target lines up with a key descending trendline and the appearance of a rounded bottom pattern. But it all hinges on $0.18. If POL stays above it, the setup remains intact. If it drops below, the breakout case fades. The next few candles are critical for traders aiming to ride a fast upside move. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Creates Daily Winners! Forget the usual presale routine, BlockDAG is changing the game. Its Buyer Battles feature brings live action into the mix, turning every day into a fresh opportunity. Each day, 50 million BDAG coins are set aside. If they aren’t fully bought, they go straight to the top buyer of the day. That’s right, the person who times it best or buys most during a given day can walk away with tens or even hundreds of thousands of BDAG. And with the presale price fixed at $0.0016 until August 11, far below the $0.05 launch rate, the ROI potential is massive. So far, BlockDAG has pulled in over $332 million and sold more than 23.6 billion coins. Traders are already using strategies like stacking smaller buys or pouncing during low-volume windows to win those daily rewards. This isn’t about how much you spend, it’s about how smart you are when you spend it. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11 is closing in fast. With the presale window narrowing, FOMO is hitting hard. Even if you don’t win the daily battle, you still lock in BDAG at its cheapest rate. That’s why so many are calling this one of the most unique and rewarding entries in the market right now. Closing Thoughts The ONDO price structure has held strong at $0.55, keeping the path open toward $0.70 and possibly $1. At the same time, the POL price update suggests a 12% to 13% breakout to $0.21, if it holds firm above $0.18. But BlockDAG is doing more than showing signals; it’s delivering results in real time. With over $332 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and a unique Buyer Battles setup offering 50 million BDAG in daily rewards, this presale isn’t slowing down. Add in the $0.0016 limited-time price and the August 11 Global Launch release, and it’s clear why many see BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy now .

47666859,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73571,1751842995,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Bollinger Bands Signal Incoming Big Pump,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-bollinger-bands-signal-incoming-big-pump/,"XRP is on the verge of what could be a significant price move , as one of the most reliable technical indicators—the Bollinger Bands—has tightened to levels not seen since November 2024. This signal, highlighted by renowned analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO, is now capturing the attention of traders and investors across the crypto space. In a chart shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO pointed out that XRP is currently trading in the narrowest range since its explosive breakout in late 2024. That historical move saw XRP rally from below $0.70 to over $3.00 in just weeks. With a similar pattern forming now, speculation is growing that a new rally may be imminent. Tight Bollinger Bands: A Signal of Imminent Volatility Bollinger Bands are designed to measure market volatility. When these bands contract sharply, forming what’s known as a “squeeze,” it signals that price volatility has dropped to unusually low levels. This often precedes a large breakout as the market builds momentum behind the scenes. The #XRP Bollinger Bands are extremely tight. BIG PUMP INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/btbtZkR8pb — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 6, 2025 Currently, XRP’s Bollinger Bands on the 3-day chart are the tightest they’ve been in over eight months. Historically, this kind of compression has led to dramatic price shifts, most often in the direction of the prevailing trend. With XRP maintaining strength above the $2.00 level, many analysts believe an upward breakout is the most likely outcome. Echoes of November 2024’s Rally The current setup bears a striking resemblance to the consolidation seen just before XRP’s massive rally in November 2024. At that time, the market also experienced a period of unusually low volatility, followed by a surge that took XRP to multi-year highs. Now, in July 2025, the same pattern is unfolding. The price has been trading within a narrow band between $2.00 and $2.50, and the Bollinger Bands have once again constricted, suggesting that another major move is around the corner. As history often rhymes in financial markets, traders are paying close attention to what could be the start of a new bullish wave. Strong Fundamentals Reinforce the Setup Beyond the chart signals, XRP’s ecosystem has continued to grow in strength. Ripple’s recent developments, particularly the launch and integration of RLUSD, have added new layers of utility for the digital asset. RLUSD, Ripple’s fully-backed stablecoin, is now accepted as collateral by Hidden Road , a leading institutional prime broker. This positions XRP as a key component in cross-margin trading strategies that bridge traditional and digital finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Such real-world utility and institutional adoption bolster investor confidence and provide a strong foundation for long-term growth. As more financial platforms explore the integration of XRP and RLUSD into their liquidity models, the asset’s market relevance continues to deepen. Anticipation Builds Across the Crypto Market With XRP holding firm and Bollinger Bands signaling suppressed volatility, market sentiment is becoming increasingly bullish. Traders are now watching closely for a decisive breakout above the $2.50–$2.70 range, which could ignite a surge of momentum and trigger widespread buying interest. STEPH IS CRYPTO emphasized that this kind of setup rarely goes unnoticed for long. The market is coiling, and a breakout, likely to the upside, may be just a matter of time. XRP Poised for a Breakout All signs are pointing to an imminent move for XRP . The tightening of Bollinger Bands, historical patterns, and growing ecosystem utility form a compelling bullish narrative. As traders prepare for the next leg of price action, one thing is clear: XRP is not a token to ignore right now. A major breakout may be just around the corner.

With increased attention on cryptocurrencies like TRX and BNB, a surprising contender has come into play: AGNT. As the market experiences a bull run, AGNT is being touted as a potential top performer this quarter, intriguing many in the trading community.

The swift sellout underscores strong community interest and bullish sentiment surrounding the project.

According to its developers, the AI framework is designed to: Spot Emerging Meme Coins Analyze Market Sentiment Deliver Actionable Trading Insights Optimize Automated Trading The development team is actively enhancing both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the platform evolves in tandem with the broader crypto ecosystem. Codename:Pepe brings together two of the most compelling forces in today’s market: AI innovation and meme coin virality. With a focus on real utility, intelligent automation, and community-powered growth, it stands out among the latest wave of crypto launches. As the listing date approaches and momentum builds, the limited presale supply and tiered pricing model could make $AGNT one of the top-performing tokens post-launch, possibly achieving 1000x growth from its presale price. Grab the Next 1000x Meme Coin — Get Ready for $AGNT Listing Now TRON Takes Off: Why TRX Is the Crypto to Watch in 2025 and Beyond TRON is a public blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. It's open-source and works smoothly with Ethereum. This means developers can easily move their apps from Ethereum to TRON. The platform aims to make transactions fast and cheap, giving users and developers a better experience. TRON uses a Proof-of-Stake system. This involves 27 super representatives who validate transactions and earn rewards. New blocks are added every three seconds, much faster than some older blockchains. This speed allows TRON to handle more transactions efficiently. In early 2018, TRX, the coin that runs on the TRON network, hit an all-time high of $0.3004. Then, in December 2024, it surged nearly 100% to reach $0.4407. Although it has dipped since then, many are hopeful. With Donald Trump's second term, there's buzz about crypto growth. His World Liberty Financial platform bought $4.66 million worth of TRX in January 2025. Experts have positive predictions for TRX. By the end of 2025, it could reach up to $0.45. In 2026, it might climb to $0.60, and by 2030, it could hit $1.20. These numbers suggest strong potential for growth. TRON's technology and recent developments make it stand out in the crypto market. Its fast transactions and compatibility with Ethereum position it well for future success. Many are considering TRX as a promising investment in the current market cycle. Binance Coin's Future: Will BNB Soar Again? Binance Coin (BNB) powers the Binance exchange, one of the world's largest crypto platforms. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum network, BNB moved to the Binance Smart Chain for better speed and lower fees. It helps users trade hundreds of tokens and pay for services like travel and loans. BNB has strong potential due to its many uses. Binance buys back and burns BNB tokens each quarter, reducing supply and possibly increasing value. The coin also benefits from the popularity of new meme coins on the platform, boosting trading volumes since 2024. In December 2024, BNB hit an all-time high of $793.35. Although it dipped slightly, it's still up 135% over the past year. Analysts like Altcoin Sherpa believe BNB can break past previous highs due to strong trading patterns. However, some experts, like W.E. Messamore, caution about regulatory challenges that could impact its growth. The current market cycle shows promise for BNB. Predictions suggest it could surpass $1,000 in 2025 and reach up to $1,600 by 2026. By 2030, forecasts vary widely, with some expecting prices over $7,000. The long-term outlook depends on factors like market trends and regulatory developments. Overall, BNB's performance and growth potential make it a coin to watch. Its expanding use cases and Binance's strong position in the market could lead to new heights in the years ahead. Conclusion In the current bull run, established coins like TRX and BNB may offer limited short-term gains. Their growth is steady but might not match the rapid returns that newer projects can achieve. Codename:Pepe crypto presents a compelling opportunity for those seeking maximum profits. It leverages real artificial intelligence to identify promising meme coins, predict market trends, and provide early trading signals. With a capped supply and a community-driven model, it offers the potential for significant returns and active participation in its mission.

The state-run newspaper RIA Novosti reported that the ministry is working on the plan with the Federal Tax Service and the Ministry of Digital Development. The registry, the ministry claims, will serve as a central database of all the equipment used for cryptocurrency mining in the nation. Crypto Mining Rigs: Russians Must Register Hardware Russia’s Deputy Minister of Energy, Petr Konyushenko, told RIA Novosti that the ministry has sent its draft document to regions with high levels of crypto mining activity. A power station in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Lodo27 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Konyushenko said the registry will let Moscow “precisely identify” who in the nation is “using electricity to mine cryptocurrencies.” This will allow regulators and tax officials to ensure miners are complying with mining-related laws. It will also help boost tax revenues, the ministry claimed. Konyushenko said: “This is a step toward legalizing the industry and reducing illegal energy consumption.” While legal crypto mining is on the rise in Russia, so too is the illegal sector. Scores of industrial crypto miners are known to be operating all across the country. Many use illegal connections to power grids. And others use subsidized power intended for residential households to power their data centers. The database will require all miners to submit rig serial numbers and device models. They will also have to submit details on other mining-related equipment. The Energy Ministry and the Industry Ministry first proposed creating a national crypto mining equipment registry back in February this year . A Russian crypto miner shows off his equipment. (Source: Chudesniy Kitai!/RuTube) Critics Unsure About Ministry Plans Government officials said a unified registry of “equipment without which cryptocurrency mining is impossible” was needed. The idea is not without its vociferous critics. These include the lawmaker Anton Gorelkin, one of the architects of Russia’s crypto mining laws. Gorelkin said it was “unclear how exactly this registry will help combat illegal mining.” He added that Moscow already has the “necessary tools to identify miners who use electricity illegally.” Legalize Black-market Rigs, Says Lawmaker The lawmaker also explained that Moscow needed to focus its efforts on helping miners legalize crypto mining equipment bought using sanctions-evading “shadow schemes.” Russia is regularly switching off mobile internet connections in large swaths of the country for security reasons https://t.co/Hv1uW7cWzn — Bloomberg (@business) July 3, 2025 This would help miners “legalize” mining rigs they buy on the black market and “quickly add them to the registry,” Gorelkin said. The media outlet RBC reported that officials (including customs officers) are considering issuing an “amnesty” for crypto miners who have “no other choice” than to buy rigs through underground channels in a bid to evade sanctions regimes. Earlier this month, police in Sayansk announced they had shut down an illegal crypto mining farm fitted with 240 mining rigs. Officers said the farm was using enough electricity to power 2,000 apartments. Also this month, police in St. Petersburg said they seized an undisclosed number of crypto mining rigs operating in a warehouse in an industrial zone near the iconic Mitrofanievsky Highway.

Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are both expected to formally withdraw their appeals, a move that would bring immediate finality to Judge Analisa Torres’s landmark 2023 ruling. As highlighted by Jungle Inc Crypto News on X, this outcome requires no further court action. Once the appeals are dropped, the case is over, no retrial, no revisions, and no delays. Judge Torres’s Ruling Becomes Final Judge Torres’s ruling in July 2023 delivered a partial win for both sides. The judge ruled that XRP is not a security in itself, and Ripple’s sales of XRP on secondary markets through programmatic means did not constitute a breach of securities laws. However, the court found that Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP were unregistered securities offerings. This split decision gave both the SEC and Ripple grounds to appeal. If Ripple and the SEC drop their appeals, it’s over. Judge Torres’s ruling becomes final immediately — no retrial, no revisions, no extra steps. Marc Fagel (former SEC Regional Director) confirmed: The moment the appeals are withdrawn, her decision stands as law. … pic.twitter.com/9Q4aMNLvSn — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) July 5, 2025 Following a denied settlement attempt, Ripple and the SEC seem poised to move by dropping their appeals. Once the appeals are formally withdrawn, Judge Torres’s opinion becomes the final word on the matter. No further input or signature from the judge is necessary. The ruling becomes legally binding and will stand as a precedent in future cases involving digital assets. No More Legal Delays or Courtroom Drama As Jungle Inc Crypto News succinctly stated, “No more delays. No more court drama.” This sentiment captures the relief that many XRP holders and industry participants feel after years of legal uncertainty. The end of the appeals process marks the legal resolution of a case that began in December 2020 and sent shockwaves across the crypto sector. The decision will no longer be subject to modification or reversal. Ripple can now operate without the overhang of active litigation, and XRP can move forward with its legal status clearly defined in the United States. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Defining Moment for XRP and U.S. Crypto Regulation With the case concluding, Judge Torres’s ruling will become a foundational legal reference in future disputes over how U.S. securities laws apply to digital assets. The distinction her court made—that the manner of token sales matters more than the token itself- could shape regulatory enforcement and even influence how lawmakers draft future crypto legislation. For XRP, this could pave the way for renewed exchange listings, deeper institutional adoption, and enhanced global integration into payment systems. For Ripple, the decision affirms its business model while clearing a major regulatory hurdle, positioning the company to accelerate its operations and partnerships. What Happens Next? At this stage, all that remains is for Ripple and the SEC to submit their notices of appeal withdrawal. Once filed, the case will be formally closed, and no further legal proceedings will follow. As Jungle Inc Crypto News pointed out, “Her decision stands as law,” signaling a definitive end to years of courtroom battles. With both parties now ready to move on , this moment marks a rare sense of closure in an industry often marked by regulatory ambiguity. For Ripple, for XRP holders, and the broader crypto ecosystem, dropping the appeals will represent not just the end of a case, but the beginning of a new chapter.

Infrastructure platforms are gaining prominence for their groundbreaking solutions, while a fresh player is capturing attention through viral trends. This piece delves into how these entities are influencing the market during this bullish surge. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Hyperliquid: Revolutionizing DeFi with Speed and Zero Fees Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform transforming decentralized finance (DeFi). It has built its own Layer 1 blockchain from the ground up, focusing on speed and scalability. With its unique HyperBFT consensus mechanism, transactions are fast and secure.

Its focus on efficiency and transparency sets it apart in the DeFi space.

While many cryptocurrencies face ups and downs, Ondo's focus on real-world assets and compliance could make it an attractive option for those interested in both traditional finance and blockchain innovation.

At the same time, another digital asset is making waves with a $14 million presale amid shifting market trends. XYZVerse is gaining traction as investors reevaluate their positions. This situation highlights changing dynamics in the crypto market and raises questions about what comes next. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.

With aims to drive real-world adoption and incentivize XRP integration across borders, the initiative signals a bold push to solidify XRP’s utility. But with price action lagging behind the headlines, investors are left wondering: will this global expansion translate into a meaningful price surge, or is XRP’s rally already priced in? XRP Poised for Potential Gains Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between a little over $2, showing some lively movement. Recent data suggests the price could rise, challenging its nearest resistance at just under $2.50. The coin has climbed nearly 4% over the past week and more than 8% over the month. However, its six-month performance has seen a slight downturn of over 6%. If it breaks resistance, XRP could target under $2.80, marking a potential climb of roughly 20% from its current price range. With a steady Relative Strength Index above 70, XRP exhibits strong momentum, signaling possible continued growth. Conclusion XRP’s technicals hint at strength, but its price still hovers below key resistance levels. The global reach of the Accelerator program may unlock broader adoption, yet price movement will ultimately depend on sustained momentum and market sentiment. If XRP can build on recent gains and clear resistance, the next leg upward may follow—but until then, traders remain cautious, watching closely to see if utility will finally ignite a breakout.

While the broader market remains cautious, a handful of meme coins are quietly gaining momentum—showing early technical signs of life and community interest. In this article, we spotlight BOME, Turbo, and Popcat—three meme tokens with breakout potential that could ride the next big wave in this high-risk, high-reward corner of crypto. BOME Eyes Potential Surge Amid Current Price Movements Source: tradingview The cryptocurrency BOOK OF MEME (BOME) is currently oscillating between $0.001395 and $0.001761. It's on the edge of breaking its nearest resistance at $0.0018943. Should it pass this mark, optimism suggests a climb to around $0.0022603, marking a potential growth of over 20%. With the coin riding above its 10-day moving average but below the 100-day, there's a mixed sentiment in the market. Still, if it dips, the nearest support stands strong at $0.0011623. While the MACD hovers near zero, traders are closely watching for signs of bullish momentum. The balance between hold and fold is delicate, as any shift could lead to rapid movement. Turbo (TURBO) Shows Slow Growth but Eyes Higher Levels Source: tradingview Turbo , currently priced between three to four-tenths of a cent, is inching upwards. Its recent performance saw a slight dip of over two percent in the last week and month, with a drop of about sixty-four percent over six months. However, Turbo has potential upside, especially if it breaks past the nearest resistance around four-tenths of a cent. Achieving the next resistance point could mean an increase of around thirty percent. The market indicators, with RSI and Stochastic hovering above 50, suggest moderate buying interest. If Turbo taps into its potential, continuing upward could push it closer to half a cent, marking notable growth from its current range. Popcat (POPCAT) Eyes Potential but Faces Challenges Source: tradingview Popcat (POPCAT) has seen some better days, currently trading within the low $0.30 range. It's inching closer to a resistance level just below $0.40 but struggles to maintain momentum. The recent price slide has brought a decline of over 10% in a month and more than 65% over six months. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) under 50, the coin shows a lack of strong buying interest. However, should POPCAT break past $0.37, it could aim for the $0.44 mark, signaling a potential gain of over 20%. For now, traders are wary, keeping an eye on both support levels just below a quarter and $0.15 as fallback points. Conclusion While the meme coin space is famously unpredictable, BOME, Turbo, and Popcat each show glimmers of promise under current conditions. With key resistance levels in sight and growing market attention, even modest surges could trigger wider momentum. As history has shown with coins like PEPE, all it takes is a spark—making these three meme tokens worth watching closely in the coming weeks.

NEW YORK – July 7, 2025 – Plume , the first full-stack chain and ecosystem purpose-built for real world asset finance (RWAfi), has announced a strategic integration with TRON to launch SkyLink across the TRON Network. TRON’s vast global user base, which generates some of the highest stablecoin volume and transaction throughput in crypto, now has direct access to asset-backed yields from tokenized U.S. Treasuries, private credit, and other real-world financial products issued on Plume. This marks a major development for TRON, historically known as the leading decentralized payments and settlement network in emerging markets. With SkyLink now live, stablecoins circulating on TRON can be natively deployed into RWA yield strategies and institutional-grade investment assets – while expanding Plume’s reach to one of the largest and most active DeFi user bases in the world. “TRON is one of the most systemically important networks in crypto today – moving billions in stablecoins daily across global economies,” said Chris Yin, CEO of Plume. “This integration allows Plume to leverage TRON’s leading settlement network and provide broader access to real-world assets and real yields. SkyLink launching on TRON will enable more users and institutions to preserve dollar liquidity while earning sustainable returns.” SkyLink is Plume’s omnichain RWA yield distribution protocol, enabling secure, permissionless access to institutional-grade financial products across chains. Leveraging LayerZero’s SyncPools architecture, SkyLink ensures that yield is streamed continuously and transparently to users’ wallets via mirrored YieldTokens, while underlying liquidity remains locked on each native chain – including TRON. “TRON is built for speed, scale, and accessibility, and this collaboration with Plume brings a new dimension to that mission,” said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for the TRON DAO. “By integrating SkyLink, we’re enabling users around the world to access compliant and institutional-grade, dollar-denominated investment products like treasuries, corporate bonds, and structure credit directly from their wallets or custodians, unlocking a new era of financial empowerment through DeFi.” SkyLink’s mirrored YieldTokens enable continuous, onchain yield streaming while preserving liquidity on each native network. Powered by LayerZero’s SyncPools architecture, SkyLink ensures omnichain compatibility, unified compliance standards, and native composability across supported ecosystems – including Solana, TRON, Sui, Soneium, Injective, Omni Network, and more. About Plume Plume is the first full-stack RWA Chain and ecosystem purpose-built for RWAfi, enabling the rapid adoption and demand driven integration of real world assets. With 200+ projects building on the network, Plume offers a composable, EVM-compatible environment for onboarding and managing diverse real world assets.

The US president said, “I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.” Trump also dismissed the third party idea completely, saying third parties have “never succeeded in the United States” because “The System seems not designed for them.” His warning? Third parties only lead to “complete and total disruption and chaos,” and Trump said the country already had enough of that from Democrats. Elon announced the America Party on Saturday, claiming Americans want something new. He said his research showed voters preferred a new party by “a factor of 2 to 1.” He blamed both Republicans and Democrats for waste and corruption and called the US a “one-party system.” Trump is not impressed. He called the Republican Party a “smooth running machine” and said it had just passed the biggest bill of its kind “in the history of our country.” That legislation, signed last week, killed the federal electric vehicle mandate. It was one of Trump’s longtime campaign goals. Trump slams Elon over EV mandate, NASA request, and party betrayal Trump made it clear the bill would let Americans choose what kind of cars they drive, be it gas, hybrids, or whatever tech comes next. He reminded Elon that this rollback wasn’t new, saying , “It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had.” Trump said he even asked Elon if he knew the mandate would be removed, and Elon supposedly said he didn’t mind. Trump called that “very surprising” after Elon gave him a “total and unquestioned Endorsement.” Then Trump brought up an older request from Elon: asking that a close friend run NASA. Trump said the man was talented but was “a blue blooded Democrat who had never contributed to a Republican before.” Trump added, “Elon probably was, also.” He said it was inappropriate to put a friend of Elon’s, who was also in the space business, in charge of NASA, especially since NASA plays a major role in Elon’s companies. Trump said his priority was to “protect the American Public.” Feud leads to threats, polls drop, and party divide grows On June 28, Elon had tweeted, “The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country.” He called it “political suicide for the Republican Party.” On June 30, Trump pushed back and said he would use DOGE, a regulatory program that Elon once headed, to look into Elon’s business contracts with the federal government. By July 1, Elon made it personal. He said he would financially support Rep. Thomas Massie’s reelection campaign. Massie voted against Trump’s bill. Trump then told reporters that same day he’d “take a look” at deporting Elon. Meanwhile, Dmitry Novikov, a Russian politician, told TASS that Russia could offer Elon political asylum if things escalated further, but did add that Elon probably wouldn’t need it. As of now, Elon hasn’t said anything about that. Meanwhile, a YouGov polling showed Elon’s net favorability among Republicans dropped 20 points in June, the lowest he’s ever scored with that group in their records. Still, he’s gaining interest elsewhere. A poll from Quantus Insights in early July showed almost 40% of Americans said they would support Elon’s new party. It’s unclear how that translates to actual votes, but it rattled both major parties. Inside the MAGA camp, some were celebrating the split. A separate YouGov poll found that most Republicans sided with Trump in the feud, while most Democrats didn’t pick a side. When voters were asked how they felt about Elon’s attack on the GOP-backed bill, 56% said they agreed with him. Only 17% disagreed. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon said on his War Room show that Elon might get “flipped” by Democrats, so Democratic California Congressman Ro Khanna urged his party to court Elon, saying it could benefit them in the long run.

Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their holdings since batch 1, and the team targets a $0.05 listing. This means those buying at the $0.0016 price are set to see 3025% gains at launch. With all these factors together, BlockDAG (BDAG) is among the highest potential cryptos in 2025 that one should follow closely. 2. Aptos Progresses with Real-World Asset Adoption Showing clear upward signs this July, Aptos trades at around $4.73, touching intraday highs of $4.84 and lows of $4.43. Recent price action broke through resistance between $5.00–$5.06, and if it maintains this zone, a rise to $5.35 is possible. Beyond its chart, Aptos is expanding into Real-World Assets (RWA), crossing $540 million in exposure and ranking in the top 3 chains for RWA. On-chain activity includes BlackRock funds and PACT Protocol. Product growth is also visible as Aptos Labs and Jump Crypto develop Shelby, a decentralized hot storage system that will work with Ethereum and Solana while keeping Aptos as the central L1. DeFi usage is also strong, with Echo Protocol securing $878 million TVL. These solid moves ensure Aptos remains among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. 3. Shiba Inu Strengthens with Community and AI Plans With a strong bounce to $0.0000119 this week, Shiba Inu recorded a 5.7% daily gain, touching intraday highs of $0.00001197 and lows of $0.00001132. Whale wallet activity has risen by 40%, and total wallet count with non-zero balances is now at 1.45 million. However, 66.7% of holders remain at a loss, suggesting growth potential if momentum continues. Its lead dev Shytoshi Kusama has hinted at a “Jul-AI” campaign, with new AI updates planned. Ecosystem actions include Shibarium rollups, ongoing token burns, metaverse zone expansion, and upgrades to ShibaSwap features. Although price movements have been choppy, a breakout above $0.0000119–$0.000014 is expected if momentum strengthens. It remains a part of the highest potential cryptos in 2025 because of its loyal community and renewed development. 4. Hyperliquid Grows with DEX Volume and Tools Trading between $39.80–$40.60 now, Hyperliquid has recovered well from recent dips below $33. Its June DEX volume reached $11.4 billion, nearly double April’s figures, while TVL has increased to $1.8 billion. Leading the on-chain perpetuals space, Hyperliquid beats dYdX, Aevo, and GMX in speed and fees, processing 100,000 orders per second with sub-second settlement. Big players are noticing this growth. HYLQ Strategy purchased around 3,600 HYPE tokens at $39.6, while Lion Group Holding raised $600 million for a HYPE Treasury. Future upgrades like the CoreWriter tool and opt.fun leveraged trading could further strengthen use. While slightly below its all-time high of $45.6, a rise above $41.50 may drive another strong move. Hyperliquid’s volume strength and upgrades make it one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025. To Sum Up! Aptos is building real-world asset use and new protocols, Shiba Inu is driving AI upgrades and community support, and Hyperliquid is expanding with volume and infrastructure. But BlockDAG stands apart with clear pricing benefits, rewards strategy, and broad product progress. Its current $0.0016 price until August 11th, strong miner community, and upcoming listings place it among the highest potential cryptos in 2025 that could set new standards before full launch The post 4 Highest Potential Cryptos in 2025 According to Top Analysts: Aptos, SHIB, Hyperliquid & BlockDAG! appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Token Presale and ICO Insights|BlockDAG,EN,0,0,SHIB|APT|TRADING|MINING|ZRX,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-07-07 01:00:50
