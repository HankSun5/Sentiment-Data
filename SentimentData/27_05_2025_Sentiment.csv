After weeks of steady gains and strong consolidation above the $100K level, BTC appears ready to break higher and extend its macro uptrend. The market is watching closely, as a clean move above $112K could trigger a wave of bullish continuation and renewed institutional interest.

Specifically, the analysis of UTXOs—Unspent Transaction Outputs—provides a deeper understanding of the state of unrealized profits across the network. UTXOs are the core technical structure that ensures a single bitcoin can only be spent once. But beyond that, they offer critical insight into the profitability of held coins. Currently, the market is nearing the 99% threshold, meaning 99% of all BTC holdings are in profit. This level historically aligns with periods of market euphoria and strong uptrend, but can also signal potential overheating if sustained too long. As Bitcoin inches toward new highs, this metric reinforces the strength of the rally while reminding investors that such high profitability often comes with increased volatility. Bitcoin Thrives In Volatile Times As Market Nears 99% Profit Threshold Bitcoin is showing remarkable strength as it flirts with new highs this week, trading just below $112,000. While global markets react to rising U.S. Treasury yields and persistent inflation, Bitcoin appears to be thriving in the chaos, solidifying its role as both a risk asset and a macro hedge. As traditional markets face pressure, BTC continues to lead with resilience, even as geopolitical and policy-related uncertainty clouds investor sentiment. Top analyst Darkfost shared fresh insights on Bitcoin’s on-chain condition, focusing on the utility of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). UTXOs are the technical mechanism that ensures a single BTC can only be spent once on the blockchain. But beyond that, they serve as a powerful tool for assessing unrealized profits across all held BTC. One key metric derived from UTXOs is the percentage of BTC supply in profit. Currently, Bitcoin is approaching the critical 99% threshold, meaning nearly all coins are in unrealized gain territory. Historically, this level is associated with periods of market euphoria and sustained uptrends, but it also comes with a warning: elevated unrealized profits often precede spikes in profit-taking. While BTC’s structure remains bullish, macro uncertainty—especially around the Trump administration’s policy direction—keeps risk-on conviction muted. As Darkfost notes, “We’re not fully euphoric yet, but we’re entering a zone where late buyers should be cautious.” If the 99% profit signal drops, it may trigger a wave of selling as gains shrink and weaker hands capitulate. For now, though, Bitcoin remains strong, and the uptrend is intact. The market is watching closely because in times like these, BTC tends to move first.

The price recently bounced off the 100 SMA ($105,586) and is now hovering above the 34 EMA ($108,280), signaling continued bullish momentum. All key moving averages are aligned to the upside, reflecting a strong and healthy trend. Volume has remained relatively stable during the pullback and recovery, suggesting no major distribution phase is underway. The 50 SMA ($107,679) also acted as dynamic support during the recent dip, reinforcing the strength of the $107K–$108K zone. The $103,600 level, previously a major resistance, continues to serve as solid structural support. As long as BTC remains above this zone, the broader uptrend remains intact. Short-term resistance now sits near the $110,200–$112,000 range. A breakout above this level would likely trigger the next leg higher, potentially toward the $120,000 mark.

A recent announcement has caught the attention of many, particularly those interested in the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape built on Bitcoin. YZi Labs , a major player in the crypto investment space, has made a strategic move that could accelerate growth for a promising project. What is This Significant YZi Labs Investment? In a move signaling continued interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem, YZi Labs , known for its strategic investments in innovative blockchain projects, recently announced its investment in Avalon Labs . This announcement, shared via their official communication channels, highlights a commitment to supporting platforms that are building foundational infrastructure in key areas of the crypto market. Avalon Labs is specifically focused on developing a robust Bitcoin DeFi platform. While much of the DeFi activity has historically centered around Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, building decentralized financial applications on top of the Bitcoin network, the most secure and decentralized blockchain, is gaining significant traction. Avalon Labs aims to be a key contributor to this growing segment. Beyond its core DeFi platform, Avalon Labs is also the issuer of the USDa Stablecoin . Stablecoins play a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem by providing a stable medium of exchange and store of value, mitigating the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A well-integrated stablecoin is often essential for facilitating lending, borrowing, and trading activities within a DeFi protocol. How Will Avalon Labs Use the New Crypto Investment? According to the announcement, the funding secured through this Crypto Investment from YZi Labs is earmarked for two primary strategic objectives for Avalon Labs : Pursuing Regulatory Licenses: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape is critical for any financial platform, especially one aiming for institutional adoption. Securing the necessary licenses in various jurisdictions will legitimize Avalon Labs’ operations and open doors to a wider range of users and partners. Expanding Institutional Lending Operations: A major goal for many DeFi projects is bridging the gap between decentralized protocols and traditional finance, particularly institutional capital. Expanding institutional lending operations means building the infrastructure, partnerships, and compliance frameworks needed to onboard large financial entities, bringing significant liquidity and credibility to the platform. This focus indicates Avalon Labs’ ambition to not only serve retail DeFi users but also tap into the vast potential of institutional finance looking for compliant and reliable avenues to participate in the crypto space, particularly leveraging Bitcoin’s underlying security. What’s the Connection to the MVB Program? This investment isn’t a standalone event. It follows Avalon Labs’ participation in the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) incubation program. This program is a significant initiative in the blockchain space, co-led by prominent entities like BNB Chain, YZi Labs (in its former capacity or through its continued association), and CoinMarketCap. Participation in such a rigorous program often signifies a project’s potential, innovation, and readiness for growth. The MVB program provides selected projects with mentorship, resources, and networking opportunities, helping them refine their technology, business model, and market strategy. Avalon Labs’ successful navigation of this program likely played a crucial role in attracting the subsequent Crypto Investment from YZi Labs, validating their progress and future potential. Why is Bitcoin DeFi Gaining Momentum? For years, Ethereum has been the undisputed king of DeFi. However, the narrative is shifting. The desire to leverage Bitcoin’s unparalleled security, liquidity, and brand recognition for decentralized financial applications is driving innovation in the Bitcoin DeFi space. Projects are exploring various technical approaches, including: Layer 2 solutions (like Lightning Network extensions or sidechains) Cross-chain bridges and wrapped Bitcoin assets New protocols built directly on or interacting with the Bitcoin base layer Innovative uses of Bitcoin scripting or other functionalities Avalon Labs, with its platform and the USDa Stablecoin , is positioning itself within this exciting frontier, aiming to unlock the potential of Bitcoin’s dormant capital within the DeFi ecosystem. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? An investment like this brings several potential benefits: Accelerated Development: Funding allows Avalon Labs to hire more talent, improve technology, and expedite product launches. Enhanced Credibility: An investment from a reputable entity like YZi Labs boosts Avalon Labs’ standing in the market. Wider Reach: Resources can be allocated to marketing and business development, attracting more users and institutions. Regulatory Progress: Dedicated funding for licenses can significantly speed up compliance efforts. However, challenges remain: Regulatory Uncertainty: The pace and nature of crypto regulations are unpredictable globally. Competition: The Bitcoin DeFi space, while younger than Ethereum DeFi, is becoming increasingly competitive. Technical Hurdles: Building complex DeFi protocols securely on or connected to Bitcoin can be technically challenging. Market Adoption: Educating users and institutions about new Bitcoin DeFi solutions takes time and effort. Examples in the Bitcoin DeFi Space Avalon Labs is not the only project building in this area. Other examples of platforms contributing to the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem include projects focused on lending, borrowing, trading, and asset issuance using Bitcoin as the base layer or underlying asset. This growing ecosystem signifies a broader trend towards making Bitcoin more programmable and useful within decentralized finance. Actionable Insights for Readers What does this development mean for different stakeholders?

Although Liu has remained on the sidelines of XRP until now, he believes an upcoming market shift could present a viable entry point. I’ll buy $XRP when this happens I’ve never held $XRP . But that might be about to change. One key signal is setting up and if it triggers in the next 3–6 months, I’ll finally add $XRP to my portfolio. Here’s what I’m watching — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 24, 2025 XRP Price Trails Bitcoin’s Rally As of this year, XRP has seen a modest gain of 12.54%. Despite this upward movement, it continues to struggle near the $2.50 range and has yet to establish a decisive breakout. In contrast, Bitcoin has recently surpassed new all-time highs, reaching $112,000. This disparity has highlighted XRP’s relative underperformance, leading some investors to reconsider its mid- to long-term potential. Investor’s Strategy Focuses on XRP/BTC Ratio Liu’s approach does not rely on speculative price targets or broader community sentiment. Instead, he is closely monitoring the XRP/BTC trading pair, which he believes holds the key to a more sustainable investment entry. As of now, the pair is trading at 0.00002136. According to Liu, this ratio has maintained support near 0.000022 since November 2024 and has formed a rounded top, signaling potential downside. The investor has identified a value range between 0.000017 and 0.000019 BTC. If the ratio drops into this zone, representing a 20% to 23% decline from current levels, he would consider initiating a position. He referred to this price band as the zone where other altcoins, including Ethereum and Solana, have historically begun significant upward movements. Price Scenarios That Could Lead to a Buy Signal Liu outlined two possible developments that might push the XRP/BTC pair into his target zone. One scenario involves XRP declining to around $1.80 while Bitcoin remains stable near $100,000 . Another possibility is that Bitcoin increases further, potentially reaching $128,000, while XRP remains stagnant. In either case, the result would likely be a lower XRP/BTC ratio, creating the conditions Liu is waiting for. He also cautioned that a quick dip to the $1.80–$1.85 range could act as a short-term correction, potentially forcing weaker investors to exit before a recovery begins. This, he believes, would represent a favorable buying opportunity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strengthening Fundamentals Support Long-Term Outlook Beyond price dynamics, Liu cited multiple developments that have improved XRP’s market fundamentals. These include the resolution of Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the listing of XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the approval of a Canadian spot XRP ETF, and the recent filing of a similar ETF application in the U.S. He also mentioned the increasing traction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Additionally, Liu noted that XRP has consistently underperformed Bitcoin since 2017. A reversal of this trend would mark a significant shift, not only for XRP but also for other long-standing altcoins that have lagged during recent market cycles. Liu has set clear conditions for his potential entry into XRP, a drop in the XRP/BTC ratio to the 0.000017–0.000019 range, and a possible price dip to around $1.80. While he has yet to take a position, the next three to six months will be critical in determining whether those technical conditions are met. If they are, Liu has confirmed he is ready to act on what he considers a data-driven and strategically timed opportunity.

While factors like the halving event and U.S. spot ETF inflows are often cited, analysts are pointing to a less obvious, yet significant, driver: instability in Japan’s bond market. Understanding the Bitcoin price Japan connection reveals fascinating dynamics at play in the global financial system. Is Japan’s Bond Market Shaking Up Bitcoin? Yes, according to some prominent market watchers. The core idea is that rising yields in Japan’s government bond market signal potential stress and increased sovereign credit risk for one of the world’s largest economies. When the cost for a government to borrow money (the yield on its bonds) goes up significantly, it can make investors nervous about the stability of that nation’s finances. Here’s a breakdown of the situation: Japan has maintained ultra-low interest rates and bond yields for decades as part of its economic policy. Recently, yields on longer-term Japanese government bonds (JGBs), particularly the 30-year yield, have been climbing, reaching levels not seen in years or even decades. This rise suggests market participants are demanding higher returns to hold Japanese debt, indicating concerns about future inflation or the government’s ability to manage its considerable debt load. This volatility in the Japan bond market is reportedly causing institutional investors to look for alternative assets that are not tied to traditional government debt or fiat currencies. Why is Japan Bond Volatility Driving Bitcoin Interest? The link stems from the perception of Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional financial system risks. When sovereign debt markets in major economies show signs of stress, investors, especially large institutions, begin searching for assets that are uncorrelated or even negatively correlated with these risks. Bitwise Asset Management’s Senior Macro Analyst, André Dragosch, highlighted this trend, noting the record high hit by the 30-year Japanese government bond yield. His analysis suggests this move prompted institutional investors to consider Bitcoin as a hedge against potential sovereign default risk. Unlike government bonds or fiat currency tied to a specific nation’s economy, Bitcoin is decentralized and operates outside the direct control of any single government or central bank. Think of it this way: If you are a large fund holding significant amounts of Japanese government bonds, and you see their value potentially eroding due to rising yields or concerns about Japan’s fiscal health, you might seek an asset that behaves differently. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and global, decentralized network, presents itself as one such alternative. Is Bitcoin a True Safe Haven Asset? The debate around whether Bitcoin safe haven status is legitimate continues. Traditionally, assets like gold, certain currencies (like the Swiss Franc), or even specific government bonds (in times of global turmoil) have been considered safe havens – places investors flock to during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Arguments for Bitcoin as a safe haven: Decentralization: Not controlled by any government or central bank, immune to national monetary policy shifts or political instability (unlike fiat currencies or government bonds). Scarcity: Fixed supply cap (21 million coins) provides a perceived store of value similar to precious metals. Global Accessibility: Can be accessed and transferred anywhere in the world, bypassing traditional banking systems. Arguments against Bitcoin as a safe haven: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings, which contradicts the traditional definition of a stable safe haven asset. Lack of Long-Term Track Record: Relatively young asset class compared to gold or reserve currencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Its decentralized nature also means it operates in a complex and evolving regulatory landscape across different countries. However, the current narrative linking it to Japan’s bond market suggests that, for some sophisticated investors, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed through this ‘digital gold’ or uncorrelated asset lens, particularly when specific sovereign risks emerge in major economies. The Role of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The thesis put forward by analysts like Dragosch heavily relies on Institutional Bitcoin adoption. It’s not just retail traders reacting to news; it’s the movement of significant capital by large funds, corporations, and asset managers that can truly impact market prices. Several factors point to growing institutional interest: Spot ETF Approvals: The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided a regulated and accessible avenue for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Corporate Treasury Strategies: Some corporations have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Fund Allocations: Macro hedge funds and other investment vehicles are increasingly including Bitcoin in their portfolios as part of diversification strategies. The idea is that the scale of capital managed by these institutions means even a small allocation to Bitcoin as a hedge against sovereign risk, especially from a market as large as Japan’s, can create substantial buying pressure. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Market Analysis? This connection between the Bitcoin market analysis and traditional macroeconomics, specifically sovereign debt markets, adds a new layer of complexity. It suggests that global financial stability (or lack thereof) in major economies can become a significant factor influencing Bitcoin’s price movements, alongside crypto-specific events like the halving or ETF flows. Analyst predictions, such as Dragosch’s projection of Bitcoin potentially reaching $200,000, are often contingent on the continuation of these macro trends and sustained institutional buying. If Japan’s bond market volatility persists, or if similar sovereign risk concerns arise in other major economies, the demand for perceived uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin could continue to grow. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Pay attention not just to crypto news but also to major global macroeconomic developments, particularly sovereign debt markets in large economies. Understand the Narrative: Recognize that part of Bitcoin’s value proposition for institutions is its potential as a hedge against traditional financial risks. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin is volatile, its potential uncorrelated nature might make it a component of a diversified portfolio for some investors. Evaluate Predictions Carefully: Price targets like $200,000 are based on specific conditions and trends continuing; they are not guarantees. Potential Challenges: Correlation Risk: Bitcoin could still correlate with traditional markets during extreme stress events. Regulatory Headwinds: Increased institutional adoption could also bring more regulatory scrutiny. Market Sentiment Shifts: The narrative could change rapidly, impacting demand. Compelling Summary The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price appears to be influenced not just by crypto-native factors but also by macro-financial dynamics in distant markets like Japan’s. Volatility and rising yields in the Japan bond market are prompting some institutional investors to view Bitcoin as a potential Bitcoin safe haven or hedge against sovereign risk. This growing trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption, driven partly by global financial instability, is a significant element in the current Bitcoin market analysis and future price predictions, including projections like $200,000, provided this institutional interest and the underlying macro drivers persist. The Bitcoin price Japan connection highlights the increasing integration of the crypto asset into the broader global financial landscape.

In an announcement today, the firm said the feature will empower its community. According to the announcement , the Live Trading feature allows verified creators on Binance Square to livestream their trading strategies to users. The users can also place futures or spot trades directly within the live stream. By introducing this feature, the exchange plans to make crypto trading more accessible and engaging with the friction between learning a trading strategy and executing it completely removed. The announcement reads: “This feature is part of our ongoing commitment to provide cutting-edge tools and resources to empower our community and make trading more accessible and engaging for users globally.” The Live Trading feature is similar to the one released by Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun in early 2025. At the time, the feature generated controversy for its abuse, leading to Pump.fun shutting it down before reopening in April with more safety restrictions. However, Binance’s Live Trading focuses on helping users copy and execute trading strategies from experienced traders. The firm highlighted the several benefits of the Live Trading feature, noting that it will allow users to connect with the creators on Binance Square and gain real-time insights from them. This is expected to improve understanding of the crypto market and enable global crypto adoption while also allowing users who participate in such live streaming to gain more knowledge about strategies for crypto trading. The feature is already live on the Binance app and website. How the Live Stream feature works Meanwhile, the Binance announcement also included a comprehensive explainer of how the feature works for users and creators. According to the explainer, users can join a livestream and check the Strategy Tab to find trades that the creators share during the session. By selecting any trade, they get to see all the details, such as order size, pair, and direction, and can easily place their order, which copies the exact trade directly from the stream. Creators can share up to 100 spot or futures trades during a live session and pin trades in the strategy cards for viewers to gain easy access. Interestingly, this comes with perks for the creators, who earn 50% of trading fees when users copy their strategies from the live stream. The announcement added that creators can get more visibility by participating in Live Trading Competitors and other events organized by the exchange. However, only traders with at least 1,000 followers on Binance Square qualify to be creators. For experienced traders who do not have the required followers to be eligible for the feature, Binance is offering participation in its Binance Square Live Trading Incubation Program. Binance’s new products and features to help market dominance Meanwhile, Live Trading continues a trend of new features and products that Binance has launched in the past few months. The exchange recently launched Grid Trading 2.0, a feature that allows users to customize bot settings and optimize trading experience. This week alone, it has also integrated Bio Protocol on Base Network while introducing new offers through Binance Earn. It also recently added the World Liberty Financial stablecoin USD1 to the Earn, Buy Crypto, Convert, and Margin products. One of the key features that the exchange has launched recently is Binance Alpha, a platform within the Binance wallet that spotlights early crypto projects that have potential, allowing users to buy tokens of such projects. All these new features appear to be part of the exchange’s effort to remain dominant as competitors continue encroaching on its market share. According to Token Insight, Binance remains the largest crypto exchange, with 36.5% of the market share for spot trading in Q1 of 2025. Interestingly, it also dominated derivatives trading with 45% of the market share. However, its spot market shares declined by 1.38% in 2025 Q1, and it has faced some headwinds due to reports of links to the Trump family and the poor performance of new tokens listed on the exchange. Those headwinds could become more serious as competing exchanges continue to expand. For instance, Robinhood recently bought BitStamp while Kraken acquired Ninja Traders, deals that could expand their product offerings and attract more users.

These networks, also known as “fei qian” or flying money, operate in the shadows and function outside traditional banking regulations, and as a result, facilitate an array of illicit activities, from drug trafficking to cybercrime. The symbiotic relationship between global crime networks and Chinese underground banks According to TRM Labs’ report , there is a symbiotic relationship between Chinese underground banks and organized crime groups worldwide, and it operates beyond regulatory oversight. These networks have been known to use informal value transfer systems, such as “mirror exchanges,” to move funds across borders, which helps them avoid triggering the AML alarms in regulated banking systems. This network allows a broker in the U.S. to collect drug cartel cash and provide equivalent value in China—often in cryptocurrency or through trade-based money laundering (TBML)—without any cross-border wire transfers. In this way, cartels have been able to repatriate illicit earnings while helping wealthy Chinese clients interested in capital flight evade China’s strict capital controls, creating a mutually beneficial partnership. TRM Labs says these networks’ reach now extends globally, allowing them to serve a diverse clientele of criminal organizations from Mexican cartels to North Korean hackers. The cartels, for example, reportedly rely on Chinese underground bankers to launder drug proceeds, as seen in a Los Angeles-based ring that laundered over USD 50 million in narcotics revenue via crypto and trade-based schemes. Similarly, North Korean hackers depend on Chinese over-the-counter (OTC) brokers to convert stolen digital assets into fiat currency or commodities, evading global sanctions. The symbiotic ecosystem thrives on the ability of underground banks to act as a bridge between the cash-heavy criminal underworld and the formal economy. It depends on encrypted communication platforms like WeChat and Telegram, and exploiting regulatory gaps in jurisdictions with weak oversight, to ensure that illicit funds remain obscure. The financial pipeline for drug trafficking One particularly alarming thing about Chinese underground banking networks is that their capabilities have allowed them to evolve into a shadowy financial pipeline that boosts illicit activities, especially the lucrative drug trafficking between America and China. TRM’s report claims the system, which operates outside regulated channels, allows cartels like Sinaloa to launder hundreds of millions annually while Chinese brokers profit from small commissions, typically 1-2%. The increased adoption of crypto has revolutionized this pipeline, as it enables these groups to make faster, larger and more anonymous transactions. For example, TRM Labs reported cases where Sinaloa Cartel-linked launderers in the U.S. deposited drug cash into crypto ATMs or exchanges, converting it to Bitcoin for transfer to Chinese-controlled wallets. These funds are then used to purchase precursor chemicals for fentanyl production or other goods, which are reinvested into the drug trade. The pipeline not only encourages the opioid crisis but also supports a broader illicit economy, including North Korean sanctions evasion and Russian military supply chains. Disrupting the pipeline will require advanced blockchain analytics, international cooperation, and proactive measures, such as targeting key nodes like OTC brokers. There have been successful cases, such as Binance freezing accounts linked to North Korean launderers in 2022. However, the networks’ constant innovation means law enforcement has to remain on their toes and get even better at their jobs.

Recently, a significant announcement sent ripples through the community: the Alpaca Finance shutdown . As a prominent DeFi platform known for its leveraged yield farming, Alpaca Finance has revealed plans to cease operations, citing ongoing financial difficulties . This development is crucial for current users and provides valuable insights for anyone involved in yield farming or following crypto news . What Exactly Happened with Alpaca Finance? In an official announcement shared via their Medium blog, the team behind Alpaca Finance communicated the difficult decision to wind down the platform’s services. This wasn’t a sudden impulse but a step taken after facing persistent financial headwinds. Official Announcement: The news was delivered directly to the community through their established communication channels. Reason Cited: The primary driver for the shutdown is stated as ongoing financial difficulties. Impact on Services: The core offering, farming services, will be discontinued soon. Despite efforts, including downsizing the team, the platform continued to experience consistent losses. This unsustainable situation ultimately led to the decision to cease operations rather than continue under duress. Understanding Alpaca Finance’s Financial Difficulties Running a DeFi platform , especially one centered around yield farming and leverage, involves complex economic models and faces market volatility. The announcement points to ‘consistent losses’ as the core issue leading to the Alpaca Finance shutdown . What could contribute to such difficulties? While the specific details for Alpaca Finance are internal, common challenges for DeFi protocols can include: Market Downturns: Prolonged bear markets reduce trading volume, TVL (Total Value Locked), and overall user activity, impacting revenue streams (like fees). Competition: The DeFi space is highly competitive, with many platforms vying for users and liquidity. This can drive down fees or require costly incentives. Operational Costs: Running a secure and functional DeFi protocol involves significant costs, including development, security audits, marketing, and team salaries. Tokenomics Pressure: If the platform’s native token value declines significantly, it can impact incentives and the protocol’s treasury health. Smart Contract Risks: While not explicitly mentioned for Alpaca Finance’s shutdown, exploits or bugs can lead to massive losses and erode user trust and TVL. The fact that downsizing wasn’t enough to offset these losses highlights the severity of the financial strain faced by the platform. Urgent Actions Required for Alpaca Finance Users For anyone currently using Alpaca Finance for yield farming or other services, the most critical part of this crypto news is the set of deadlines and required actions. Ignoring these could result in loss of access to funds or positions. Here are the key dates and what you need to do: Cessation of Farming Services: All farming services will stop by June 2024 . This means you won’t be able to maintain or open new farming positions after this point. Deadline to Close Positions: Users are strongly advised to close all their open leveraged positions by June 30, 2024 . Failing to do so before the front-end services are significantly reduced or removed could make accessing and managing your funds extremely difficult. Front-End Availability for Withdrawals: The front-end website will remain accessible for withdrawals until December 31, 2024 . This provides a window to withdraw any remaining assets after closing positions. However, relying on the last day is risky; it’s best to act sooner. Actionable Insight: If you have funds or open positions on Alpaca Finance, log in immediately and plan your exit strategy well before the June 30th deadline. Understand the process for closing your specific positions and withdrawing your assets. Broader Implications for the DeFi Ecosystem and Yield Farming The Alpaca Finance shutdown is more than just news about one platform; it’s a reminder of the inherent risks and challenges within the DeFi platform landscape, particularly in complex areas like leveraged yield farming . This event underscores several points for the wider community: Sustainability Matters: Protocols need robust and sustainable revenue models that can withstand market cycles. Relying solely on token emissions or high, unsustainable APYs is risky. Risk Management: For users, this highlights the importance of understanding the risks associated with specific platforms, especially those offering leverage. Protocol failure is a real risk, separate from market price risk. Due Diligence: Always do your own research (DYOR) on the financial health, security audits, and team behind a DeFi protocol before committing significant capital. Market Maturity: While DeFi is innovative, it’s still a relatively young and volatile space. Not all projects will succeed, and failures are part of the maturation process. While this news is unfortunate for Alpaca Finance and its users, it serves as a valuable case study for the entire DeFi space, prompting reflection on resilience and risk. What Can We Learn from This Crypto News? The Alpaca Finance shutdown offers concrete lessons for both users and developers in the crypto space: For Users: Don’t Get Complacent: Even established platforms can face insurmountable challenges. Regularly review your exposure. Understand Leverage Risk: Leveraged yield farming amplifies both gains and losses, including the risk of liquidation and platform failure. Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into a single DeFi protocol. Stay Informed: Pay attention to official announcements and crypto news regarding the platforms you use. For the DeFi Space: Focus on Sustainable Models: The focus should shift further towards protocols with clear, long-term viable revenue streams. Transparency: Greater transparency about a protocol’s financial health (where feasible and safe) could help users make informed decisions. Robustness: Building protocols that can weather market downturns is crucial for long-term success. This event is a stark reminder that even in the innovative world of DeFi, traditional financial challenges like consistent losses can lead to difficult outcomes. Conclusion: Navigating the Aftermath of the Alpaca Finance Shutdown The announcement of the Alpaca Finance shutdown due to ongoing financial difficulties marks a significant event for the platform’s users and the wider DeFi platform ecosystem. As a platform known for leveraged yield farming , its closure underscores the economic pressures faced by crypto projects in challenging market conditions. The most critical takeaway for users is the urgency to act: close positions before June 30 and withdraw assets before the end of December 2024. This piece of crypto news serves as a vital case study, reinforcing the importance of due diligence, understanding risks, and staying informed in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance. While unfortunate, such events contribute to the market’s maturity and highlight the need for robust and sustainable models in DeFi.

The popular cryptocurrency exchange has just announced a significant expansion, bringing enhanced crypto access Germany . This move is set to provide German crypto users with even more opportunities to explore the diverse and rapidly evolving world of digital assets directly on the Coinbase platform. What New Tokens Coinbase Are Now Available in Germany? Coinbase made the announcement via their official communication channels, confirming that residents in Germany can now trade a fresh batch of altcoins. This listing includes tokens from various sectors of the crypto market, ranging from liquid staking and restaking to decentralized infrastructure and yield protocols. Here are the specific new tokens Coinbase has added for German users: Rocket Pool (RPL): A leading decentralized Ethereum staking protocol, offering liquid staking solutions. Reserve Rights (RSR): The utility token for the Reserve Protocol, which aims to facilitate stablecoin creation. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): A token likely associated with the popular NFT collection and its expanding ecosystem. Renzo (REZ): A liquid restaking protocol built on EigenLayer, focusing on yield opportunities in the restaking space. Aethir (ATH): A decentralized cloud infrastructure network, often categorized under DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). Syrup (SYRUP): Details on this specific token might vary, but it typically relates to yield farming or governance within a specific DeFi ecosystem. (Note: Users should research the specific SYRUP token listed by Coinbase). Pendle (PENDLE): A protocol that enables the tokenization and trading of future yield, offering advanced yield strategies. Layer3 (L3): A platform focused on web3 discovery and earning through interactive experiences and quests, often bridging users to various chains and protocols. This diverse selection of new tokens Coinbase brings represents various trending narratives within the blockchain space, offering German users exposure to different types of crypto assets beyond the major ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why is Coinbase Expanding Crypto Access Germany? Germany is a significant economic powerhouse in Europe with a growing interest in digital assets. Expanding offerings in such a key market is a strategic move for Coinbase. Providing broader crypto access Germany helps the platform solidify its presence and cater to the increasing demand from German crypto users looking for regulated and accessible ways to invest in altcoins. Coinbase operates under regulatory oversight in many jurisdictions, including Germany, where it holds a crypto custody license from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). Expanding the range of tradable assets, while adhering to local regulations, enhances Coinbase’s appeal and competitive edge in the European market. What Does This Mean for German Crypto Users? For German crypto users , this announcement is overwhelmingly positive. It directly translates to several key benefits: Increased Investment Opportunities: Access to a wider array of altcoins means more potential investment strategies and diversification options. Users can now easily explore tokens related to cutting-edge areas like liquid staking, restaking, and decentralized infrastructure. Convenience and Accessibility: Trading these tokens on a familiar and regulated platform like Coinbase simplifies the process compared to using multiple smaller or less-regulated exchanges. Exposure to Emerging Trends: The listed tokens represent sectors gaining significant traction in the crypto world. This allows German users to participate in these trends early on. Enhanced Portfolio Diversification: Adding tokens from different categories (DeFi, NFTs, Infrastructure) helps users build more robust and diversified crypto portfolios, potentially mitigating risks associated with concentrating investments in just a few assets. This expansion of crypto access Germany by Coinbase underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing demand for a broader range of assets from mainstream investors. Navigating the New Options: Risks and Considerations While the addition of new tokens Coinbase offers exciting possibilities, it’s crucial for German crypto users to approach these new listings with caution and a clear understanding of the associated risks. Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps or newer projects, can be significantly more volatile than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Key considerations include: Volatility: Prices of these altcoins can experience rapid and unpredictable swings. Research is Crucial: Understand the technology, use case, team, and market position of each token before investing. Don’t invest based purely on hype. Regulatory Landscape: While Coinbase is regulated, the regulatory status and tax implications of trading various cryptocurrencies in Germany should be understood by users. Market Liquidity: While Coinbase listings typically bring liquidity, some newer or smaller tokens might still have lower trading volumes compared to major assets. Education is your best tool. Take the time to research RPL, RSR, PENGU, REZ, ATH, SYRUP, PENDLE, and L3 to understand their fundamentals and potential risks. Getting Started: Actionable Tips for German Users Ready to explore the new tokens Coinbase has listed? Here are some actionable tips for German crypto users : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This cannot be stressed enough. Visit the official websites of Rocket Pool, Renzo, Pendle, Aethir, and others. Read their whitepapers or documentation. Understand what problem they solve and their long-term vision. Start Small: Don’t feel pressured to invest heavily right away. Begin with smaller amounts to get a feel for the market dynamics of these specific altcoins Germany now has easier access to. Understand the Technology: Gain a basic understanding of the underlying blockchain technology and the specific niche each token occupies (e.g., liquid staking vs. decentralized cloud). Utilize Coinbase Resources: Coinbase often provides educational content about the assets listed on its platform. Leverage these resources to learn more. Consider Your Investment Goals: Are you looking for long-term investments, or are you interested in short-term trading? Your goals should influence which tokens you consider and how you approach them. This expansion by Coinbase significantly enhances crypto access Germany , opening doors to a broader universe of digital assets. By staying informed and cautious, German users can potentially benefit from these new opportunities. Summary: A Win for German Crypto Users Coinbase’s decision to list Rocket Pool (RPL), Reserve Rights (RSR), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Renzo (REZ), Aethir (ATH), Syrup (SYRUP), Pendle (PENDLE), and Layer3 (L3) marks a positive development for the German cryptocurrency market. This move not only increases the range of investment options available to German crypto users on a trusted platform but also signifies the growing importance of Germany in the global crypto landscape. As Coinbase continues to expand its offerings, it provides more pathways for users to engage with innovative projects across various blockchain sectors. While the opportunities are exciting, remember the importance of thorough research and risk management when exploring these altcoins Germany now has easier access to via Coinbase.

As altcoin season heats up, TRUMP Coin, Cardano (ADA), and the ultra-cheap FloppyPepe (FPPE) are surging into the spotlight. Unsurprisingly, this rising meme star, FloppyPepe (FPPE), is making the loudest entrance as it nears the $2 million presale milestone. Its early-stage presale is ending in just a few hours, and momentum has sharply intensified. With an 80% bonus currently active using code “ FLOPPY80 ,” buyers are rushing to grab tokens before the next price hike hits. In a market this bullish, it aims to deliver powerful returns, generous coin incentives , and high-yield rewards. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Surges Into Stage 2 Presale With 80% Bonus As Altcoin Season Heats Up As FARTCOIN enjoys a wave of weekly growth, the altcoin market is firing all around with meme token FloppyPepe (FPPE) charging ahead. While TRUMP Coin and Cardano (ADA) also led the altcoin season, the meme coin has recently climbed to Stage 2 of its presale, already surpassing the last phase’s $2 million mark. Just hours into this new stage, investors are swarming in, drawn by its rock-bottom price of $0.00000035 and an ongoing 80% bonus using code “ FLOPPY80 .” This limited-time reward is pushing demand higher by the minute, especially as the bullish altcoin season fuels more decisive presale action. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Floppynomics Fuels Real Value And Long-Term Growth FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) unique Floppynomics brings real value to its utility and reward-based token. With a massive 120 trillion total supply, its deflationary structure is designed to benefit long-term holders. Each transaction carries a modest 3% fee, divided equally into 1% redistribution to loyal investors, 1% token burn to reduce supply and support price stability, and 1% directed to wildlife conservation efforts. With altcoin season heating up, investors are rushing to scoop up its tokens at $0.00000035 . The project is backed by a SolidProof-audited smart contract, 7.8% staking rewards, liquidity pools, and free airdrops. FARTCOIN Shows Strong Gains Amid Altcoin Season, But Investor Caution Remains FARTCOIN is gaining traction as altcoin season kicks in, with a 42% spike last month, 25% in the previous two weeks, and another 30% this past week. Still, FARTCOIN investor confidence wavers after a drop from its $1.70 high to $1.63, sparking fears of another reversal. While market analyst VikingXBY claims the retest is done and a run to $2.60 is next, many FARTCOIN holders remain cautious. Some are eyeing early-stage presale tokens with higher ROI potential, questioning if the FARTCOIN price momentum can truly hold in this volatile cycle. TRUMP Coin Gears Up For Breakout As Buying Pressure Builds Building on the momentum seen in leading meme coins, TRUMP Coin is positioning itself for a strong rebound as altcoin season heats up. Currently valued at $13.93, TRUMP Coin dropped 7% in 24 hours but gained 8% over the past week, according to CoinGecko data. Crypto analyst Kamil shared on X that TRUMP Coin must break above $15 to target $17 and beyond. With growing buying pressure, the TRUMP Coin shows clear potential to rally past the $13 mark, signaling renewed investor interest and momentum building. Cardano (ADA) Price Wobbles Under Bearish Pressure As Altcoin Season Heats Up Investors are closely watching the Cardano (ADA) price potential as altcoin season gains momentum, while rival FloppyPepe (FPPE) claims to offer better opportunities for high returns. Despite a brief climb to $0.85 last week, Cardano (ADA) has struggled to maintain momentum, slipping back to around $0.80. Crypto analyst THEDEFILINK warns that Cardano (ADA) is flashing multiple bearish signals, including a looming death cross, declining volume, and fading whale support. He adds that without a quick shift in sentiment, the Cardano (ADA) token may slide deeper, breaking key support levels and losing bullish momentum. Altcoin Season Is Brewing—And FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Racing Ahead Of The Pack Crypto expert Crypto Rover just fired up the space with a bold update on X (formerly Twitter), declaring that altcoin season is loading. He reminded investors that every four-year cycle ends with an explosive altcoin run, and this time should be no different.

While he was handed a significant 25-year prison term in 2023 for orchestrating an $11 billion fraud, recent reports suggest his time behind bars might be shorter than initially expected. This development has sparked considerable discussion within the crypto community and beyond, raising questions about the nuances of the U.S. penal system. Understanding the SBF Prison Sentence and Potential Reduction Sam Bankman-Fried’s 25-year sentence was a landmark moment following his conviction on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the misuse of customer funds at FTX and the intertwined operations with Alameda Research. However, according to reports citing Business Insider and CoinDesk, there’s a possibility his actual time served could be reduced by over four years. Why the potential reduction? The U.S. federal prison system allows for sentence reductions based on several factors: Good Conduct Time: Inmates can earn credit for maintaining good behavior. For federal sentences over one year, inmates can earn up to 54 days of credit for each year of their sentence served, provided they avoid disciplinary infractions. Participation in Programs: Engaging in educational, vocational, or rehabilitative programs offered by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) can also earn inmates time credits under the First Step Act. These programs aim to reduce recidivism. Credit for Time Served: Any time spent in federal custody before sentencing for the offense for which the sentence was imposed is typically credited towards the final sentence. Sam Bankman-Fried was held in custody for a period before his sentencing. Applying these factors could potentially shift his projected release date from around March 2049 to December 2044, a significant difference of more than four years. It’s important to note that this projected date is based on current calculations and assumes continued good behavior and program participation. What Does This Mean for Sam Bankman-Fried and His Future? For Sam Bankman-Fried himself, a reduced sentence means an earlier return to life outside prison walls. While still a lengthy term, shaving off several years is a substantial change. It highlights that even after a high-profile conviction, the standard processes and regulations of the federal prison system apply. This situation also brings attention to the complexities of sentencing and incarceration in the U.S. legal system. The initial 25-year sentence reflected the severity of the crimes involving FTX and Alameda , but mechanisms like Good Conduct Time exist as incentives for rehabilitation and orderly prison management. Public perception versus the legal and penal process is often a point of discussion in such cases. Understanding Good Conduct Time and other sentence reduction mechanisms is crucial for interpreting such news. It’s not an overturning of the sentence itself, but rather an application of existing federal rules that govern how sentences are served. Key Takeaways on the SBF Prison Sentence The potential reduction in the SBF prison sentence underscores several points: The U.S. federal prison system has established rules for sentence reduction based on inmate behavior and participation. Good Conduct Time and program credits are standard mechanisms, not unique to this case. Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction for the massive FTX and Alameda fraud remains, and he will still serve a very substantial prison term. The projected release date is subject to change based on future conduct and BOP calculations. While the headlines focus on the reduction, the core fact remains: Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of egregious financial crimes and is serving a significant sentence as a consequence of the collapse of FTX and the actions at Alameda Research. In conclusion, the news of a potential reduction in Sam Bankman-Fried’s prison term is a detail within the larger narrative of the FTX collapse and its legal ramifications. It demonstrates the application of standard federal prison regulations, primarily involving Good Conduct Time and program participation, which could result in an earlier release date than his initial 25-year sentence implied. This development, while notable, doesn’t diminish the gravity of the crimes for which he was convicted.

The exchange performs regular buy-backs and burns, which reduce the circulating supply, creating upward pressure on value. As of now, only 60 million OKB tokens remain in circulation out of a total 300 million. This token model mirrors deflationary blueprints adopted by successful exchanges, giving OKB the structural foundation to become a store of value within the trading ecosystem. The all-time high of $73.83 set in March 2024 is still fresh in memory, and with exchange-based tokens rising again, long-term projections remain bullish. Market Catalysts That Could Fuel OKB’s Future Price The current global push toward crypto regulation has significantly impacted centralized exchange tokens. OKX has proactively implemented industry-grade compliance measures, strengthening its trustworthiness. The platform’s integration of institutional features and participation in global DeFi protocols further enhances OKB’s use cases. OKB’s value may also benefit from broader crypto adoption trends, particularly those involving tokenized assets and real-world utility. As token economies mature, exchange tokens with embedded governance and reward mechanisms, such as OKB, are likely to become indispensable. OKB Price Prediction 2030: Analysts Weigh In According to recent projections by Changelly, OKB could reach a maximum value of $494.76 by 2030. The forecasted average sits at $411.32, while conservative estimates suggest a floor of $285.55. These predictions are anchored in OKX’s growing market share, the scarcity created by token burns, and enhanced interoperability initiatives across its product suite. Such a price outlook is contingent on sustained exchange dominance and ecosystem expansion. OKB’s long-term price may also be influenced by macroeconomic factors, such as inflation hedging, dollar devaluation, and integration with tokenized financial systems. The upward trajectory is plausible, though not guaranteed. This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Readers should conduct their own research before making any investment decisions. Risks to Consider with OKB’s Long-Term Forecast Despite positive outlooks, OKB is not without risk. Regulatory crackdowns on centralized exchanges, particularly in high-stakes markets like the U.S., could stifle OKX’s operations. Furthermore, exchange hacks, smart contract vulnerabilities, or declines in trading volume could erode OKB’s utility. Competition from decentralized exchanges and emerging blockchain ecosystems may also impact OKB’s market share. While the token burn mechanism supports scarcity, demand-side stagnation can diminish its impact. Price forecasts are speculative and depend heavily on evolving market sentiment. Qubetics: Redefining Interoperability and Token Utility While OKB commands attention, another crypto project is gaining rapid momentum in parallel: Qubetics. This emerging Layer-1 platform is making headlines for its powerful application interoperability framework. Qubetics enables seamless communication between distinct blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos. Its architecture is designed for enterprise-grade scalability, with zero-knowledge proofs and secure validator layers ensuring high throughput and privacy. Qubetics eliminates the silos between blockchain ecosystems, allowing smart contracts to operate across platforms without compromising speed or trust. In an era where interoperability defines usability, Qubetics offers a unique value proposition. Qubetics Presale Momentum Signals Early Community Confidence Qubetics is currently in its 36th presale stage. The presale has already sold over 514 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,100 holders. The platform has raised more than $17.4 million, showcasing strong market demand and early community engagement. The current token price stands at $0.3064, still considered an entry point by many analysts. The ongoing crypto presale campaign is structured to reward early adopters. Analysts estimate that if $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the return on investment could be 226%. Should the token rise to $5, ROI jumps to 1,531%. At $6, the return expands to 1,857%. If the token hits $10, community members could see gains of 3,163%. A potential surge to $15 after the mainnet launch could bring a staggering 4,794% ROI. These projections underscore why Qubetics is being closely watched. The protocol’s focus on technical innovation, combined with a strong presale performance, gives it a viable chance to emerge as a leading utility asset over the next few years. This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Always perform your due diligence before participating in any crypto presale or investment. Final Thoughts OKB stands as a proven asset within the exchange-token niche. Its established utility, deflationary tokenomics, and exchange dominance offer a level of security that few other projects can replicate. The 2030 price prediction of $494 is ambitious, but achievable if current trends persist. On the other hand, Qubetics represents the frontier of what next-generation blockchains aim to accomplish. Its focus on interoperability and early presale traction suggest that it may follow a high-growth trajectory. While OKB offers stability and proven utility, Qubetics offers transformative potential for those willing to embrace calculated risk. Both assets occupy different ends of the crypto spectrum: one rooted in existing infrastructure, the other trailblazing the future. For community members looking to diversify between growth and security, watching both OKB and Qubetics could be a prudent strategy.

Reports indicate that Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), known for its social media platform Truth Social, is exploring a massive fundraising effort specifically aimed at venturing into the crypto space. This potential move could signal a significant embrace of digital assets by a prominent media entity. What is Trump Media Planning for Crypto Investment ? According to the Financial Times, citing unnamed sources familiar with the company’s plans, TMTG is looking to raise a substantial $3 billion. The primary target for deploying these funds is reportedly Crypto Investment , with particular interest in established digital currencies like Bitcoin . The proposed fundraising structure involves a two-pronged approach: Share Issuance: TMTG aims to secure $2 billion by issuing new shares. This would dilute existing ownership but provide a significant capital injection. Convertible Bonds: The remaining $1 billion is planned to be raised through the issuance of convertible bonds. These bonds can later be converted into equity under certain conditions, offering another pathway for capital generation. This ambitious Fundraising goal highlights the company’s apparent conviction in the potential of digital assets as a future area of growth and diversification. Why Would Trump Media Enter the Crypto Space? The potential entry of a company like Trump Media into the cryptocurrency market raises several interesting questions. While the company’s core business is social media and technology, expanding into crypto could be driven by various factors: Diversification: Investing in cryptocurrencies could offer a way to diversify the company’s assets beyond its primary operations, potentially hedging against volatility in the tech or media sectors. Engagement with a Tech-Savvy Audience: The user base for platforms like Truth Social often overlaps with individuals interested in technology, finance, and alternative investments, including cryptocurrencies. A direct involvement in crypto could resonate with this audience. Exploring New Revenue Streams: Beyond direct investment, TMTG could explore integrating crypto features into its platforms, such as payments, NFTs, or tokenized content, tapping into new revenue possibilities within the Digital World . Strategic Positioning: Embracing technologies like Bitcoin and blockchain could be seen as a strategic move to position TMTG at the forefront of digital innovation, aligning with themes popular among its user base. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and the Market? A $3 billion investment, even if phased over time, represents a significant capital allocation. If a substantial portion of this were directed towards Bitcoin , it could have several implications: Increased Institutional Interest: While not a traditional financial institution, a publicly traded media company making a large crypto allocation adds to the narrative of increasing institutional adoption, potentially encouraging others. Market Impact: A large purchase of Bitcoin could exert upward pressure on its price, depending on market conditions and the timing of the investment. Validation: A high-profile company publicly backing crypto through investment can lend further legitimacy to the asset class in the eyes of mainstream investors. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is currently a report based on unnamed sources. The actual investment amount, the specific cryptocurrencies targeted beyond mentions of Bitcoin , and the timeline for both the Fundraising and investment remain subject to change or confirmation. Navigating the Digital World of Crypto: Challenges and Opportunities While the potential opportunities are clear, venturing into crypto also presents challenges for Trump Media : Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its significant price swings, which could impact the value of TMTG’s investment portfolio. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing potential risks and compliance hurdles. Technical Complexity: Managing and securing significant crypto holdings requires specialized expertise and infrastructure. Public Perception: Crypto remains a polarizing topic for some, and TMTG’s move could face scrutiny or criticism. Successfully navigating these challenges while capitalizing on the opportunities presented by the Digital World will be key to the success of this potential venture. Actionable Insights for Readers For those following the market or interested in TMTG: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from TMTG regarding their Fundraising efforts and investment plans. Monitor Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin , reacts to confirmed news regarding TMTG’s entry. Research Due Diligence: If considering investment in TMTG or cryptocurrencies based on this news, conduct thorough research on both the company’s fundamentals and the specific digital assets. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Digital World ? The report that Trump Media is planning a substantial $3 billion Fundraising effort for Crypto Investment , with a focus on Bitcoin , is a significant development. If confirmed and executed, it represents a bold step by a prominent media company into the rapidly evolving Digital World of digital assets. While opportunities for growth and diversification exist, the company will need to navigate the inherent volatility and regulatory complexities of the crypto market. This potential move underscores the increasing convergence of traditional industries and decentralized finance, signaling a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in corporate strategies.

Data from CoinShares shows institutions poured $3.3 billion into Bitcoin ETFs last week alone, $10.8 billion YTD. This is Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a portfolio diversifier with US Treasury yields rising and fiscal outlook cloudy. US led the inflows with $3.2 billion, Australia, Hong Kong and Germany followed with smaller allocations. Source: CoinShares But not all flows were bullish: XRP saw outflows of $37 million, breaking its 80 week inflow streak as Bitcoin and Ethereum took center stage. Market Sentiment: Institutions Strong, Retail Eyes Altcoins Institutions are betting on Bitcoin as a macro hedge, retail is getting cautious. Social media is shifting to smaller cap tokens like FloppyPepe (FPPE) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) with influencers highlighting their upside as Bitcoin consolidates. On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows 99% of BTC supply is in profit, a level associated with market euphoria but also profit taking.

High US Treasury yields, potential Moody’s downgrade and geopolitical concerns are keeping investors on edge. But Bitcoin’s resilience in these conditions reinforces its dual role as risk asset and safe-haven. Technical Outlook: Key Levels for Bitcoin Price Bitcoin 2 hour chart is consolidating just above the 50 EMA at $108,731 and the ascending trendline from $102,190. The 0.236 Fibonacci level at $109,653 has been a pivot with small bodied candles and doji formations showing market indecision.

A failure to hold above $108,731 could see a pullback to $107,078 or $105,905. For now, wait for clear signals before entering and Bitcoin’s resilience in macro headwinds is short term bullish. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.33M Mark as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With BTC/USD dipping below $110,000, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,384,454/ $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

Under the surface, U.S. fiscal policy decisions and the advancement of the GENIUS Act are redefining how institutional capital, retail investors, and policymakers approach the crypto sector. Bitcoin recently set a new all-time high near $112,000 before pulling back slightly. That move wasn’t just technical — it was driven by macroeconomic shifts, including concerns over U.S. sovereign debt, inflationary pressure, and a recalibration of monetary policy. For many investors, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as both a high-growth asset and a long-term hedge against monetary uncertainty . The GENIUS Act: Opening the Door to Regulated Crypto Integration The GENIUS Act , recently passed in the U.S. Senate, focuses on establishing clearer frameworks around stablecoins, on-chain payments, and digital asset disclosures . It represents a formal shift in Washington’s tone — from adversarial to strategic. While not Bitcoin-specific, the Act provides institutional players with a pathway to explore digital asset exposure under clear rules. This regulatory clarity may help reduce the friction for broader adoption, especially among traditional financial institutions that have been cautious due to compliance risks. Bitcoin’s Role in a Changing Policy Landscape As U.S. fiscal dynamics remain volatile, Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized, supply-capped store of value continues to grow. With ETFs now active, institutional inflows are reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin isn’t speculative — it’s strategic. But as capital flows into blue-chip crypto assets, investors are also seeking earlier-stage exposure to high-upside opportunities. One project benefiting from this parallel trend is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a fast-growing crypto asset designed with a $0.007 listing target , fixed 100 billion supply , and upcoming staking utility . While Bitcoin remains the macro hedge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a strategic early-stage entry point with future utility built in. As regulation and fiscal conditions evolve, both institutional giants like Bitcoin and emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are playing key roles in what could be a transformative crypto decade.

As market sentiment tilts bullish, only a few names are turning heads. At the top is BlockDAG, rolling out a rare deal where topping up $100 on a $200 spend unlocks a 4X stack. With a $269 million presale and 21.3 billion BDAG coins already sold, BlockDAG easily leads the most promising cryptos in 2025. Here’s what makes it, and three other standout projects, worth watching. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Limited-Time 4X Stacking Opportunity Leading the Presale Boom Among the most promising cryptos in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with a strategic offer tailored for quick gains. It has already secured $269 million in presale funding and introduced a unique bonus system, contributing 50% of your initial spend again earns you 4x the original BDAG coins. For example, a $200 spend with an added $100 gives users four times the original allocation. The figures tell the story: over 21.3 billion BDAG sold, price locked at $0.0020 until June 13, and an ROI since batch 1 reaching 2,520%. The team is also prepping for listings across 20 exchanges during its upcoming GO LIVE Reveal. Once the price lock ends, this offer is gone. It’s a high-reward window rarely seen in presale phases, making BlockDAG a top name among the most promising cryptos in 2025. 2. Near Protocol (NEAR): High-Speed Blockchain for User-Friendly dApps NEAR is securing its position among the most promising cryptos in 2025 by combining performance with ease of use. Its advanced sharding tech boosts transaction speed, while its environment supports both new and experienced devs. This makes NEAR a preferred choice for high-speed apps needing low fees. The NEAR Foundation has helped drive growth by backing developers with grants and key resources. Now expanding into multichain support and Web3 usability upgrades, NEAR is doing more than just keeping up, it’s building. This push toward functional adoption helps it stay relevant among the most promising cryptos in 2025. 3. Polygon (MATIC): Scalable Ecosystem Bridging Enterprise and DeFi Polygon is making its mark among the most promising cryptos in 2025 with its real-world tech reach. Beyond its ties to Ethereum, Polygon is powering big brand rollouts, from Starbucks to Reddit. The integration of zkEVM further proves its push for greater privacy and efficiency. Polygon’s support for zero-knowledge rollups and modular networks shows it’s focused on next-gen scaling. With use cases rising in both business and DeFi spaces, MATIC continues to offer real traction, ensuring it remains among the most promising cryptos in 2025. 4. Celestia (TIA): Data-Focused Blockchain With Modular Architecture Celestia is shaking up standard blockchain frameworks, giving developers more power to build tailored chains. It separates the consensus layer from execution, allowing teams to optimize performance and efficiency. This design helps reduce limitations seen in older blockchain models. With rollups and Layer 2 projects demanding scalable data layers, Celestia fits naturally into the upgrade path. Its modular design avoids typical performance blocks and enhances security. These factors place TIA firmly in discussions about the most promising cryptos in 2025. Final Thoughts! Few presales can match what BlockDAG is offering right now. With a $200 spend followed by a $100 top-up delivering 4x coin holdings, it’s a rare chance that won’t last beyond June 13. Add in a fixed price of $0.0020, 21.3 billion coins already sold, and upcoming listings on 20 exchanges, and the numbers speak loud. NEAR, Polygon, and Celestia deserve attention for their strong fundamentals and tech routes. But for those after near-term returns and strategic entry, BlockDAG clearly leads among the most promising cryptos in 2025 . If you’re building your 2025 game plan, this list is your starting point.

45136554,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=163028,1748304025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45136554.jpeg,Circle Firmly Denies Sale Rumors: What It Means for USDC Stability,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/circle-denies-sale-rumors/,"BitcoinWorld Circle Firmly Denies Sale Rumors: What It Means for USDC Stability In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, rumors can spread like wildfire, often causing market jitters and speculation. Recently, a report surfaced suggesting that USDC issuer Circle , one of the most prominent companies in the stablecoin space, might be considering a sale. This news sent ripples through the crypto community, given Circle’s central role in the digital asset ecosystem. However, Circle has stepped forward to directly address and firmly deny these claims, providing clarity amidst the noise. What Were the Circle Sale Rumors All About? The speculation originated from a report by Fortune, which cited unnamed sources suggesting that Circle had engaged in informal discussions about a potential sale of the company. The report specifically mentioned potential talks with two other major players in the crypto industry: Coinbase and Ripple. Coinbase, a long-standing partner of Circle and co-founder of the Centre Consortium which initially governed USDC, and Ripple, a blockchain payments company, were named as parties with whom Circle allegedly held these preliminary discussions. Considering Circle’s significant market position, particularly with its widely used USDC stablecoin, the idea of a potential crypto company sale involving such a key player is naturally a major news item. A sale could have significant implications for the stablecoin market, regulatory landscapes, and the broader crypto industry structure. Circle Denies Sale : Setting the Record Straight Responding to the report, Circle issued a clear and unequivocal denial. According to reporting by PYMNTS, Circle stated directly that the company is not for sale. This statement aims to quell the speculation and reassure partners, customers, and the wider market about the company’s future direction and stability. Circle emphasized that its long-term goals remain unchanged. While the specific details of these goals weren’t reiterated in the context of the denial, Circle has historically communicated ambitions related to the expansion of USDC adoption globally, compliance with evolving regulations, and the development of financial infrastructure built on stablecoins and blockchain technology. Here’s a quick comparison of the rumor vs. reality: Rumor: Circle is considering selling the company and talking to potential buyers like Coinbase and Ripple. Reality (According to Circle): The company is not for sale, and its long-term strategic objectives remain the same. This direct denial from Circle is a crucial development. In the absence of a clear statement, rumors can persist and potentially impact market sentiment or even Circle’s business operations and partnerships. Why Does This Matter? Understanding USDC Issuer Circle ‘s Role Circle isn’t just any crypto company; it’s a foundational piece of the current crypto financial system, primarily through its role as the issuer of USDC. USDC is one of the largest and most widely used stablecoins globally, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Stablecoins like USDC are vital for the crypto market as they provide a stable store of value and a medium of exchange that avoids the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, while still operating on blockchain networks. Circle’s operations involve managing the reserves that back USDC, ensuring transparency and compliance, and facilitating the issuance and redemption of the stablecoin. This requires significant regulatory engagement and financial partnerships. Any uncertainty about Circle’s ownership or strategic direction could theoretically impact confidence in USDC itself, which is why the company’s swift denial was important. Key Aspects of Circle and USDC: Stability: USDC aims for a stable 1:1 peg to the USD, crucial for trading, lending, and payments in crypto. Transparency: Circle provides regular reports on the reserves backing USDC. Adoption: USDC is integrated across numerous exchanges, DeFi protocols, and payment platforms. Regulation: Circle actively engages with regulators globally, aiming to operate within compliant frameworks. Given this central role, the idea of a sale or significant change in ownership naturally sparks interest and concern about how it might affect the stablecoin’s future management, regulatory approach, and overall reliability. The Context: Why Would Coinbase, Ripple, Circle Talks Be Speculated? While Circle denies the talks, it’s worth briefly considering why such speculation might arise, even if unfounded. The crypto industry is constantly evolving, with companies seeking strategic advantages, partnerships, or potential acquisitions to grow and navigate challenging market conditions or regulatory shifts. Coinbase already has a deep relationship with Circle through USDC. Ripple is focused on global payments and expanding its services. In a consolidating market, strategic moves are common. However, speculation doesn’t equate to reality, as Circle’s denial clearly indicates. Potential Reasons for M&A Speculation (Generally in Crypto): Market downturns can lead to consolidation. Companies seek to acquire technology or user bases. Strengthening competitive positions. Navigating complex regulatory environments together. It’s important to differentiate between general industry trends that might fuel speculation and specific, denied reports like the one concerning Circle. Actionable Insights for the Reader For individuals holding or using USDC, or participating in the crypto market, Circle’s denial offers a degree of reassurance. It suggests that, from the company’s perspective, it is maintaining its current course and commitment to its stablecoin operations and growth strategy. This reinforces the narrative of stability that is fundamental to a stablecoin’s value proposition. For those interested in the business side of crypto, this event highlights how quickly rumors can spread and the importance of official statements from the companies involved. It also underscores the strategic importance of key infrastructure providers like Circle in the ecosystem. Concluding Thoughts: Stability Amidst Rumors Circle’s swift and clear denial of the Fortune report regarding potential sale talks with entities like Coinbase and Ripple serves to reinforce its stated commitment to its existing mission and long-term goals as a leading USDC issuer Circle . While speculation is part of the dynamic crypto landscape, the company’s direct response aims to provide confidence in its continued operation and the stability of the USDC stablecoin. This event reminds the market that official communications are key in navigating the often rumor-driven world of cryptocurrency news and corporate strategy.

Over 70% Of XRP Realized Cap Is Six Months Old Or Younger In a post on X, Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt.₿ has talked about the capital inflow situation related to XRP. The indicator of relevance here is the “Realized Cap,” which is a model that, in short, keeps track of the sum of the cost bases of all addresses on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Here—Time To Be A Contrarian? In other words, the indicator provides an estimate of the total amount of capital that the holders as a whole have invested into the cryptocurrency. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how this metric has changed for XRP over the past decade. As is visible in the graph, the XRP Realized Cap (black curve) has witnessed an explosion alongside the recent bullish push in the asset’s price. This would imply that a large amount of new capital has come into the cryptocurrency. In the same chart, the Glassnode researcher has also attached the data related to the Realized Cap associated with the different coin groups younger than six months. The aggregated Realized Cap has seen its growth during the past six months, so it’s not surprising to see that the capital held by cohorts falling in this age range has seen its share of the indicator blow up. This massive capital wouldn’t be in any significant profit, however, considering the price levels at which it has flowed in. After all, the window of the past six months is mostly just the cryptocurrency’s top and the subsequent phase of stagnation that’s still ongoing today. “Over 70% of the capital locked in XRP was deployed near the top over the past 6 months,” notes the analyst. Naturally, this could put the digital asset in a delicate situation, as it wouldn’t take much of a drawdown to throw all these investors into the red. It now remains to be seen how the coin would develop in the near future and whether capital would continue to flow in, despite the fact that its price has been unable to revisit the highs from January. In some other news, the XRP network has seen a sharp decline in the Number of Active Addresses since the March peak, as CryptoVizArt.₿ has pointed out in another X post. The Number of Active Addresses is an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the number of addresses taking part in transaction activity on the XRP network every day. Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals From the chart, it’s apparent that the Number of Active Addresses set a huge peak in March of this year, but since then, activity on the blockchain has taken a severe hit as the metric has gone down by more than 90%.

The TRUMP coin price continues to swing based on short-lived events, while the Cardano (ADA) price potential faces pressure from fading on-chain activity. These assets still dominate headlines, but in terms of investor preference, momentum is shifting toward functionality, and that’s where Web3 ai is rising fast. Now in Stage 06 of its presale and priced at $0.000383, Web3 ai has already raised over $5.5 million. With a projected ROI of 1,747% by the time it hits launch price at $0.005242, the platform is gaining status not just as the next most popular cryptocurrency, but as one built on actual utility. Its roadmap is built around future expansion, real-world AI tools, and integrations across the broader Web3 space. TRUMP Coin (TRUMP): Short-Term Price, No Long-Term Path The TRUMP coin price has rallied on the back of media-driven hype and politically timed surges. Recent analysis shows traders debating whether to buy or sell ahead of scheduled high-visibility events, with short-term gains often followed by steep corrections. This pattern has repeated throughout 2025, and while it brings volume, it doesn’t offer sustainability. The TRUMP coin price lacks connection to a platform or product. Without any long-term roadmap or innovation plan, it continues to rely entirely on attention cycles. As a result, many traders are exiting after quick profits, and long-term investors are beginning to question its ceiling. Despite being one of the most popular cryptocurrency names in headlines, TRUMP’s value narrative ends at entertainment. Investors now looking for breakout ROI with structure are looking elsewhere. Cardano (ADA): Price Potential Falls as Usage Drops The Cardano (ADA) price potential continues to suffer from falling network activity. Data shows significant declines in both transaction volume and user engagement, leading ADA to test key support levels without strong buying interest. While Cardano’s long-term vision of a secure, decentralized network remains, the current pace of innovation appears to be slowing. Historically, ADA’s price potential has been driven by anticipation: staking, upgrades, ecosystem rollouts. But with competitors delivering faster iterations and utility-focused platforms gaining traction, Cardano is now lagging. Even loyal holders are acknowledging the risk of missing the next market cycle’s top performers. In terms of the most popular cryptocurrency heading into 2025, Cardano still has brand equity, but its user base is watching faster-moving, AI-enhanced platforms. Web3 ai: Future Utility and AI Expansion Behind $5.5M Momentum Web3 ai is not a meme coin or a legacy Layer-1. It’s a multi-tool ecosystem designed to help crypto investors make smarter decisions. While the TRUMP coin price relies on noise and the Cardano (ADA) price potential leans on history, Web3 ai is gaining investors by building forward. As part of its future expansion plan, Web3 ai is preparing additional tools: NFT analysis models, chatbot integrations, and SDKs for developers. This will open the platform to creators and institutions looking to embed AI directly into their own crypto products. The result is an ecosystem that adapts, scales, and meets new needs as the industry evolves. Web3 ai is also working on partnerships with exchanges, wallets, and DeFi platforms to allow native use of its tools through third-party integrations. This interoperability expands the reach of $WAI far beyond its own interface, making it part of users’ daily crypto workflows, not just another token in their portfolio. Currently in Stage 06, the $WAI token is priced at $0.000383. With a projected listing price of $0.005242, early buyers are positioned for a 1,747% ROI. Over $5.5 million has already been raised, reflecting growing confidence in the platform’s ability to stand out from traditional and hype-driven tokens. The Final Verdict The TRUMP coin price may spike on news and events, and the Cardano (ADA) price potential may return with ecosystem improvements, but both rely on either hype or history. Web3 ai, on the other hand, is building a forward-facing, utility-first ecosystem backed by AI tools and real integrations. With $0.000383 entry pricing, a forecasted 1,747% ROI, over $5.5 million raised, and an expansion roadmap that includes NFTs, SDKs, and wallet integrations, Web3 ai is becoming more than a trending name. It’s emerging as a serious contender for the most popular cryptocurrency of 2025, not because of what it represents, but because of what it actually helps you do.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 138,500 followers on the social media platform X that resistance around the $0.26 level is key for the dog-themed digital asset. The trader shares a chart suggesting that $0.26 is a price area that appears to be a trend shift level for DOGE. “This level remains the most important resistance wall for Dogecoin.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Dogecoin is trading for $0.22 at time of writing, a 3.3% decrease during the last 24 hours. Moving on to smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ), Martinez says that a breakout past $186 could trigger an exponential rally that sends the asset shooting past a $3,000 price tag. “A breakout here could trigger a parabolic bull run for Solana!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Solana is trading for $172 at time of writing, a 2.6% decrease on the day. Turning his attention to the payments platform Stellar ( XLM ), Martinez says that it could witness a correction after moving below a diagonal support. “XLM could be breaking out of an ascending channel, potentially targeting $0.26!” Source: Ali Martinez/X XLM is trading for $0.28 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease on the day. Concluding his analysis with the native asset of the layer-1 platform Toncoin ( TON ), the analyst notes that it too looks to be on the cusp of breaking down of a symmetrical triangle pattern. In technical analysis, a move below the diagonal trendline of a triangle pattern suggests that an asset is primed for corrective moves. “Watch out! Toncoin could be breaking out of a symmetrical triangle.” Source: Ali Martinez/X TON is trading for $3.00 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

Dubai, a global hub for innovation and luxury real estate, is making headlines with a groundbreaking move. The city’s Land Department has officially launched a significant initiative to tokenize its vast real estate market, leveraging the power of the XRP Ledger. This isn’t just a small pilot; we’re talking about a plan targeting a staggering $16 billion worth of property assets for tokenization by 2033. This ambitious project is set to redefine how people invest in and own property in one of the world’s most sought-after locations, making it more accessible than ever before. Dubai Real Estate Tokenization Takes a Giant Leap The core of this exciting development is the launch of Prypco Mint, a platform specifically designed for tokenizing real estate assets. This platform is the result of a collaboration between Dubai’s Land Department, real estate technology firm Prypco, and blockchain solutions provider Ctrl Alt. Their goal is clear: to bring the benefits of blockchain technology and tokenization to the traditional real estate sector, starting with Dubai’s properties. The initiative aims to tokenize a substantial portion of Dubai’s property market – approximately 7% – over the next decade, culminating in the $16 billion target reported by CoinDesk. This isn’t just about putting property data on a blockchain; it’s about creating liquid, divisible digital representations of physical assets, directly linked to official title deeds. Imagine owning a piece of a prime Dubai property without needing to buy the entire building! That’s the promise of this new era in Dubai real estate tokenization . How Does Prypco Mint Enable This Transformation? Prypco Mint acts as the bridge between the physical world of bricks and mortar and the digital realm of blockchain tokens. Here’s a simplified look at how it works: Asset Identification: Identifying suitable real estate assets for tokenization. Legal Structuring: Setting up the necessary legal frameworks to represent property ownership digitally. Token Creation: Minting digital tokens on the chosen blockchain (the XRP Ledger in this case), with each token representing a fractional share of the underlying property. Linking to Official Records: Crucially, ensuring these digital tokens and the associated ownership rights are synced with the official title deeds maintained by the Dubai Land Department. This provides a layer of trust and regulatory backing often missing in earlier tokenization attempts. Platform Listing: Making these tokens available for purchase and potential trading on the Prypco Mint platform or linked marketplaces. This process streamlines transactions, reduces paperwork, and aims to make property investment significantly more efficient. Why the XRP Ledger for Real Estate Tokenization? The choice of the XRP Ledger as the underlying blockchain for this massive tokenization effort is notable. While the official reasons weren’t detailed in the initial report, blockchain networks chosen for large-scale enterprise applications like this are typically selected based on several key factors: Speed and Efficiency: The ability to process transactions quickly and at a low cost is essential for facilitating trading and transfer of property tokens. Scalability: Handling a large volume of transactions and a growing number of tokenized assets requires a network that can scale effectively. Reliability and Security: Ensuring the integrity and security of the digital ownership records is paramount. Suitability for Asset Issuance: The XRP Ledger has features designed to facilitate the issuance and management of various types of assets, including potentially real estate tokens. By leveraging the XRP Ledger , Dubai is signaling confidence in the network’s capabilities to support a regulated, high-value application like real estate tokenization at scale. This move could serve as a significant case study for the adoption of specific blockchain technologies in government-backed initiatives. Fractional Ownership: Opening Doors to Dubai Property One of the most exciting aspects of this initiative is the emphasis on fractional ownership . Traditionally, investing in Dubai real estate requires significant capital, often locking out smaller investors. Prypco Mint changes this by allowing individuals to own a piece of a property starting with an investment as low as 2,000 UAE dirhams, which is approximately $540 USD. What does this mean in practice? It democratizes access to Dubai’s lucrative property market. Instead of needing hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to buy an apartment or villa, you can now potentially invest a much smaller amount to own a tokenized share of a high-value asset like a hotel, commercial building, or residential complex. The benefits of this approach are numerous: Lower Barrier to Entry: Makes property investment accessible to a wider range of investors, both local and international. Diversification: Allows investors to spread their capital across multiple properties or types of real estate rather than concentrating it in one asset. Increased Liquidity: Tokenized assets can potentially be bought and sold more easily on secondary markets compared to traditional property, which is often illiquid. Portfolio Building: Enables investors to build a diversified real estate portfolio with smaller capital outlays. This focus on fractional ownership is a key driver behind the potential success and broad adoption of the Prypco Mint platform. Exploring the Potential of Blockchain Real Estate The integration of blockchain technology with real estate goes far beyond just fractional ownership. The broader concept of blockchain real estate promises to address many inefficiencies and pain points in the traditional property market. Consider the typical process of buying or selling a property: It involves numerous intermediaries (agents, lawyers, banks, escrow services). It requires extensive paperwork and manual verification. Transactions can be slow, taking weeks or even months to complete. Transparency can be limited, and fraud is a potential risk. By leveraging blockchain, many of these issues can be mitigated. Smart contracts can automate parts of the transaction process, reducing the need for intermediaries and speeding things up. The transparent and immutable nature of the blockchain ledger can provide a clear and verifiable record of ownership and transaction history. This vision of blockchain real estate is what Dubai is actively pursuing, aiming to create a more efficient, transparent, and secure market. Navigating the Landscape: What Challenges Lie Ahead? While the potential is immense, the path to fully realizing the $16 billion tokenization goal is not without its challenges. Implementing such a large-scale initiative requires careful planning and execution. Some potential hurdles in real estate tokenization include: Regulatory Clarity: Ensuring a clear and stable regulatory framework for tokenized securities and property ownership is crucial for investor confidence and legal certainty. Dubai has made significant strides in crypto regulation, but applying it specifically to real estate tokens at this scale is an ongoing process. Market Adoption: Educating investors, developers, and traditional market participants about the benefits and mechanics of tokenization is necessary for widespread adoption. Valuation and Pricing: Establishing reliable and transparent methods for valuing tokenized real estate assets and ensuring fair pricing on secondary markets. Security Risks: While blockchain is secure, the platforms and wallets used to hold and trade tokens must also be robust against cyber threats. Integration with Existing Systems: Seamlessly integrating the blockchain platform with existing land registry systems and financial infrastructure is a complex technical task. Dubai’s approach, involving the Land Department directly and linking tokens to official deeds, addresses some of these challenges head-on, particularly regarding legal recognition and integration with official records. However, overcoming these hurdles will be key to achieving the ambitious 2033 target for real estate tokenization . Why Dubai is a Natural Fit for This Innovation Dubai has consistently positioned itself as a forward-thinking city eager to embrace technological advancements. It has actively courted blockchain companies, established crypto regulations, and launched various digital initiatives. Its strong real estate market, coupled with its ambition to be a global leader in technology and finance, makes it an ideal testbed for large-scale blockchain real estate projects like this. The government’s direct involvement through the Land Department provides a level of legitimacy and trust that is often difficult for private ventures to achieve alone. This institutional backing is a critical factor that could propel the Prypco Mint platform and the broader tokenization initiative towards success. The Future is Fractional and Digital The launch of Prypco Mint and the $16 billion tokenization target represent a significant milestone not just for Dubai, but for the global real estate and blockchain industries. It demonstrates a clear pathway for transforming illiquid, high-value physical assets into accessible, tradable digital tokens. This initiative has the potential to unlock significant capital, attract new investors, and set a precedent for other cities and countries looking to modernize their property markets. As the platform develops and more properties are tokenized, we can expect to see increased liquidity in the market, potentially more dynamic pricing, and a shift in how people perceive property investment. The collaboration between government entities and private tech firms, utilizing robust blockchain networks like the XRP Ledger , showcases a model for future digital economies. Conclusion Dubai’s ambitious plan to tokenize $16 billion of real estate on the XRP Ledger via the Prypco Mint platform is a bold statement about the future of property ownership and investment. By enabling fractional ownership from just $540 and linking digital tokens directly to official title deeds, the initiative aims to democratize access to Dubai’s prime real estate market, enhance liquidity, and leverage the efficiencies of blockchain technology. While challenges related to regulation and adoption remain, the strong governmental backing and the clear vision for integrating blockchain real estate into the city’s economy position Dubai at the forefront of this global trend. This development is a powerful indicator of how digital assets and blockchain are set to disrupt traditional industries, creating new opportunities for investors worldwide.

The Bank of Russia has kept its key rate at 21 percent since an emergency increase in October. The tight stance helped slow soaring prices but has also choked investment, just as the boost from heavy wartime spending starts to fade. Moscow’s economic authorities usually present a unified front, yet high interest rates, large budget spending, and strict capital controls have triggered open disputes in recent years. In August 2023, the central bank was forced to call an unscheduled meeting and lift rates by 3.5 percentage points after President Vladimir Putin’s then economic adviser, Maxim Oreshkin, publicly blamed “soft” monetary policy. In March this year, Putin told officials not to freeze the economy “like in a cryotherapy chamber,” a remark many analysts read as a call to begin easing. Speaking to lawmakers in the State Duma on Monday, Reshetnikov said weekly data suggest annualized inflation had dropped to between 3 and 4 percent. “We expect that May figures will confirm this trend, and we, of course, expect the central bank to consider it, because we also see risks of economic hypothermia in the current regime,” he said. The economy ministry puts consumer price growth for 2025 at 7.6 percent, a level Reshetnikov called “realistic.” Signs of cooling demand in Russia are already visible A Russian Railways planning paper last week showed major exporters, including aluminum group Rusal and oil producer Gazpromneft, cutting the volumes of metals and oil products they intend to move by rail. The document points to weaker sales at a time when the broader economy is slowing. Many factories say the 21 percent borrowing cost is too high and have trimmed investment plans. The ministry foresees gross domestic product expanding by 2.5 percent this year, compared with the central bank’s own forecast of 1 to 2 percent. The next rate-setting meeting falls on 6 June. The central bank, for its part, has said it will weigh incoming data but warns that an early cut could reignite price growth if households rush to spend savings and if the ruble comes under new pressure from sanctions or falling export revenues. While economic debate intensifies at home, Russia has shown little interest in peace talks with Ukraine. Military analysts describe recent short “ceasefires” as performative, and efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to draw President Putin into negotiations have failed. Instead, Moscow is widely expected to launch a fresh summer offensive aimed at securing more ground in the south and east of Ukraine, areas its forces partly occupy. Success on the battlefield could strengthen Russia’s hand in any eventual talks. Even so, growing pressures, from securing enough weapons to coping with sanctions on exports like oil that generate a major portion of the revenue, may pull the Kremlin toward the negotiating table.

The crypto space is buzzing with news about Lagrange Labs , a prominent player in the cross-chain infrastructure sector, and their upcoming utility token launch. Get ready, because the LA token is coming, and with it, an anticipated crypto airdrop . What is Lagrange Labs and Why Does it Matter? Lagrange Labs is building essential infrastructure designed to solve one of the biggest challenges in blockchain today: seamless and secure communication between different blockchain networks. Think of it as creating superhighways that allow data and assets to flow freely and reliably from one chain to another. This is crucial for the growth of decentralized applications (dApps) and the overall crypto ecosystem. Their focus on cross-chain capabilities positions them at the forefront of blockchain interoperability. By enabling efficient communication, they aim to unlock new possibilities for developers and users alike, potentially leading to more complex and powerful dApps that aren’t limited to a single network. The Arrival of the LA Token After establishing a dedicated foundation to oversee its development and ecosystem growth, Lagrange Labs is now set to launch its own native utility token, the LA token . The introduction of a native token is a significant step for the project, often serving multiple purposes within the ecosystem. Utility tokens like LA can be used for various functions, such as governance (allowing token holders to vote on project proposals), paying for services within the network, staking to secure the network or earn rewards, and potentially accessing exclusive features. The specific utilities for the LA token will be detailed further by Lagrange Labs, but its existence signifies a move towards a more decentralized and community-driven model for the project. Get Ready for the Crypto Airdrop: How to Participate Perhaps the most exciting news for many in the crypto community is the planned crypto airdrop for the LA token . Airdrops are a popular method for projects to distribute tokens to a wide audience, often rewarding early supporters, users of their testnet or platform, or simply active participants in the broader ecosystem. According to recent reports, the registration window for the LA token airdrop is set to open soon. Mark your calendars: Airdrop Registration Start: May 28th Airdrop Registration End: June 2nd This short registration window means interested individuals need to act relatively quickly once it opens. While the exact criteria for eligibility and the registration process details will be provided by Lagrange Labs , typically, participants may need to connect their wallets, complete certain verification steps, or demonstrate prior interaction with the project’s testnet or related activities. Always ensure you are visiting the official Lagrange Labs website or communication channels for accurate instructions to avoid scams. Understanding LA Tokenomics: Supply and Allocation A crucial aspect of any token launch is its tokenomics – the economic model governing the token’s supply, distribution, and utility. Understanding tokenomics provides insight into the project’s long-term vision and how the token is intended to function within its ecosystem. For the LA token , Lagrange Labs has outlined a clear distribution plan: Total Supply Cap: 1 Billion LA tokens The allocation of this total supply is as follows: Community: 34.8% Early Contributors: 25.4% Investors: 18.5% Foundation: 11.3% Initial Airdrop: 10% This allocation structure shows a significant portion dedicated to the community and the initial airdrop, which is often seen as a positive sign for decentralization and broad distribution. The allocation to early contributors and investors is standard for projects that have undergone funding rounds, while the foundation’s share is typically used for ecosystem development, grants, and ongoing operations. What Does the $17 Million Funding Mean? It’s worth noting that Lagrange Labs secured a substantial $17 million in investment last year. This significant funding round demonstrates strong investor confidence in their vision for cross-chain infrastructure and their ability to execute on their roadmap. Such funding is essential for building complex technology, hiring talent, and expanding the project’s reach. The successful funding round likely played a key role in enabling the project to reach this stage, including the development necessary for the LA token launch and the subsequent airdrop. It provides resources to continue building robust and secure cross-chain solutions. Why Airdrops Are Exciting for the Community A crypto airdrop like the one planned by Lagrange Labs serves multiple purposes. For the project, it helps to decentralize token ownership, generate excitement and awareness, and potentially attract new users to their platform or technology. For participants, it offers an opportunity to receive free tokens, becoming early holders and stakeholders in the project’s success. Participating in airdrops can be a way to get involved with promising projects early on. However, it’s always important to do your own research (DYOR) and be cautious of scams. Only use official links provided by Lagrange Labs . Actionable Steps: Preparing for the Airdrop If you’re interested in the LA token airdrop, here are some actionable steps you can take: Monitor Official Channels: Follow Lagrange Labs on their official social media (like Twitter/X), Discord, and check their official website regularly for the precise airdrop registration link and detailed instructions. Prepare Your Wallet: Ensure you have a compatible cryptocurrency wallet ready. MetaMask or similar EVM-compatible wallets are often used for airdrops on networks like Ethereum or Layer 2s, which are common for infrastructure projects. Understand the Criteria: Once released, carefully read the eligibility criteria. Did you use their testnet? Participate in previous campaigns? These factors often determine eligibility. Be Mindful of Security: Never share your private keys or seed phrase. Be wary of phishing attempts and fake websites. Only interact with official sources. Note the Dates: Remember the May 28th to June 2nd registration window. Don’t miss it! Conclusion: A New Chapter for Lagrange Labs and Cross-Chain Infrastructure The launch of the LA token and the accompanying crypto airdrop mark a significant milestone for Lagrange Labs . As they continue to build vital cross-chain infrastructure , the introduction of a native token with a clear tokenomics structure and a community-focused distribution plan via an airdrop signals their commitment to growth and decentralization. This is an exciting development for anyone interested in the future of interoperability and the potential opportunities within the crypto space.

According to the post-mortem report , the main reason for the Cetus incident was a problem in a math library used by Cetus, not a weakness in Sui or Move. Move is a programming language for creating smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, and Sui is a Layer-1 blockchain project. However, based on the report, the effect on users is still the same. As a result, Sui Network revealed that they needed to adopt a more effective approach and improve their efforts to support the ecosystem’s security. Apart from this, the report also highlighted that the network was designed to allow for safer smart contract development, making the first significant incident for a dApp a “deeply sad” moment for the team. Sui team takes effective measures to strengthen the network’s security Last week, the $223 million crypto hack hit the network’s largest decentralized exchange and liquidity provider, Cetus Protocol. Luckily, the network managed to freeze $162 million while Cetus put out a $6 million bounty to reclaim the other $60 million of stolen funds. The Cetus team earlier stated that they were collaborating with the Sui Foundation and other groups in the ecosystem to recover the remaining funds. The Sui Foundation confirmed that many validators had identified the addresses linked to the stolen funds and were blocking transactions on those addresses until further notice. The Cetus team was looking for ways to recover those funds and return them to the community. In addition, to enhance the network’s security, Sui has decided to invest an extra $10 million in security efforts. The network will use this money for audits, bug bounty programs, and formal verification. The team also aims to work with the developer community to finalize these security strategies. Concerning the incident, the team mentioned that it marks a coming-of-age experience, which, according to them, is something every major blockchain has unfortunately faced. They further supported their claim with the argument that no design or programming language can prevent humans from creating bugs. Therefore, the Sui team has urged community members to use this incident as a lesson to learn from it to strengthen vital code on the network and assist builders in taking the necessary steps to come back stronger. Following the CoinMarketCap report, SUI’s price currently trades at $3.49, reflecting a 3.07% decrease in the past 24 hours. Growing cases of cybersecurity raise serious concerns in the crypto world On May 22, the Cetus DEX experienced a hack that was thought to have happened due to a smart contract code issue, resulting in the loss of around $223 million in user funds. Based on the information from the Extractor Web3 security notification tool team, $63 million of the stolen money was moved to the Ethereum network. They also reported a wallet address ending in “AF16” that the hackers used to launder 20,000 Ether worth about $53 million. The recovery efforts and the freezing of assets, organized by various projects, platforms, and validators in the Sui ecosystem, received mixed reactions from the crypto community. Following this, one user commented that the action was good news for the victims. However, according to the user’s argument, if the 114 validators could freeze wallets whenever they wanted, it raised serious concerns about the network’s ability to resist censorship. The user then concluded that Sui was far from decentralized. Notably, the Cetus hack is the latest incident affecting crypto and Web3 in the first half 2025. On top of that, cybersecurity still remains a big concern in the crypto world, with many leaders in the industry urging the sector to self-regulate and strengthen defenses to avoid more regulatory attention.

At first glance, ADA is a well-established project with a mature ecosystem, while MUTM is an emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol with strong potential. This article compares the two to see which has the better chance of delivering 20x returns, focusing on market caps, upcoming milestones, and utility. For aggressive growth investors, understanding this comparison is key to making smart investment choices. Market Cap and Circulating Supply Cardano (ADA) has been around for several years and commands a market cap of billions, currently priced around $0.44. This high valuation reflects its extensive ecosystem, large user base, and many partnerships. However, this maturity also means that ADA’s price growth tends to be slower and more steady rather than explosive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is in its early phase. At $0.03 per token with approximately 11,021 holders, MUTM is still in the presale and early adoption stages. Its market cap is much smaller than ADA’s, meaning that even a modest increase in price could translate into significant percentage gains. This early position offers a chance for outsized returns, especially if the platform delivers on its promises. Upcoming Milestones and Roadmap Cardano (ADA)’s ecosystem development follows a well-established path, with smart contracts, DeFi apps, and partnerships steadily growing. While this stability is attractive to conservative investors, it often limits rapid price surges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, has a dynamic roadmap. The project is set to launch a beta version of its decentralized lending and borrowing platform soon. This upcoming launch is a critical event that will trigger investor interest and price appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique liquidity pools allow users to lend or borrow digital assets with flexible terms, combining P2C (pool-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) models. This flexibility is rare in DeFi and gives MUTM a competitive edge. Understanding Utility: Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stands Out One of the key differences between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) is the utility offered by their tokens. ADA primarily serves as a governance token and a means to participate in Cardano (ADA)’s blockchain. While it is integral to the ecosystem, ADA holders typically gain through network growth rather than direct passive income. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s MUTM token offers tangible earning potential. Users can deposit assets like ETH or DAI into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s liquidity pools to earn passive income. The platform’s utilization rates dynamically adjust interest, meaning that higher borrowing activity leads to better returns for lenders. For example, investing $1,000 at MUTM’s current price of $0.03, if the token grows 22x, will turn into $22,000. This kind of growth paired with passive income from lending rewards creates a strong incentive to invest early. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses a unique system called mtTokens, which represent users’ shares in the liquidity pools and automatically increase in value as interest accrues. This non-custodial system keeps user funds secure while generating steady returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to distribute passive dividends by buying back MUTM tokens with protocol revenue and rewarding stakers, creating a further financial benefit for holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual model also offers advantages. While traditional P2C platforms only allow lending within shared pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2P option enables users to lend and borrow tokens often unavailable on P2C platforms. This includes popular memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB). This flexibility broadens the range of assets available, catering to more diverse investment strategies and increasing the protocol’s appeal. Price Growth Comparison: How Far to 20x? To achieve a 20x gain, ADA priced at $0.44 would need to reach approximately $8.80. Given ADA’s current market cap and its large circulating supply, this level represents a huge jump that would require massive adoption and network expansion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.03, would only need to rise to $0.60 to deliver the same 20x return. Given that MUTM has already increased from its Phase 1 price of $0.01 to $0.03 in Phase 5—a 200% gain so far—it shows strong momentum. The percentage difference between the Phase 1 price and the current price suggests that early investors have already made significant profits, reinforcing why buying in now before the platform fully launches is advantageous. The gains will likely be higher during early phases compared to later ones, as the price tends to stabilize over time. Final Verdict: Which Token Should Aggressive Investors Choose? For aggressive investors looking for explosive growth and the chance to maximize returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a compelling opportunity. Its early-stage status, clear roadmap with an imminent beta launch, and passive income potential through lending pools make MUTM a strong candidate for 20x gains. Cardano (ADA) remains an excellent choice for those who prioritize stability, a mature ecosystem, and long-term steady growth. However, for those willing to take on more risk in exchange for higher rewards, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique features and early adoption phase provide a better upside. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ongoing $100,000 giveaway is another reason to join the community now, helping to build excitement and reward early supporters. In conclusion, while ADA offers a slower climb, MUTM’s blend of innovative DeFi technology, real token utility, and attractive price point make it the more exciting play for investors aiming for substantial short to mid-term gains. The chance to earn passive income on deposits, benefit from the protocol’s buybacks, and participate in a growing, community-driven platform makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the token to watch. If you want to position yourself for growth and financial rewards in the DeFi space, MUTM is worth a serious look today.

Bitcoin’s ecosystem has lagged behind other Layer 1s like Ethereum for years due to technical limitations — especially its lack of support for Turing-complete smart contracts. Bitlayer’s BitVM paradigm addresses this by offering Bitcoin-equivalent security and Turing completeness without altering Bitcoin’s core protocol or compromising its foundational design. But turning that vision into reality requires the cooperation of miners — the entities that create new blocks and validate transactions in exchange for BTC. That’s precisely what this new partnership secures. The three mining pools, representing over 36% of Bitcoin’s total computing power (hashrate), have agreed to support non-standard transactions (NSTs) — a critical piece of BitVM’s challenge-response mechanism, the firms said. Their support removes a key bottleneck to BitVM deployment and brings the system closer to widespread use. NSTs are transactions that are valid under Bitcoin’s consensus rules but are not relayed by the default Bitcoin Core software, making them hard to get confirmed on-chain without miner cooperation. Under this partnership, Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool will serve as guardians of the BitVM Bridge, ensuring NSTs are reliably included in blocks and become part of Bitcoin’s immutable ledger. The BitVM bridge is a special tool that facilitates secure and reliable movement of BTC into other blockchain ecosystems — such as rollups, cross-chain protocols, and smart contracts — without relying on centralized intermediaries. It opens the door for broader Bitcoin DeFi applications while preserving the network’s robust security guarantees. “BitVM represents the most credible path to bring on-chain validation to Bitcoin while maintaining its core security. This partnership solves the critical last-mile challenge of getting Non-Standard Transactions included on-chain,” said Kevin He, co-founder of Bitlayer, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. A win for miners This isn’t just a milestone for Bitlayer — it’s a strategic win for miners as well, especially as they face dwindling income due to per-block BTC rewards being cut in half every four years. Andy, CEO of Antpool, noted that Bitlayer's BitVM can help drive new economic activity and fee-based income for miners. ""Built on BitVM, Bitlayer enables BTC to flow into DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems. That means more use, more fees, and long-term sustainability for miners,"" Andy said in the press release. Leon Liang, chief strategy officer at F2Pool, emphasized the importance of innovation, saying, ""we want to support high-quality projects like Bitlayer that expand what Bitcoin can do.” SpiderPool CTO Kenway spoke to the broader potential of Bitcoin as a financial services platform, stating, ""This partnership lets us unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin DeFi. It enhances Bitcoin’s utility while reinforcing miners’ central role in the ecosystem.” Demand for bitcoin DeFi is growing rapidly Bitlayer’s collaboration with mining giants follows recent integrations with major Layer 1 ecosystems like Sui, Base, Arbitrum, and Starknet. Together, these partnerships reflect a growing demand for secure, Bitcoin-native DeFi infrastructure that scales. Bitlayer is actively onboarding more validators and early adopters to help secure and expand the BitVM Bridge — and to build what could become the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s next evolution.",Finance|Bitcoin|Bitvm|Antpool|F2Pool|Mining|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-27 01:00:00

It has raised nearly $5.4 million, with $WAI priced at $0.000383. A future listing at $0.005242 suggests early buyers could see returns of 1,747%. But beyond the numbers, the project offers useful AI-powered tools for traders. Features include portfolio analytics, scam alerts, DeFi optimization, and more. These tools are only available to $WAI holders after launch. Web3 ai works across Ethereum, BNB, and Solana chains, making it highly accessible. The platform is being shaped into an all-in-one solution for smarter crypto activity. With AI tools set to go live post-presale, the timing for this entry is ideal. Cold Wallet: Protecting Privacy With Zero-Knowledge Proofs Cold Wallet is answering growing concerns about privacy with zero-knowledge storage tech. In stage 9 of its presale, $CWT is priced at $0.0082 and aims for a listing price of $0.3517, suggesting up to a 4,900% return. That places Cold Wallet among the top presale crypto entries in terms of projected ROI. Cold Wallet secures user identity by removing metadata exposure through zero-knowledge proofs. With full non-custodial control, users manage their assets without third-party risks. The MVP is on track for Q3 2025, with listings expected in Q4. As data tracking rises, Cold Wallet’s relevance grows stronger. For privacy-first users, this project offers timely utility and strong growth potential. Final Outlook The top presale crypto names of 2025 are going beyond promises. They’re building real tools, growing user bases, and offering strong market advantages. BlockDAG leads with unmatched presale momentum and advanced tech. Unstaked is redefining how AI functions in Web3. Web3 ai provides practical AI trading solutions, and Cold Wallet protects user privacy with cutting-edge cryptography. Each project plays a different role in the Web3 space, but all are aligned with market needs. Whether you’re focused on utility, security, automation, or performance, these projects offer a valuable early-stage entry point. As listings get closer, these names are gaining serious attention. They are the top presale crypto choices to watch closely in 2025.

Here’s Why UNSD Is The Next Big Crypto Opportunity",https://thecoinrise.com/litecoin-rallies-pepe-breaks-key-levels-and-unstaked-nears-10m-in-presale-heres-why-unsd-is-the-next-big-crypto-opportunity/,"Meme coins and well-known tokens like Litecoin (LTC) are grabbing attention again, with Litecoin’s recent rally and Pepe (PEPE) showing bullish potential. But while these familiar faces dominate the headlines, there’s a rising star quietly making waves: Unstaked. With nearly $10 million raised in presale, Unstaked is far more than a trend, it’s a project driven by automation, AI, and real blockchain utility. While Litecoin benefits from an ETF delay and Pepe rides the wave of Ethereum’s rally, Unstaked is building a solid foundation for long-term success with active development and community rewards. With a potential 28x ROI before its public launch, the real question is whether Unstaked is already the smartest “crypto to invest in” for sustainable, utility-focused returns. Litecoin Defies Expectations with Impressive Rally Even with the SEC delaying its ETF approval, Litecoin (LTC) has shown surprising strength. The coin jumped over 12% in a single day, breaking through the $90 mark, and saw its trading volume surge by nearly 69%, reaching over $900 million. This rally is even more impressive considering the ETF decision was pushed back, something that usually cools market enthusiasm. What’s driving this momentum? Litecoin’s deep connection to Bitcoin. Both cryptocurrencies share a proof-of-work model and similar monetary structures, but Litecoin’s use of the Scrypt algorithm means faster transaction times and wider accessibility. Now, traders are keeping a close eye on Litecoin’s next big move. The $96 resistance level is key, with some speculating a rise to $105 or even $120 if it breaks through. Whale activity is picking up, as large holders begin to consolidate their positions. All of this reinforces Litecoin’s place as a reliable, long-term investment, especially for risk-conscious portfolios. Is Pepe Set for a Major Breakout? The Pepe (PEPE) price outlook has turned bullish, with the coin breaking out of a multi-week symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling a shift in momentum. Trading at around $0.000014, PEPE has successfully cleared a critical upper trendline and held firm at the 50-level RSI support, signaling strength. Key indicators like Momentum (10) and MACD (12, 26) are now flashing buy signals, suggesting that a larger upward movement could be on the horizon. That said, resistance at $0.00001477 and $0.0000178 is still in play, and traders are keeping an eye on those levels. With daily gains of 10-20% still in the cards, PEPE could see significant volatility. Some analysts are more optimistic: Solberg Invest anticipates a move toward $0.000025, while trader Kaleo sees PEPE potentially reaching a market cap between $10B and $20B in the long run. As ETH and BTC rally, meme coins like PEPE are often magnets for speculative capital, but questions about their long-term value still linger. Unstaked: Building a Real Web3 Ecosystem with AI Unlike the constant buzz around popular meme coins and long-established tokens, Unstaked is taking a more focused and strategic approach. Currently in Stage 15 of its presale with nearly $10 million raised, this project is carving out a unique space in the Web3 world, driven by AI agents and a Proof of Intelligence governance model. Unstaked stands out by allowing users to earn not just by holding assets, but by deploying autonomous AI agents that work across platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. These agents are already in testing, with plans to expand to Instagram later this year. And it doesn’t stop there; later this year, the Agent Customization Marketplace will be launched, allowing users to create, buy, and sell AI routines based on actual performance. Financially, Unstaked continues to impress. With a public launch price set at $0.1819 and early presale prices starting at just $0.009831, investors are eyeing significant returns, up to 28x if goals are met. On top of that, the project is promising substantial liquidity post-launch, offering stability rare in today’s presale market. To fuel even more excitement, Unstaked has launched a $1 million giveaway, offering $50,000 in tokens to 20 lucky winners. Entry requires social engagement and a $100 purchase, blending gamification with genuine buyer commitment. In a sea of projects that fail to deliver, Unstaked’s active ecosystem and clear financial strategy are making it one to watch in 2025. Looking Ahead While the latest Litecoin (LTC) market trends and the renewed buzz around Pepe (PEPE) show that crypto enthusiasm is still alive, these coins rely largely on momentum, market conditions, and their past reputation. Unstaked, however, is carving out its space by focusing on real infrastructure, automation, and community-driven growth rather than speculation. With presale commitments nearing $10 million, Unstaked is proving that utility, smart incentives, and long-term vision can rival, and even outpace, legacy and meme coins. In a market full of quick flips and unfulfilled promises, Unstaked stands out as a strong choice for anyone looking for a crypto investment with genuine real-world use, solid financial structure, and early-stage opportunities in the AI-powered Web3 landscape.

That marks a 32% drop from May’s haul of $4.9 billion. According to crypto vesting tracker Tokenomist, investors and traders will face new supply pressure again this month. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says Total Token Unlocks Dip In June June’s release of $3.3 billion is down sharply from May’s nearly $5 billion. A lot of that change comes from projects finishing earlier vesting schedules. But $3.3 billion is still a heavy weight on token prices. Markets usually wobble when billions of dollars suddenly become tradable. Cliffs Versus Gradual Releases About $1.4 billion of June’s tokens will hit wallets all at once in what’s called a cliff unlock. That means a lump sum becomes liquid on a set date. The rest— nearly $2 billion—will drip into the market bit by bit with linear unlocks. A slow trickle of new supply can soften the blow, but it still adds up over time. Source: Tokenomist Big Names On The List Several major projects lead the pack in June. Metars Genesis (MRS) will drop over $190 million worth of tokens on June 21 to back an AI partnership. Since March, MRS has unlocked 10 million tokens each month, pushing nearly $1 billion into circulation so far. On June 1, SUI will unlock 44 million coins—about $160 million in value. Over $70 million of that goes to Series B investors. To date, SUI has released more than 3 billion tokens valued at roughly $12 billion, or about 33% of its total supply. Another 5.22 billion tokens, worth nearly $20 billion, are still locked without a set date. Other Projects To Watch A handful of well-known tokens also have vesting dates in June. Fasttoken will hand out 20 million tokens—around $88 million—to its founders. LayerZero plans to unlock 25 million tokens worth over $70 million for core contributors and strategic partners. Aptos will release 11.30 million tokens, about $60 million, to its team, backers and community fund. ZKsync sets free over 760 million tokens valued at almost $50 million to investors and staff. Even Arbitrum joins the list, adding to the pressure on Layer-2 markets. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets What This Means For Traders Based on reports, big unlocks tend to spark price swings. Cliff events often trigger fast sell-offs as holders gain full access. Gradual releases can drag on prices over weeks. Those who trade around these dates should be ready for volatility. For long-term holders, dips caused by fresh supply might offer a chance to add to positions. Either way, tracking vesting calendars could help time moves and spare traders from nasty surprises.

According to a May 27 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Bitlayer’s BitVM implementation will be supported by major Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining pools including Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. Antpool CEO Andy Chow said: ""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.” BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups. Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backbone A BitVM implementation Bitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners: “This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“ Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer. BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function. Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVM Mining pool support According to Hashrate Index data , Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of 31.5%. Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate Index This is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications. With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development. A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.

The sector urges the government to reconsider its current taxation policies , which stakeholders have deemed burdensome. Despite a more favorable governmental outlook and increasing international momentum, particularly influenced by Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance after his return to the US presidency, the industry continues to face significant challenges. Since 2022, the 30% capital gains tax and 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on all transactions in digital assets have created an unfriendly environment for Indian traders. A think tank Esya Centre report estimates that almost 90% of Indian crypto trading shifted to offshore platforms in the wake of these regulations. Industry leaders say the taxes stifle innovation, drive users toward unregulated markets, and erode India’s share of the burgeoning global crypto economy . The tax regime is “very harsh,” said Ashish Singhal, co-founder of CoinSwitch, one of India’s largest exchanges. He suggests a 0.1% transaction tax – one-tenth of the current rate – which he says would still let light be shone on transactions but would incentivize legitimate trading. Compounding the pressure on the sector, the government enacted new compliance regulations. Under these rules, designated persons must notify the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) of digital asset transactions, causing extra oversight without relief from the already impactful tax obligations. India increases crypto engagement as global trends shift The government’s outlook on digital assets is changing. Execs said the frequency with which crypto firms met with policymakers had spiked noticeably. Singhal said the engagement has turned from once every six months to “monthly, if not weekly.” The shift also arrives as Donald Trump, the US president, sits at the head of the table and embraces digital currencies. Indian industry leaders say the global momentum — especially in the US — is swaying policy discussions in India. In the weeks after Trump took office in January, there were reports that India’s Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth planned to redraft a pivotal discussion paper that may be the foundation for future crypto rules. Seth has not spoken publicly since, but the steps point to Indian regulators rethinking their approach to the sector. India’s crypto industry has long existed under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), once a vocal opponent of digital currencies, had prohibited banks from serving cryptocurrency firms in 2018. The Supreme Court overturned that ban in 2020. Today, RBI’s language has mellowed. Though the central bank remains concerned about the potential risks that digital assets poses to financial stability, its current governor, Sanjay Malhotra, has shunned the harsh language of his predecessors. The relationship has moved from “negative to neutral” alongside RBI, noted Singhal of CoinSwitch, a sign of potential room to work together. India lets major crypto exchanges re-enter market Some leading global crypto exchanges are re-entering India as the country’s regulations are becoming more favorable for the industry. Coinbase, the biggest US-based exchange, has registered with the FIU-IND and can now open in India. The move comes after the brief withdrawal of Coinbase in 2022 when it said it was unclear on regulatory and payment processing fronts. Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, has also made a re-entry into the Indian market after partnering with the very same financial oversight body. The registrations are a major reversal, with the regulators now emphasizing compliance and oversight rather than outright bans. Tom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s head of international policy, said Trump’s comeback has inspired confidence in the global crypto sector. He added that the Indian government now understands they cannot ban crypto anymore. According to Grant Thornton, India’s crypto market will increase from $2.5 billion in 2024 to over $15 billion in 2035. “Competition has definitely started heating up,” said Kush Wadhwa, partner at Grant Thornton’s Indian arm. “India doesn’t have any option but to adopt it, but the problem for them is money laundering and tax evasion — they’re not saying ‘don’t do it’, but they want a control on it.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-27 01:48:37

At the moment, Bitcoin is holding up better than most altcoins — and that includes XRP. With Bitcoin dominance staying strong, many altcoins like XRP are struggling to keep up. As Bitcoin moves sideways or pulls back, it puts pressure on altcoins, causing short-term drops. Right now, XRP is in a cooling-off phase and experiencing a slight pullback. At the moment, XRP’s price is stuck between a support level around $2.30 and resistance at around $2.34 to $2.35. If the price manages to break above $2.35 with a strong daily candle close, it could move toward the next resistance zone between $2.43 and $2.44. Beyond that, there’s a major resistance waiting between $2.55 and $2.62. On the flip side, if XRP fails to hold above $2.30, the next important support level to watch is in the $2.10 to $2.15 range. A Bullish Signal Forming? Interestingly, on the 6-hour chart, there’s a possible bullish divergence forming. While the price has been making lower lows, the RSI is showing slightly higher lows. This is often an early signal that a price bounce could be on the way. However, it’s not confirmed yet. Traders would need to see the price hold steady and start trending upward alongside a rising RSI to take it seriously. For now, Bitcoin’s short-term cool-off is weighing on XRP’s momentum. Even if this bullish divergence plays out, it might not lead to a significant move unless Bitcoin stabilizes or starts climbing again. The good news is, a deeper pullback isn’t necessarily bad news for XRP. What Needs to Happen Next If the price drops to around $2.00 and finds solid support there, it could set up for a major bullish pattern on the daily chart — an inverse head and shoulders. This pattern is typically a sign of a coming reversal to the upside. But to confirm it, XRP would need to pull back to the $2.00 area, bounce back toward the $2.60 zone, and then break above $2.62 with strong daily candle closes. Until then, it remains a possible but unconfirmed setup.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 01:50:42

The second man is a Swiss crypto investor who allegedly assisted business partner Joel Woeltz, who is accused of kidnapping Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan and torturing him in a Soho apartment in an attempt to pressure him into revealing his crypto wallet phrase, ABC7 New York reported on May 26. A separate NBC report said the Swiss trader — who is not named — would turn himself over to police within a week. However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources. The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm. Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days. Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her. The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.” CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit. Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer. Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody. He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28. Alleged victim shares ordeal Teofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.” Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase. NBC New York reported that Teofrasto Carturan has an estimated net worth of around $30 million. Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summit Police said Teofrasto Carturan was tied up with electrical cords and electrocuted. His feet were also tased while submerged in water and the alleged perpetrators held an electric chainsaw to his leg, threatening to cut off his limbs. Police claimed they found a Polaroid of the alleged perpetrators torturing Teofrasto Carturan, one showing him bound to a chair with a gun to his head. Teofrasto Carturan was also allegedly forced to smoke crack cocaine and was urinated on in the Soho apartment, described by NBC New York reporters as a “high-end frat house” with stripper poles and expensive liquor scattered throughout the five-story building. Carturan spent some time being treated at a hospital after escaping, the New York Post said.

Beginning Tuesday the 27th, the world’s largest cryptocurrency will be at the centre of its own ecosystem, Wall Street’s macro diary and one of the most closely watched bankruptcy wind-downs in digital-asset history. Bitcoin Week Of Fire The epicentre is Bitcoin 2025, the annual industry gathering that this year takes over The Venetian in Las Vegas from 27–29 May. Organisers expect more than 30 000 attendees and have added a new “Code + Country” policy track to underline Bitcoin’s emergence as a political wedge issue. “This is more than a headline moment — it’s a signal,” BTC Inc. chief executive David Bailey said when announcing the keynote roster. “Bitcoin is the most exciting financial innovation in the world. It’s at the forefront of the national conversation.” Related Reading: $200,000 Bitcoin ‘Is Real’ By Year-End, Says Top Researcher For the first time a sitting US vice-president will speak at a crypto conference: JD Vance is due on the main stage Wednesday morning, 28 May. His team has trailed a defence of “innovation, financial sovereignty and a more resilient American future,” and public filings show personal Bitcoin holdings worth up to half a million dollars. Moreover, “Crypto Czar” David Sacks, Bo Hines, Executive Director of President Donald Trump’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets and US Senator Cynthia Lummis will speak on Tuesday. The political guest list does not end there. From abroad, Brexit campaigner – and now Reform UK leader – Nigel Farage has confirmed a fireside interview, arguing that national sovereignty and “free speech” run parallel to Bitcoin’s ethos. “We are pleased to announce that Nigel Farage will join the speaker lineup at the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas,” organisers wrote in a statement last week, framing his return as a natural sequel to his 2023 appearance in Amsterdam. Also slated are Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., underlining how thoroughly the Republican establishment has embraced the event. While cameras focus on the Venetian halls, traders will be wiring what the FTX Recovery Trust calls “over $5 billion” to thousands of former customers of the failed exchange. The second distribution round, beginning Thursday 30 May, will see creditors recover between 54 % and 120 % of their dollar-denominated claims, with BitGo and Kraken acting as agents. Because many claimants sold other crypto holdings to cover losses in 2022, analysts will watch whether a fresh injection of spendable dollars feeds directly back into the market.

On Wednesday afternoon the Federal Reserve releases the minutes of its 6–7 May policy meeting. The Fed’s signaled that, because of persistent inflation risks, a rate cut is off the table for now, even as policymakers express concern over the economic fallout tariffs could trigger. Twenty-four hours later comes the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ second estimate of first-quarter GDP; the advance print showed a 0.3 % annualised contraction, a surprise that rattled rate-cut odds in early May. Finally, Friday brings the April Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, with publication set for 30 May at 08:30 EDT. March’s core PCE was flat month-on-month and 2.6 % year-on-year; economists now infer a 0.2 % MoM rebound for April, keeping the YoY pace at 2.6 %. The estimate comes from translating the latest CPI release into PCE weights. Headline PCE inflation has already slowed to 2.3 % YoY in March, its lowest in four years.

So the question now is, which ones count as the best performing crypto coins in 2025? People are no longer just chasing hype. The interest is now in strong setups that can show real results. This article highlights four standout options gaining attention: BlockDAG, Ethereum, Official Trump Coin, and Arbitrum. Each brings something different, from fixed presale prices and competitive buying events to network scalability and cultural impact, positioning them as top names in 2025. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Building Buzz with Buyer Battles and a $269M Presale Among the best performing crypto coins to watch closely, BlockDAG has made a mark with its huge presale success and exciting Buyer Battles feature. This gamified concept pits wallet addresses against each other daily, offering large rewards to the most active buyers. Every day, 150 million BDAG coins are set aside in a reward pool. The buyer who accumulates the highest BDAG during the day gets the remaining unclaimed coins from the pool, free of charge. This keeps the buying energy alive and highly competitive. So far, the project has raised $269 million and sold 21.3 billion BDAG coins. The current price remains at $0.0020 until June 13, giving a potential return of 2,520% when it hits exchanges. But it’s more than numbers, BlockDAG also delivers value through its no-code dApp builder, CertiK verification, and detailed roadmap for wide-scale adoption. BlockDAG (BDAG) also maintains strong momentum with daily social updates, regular podcast announcements, and influencer support. For those tracking the best performing crypto coins, BDAG is gaining attention due to both its progress and strategy. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Holding Ground in the Smart Contract Space Ethereum continues to rank high among the best performing crypto coins, thanks to its strong presence in DeFi, NFT markets, and dApp development. The shift to proof-of-stake has improved both energy use and scalability. Ethereum’s Layer 2 network, including names like Arbitrum and Optimism, remains active. Plus, new staking methods like restaking and liquid staking provide ETH holders with new ways to earn without restrictions. Despite market swings, Ethereum’s developer strength and network use keep it firmly among the best performing crypto coins for 2025 and beyond. 3. Official Trump Coin (DJT): A Meme Coin Riding Political Waves DJT, the Official Trump Coin, has gained traction in the meme coin sector. Once seen as a novelty, it’s now pulling in volume as political debates heat up. Its direct link to Donald Trump remains unclear, but that hasn’t slowed down the buzz. DJT is active on Solana DEXs and heavily mentioned on social media. It’s benefiting from the mix of politics and memes, a space growing fast in crypto. Though it carries high risk, the ongoing talk around DJT secures its place among the best performing crypto coins of this year. 4. Arbitrum (ARB): Showing Strength with Layer 2 Solutions Arbitrum is becoming one of Ethereum’s leading Layer 2 scaling platforms. Its Optimistic Rollups offer quicker transactions with lower gas fees, and the network already supports projects like GMX, Camelot, and Radiant Capital. ARB’s price has recovered in 2025, helped by active development and new incentives. Arbitrum Orbit, which helps developers create secure custom chains, has also boosted attention. With growing user numbers and increasing total value locked, Arbitrum is seen as one of the best performing crypto coins showing solid long-term development. Why These Coins Stand Out in 2025 As crypto moves forward, the best performing crypto coins will be those offering useful features, strong community action, and consistent updates. BlockDAG stands out due to its daily Buyer Battles, fair pricing, and strong roadmap. Ethereum continues leading in smart contracts. DJT brings in cultural energy, and Arbitrum proves its value as a scalable tool for developers. Each of these coins brings something different, whether it’s easier access, better performance, or active community appeal. Watching these best performing crypto coins in 2025 could be a smart step for those following key developments.

The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin ( BTC ) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26. Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko. However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin ; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.” Source: Alexandre Laizet Venture capital firm Fulgur Ventures invested the lion’s share for the bond sale, with 55.3 million euros ($62.9 million), while crypto private investment fund Moonlight Capital invested 5 million euros ($5.7 million). The bonds will be convertible into shares of the Blockchain Group at 3.809 euros ($4.34). The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) is listed on Euronext Paris, Europe’s second-largest stock exchange by market cap. The company’s website says it is focused on “increasing the number of Bitcoin per share over time by leveraging the holding company’s excess cash and appropriate financing instruments.” ALTBG closed May 26 trading down nearly 5.5% at 2.77 euros ($3.16), but has gained nearly 766% so far this year, according to Google Finance. After the company started buying Bitcoin on Nov. 5, the stock spiked 225% to 0.48 euros ($0.52). The Blockchain Group’s stock price has made significant gains since the company announced its Bitcoin buying plan. Source: Google Finance In its 2024 financial year results, released April 30, the Blockchain Group listed the current yield from its Bitcoin holdings at over 709%. Meanwhile, its total consolidated revenue for the year was 13,864,000 euros ($15.8 million) compared to 20,408,000 euros ($23.2 million) for the previous fiscal year, representing a decrease of 32.1%. As part of its results, the company said its long-term strategy is to acquire 1% of the total Bitcoin supply over the next eight years, with a target of over 170 by 2032. More companies take the “orange pill” A growing number of public companies are buying Bitcoin to hold for the long term in the hopes of making gains from the asset.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Uniswap's UNI token surged from $6.00 to $6.65 over the past 24 hours, pushing the token up 5%, while the broader market gauge CoinDesk20 Index fell 1.8% in the last 24 hours. This momentum coincides with Uniswap recording its highest monthly transaction volume since February, processing over $73 billion in trades and generating more than $380 million in revenue this year, as institutional interest grows and a notable whale re-entered the market by acquiring nearly $4 million worth of UNI. SCB10X’s New CEO Sees US-Asia Crypto Dealflow, AI Opportunities Kaweewut Temphuwapat, the new CEO of SCB10X, the venture arm of Thailand's SCB bank, sees significant opportunities emerging at the intersection of AI, crypto, and Web3. ""We definitely [are] going more on AI and also crypto and AI plus crypto,"" Temphuwapat told CoinDesk, highlighting these hybrid investments as firmly ""under our radar."" He predicts clearer crypto regulation in the U.S. will fuel increased deal flow into resilient Asian markets, noting SCB10X's early success investing in Ripple: ""We are an early investor in Ripple of 10 years ago… we've used that technology for the last five to six years in our SCB App."" Temphuwapat praised Thailand’s proactive and innovative regulators, highlighting the country's robust payments infrastructure. He expects Thai banks, including SCB, could soon directly hold crypto tokens on their balance sheets, initially through regulatory sandboxes: ""The intention is there... they allow us to do [it] in a small scale."" Trader James Wynn Shifts From Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bets to Memecoins, Goes Long Pepe Pseudonymous trader ""James Wynn,"" known for high-stakes crypto bets on decentralized platform Hyperliquid, has shifted focus from billion-dollar bitcoin positions to memecoins, recently placing a leveraged $1 million bet on Pepe (PEPE), CoinDesk reported earlier. Previously, Wynn closed a massive $1.2 billion bitcoin long position at a $17.5 million loss, before pivoting to a $1 billion short position at 40x leverage, effectively wagering their entire $50 million wallet balance on bitcoin’s downside. That short briefly netted Wynn about $3 million in profit before closing, marking one of the largest trades ever executed fully on-chain. Wynn announced stepping back from perpetual trading after securing a cumulative profit of $25 million, earned from an initial investment of just over $3 million. The trader’s latest high-leverage PEPE position has already gained $500,000 amid a nearly 6% rise in the memecoin's value. Strategy Buys Another 4,020 Bitcoin for $427M, Total Holdings Surpass 580K BTC Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, purchased an additional 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for roughly $427 million, bringing its total holdings to 580,250 BTC, CoinDesk previously reported . The acquisition was funded through three separate at-the-market equity programs, including sales of common and preferred stock totaling approximately $427 million. These latest bitcoin purchases were executed at an average price of $106,237 per coin, pushing Strategy’s total investment in bitcoin to over $40.6 billion, at an average cost basis of $69,979 per coin. The acquisitions reflect the company’s ongoing commitment to expanding its sizable bitcoin holdings through regular capital raises and share issuances. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin holds steady near record levels around $109,000, consolidating gains despite tariff-induced volatility, as long-term investors continue accumulating amid macroeconomic uncertainty. ETH: Ethereum maintains resilience above $2,500 amid volatility and cautious whale behavior, supported by continued institutional inflows into spot ETH ETFs. Gold: Gold dips slightly on tariff delay but stays above $3,310 as deficit concerns fuel bullish outlook. Hang Seng: Hong Kong's Hang Seng opened lower, trading above 23,304, led by tech losses, including Meituan's 4.9% decline. Nikkei: Japan's Nikkei 225 dipped 0.13% Tuesday morning as markets assessed Trump's tariff delay. S&P 500: Closed for Memorial Day. Elsewhere in Crypto...

To be clear, no one’s promising moon boots here. But according to analyst Cheeky Crypto, the risk-versus-reward setup for XRP today looks a lot like Bitcoin’s awkward teenage years, back when the loudest voices called it a scam while quiet hodlers quietly became millionaires. What’s Been Holding XRP Back? XRP has been around since 2012. While it made solid gains early on, its price has been weighed down by a long legal fight between Ripple (the company behind XRP) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That lawsuit kept many big exchanges from listing XRP and made investors nervous. But now, that legal battle seems to be nearing an end. Settlement talks and court updates are happening regularly. Many believe that once the case is over, XRP could finally get the momentum it’s been missing. The Numbers Get Wild — Even with Small Gains Let’s talk numbers. Even if XRP only manages to follow a small portion of Bitcoin’s past performance, the gains are huge. If XRP matched 10% of Bitcoin’s historic growth, its price could jump to over $5,300. If it matched just 1%, that’s still a jump to $53 — far above today’s price of around $2.33. And that’s without including other possible boosts, like Ripple burning excess tokens, launching new global payment partnerships, or adding more banks to its network. What About the Huge Token Supply? One concern people often raise is XRP’s large total supply — 100 billion tokens, compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. But what really matters is market cap — the total value of all coins combined. If Ripple manages to handle even a small portion of the $150 trillion in global cross-border payments each year, it could easily justify higher prices without breaking financial logic. Yes, there are risks. The SEC could drag out appeals, other regulators might get involved, or Ripple might stumble in integrating new partnerships. Those aren’t imaginary threats — they’re very real. But risk is why rewards exist. If XRP had zero uncertainties, it wouldn’t be sitting at $2. So, is XRP the next Bitcoin? Maybe not. But could it surprise everyone once the legal dust settles?

He spoke during the Charleston Festival in East Sussex. He argued that AI is already capable of creating its art. During a recent interview with The Times of London, Clegg, the former UK Deputy Prime Minister, engaged in a heated debate over AI copyright laws. He commented when parliament members voted against proposals allowing copyright holders to see when their work had been used to train AI systems and by whom. Creatives urge the government to balance copyright laws Music legends like Sir Elton John and Sir Paul McCartney have urged the UK government not to change copyright laws to favor big tech firms. The creatives warned that the proposal to change copyright protection laws risks destroying the livelihoods of more than 2.5 million people who work in the creative industry. “The safest road to Hell is the gradual one… the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.” C. S. Lewis didn’t account for Lib Dem sherpas sadly… Clegg (yes him) saying Artists demands over copyright are unworkable in AI age — Andrew Walker (@Andrew_E_Walker) May 26, 2025 Clegg argued that the demands of artists and prominent creative figures to require tech firms to seek permission before using copyrighted materials to train AI models are unworkable and implausible. He continued to point out that AI systems have already used a significant portion of the data readily available online, The former UK Deputy Prime Minister suggested that people should have a straightforward way to opt out of using their content. He viewed the idea of AI companies having to seek permission as something that collides with the physics of the technology itself. He added that the idea would kill the UK’s AI industry overnight if applied in the UK alone. Describing copyright as the lifeblood of their profession, the UK creative community wrote an open letter to Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the UK, warning that the proposed changes to copyright laws would threaten Britain’s status as the leading creative power. The open letter said that the UK creative community would lose immense growth opportunities if it gave away its work to a small group of powerful tech companies. The letter reiterated the UK’s position as a creative powerhouse and the hopes that technology will embody the country’s values. Dua Lipa among artists urging Starmer to rethink AI copyright laws David Furnish, Coldplay, Tom Dixon, and John Pawson, among hundreds of others, represented the UK creative community as signatories to the open letter. The letter urged Starmer to support Baroness Beeban Kidron’s amendment to the Data Bill . The Data Bill would give the UK creative transparency over the copyright works used to train AI models. According to the letter, transparency would allow creators and creative businesses to hold AI firms accountable for stealing creative works. The letter urged the government to accept the amendment and allow AI developers and creators to develop licensing regimes enabling human-created content. Elsewhere in the U.S., Hollywood recently wrote a letter to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, in which more than 400 creatives, including director Guillermo del Toro and actor Cynthia Erivo, signed to urge the U.S. government to uphold existing copyright protections against AI. Many prominent creative figures in Hollywood signed the letter in response to Trump’s administration’s request for public comments on the White House’s AI Action Plan. The plan aimed to secure and advance the country’s position in the AI industry. Silicon Valley tech companies and OpenAI wrote separate letters arguing that they should be able to train AI models using publicly available content under the fair use doctrine. The doctrine allows for the limited reproduction of material without permission from the copyright holder. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In a post addressed to his followers, Brandt asked which of the two they would select for a $100,000 investment, provided they could only choose one. He encouraged responses with concise reasoning limited to 40 words and shared technical charts of both assets to aid informed decision-making. Let's say I will buy $100,000 of either $XRP or $SOL this week — no other option but ONLY one of the two please Which one? State your case 40 words max or I'll ignore Remember, XRP or SOL – only choices pic.twitter.com/cNikoRICfd — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) May 25, 2025 Technical Overview: XRP Approaches Critical Retest On the XRP front, a symmetrical triangle pattern spanning several years has recently broken to the upside. This breakout surpassed a long-standing descending resistance line, with XRP reaching a high of $3.40 earlier in the year before entering a corrective phase. The asset is now undergoing a retest of the breakout level, a process that, if successful, could set the stage for further upward movement. Based on the triangle’s height, technical projections estimate a potential rise to $4.43. Currently, the token is priced at $2.32, reflecting a 12.88% increase year-to-date. It trades just below its 8-period simple moving average (SMA) at $2.36 and slightly above its 18-period weighted moving average (WMA) at $2.29. These indicators suggest short-term support and alignment in price momentum. However, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is currently at 14.17, implying that the prevailing trend lacks strong momentum. The Average True Range (ATR) stands at 0.2588, indicating low volatility, which often signals consolidation ahead of a significant move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Solana Eyes Breakout from Classic Formation In contrast, Solana exhibits a long-term cup and handle formation on the weekly chart. The cup formed following the asset’s peak in late 2021, with the bottom established during the 2022 downturn. The handle began taking shape in early 2025 and shows signs of a potential breakout. SOL is trading at $174.84, down 6.31% since the beginning of the year. Although it lags behind XRP in 2024 performance, its technical structure remains promising. SOL trades above its 8-period SMA ($147.85) and its 18-period WMA ($150.89). The projected target from the cup and handle pattern is around $518.73, though confirmation is still required. Solana’s ADX is at 15.91, slightly higher than XRP’s, indicating a marginally stronger trend. Meanwhile, the ATR is at 37.23, showing greater volatility and trading activity. Market Participants Share Preferences Investors and analysts responded to Brandt’s question with differing perspectives. Trader CJ opted for XRP, citing reduced selling pressure from institutions compared to Solana. Another contributor, IL Gallon , also chose XRP, referencing Wyckoff accumulation signals as a sign of stronger long-term positioning. Peter Detwiller, reviewing daily charts, favoured XRP as well. He found Solana’s pattern less convincing, describing it as overly speculative. Conversely, analyst Chris Huber leaned toward Solana , highlighting its consistent respect for the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) since an April downturn. He also pointed to resistance near $261.43 as a potential breakout level. Additional views included support for XRP from Trader Vievie, who noted the asset’s formation of higher highs and manageable downside risk with a support level near $2.27. On the other hand, Trader Studios Stoic found Solana’s technical setup more compelling, viewing the cup and handle structure as indicative of stronger breakout potential compared to XRP’s shorter consolidation phase. XRP and Solana exhibit bullish technical structures, though they differ in maturity and context. XRP is retesting a significant breakout, while Solana is nearing confirmation of a long-term bullish pattern. Investor sentiment remains divided, with arguments on both sides grounded in technical indicators and broader market dynamics. Ultimately, the decision between the two depends on an individual’s risk tolerance and interpretation of technical signals.

After years at the center of regulatory debate, XRP is now entering a new era — with BlackRock reportedly exploring XRP-linked products and institutional interest growing fast. For large capital allocators, XRP’s non-security designation in the U.S. and its availability through regulated ETFs solve two of the biggest barriers to entry. Pension funds, family offices, and traditional asset managers can now gain exposure to XRP in a compliant, familiar format. BlackRock’s involvement amplifies the signal. As the world’s largest asset manager, its movements influence a wide range of financial institutions. Interest in XRP-based instruments suggests growing recognition of XRP’s use case in cross-border payments and tokenized settlement. XRP Forecasts Expand as Institutional Demand Grows Analysts are already revising long-term XRP forecasts. Over the next five years, many predict price potential ranging from $5 to $12.50, particularly if a spot ETF approval follows. The futures product is widely seen as the beginning of a larger, multi-year growth wave. This ETF approval is also reshaping sentiment across the altcoin space. With XRP now positioned as a trusted, institution-ready asset, attention is turning toward early-stage opportunities that could benefit from the next wave of capital rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction as a Scalable Newcomer One of those is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising project with a structured token model, growing investor demand, and clear fundamentals. With a $0.007 listing target, 100 billion fixed supply, and upcoming staking utility, analysts are now calling it one of the top early-stage plays of 2025. Wallet activity continues to rise, and repeat buyer behavior suggests high conviction among early participants. Combined with its under-$0.01 access, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched closely by those seeking scalable entry positions ahead of broader exposure. As capital flows into regulated leaders, traders are also seeking high-upside alternatives that offer both early access and real token utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE, still in its growth phase, is increasingly viewed as a project with the structure and momentum to benefit from the same adoption cycle XRP is helping to lead. The next chapter in crypto will be defined by both institutional scale and early innovation — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is now part of that conversation. Final Thoughts: The XRP ETF launch is a milestone for crypto. And while top players like XRP lead the charge, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are building early — offering the potential to grow alongside the next phase of adoption.

With the market gearing up for its next cycle, early positioning can make the difference between average returns and exponential gains. That’s why this list of the top crypto to buy right now starts with Web3 ai, a project designed to support both retail traders and institutional investors. Unlike one-size-fits-all platforms, Web3 ai offers a modular ecosystem tailored to different user levels. Retail traders benefit from real-time market alerts, AI-driven trading signals, and portfolio insights, while institutional teams can plug into APIs for algorithmic strategy, on-chain risk analysis, and advanced performance metrics. The project is currently in presale stage 6, selling at just $0.000383 per token. With over $4.5 million raised and a post-presale launch price set at $0.005242, early participants are staring down a projected 1747% ROI. Web3 ai isn’t just targeting a niche audience, it’s bridging the needs of everyday users and quant teams alike, making it the top crypto to buy right now for those who want both versatility and early advantage. Its tools don’t just react to market conditions they help shape smarter trading decisions across experience levels. Ethereum (ETH): Holding Strong Through Smart Contract Dominance Ethereum remains one of the most established names in the space, and for good reason. As the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts, ETH continues to power some of the largest ecosystems in blockchain. Its shift to proof-of-stake has improved scalability and reduced energy costs, making the network more efficient. Institutions and developers continue to rely on Ethereum’s infrastructure, with Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism expanding its capability even further. For long-term holders and new entrants alike, Ethereum still qualifies as a top crypto to buy right now, offering both stability and deep integration across the industry. SUI: Scalable Speed for the Next Generation of dApps SUI is gaining traction as a high-performance Layer 1 built by former Meta engineers. Its focus on parallel execution and low latency makes it ideal for decentralized applications that require speed and responsiveness, such as gaming and finance. Developers are drawn to its easy-to-use architecture and high throughput, which supports real-time interactions without congestion. As the dApp space continues to evolve, SUI positions itself as a practical solution for teams looking for more efficient infrastructure. With its growing ecosystem and technical advantages, SUI is firmly placed among the top crypto to buy right now for those seeking scalable alternatives to older chains. XRP: Gaining Ground Through Utility and Clarity XRP is quietly regaining investor attention, supported by regulatory clarity and real-world financial use. With Ripple pushing adoption in cross-border settlements, XRP’s appeal lies in its ability to move value quickly and cheaply across jurisdictions. As more institutions explore blockchain-backed payment systems, XRP’s efficiency makes it a top candidate for integration. Recent legal clarity around its status has also sparked a return of investor confidence. With its utility-driven use case and expanding global reach, XRP ranks high on the list of the top crypto to buy right now, especially for those seeking exposure to finance-backed blockchain applications. Final Thoughts: The Right Entry Can Make All the Difference Buying into a project before the broader market recognizes its value is often where the highest returns are made. Web3 ai offers that edge right now, combining real-time analytics, risk management, and advanced trading tools for both retail and institutional users. Still in presale stage 6 at $0.000383, with a projected launch price of $0.005242, it gives early investors a potential 1747% return. That kind of upside, paired with practical utility, makes it a standout. At the same time, Ethereum, SUI, and XRP each present strong use cases, from smart contract dominance to scalable infrastructure and financial integration, earning their place as the top crypto to buy right now.

BlockDAG, Litecoin, Cardano, and Dogecoin Are Gaining Speed Fast",https://thecoinrise.com/best-altcoin-to-buy-now-blockdag-litecoin-cardano-and-dogecoin-are-gaining-speed-fast/,"As May 2025 wraps up, energy is picking up across the crypto market. Bitcoin and Ethereum are holding steady, but altcoins are showing new signs of strength. This shift is opening up chances for those watching closely and ready to act before the crowd moves in. Here, we break down the best altcoins to buy now. BlockDAG, Litecoin, Cardano, and Dogecoin are all building momentum. Whether it’s speed, staying power, or strong support behind them, these four are standing out as key names to follow closely into the next wave. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Moving Fast With Real Progress and Big Numbers BlockDAG is climbing the charts quickly, gaining attention with results that can already be seen. Instead of hype alone, it runs a setup that lets blocks process at the same time, aiming to make things faster and more scalable right from the start. So far, the response has been huge. BlockDAG (BDAG) has pulled in $269 million, with more than 21.3 billion coins sold. The price has gone from $0.001 to $0.0262, but for a short time, it’s available for just $0.002 until June 13. After that, the next phase kicks in with a Go Live reveal that includes confirmed exchange details. With a mining app, custom hardware, and over 170,000 holders, BlockDAG is picking up speed. It’s now being looked at as the best altcoin to buy now for those aiming to lock in early on something with real growth ahead. 2. Litecoin: Slow and Steady with Real Potential to Move Litecoin (LTC) still holds a reputation for being one of the more stable cryptos. With a current price near $95.30, it offers an entry point that appeals to those seeking reliability over hype. Even after a 4% pullback, LTC is back in focus, thanks to upcoming drivers like the possible Litecoin ETF via Grayscale and the effects of the MimbleWimble privacy upgrade. Support is holding strong near $95, and Litecoin is starting to gain traction again. It might not be the loudest name out there, but it continues to fit into many cautious strategies. For anyone looking for something battle-tested, Litecoin still earns its spot as one of the best altcoins to buy now with long-term strength. 3. Cardano: Quiet Build, Big Plans, and a Breakout Coming? Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground with a price around $0.7280. If it clears the $0.83 mark, many are eyeing a move toward $1.30. Its rise is getting more attention thanks to new connections like its integration with Brave Browser and its role in the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. Cardano’s appeal isn’t just about price movement. Its focus on regular upgrades and eco-conscious goals adds to its long-term appeal. For anyone watching smart contract growth, Cardano is one of the best altcoins to buy now for a solid, steady build. 4. Dogecoin: Back on the Radar as Traders Watch the Charts Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a meme, but it’s now turning into a serious option. While it dipped 6% to $0.2186, charts suggest something bigger could be on the way. Open interest is climbing, now above $3 billion, and a push through the $0.25–$0.26 zone could spark a run toward $0.30. DOGE continues to draw interest for its strong liquidity and smoother price action compared to other meme-based names. As altcoin activity ramps up, Dogecoin is stepping up as one of the best altcoins to buy now for those chasing short bursts of momentum. Which of These Best Altcoins to Buy Now Will Lead the Pack? Let’s recap. Litecoin brings proven strength, plus fresh upside with the MimbleWimble upgrade and possible ETF listing. Cardano shows long-term growth through steady updates and new integrations. Dogecoin has moved past meme status and now delivers real action for traders. Then there’s BlockDAG. While the rest hold their own, BlockDAG is doing something different. With $269 million raised and 21.3 billion coins already sold, it’s built major traction. Price is locked at $0.002 until June 13, and the Go Live reveal will confirm exchange details. Some say it could push to $1 after launch. That kind of setup doesn’t come often. For anyone scanning the market for the best altcoin to buy now, BlockDAG stands out with a serious mix of momentum and early-stage upside. The post Best Altcoin to Buy Now?

With bullish momentum building, several crypto analysts now believe that BTC may be on track to hit a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming days. Bitcoin To Surge To $112,000? Analyst Says Yes According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ibrahimcosar, Bitcoin is forming a classic bullish pattern on the hourly chart – the double bottom. The analyst described this setup as “one of the strongest reversal signals” in technical analysis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebound Signals Healthier Bull Market Without Overheating, Analyst Says Ibrahimcosar explained that this pattern signals a weakening of bearish pressure, with buyers poised to regain control of the market. The first bottom of this formation was observed on May 23 at $106,800, followed by a second low on May 25 at $106,600. For the uninitiated, the double bottom is a bullish reversal chart pattern that forms after a downtrend, characterized by two distinct lows at a similar level with a moderate peak – called neckline – in between. According to the CryptoQuant contributor, the current neckline is around $109,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is hovering just above this neckline, confirming the breakout. Importantly, the breakout was accompanied by a surge in trading volume, which analysts interpret as a sign of robust bullish momentum. If $109,000 holds as support, then price levels beyond $112,000 could be on the horizon. The analyst explained in their Quicktake post: Double bottoms are where the market says: ‘We’ve sold enough.’ When buyers defend the second bottom, it sends a message: Now it’s our turn. But remember, not every pattern plays out. Know your risk, make your decision. Fellow analyst Ali Martinez echoed this sentiment in a recent post on X, sharing the following BTC hourly chart that highlights a breakout from the recent downtrend. According to Martinez, Bitcoin is now targeting the $110,000 level and potentially higher. Good Days Ahead For BTC Following a rough first quarter in 2025, Bitcoin has shown significant recovery, surging from a local bottom of $74,508 on April 6 to nearly $110,000. This recent rally has revived bullish sentiment across the market. Related Reading: Technical Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Blow Off Top To $325,000 – The Timeline Will Shock You ​​Fueling the optimism are strong inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating renewed institutional interest. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s open interest recently hit a fresh all-time high, reinforcing expectations of continued price momentum. However, not all indicators are aligned. Bitcoin whales – large holders of BTC – have shown mixed behavior, with some accumulating while others appear to be taking profits. At press time, BTC trades at $109,998, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours.

Tron Hits 283M Transfers & Ripple Shows Breakout Signs,https://thecoinrise.com/unstakeds-1m-giveaway-could-deliver-bigger-gains-tron-hits-283m-transfers-ripple-shows-breakout-signs/,"Tron (TRX) network momentum and Ripple (XRP)’s latest breakout signs may be getting all the buzz, but Unstaked is quietly attracting strong attention from early-stage supporters. As TRX records over 283 million stablecoin transfers and XRP swings between price levels, Unstaked is moving forward with a model focused on user rewards, automated tools powered by AI, and carefully planned stages. Currently in Stage 15 of its public presale, Unstaked has already secured $7.3 million in funding. It’s drawing interest with a unique offering, a $1,000,000 Gleam giveaway where 20 participants each receive $50,000 in $UNSD. Unlike major coins, this model encourages user participation with real use cases and rewards. While the spotlight remains on rapid price changes, Unstaked is steadily becoming the most talked-about cryptocurrency presale of 2025. Tron’s Transaction Surge Highlights Strength, But Will It Last? Tron’s recent spike in user activity has brought it to the forefront. In the past month alone, its 30-day average of daily transactions jumped from 4.3 million to 8.4 million, showing a 95% increase. This spike largely comes from USDT activity running on the Tron network. As of May 21, Tron had surpassed Ethereum by processing over $75.8 billion in USDT transfers, compared to Ethereum’s $71.9 billion. This trend reflects Tron’s goal of being a fast, low-cost blockchain for daily use. The $2 billion in new USDT minted on Tron backs this up. With over 283 million transactions already logged in 2025, Tron’s role in the stablecoin space is growing. Still, activity doesn’t always translate to growth in value. TRX currently trades near $0.2716, with resistance expected around $0.28–$0.29. Despite high trading volumes and futures positions above $300 million, TRX’s price movement is still closely tied to its basic utility, not to development or user benefits. Ripple’s Price Signal Lacks Lasting Direction While Tron enjoys a steady rise in network use, Ripple’s chart remains unpredictable. On May 22, XRP moved between $2.388 and $2.423, reacting to fast shifts in MACD patterns from bullish to bearish. RSI readings also kept moving between overbought and oversold areas, making it hard for any clear trend to form. Though short-term traders may try to profit from these swings, XRP continues to hover between $2.400 support and $2.420 resistance. The repeated failures to break out or hold gains show how unstable its movement remains. Even though Ripple is flashing a breakout signal, hesitation is growing. Until major news or legal clarity arrives, XRP might stay locked in this tight range. This opens the door for projects like Unstaked that offer more direct rewards and clarity in structure. Unstaked: A Presale Driven by Real Utility and Clear Roadmap Big-name coins may showcase transaction records or pattern signals, but Unstaked is staying focused on building. At this point, it has raised $7.3 million in Stage 15 of its crypto presale , pricing $UNSD at $0.009831. With a confirmed launch price of $0.1819, this suggests early backers could gain nearly 28x. What separates Unstaked is its open and community-based design. The $1,000,000 Gleam giveaway will reward 20 people with $50,000 each in $UNSD. To qualify, users need to complete simple tasks and hold at least $100 in tokens. The campaign, planned over five months, builds engagement without relying on exaggerated hype. Unstaked’s approach avoids restricted private sales, instead offering a clear, open path with outlined phases. Key features in the roadmap include AI-backed “Proof of Intelligence,” community governance, and flexible access with no forced lock-ins. A liquidity pool of $20M, along with planned listings on both CEXs and DEXs, adds trust. Its marketplace for customizable AI agents will only launch after the presale is complete. While Ripple’s charts and Tron’s network headlines draw attention, Unstaked is gaining real traction among early participants who want clarity, rewards, and future utility. In a Nutshell! In today’s market, stories hold just as much power as stats. Tron may be leading in stablecoin transactions, and Ripple continues to offer setups for short-term traders. But neither has presented the kind of open presale model, price setup, or user-focused structure that Unstaked brings. With over $7.3 million raised, a price below one cent, and a $1,000,000 giveaway capturing community attention, Unstaked is shaping the idea of a strong early-stage crypto. Its plan for AI tools, public governance, and strong liquidity make it a project worth following. Established names may show movement, but Unstaked shows actual momentum. The numbers speak clearly, and in this volatile space, few signals are this direct.

Business Insider reported on May 26 that at the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year, Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said that “there are four essential characteristics of intelligent behavior that every animal, or relatively smart animal, can do, and certainly humans.” “Understanding the physical world, having persistent memory, being able to reason and being able to plan complex actions, particularly planning hierarchically,” LeCun said. He said current large language models ( LLMs ) that power popular AI chatbots have not hit this threshold, and “incorporating these capabilities would require a shift in how they are trained.” Some of the largest AI and tech giants are “cobbling capabilities” onto existing models in their race to dominate the AI game, LeCun said. Yann LeCun speaking on LLM intelligence. Source: Patrick Patterson/X Meta is already experimenting with a system called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which is a method of enhancing LLM outputs using external knowledge sources. In February, it released V-JEPA, a non-generative model that learns by predicting missing or masked parts of a video. Related: Meta gets EU regulator nod to train AI with social media content LeCun believes that “world-based models” would be a better approach as these would be trained on real-life scenarios and possess higher cognition than current pattern-based AI. The concept involves models that can imagine taking an action and predict the resulting world state. Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world. Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4 , received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added.

Dubai has now established itself as the global center of blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3.0 – and the heart of the MENA (Middle East, North Africa) region. This conference was full of optimism and celebration at the significant steps that blockchain, DeFi and Web 3.0 took worldwide. Here are 10 key takeaways from the TOKEN 2049 event. 1. AI-blockchain synergy Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents were instrumental in key blockchain use cases like fraud detection, analytics and smart contract optimization. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) clouds could cut AI training costs by 50%. The blockchain x AI technology will be a powerful synergy for the road ahead. AI-driven blockchain audits will prevent over $50 billion in annual DeFi hacks. Cognitive smart contracts could become a new standard in secure computing. Fifty percent of the world’s AI training has the potential to be run on GPUs on the cloud in less than five years. With the explosion of use cases, AI and blockchain have the potential to reframe the Web 3.0 world as we know it. 2. DePIN technology will change the world DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) were everywhere at the conference. Some companies provided archival systems at 90% cheaper than traditional cloud computing giants. Distributed wireless grids, file systems, IaaS (intelligence-as-a-service), digital infrastructure and IoT systems stole the limelight. The DePIN market is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. Decentralized Infrastructure provides power to the users and enables personal revenue. Smart cities could also be disaster-resistant with DePIN technology for electricity, internet, wireless systems, edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT). 3. Tokenized real-world assets are a reality Over $120 billion will be spent this year alone on tokenizing just real estate. Dubai’s VARA framework enables fractional blockchain ownership of luxury assets. This trend will only increase and cover everything from luxury cars to high-value assets like artwork. The RWA (real-world asset) tokenization market will hit the trillion-dollar market cap by as early as 2026. AI-managed investment portfolios with hold both crypto and real-world tokens. This is the long-awaited comeback of the security token in RWAs. Multiple institutions like banks, asset management firms and investment leaders are showing interest. 4. Bitcoin becomes mainstream Long seen as a speculative investment, Bitcoin is now a viable asset. With Trump’s presidency, multiple firms and institutions are investing in Bitcoin as a long-term purchase. The outlook for Bitcoin is incredibly optimistic, especially among core crypto followers. This is a key moment for cryptocurrency and Web 3.0 development. The legitimization of Bitcoin provides a solid foundation on which to build DeFi and Web 3.0 platforms. Companies are seeing past the hype and investing in Bitcoin heavily. Some analysts were even quoted predicting that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2028. 5. MENA is the powerhouse of global Web 3.0 Crypto transfers in this region exceeded $330 billion in 2025, with 93% of transactions by institutions. UAE and Qatar were the main participants in this sector. The US will be implementing more relaxed crypto regulation – but until it does, the UAE, with its innovative regulations, will be the center of crypto globally. There are discussions to open up energy reserves like crude oil to tokenization and fractional ownership. 6. Stablecoins are the first accepted use case of crypto Stablecoins have become one of the backbones of global payments. Cross-border frictionless trading and commerce is now a reality with stablecoins. The share in cross-border transfers could rise to even 50% by around 2028. Stablecoins have seen massive adoption by individuals and institutions alike. As protocols evolve for DeFi, this trend is only set to increase and become even more common. 7. Breakthroughs in DAO governance In 2025, AI-powered voting systems in DAOs automated 30% of decisions in collective environments. This is the start of a widespread change in how systems are governed autonomously. DAO is a governance method that truly gives power to the people. It is predicted that even CeFi (centralized finance) systems will be using DAOs by 2030. For asset management, DAOs potentially represent a multi-trillion-dollar market. 8. Web 3.0 gaming breaks the casual barrier Major studios launched play-to-earn models with AAA gameplay. This is only the beginning of a huge shift in gaming as a whole. Extractive economics was only the beginning. The metaverse, player-generated assets and Web 3.0 gaming will change the way everyone games. Annual revenue could exceed $200 billion by 2029. Metaverse content will be immersive, VR/AR integrated and created primarily by AI. Play-to-earn could also include socially desirable changes in multiple sectors. 9. The importance of security As blockchain, DeFi and Web 3.0 move into acceptable investments, security is now the key. $1.2 billion was lost through blockchain scams in 2024 alone. Security standards need to evolve and keep up with advances in technology. As hackers use generative AI and sidechain attacks on major institutions – i t is critical that security standards be defined, refined and enhanced at least four times each year. Quantum computing, in particular, plays a very important role as perhaps the biggest threat to cybersecurity. Emerging technologies like ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) and biometric authentication need integration into blockchain systems. 10. Regulational clarity worldwide Perhaps the single biggest reason that Dubai became the crypto capital of the world – t he transparent and lenient regulations adopted by the UAE for crypto and blockchain. The US is expected to follow suit very soon with sweeping regulatory changes. In less than five years, as countries see the advantages of these regulations – e xpect similar changes all over the world and for crypto to become the defining standard of the wealth of the nations. This would truly introduce wealth distribution worldwide. Trump is soon expected to introduce regulatory changes in the US for crypto as well. The road ahead TOKEN2049 Dubai 2025 marks the point where crypto moves from labs to global infrastructure. There are many scams still at work, but crypto will be one of the defining forces of the modern world. As regulatory changes are made worldwide, expect the entire industry to grow by ten times at the very least by this time next year. The optimism is mixed with caution because of the lack of sweeping security standards and the lack of international regulatory enforcement. 2025 is the year when such changes are expected to take place. And there has never been a more exciting time to be involved in crypto, AI, DeFi, DePIN, blockchain and Web 3.0 – e ver.

But is it happening now, or are we still stuck in the Bitcoin season? A group of experts recently weighed in, and here’s what they had to say. Are We in Altcoin Season Right Now? Popular crypto analyst, Scott Melker, thinks we may have just experienced a mini altcoin season. He pointed out that while Bitcoin has been rising steadily, several altcoins also made big moves recently — something we haven’t seen in a long time. Ethereum, for example, jumped 40% in just two days at one point. What made this special is that Bitcoin’s dominance (its share of the overall crypto market) actually dropped while its price went up. In the past, when Bitcoin climbed, altcoins usually stayed flat or fell. This time, both moved up together — a sign to some that new money might be entering the market rather than traders just shifting funds between Bitcoin and altcoins. But Can We Really Have Another Altcoin Season Like the Old Days? The short answer: probably not in the same way. There’s a massive number of new crypto projects waiting on the sidelines. Venture capitalists and developers are holding off on launching thousands of new tokens until market conditions improve. When those hit the market, they’ll spread investor money thinner — making it harder for every altcoin to rise together like we’ve seen in past altcoin seasons. Instead, the experts believe the next altcoin run will be narrative-driven. In other words, only certain types of coins will pump at certain times based on market trends and hype. For example, it could be memecoins one month, AI-related tokens the next, or maybe DeFi (decentralized finance) projects on Solana or Ethereum. So, rather than a “throw a dart and watch everything rise” market, investors will need to be tuned in daily to catch the right trends at the right times.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 03:44:07

The mixed mood left the region softer overall. MSCI’s broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.17 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.15 percent. Mainland China was more or less flat. The CSI300 inched 0.06 percent lower, and the Shanghai Composite hardly moved. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng edged down 0.1 percent. A holiday in U.S. markets on Monday kept trading thin overnight. Still, investors welcomed Trump’s late reversal, which moved the tariff deadline to 9 July instead of next month. The change helped lift the risk appetite in future markets . Nasdaq contracts rose 1.26 percent in Asian hours, S&P 500 futures gained 1.11 percent, and FTSE futures picked up 0.94 percent. London was also shut on Monday. “It was a better night for risk assets, following Trump deferring (EU tariffs) back to July 9,” said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG. “What I think probably is now the main driver for this week is we’ve got the month-end rebalancing flows, which should start to kick in anytime soon… Nvidia’s earnings report again is going to be front and centre in terms of what’s going on there.” Chipmaker Nvidia’s reports are due on Wednesday and are expected to show a 65.9 percent jump in first-quarter revenue, keeping focus on the artificial-intelligence boom that has driven its share price. In Japan, yields on super-long government bonds fell early in the day, retreating from the record highs hit during last week’s heavy selling. Traders are bracing for upcoming market movements Several Federal Reserve policymakers will give their speeches this week, along with Friday’s U.S. core PCE price index. In Tokyo, a two-day annual conference organized by the Bank of Japan and its think tank has already begun on Tuesday. Global central bankers gathering there are expected to discuss economic growth and inflation. Currency markets showed a steady drift away from the dollar. The greenback was on course for a fifth straight monthly loss, the longest slide since 2017. The euro hovered near a one-month high at $1.14035. The yen strengthened nearly 0.5 percent to ¥142.18 per dollar. Trump’s unpredictable trade moves and worries over the US deficit have eroded confidence in American assets, weighing on the dollar. “A U.S. dollar regime change could be in the making in the long term after it appears to have peaked recently,” said David Meier, economist at Julius Baer. “Erratic U.S. policymaking, the tense fiscal situation, and large external indebtedness, against the backdrop of the twin deficit, suggest that a weaker USD is the route of least resistance,” David added. As the dollar loses some of its safe-haven appeal, investors have looked elsewhere. Gold, which touched record highs earlier this year, last traded 0.28 percent lower at $3,332.91 an ounce. Oil prices slipped as traders weighed whether OPEC+ would agree to raise output at a meeting this week. Brent crude futures eased 0.1 percent to $64.67 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate moved down 0.16 percent to $61.43 a barrel.

This drop came despite a strong performance from broader digital asset investment products, which attracted $3.3 billion in inflows last week. According to CoinShares, the inflows brought the six-week inflow streak to a cumulative $10.5 billion. Year-to-date inflows have now hit a record-breaking $10.8 billion, while total assets under management briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion. Investors Flock to Diversification Analysts attribute this momentum to rising economic uncertainty in the US, especially following Moody’s credit downgrade and surging treasury yields, which are pushing investors toward digital asset diversification. The latest edition of ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report revealed Bitcoin dominated digital asset inflows last week with $2.9 billion, and accounted for a quarter of total inflows in 2024. Interestingly, some investors viewed its price rally as a chance to short, which resulted in $12.7 million flowing into short-Bitcoin products – the highest since December 2024. Ethereum followed with $326 million in inflows, which represented its strongest in 15 weeks and the fifth straight week of positive sentiment. Meanwhile, Solana and Sui also saw inflows of $4.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Chainlink and Cardano performed modestly as well, clocking in inflows of $0.9 million and $0.6 million, during the same period. Alongside XRP, multi-asset products bucked the positive trend as witnessing $1.9 million in outflows. Switzerland, Sweden Report Outflows Regionally, the US continued to lead digital asset inflows with $3.2 billion last week, far ahead of other regions. Germany, Hong Kong, and Australia followed with $41.5 million, $33.3 million, and $10.9 million, respectively. Canada saw modest inflows of just $0.1 million during the past week. On the other hand, Swiss investors took profits amid rising prices, which led to $16.6 million in outflows. Sweden also experienced $12.1 million in outflows, while Brazil recorded $1.9 million exiting the market over the same period.

Industry leaders say engagement with policymakers has increased sharply this year, particularly after Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his vocal support for crypto, the Financial Times reported Tuesday. At the heart of the industry’s demands is a rollback of steep taxes introduced in 2022. These include a 30% capital gains tax and a 1% levy on every crypto transaction, measures aimed at curbing illegal activity but which, according to a report by the Esya Centre, pushed more than 90% of Indian crypto trading offshore. India’s crypto industry pushes for tax cuts as New Delhi warms to former pariah sector https://t.co/SoNaVywGfp — Financial Times (@FT) May 27, 2025 India’s Regulators Shift From Resistance to Tentative Crypto Engagement Industry executives now argue that a 0.1% transaction tax could offer the same traceability without stifling growth. “Thanks to Trump, the positive momentum that has happened in crypto has impacted India as well,” Ashish Singhal, co-founder of CoinSwitch, told the outlet. He noted that meetings with officials have gone from biannual events to near-weekly discussions. “Now regulators are more closely talking to us, understanding what the space is.” India’s stance on crypto has shifted from hostility to cautious engagement. The Reserve Bank of India once likened crypto to Ponzi schemes and pushed for a banking ban in 2018, which was later overturned by the Supreme Court. While the central bank remains skeptical, its tone has cooled. “The relationship with the RBI has gone from negative to neutral,” said Singhal. “I will still not quite call it positive yet.” Coinbase and Binance Return as Market Eyes $15B Growth by 2035 The change in atmosphere comes as New Delhi works on redrafting a key industry discussion paper. The move was confirmed earlier this year by Ajay Seth, India’s economic affairs secretary, though no formal tax relief was included in February’s budget, drawing disappointment from the Bharat Web3 Association. The Supreme Court of India has also weighed in, asking the Centre why it has not yet introduced “clear-cut” regulations for the sector. The court expressed concern over the government’s continued delay in forming comprehensive crypto policies. Despite the lack of immediate relief, international exchanges are returning. Binance and Coinbase , which previously scaled back operations in India, have re-entered the market . The country’s crypto sector, currently valued at around $2.5b, is projected to grow to more than $15b by 2035, according to estimates by Grant Thornton. Changing public perception remains a challenge. Many Indians still believe digital assets are illegal, despite the absence of a formal ban. But interest is rising among younger, tech-savvy investors, particularly those from wealthier backgrounds. As regulation continues to evolve, industry players hope to bring more of the sector back onshore, and into the open.

As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $108,499, marking a 2.5% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term retracement, the overall market trend remains positive. Bitcoin has held most of its recent gains and remains just below its record peak set yesterday. The recent price action has coincided with an increase in on-chain signals, suggesting that large players are returning to the market. Notably, analysts are closely monitoring activity from major crypto exchanges like Binance, which have historically played a significant role in price discovery and market direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Smashes Past $111K, But Are Traders About to Dump? Bitcoin Whale Activity on Binance Sparks Volatility Watch A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk highlighted a surge in whale activity on Binance. In his QuickTake post titled “Binance Whale Activity Spikes — Eyes on the Market,” the analyst pointed out that the Binance Whale Activity Score has seen a sharp rise. This metric, which measures inflow and outflow behavior of the top 10 whale wallets on Binance, indicates that large holders are actively repositioning. These movements can be early indicators of upcoming volatility and directional shifts in the market. The analyst explained that inflow spikes from whales may point to potential distribution or strategic selling, while outflow surges often signal accumulation or redeployment of capital to other platforms. The significance of these whale movements lies in their historical tendency to precede major price developments. According to Crazzyblockk, Binance remains a central venue for price formation, making it critical to observe whale patterns there. He concluded that these inflow-outflow fluctuations could introduce higher liquidity and possibly increased volatility in the short term. Spot Market Data Points to Renewed Buyer Interest Complementing these observations is a report from another CryptoQuant analyst, Ibrahimcosar, who identified a positive shift in spot market behavior. According to the analyst, the Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) over the past 90 days has turned green again. This metric reflects the difference between taker buy and taker sell volumes and serves as a proxy for real-time demand. A green phase indicates that market buy orders have become dominant, suggesting that buyers are regaining control. The analyst noted that in previous months, the same chart showed mostly red values, indicating a prevalence of sell orders and downward price pressure. The recent transition back into green territory may suggest the emergence of new demand as Bitcoin challenges its previous highs.

This question is now at the center of crypto discussions, as property tokenization is gaining serious traction. Contrary to earlier doubts, thought leaders across the blockchain world are increasingly backing real-world asset tokenization, asserting that it’s no longer just a niche concept. It’s now being viewed as a major use case that brings transparency, liquidity, and democratized access to traditionally illiquid markets like real estate. As this transformation unfolds, it’s setting the stage for newer blockchain projects that are built to handle complex, cross-border, and data-rich applications. While Pi Network’s derivatives launch with 20x leverage and Litecoin’s ZA Miner offering daily returns have captured immediate headlines, there’s one presale-stage project trying to tie all these practical applications together: Qubetics . Qubetics ($TICS) is not just trying to offer another blockchain—it’s engineered to solve real-world bottlenecks that traditional cryptocurrencies couldn’t address effectively. Focused on transforming how businesses and individuals handle international payments, Qubetics uses a multi-chain aggregator model to remove transaction barriers between global networks. It is uniquely aligned with the broader shift towards blockchain utility. Meanwhile, Litecoin is pivoting to mainstream passive income models through accessible mining contracts, and Pi Network has taken a bold step into derivatives trading, giving its community a significant tool to manage exposure and speculate at scale. As different as they are in approach, all three are capitalizing on what matters most in 2025—real utility and forward-facing strategy. For those evaluating the top coins to join today, understanding these recent breakthroughs is critical. Qubetics Sets a New Standard for Global Transactions Qubetics is reshaping how cross-border payments are managed by financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Instead of relying on outdated payment infrastructure and intermediaries that cause delays, high fees, and security vulnerabilities, the Qubetics Network introduces a blockchain-driven aggregator that accelerates settlements. Through strategic partnerships and smart protocol design, Qubetics ensures international transactions happen faster, more securely, and without the complications associated with traditional methods. Banks and financial entities can now settle large amounts without worrying about geographic or network constraints. This is particularly essential in the current economic environment, where time-sensitive transactions are critical for maintaining operational stability. For small and medium-sized businesses, this application means they can fulfill cross-border orders with minimal delay, unlocking more competitive global trade. Enterprises managing payrolls or vendor payments across jurisdictions will also benefit from Qubetics’ precision and speed. On the individual level, the Qubetics application allows for fast remittance transfers without sacrificing cost-efficiency—an important factor for families relying on overseas income. These are the very kinds of tools that make Qubetics one of the top coins to join today, especially as the global financial system begins to align more closely with decentralized solutions tailored for real-world commerce. Qubetics Presale Enters 36th Stage—One of the Most Structured Top Coins to Join Today The Qubetics presale is now in its 36th stage with the token priced at $0.3064. Over $17.4 million has already been raised, with 514 million $TICS tokens sold and more than 27,100 token holders actively engaged. This presale structure is defined by a strict weekly cycle—each stage lasts exactly seven days and concludes at 12:00 AM every Sunday. With every new stage, the price increases by 10%, which introduces consistent upward pressure and rewards early participation. This makes Qubetics not only one of the most predictable presales in the space but also a compelling model for those who value structured growth potential. For example, if a participant enters with $2,000 at the current price point, and Qubetics reaches $1 post-presale, the return stands at 226.32%. If it climbs to $5, the ROI increases dramatically to 1,531.58%. A $10 token price would push that return to 3,163.16%, and at $15, the ROI balloons to 4,794.74%. These figures are backed by the project’s upcoming mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, further validating its long-term goals. As more community members align themselves with the Qubetics presale, it is rapidly being recognized as the best crypto presale available right now. These tokenomics and time-bound stages make it a clear choice among the top coins to join today Litecoin’s Cloud Mining Push Brings Passive Earnings to the Masses Litecoin is taking a bold step into simplified user onboarding with its latest cloud mining rollout via ZA Miners. The program allows users to earn Litecoin daily without managing hardware, setups, or technical overhead. Participants can begin earning immediately after selecting a mining contract, and the profits are calculated and distributed every 24 hours. This hands-off approach is helping Litecoin carve out space in the expanding segment of passive income-focused crypto solutions. This initiative is particularly relevant for those looking for scalable, low-barrier-to-entry crypto opportunities. Participants are also given the flexibility to reinvest or withdraw their profits at any point, giving them more control over their digital assets. By offering this ease and accessibility, Litecoin is reinforcing its reputation as a utility-first coin that evolves with user demands. Pi Network’s Futures Debut Marks Its Entry Into Advanced Trading Territory Pi Network just landed on the global derivatives stage with its token now tradable on Kraken through perpetual futures contracts. These contracts offer up to 20x leverage, enabling traders to speculate on PI’s price in a more sophisticated financial environment. The listing reflects Kraken’s growing interest in tokens with strong community engagement, and it offers Pi Network a legitimate on-ramp into high-volume trading markets. At the time of this development, the PI token was trading at $0.77, reflecting a slight dip of 5.33% in the last 24 hours. Despite the minor short-term pullback, the derivatives debut is a significant milestone. It signals that Pi is no longer just an experimental mobile mining project—it’s stepping into markets dominated by advanced financial products and institutional-level tools. How Current Market Trends Are Shaping the Future of These Coins One of the most important trends gaining steam right now is real estate tokenization, a concept once dismissed by many but now championed by seasoned blockchain professionals. The latest discussion highlights how tokenized property is being framed not just as a niche tool but as a major disruptor of traditional real estate finance. For Litecoin, this movement aligns with the broader theme of accessibility, as its cloud mining platform allows passive entry into crypto income streams. Pi Network’s new futures offering reflects how community-based tokens can evolve into assets with more sophisticated trading instruments. Qubetics, meanwhile, benefits from being in its crypto presale phase while market volatility plays out. Because the price increases predictably by 10% every week, it offers a built-in level of stability that shields early buyers from external price shocks. With its multi-chain infrastructure and focus on business-grade transactions, Qubetics has positioned itself to participate in this larger trend of bringing real utility to decentralized assets. Why These Three Coins Stand Out in 2025’s Rapid Crypto Shifts Litecoin, Pi Network, and Qubetics all bring something tangible to the table in an industry that’s increasingly driven by results rather than narratives. Litecoin is giving users a sustainable path to daily earnings with zero technical friction. Pi Network is proving that community-focused tokens can evolve into serious financial instruments with derivatives access. Qubetics is aiming to close gaps in international financial infrastructure, offering real utility through cross-border transaction support and a strong presale model. For those scanning the space for meaningful, timely entry points, each of these coins offers a different flavor of potential. Yet, it is Qubetics, with its scheduled price increases and strong utility roadmap, that may appeal most to those looking to join this best crypto presale while the opportunity is still at its peak. Among the top coins to join today, Qubetics stands out for its structured presale, predictable growth model, and focus on solving real-world financial challenges. As each coin continues to execute its roadmap, these early moves in 2025 may define their long-term trajectory.

The address conveyed HTX DAO’s strategic perspective on Real World Assets (RWA). Hong Kong’s recent passage of the landmark Stablecoins Bill solidifies its role as a leading global financial center embracing decentralized innovation. HTX DAO’s significant presence at this pivotal moment underscores its growing impact. During the address, it was noted that “We are at a historic inflection point. Crypto is not just a shiny new technology but a movement to restructure the global financial power matrix.” As legacy financial systems, anchored by SWIFT, the U.S. dollar, and multinational banks, begin to fragment, HTX DAO believes that the integration of DAO governance and RWA tokenization represents a vital pathway to building the next-generation financial civilization. RWA for Financial Reordering: HTX DAO’s Leadership Role Far more than the tokenization of traditional assets, RWA represents a structural shift, bringing real-world assets under on-chain governance, transparent trading, and global coordination. HTX DAO emphasizes that on-chain does not necessarily equate to decentralization; the true transformation lies in the governance redesign and value redistribution introduced by DAO frameworks. HTX DAO is uniquely positioned at the intersection of real assets, crypto infrastructure, and decentralized governance, bringing comprehensive advantages to RWA practices. HTX DAO’s infrastructure is backed by HTX Exchange and the TRON blockchain, providing high-performance capabilities for RWA issuance, circulation, and settlement. Its governance mechanisms, including veHTX, snapshot voting, and a community proposal system, ensure layered, transparent, and censorship-resistant oversight. Furthermore, HTX DAO leverages a robust KOL ecosystem, Launchpool events, and extensive community engagement to accelerate asset awareness and adoption. Building the RWA Ecosystem: HTX DAO’s Vision Looking ahead, HTX DAO is developing a six-part RWA framework, covering: asset discovery mechanism, governance standardization, governance-to-distribution synergy, revenue sharing mechanism, risk management system, and ecosystem expansion and strategic partnerships. The objective of this framework is to bring the full lifecycle of RWA—proposal, review, listing, yield distribution, and risk response—entirely on-chain, ensuring both governance and audit transparency. For $HTX holders, DAO governance is no longer a technical abstraction but a participatory, decision-making, and yield-sharing mechanism. HTX DAO is designing a veHTX and yield distribution model, enabling users to lock $HTX to receive veHTX for voting rights, influence RWA project listings, decide yield splits, and vote on execution timelines. Aligning with Hong Kong’s Stablecoins Bill for Prosperity at a New Financial Era Just prior to the Conference, Hong Kong enacted the Stablecoins Bill, establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS). This legislative action positions the city as one of the first global regions to legislate stablecoin issuance and compliance. The initiative was publicly endorsed on social media by Justin Sun, HTX DAO’s core contributor, Advisor to HTX, and the TRON founder. HTX DAO views this legislation as a foundational step, crucial not only for stablecoin sustainability but also for effectively bridging RWA assets with on-chain governance. As 2025 marks the inaugural year of stablecoin legislation, Hong Kong stands at the forefront of the global digital finance wave. HTX DAO, powered by DAO governance and RWA integration, is building an open, shared, and decentralized ecosystem for asset governance. “We’re not merely building a DAO but bridging different civilizations,” Molly concluded. “HTX DAO will continue to expand its boundaries as a builder, resonating with global policy shifts to boost a financial future rooted in community and real-world value.” About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

The tech company introduced a new quantum computing chip called Willow in December 2024 and said it could break Bitcoin in at least two days. The firm argued that Willow could solve in five minutes a problem that would take most supercomputers 10 septillion years to solve. At the time, critics believed Willow’s power could overtake Bitcoin’s hash rate in minutes, rewrite the Bitcoin blockchain, or even steal Satoshi’s coins. Google sees quantum computing as a potential threat to BTC’s security ""2048-bit RSA #encryption could theoretically be broken by a #quantum computer with 1 million noisy qubits running for one week."" https://t.co/MoxGROF3Va #PQC #cybersecurity — Jari Pirhonen (@japi999) May 26, 2025 Google said its breakthrough moved quantum computing one step closer to becoming a practical reality and a potential threat to Bitcoin’s security. The company’s Quantum Researcher, Craig Gidney, believes that planning the transition of quantum-safe cryptosystems requires understanding the cost of quantum attacks on vulnerable ecosystems. Gidney said he published an estimate in Gidney+Ekera 2019 stating that 2048-bit RSA integers could be factored in eight hours by a quantum computer with 20 million qubits. According to him, he significantly reduced the number of qubits required in his research paper. “I estimate that a 2048 bit RSA integer could be factored in less than a week by a quantum computer with less than a million noisy qubits. This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate.” – Craig Gidney , Quantum Research Scientist at Google. Google’s researcher believes that people’s digital assets are still safe for now. He also argued that the trajectory is what matters, and it’s pointing in a direction that should make anyone holding crypto pay attention. Google said the breakthrough would come from better algorithms and smarter error correction. On the algorithmic side, the firm’s researchers figured out how to calculate modular exponentiations twice as fast as the heavy mathematical lifting in encryption. The team also found that error correction improvements were possible because they tripled the density of the logical qubits’ space by adding a new layer of error correction, which packaged more useful quantum operations into the same physical space. Google researchers also deployed magic state cultivation – a trick that makes special quantum ingredients (called T states) stronger and more reliable. The team said it helps quantum computers perform complex tasks more efficiently without wasting extra resources, which reduces the workspace needed for basic quantum operations. Bitcoin operates on elliptic curve cryptography, which works on mathematical principles similar to those of RSA. Google believes that if quantum computers can crack RSA faster than expected, BTC’s security timeline just got smaller. Project 11 believes quantum computers running Shor’s algorithms might break BTC We just launched the Q-Day Prize. 1 BTC to the first team to break a toy version of Bitcoin’s cryptography using a quantum computer. Deadline: April 5, 2026 Mission: Protect 6M BTC (over $500B) — Project 11 (@qdayclock) April 16, 2025 A quantum computing research group called Project 11 launched a Bitcoin bounty worth nearly $85,000 for anyone who can break even a simplified version of BTC’s encryption using a quantum computer. The team is testing keys ranging from 1 to 25 bits, smaller compared to Bitcoin’s 256-bit encryption, but it entails tracking progress. Project 11 wrote that BTC security relies on elliptic curve cryptography. The research group also believes that quantum computers running Shor’s algorithm will eventually break it. The team is now testing how urgent the threat is. Google believes competitors could already be collecting encrypted data to decrypt later once quantum computers become available. The tech firm said it has been encrypting traffic both in Chrome and internally, switching to the standardized version of ML-KEM once it became available. The National Institute of Standards and Technology released post-quantum cryptography standards last year and recommended phasing out vulnerable systems after 2030. Google’s research suggests that the schedule might need to be accelerated. IBM has partnered with the University of Tokyo and the University of Chicago to plan for a 100,000-qubit quantum computer by 2030. Quantinuum also aims to deliver a fully immune quantum computer by 2029.

The surge, led primarily by Bitcoin and Ethereum funds, comes as several major token vesting schedules are set to expire in June, releasing an estimated $3.3 billion worth of digital assets into circulation. While the influx of new capital highlights growing investor confidence, the upcoming token unlocks may reintroduce short-term volatility and reignite scrutiny over project tokenomics and market supply dynamics. Crypto ETPs Hit $10.8B in Inflows as Institutional Demand Soars Past Records Cryptocurrency investment products have seen an explosive resurgence in demand, with institutional inflows breaching the $10 billion threshold for the year, according to the latest report by European digital asset manager CoinShares. For the week ending May 24, global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracted $3.3 billion in net inflows, one of the largest weekly totals in history, pushing 2024’s year-to-date (YTD) cumulative figure to a staggering $10.8 billion. The surge highlights a notable revival in investor appetite for digital assets amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty and renewed confidence in flagship cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Crypto ETP flows by asset as of May 23, 2025 (in millions of US dollars) (Source: CoinShares) Bitcoin investment products dominated last week’s flows, accounting for $2.9 billion of the total $3.3 billion, or roughly 88% of all weekly inflows. According to CoinShares head of research James Butterfill, this wave of capital helped push the total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs to a record $187.5 billion, albeit briefly, before markets experienced minor corrections. The inflows into Bitcoin products came as BTC soared above the $110,000 mark on May 22, marking a new milestone for the digital asset. While the rally attracted long-term capital, it also fueled demand for short-Bitcoin products, which saw $12.7 million in inflows, the largest weekly inflow into short-BTC ETPs since December 2024. This divergence indicates that some investors are preparing for near-term volatility even as the long-term outlook remains bullish. Ethereum Continues Five-Week Winning Streak Post-Upgrade Ethereum (ETH) ETPs also recorded strong performance, pulling in $326 million for the week—its fifth consecutive week of inflows. The continued momentum follows the successful rollout of the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade on May 7, which improved transaction efficiency and scalability on the Ethereum network. Investor confidence in Ethereum has been steadily growing in the wake of developments related to a potential Ethereum spot ETF in the United States. Alongside the Ethereum ecosystem’s technical improvements, this has led to a shift in sentiment favoring sustained capital allocation to ETH-based investment products. In stark contrast, XRP-based ETPs experienced a historic setback. After an 80-week streak of inflows, XRP products saw $37.2 million in outflows, the largest single-week capital flight on record for the asset class. The reversal came despite two potentially bullish developments: the growing speculation around the launch of a spot XRP ETF in the US, and the open interest in XRP futures climbing to $2.2 billion. The disconnect between the token’s price underperformance and these tailwinds has caused some institutional investors to reassess short-term exposure. Butterfill suggested that the withdrawal could indicate waning confidence in XRP's immediate price trajectory rather than a broader dismissal of its long-term viability. Crypto ETP Market Rebounds From February Correction CoinShares’ latest data shows the market has not only recovered but has surpassed levels seen before the February–March 2025 correction. During that period, crypto investment products experienced nearly $7 billion in outflows following a sharp pullback in digital asset prices. That drawdown had initially dampened enthusiasm, but by mid-May, inflows had returned with $785 million added in a single week, pushing the YTD total to $7.5 billion by May 16. Underlying the record-breaking inflows is a broader shift in institutional strategy as macroeconomic pressures mount. Butterfill pointed to the recent downgrade of the US credit outlook by Moody’s and a spike in treasury yields as catalysts pushing investors toward alternative asset classes like digital assets. The reemergence of crypto as a preferred destination for capital, especially within structured products such as ETFs and ETPs, underscores the growing sophistication of the digital asset market and the deepening role of institutions in driving this growth. Outlook: Sustained Growth or Volatility Ahead? While the recent inflows have been overwhelmingly positive for market sentiment, the rise in short-BTC positions suggests that not all investors believe the upward momentum will continue unchecked. With Ethereum’s ecosystem undergoing active upgrades and Bitcoin nearing new psychological levels, the coming weeks will be a critical test for crypto’s resilience. Moreover, with speculation mounting around future ETF approvals for Ethereum and potentially XRP, volatility may increase as regulatory signals begin to shape new investor narratives. Regardless, the crypto ETP landscape continues to break records and draw billions in capital—an unmistakable signal that institutional crypto adoption is not just back, but accelerating. $3.3 Billion in Crypto Tokens Set to Flood Market in June as Vesting Schedules Expire Meanwhile, digital assets worth $3.3 billion are poised to enter circulation in June 2025 as vesting periods for several major crypto projects come to an end, according to new data from crypto vesting tracker Tokenomist. While the figure marks a 32% month-on-month decline from May’s $4.9 billion in token unlocks, the influx is still expected to have a measurable impact on market liquidity, investor sentiment, and potentially token prices. Vesting schedules play a crucial role in managing the distribution of crypto tokens—often for team members, early investors, foundations, or community grants. These locked tokens are typically released either gradually through “linear unlocks” or all at once via “cliff unlocks.” Of the $3.3 billion to be released in June, approximately $1.4 billion will be unlocked through cliff mechanisms, while $1.9 billion will be gradually released through linear emissions, signaling a mix of immediate and ongoing market supply pressure. One of the most closely watched token unlocks in June is from Metars Genesis (MRS)—a metaverse-focused NFT project. The project is scheduled to unlock $193 million worth of MRS tokens on June 21, which it says will be directed toward a new partnership focused on artificial intelligence. Since March, Metars Genesis has been releasing 10 million tokens monthly, and has already seen nearly $1 billion in tokens enter circulation. Analysts will be monitoring how the AI partnership impacts token utility and demand in light of the expanded supply. Sui to Release $160M in Tokens on June 1 Layer-1 blockchain project Sui (SUI) is also scheduled for a major unlock. On June 1, the project will unlock 44 million SUI tokens worth roughly $160 million. The majority of these tokens will be allocated to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors, and the community reserve. Notably, more than $70 million worth of these tokens is set aside for Series B investors, prompting speculation over potential profit-taking. Tokenomist data showing Sui’s vesting schedule (Source: Tokenomist) Since its inception, Sui has already unlocked 3.3 billion tokens worth over $12 billion, which constitutes about 33% of its total token supply. However, Tokenomist data reveals that another 5.22 billion SUI tokens—valued at nearly $20 billion—remain without a scheduled release date, leaving uncertainty around future dilution risk. Other high-profile projects are also set for sizable unlocks in June: Fasttoken (FTN) will release 20 million tokens valued at $88 million, allocated to the project’s founders. LayerZero (ZRO), a cross-chain interoperability protocol, plans to unlock 25 million tokens worth $71 million, primarily directed toward core contributors and strategic partners. Aptos (APT) is slated to release 11.31 million tokens worth $61 million. The tokens will be distributed to the core team, community, foundation, and early investors. ZKsync (ZK) will emit over 760 million tokens worth $49 million, primarily targeted at team members and early backers. These unlocks are likely to reignite discussions around tokenomics, vesting transparency, and the implications for long-term holders as new supply enters open markets. Market Impact: Supply Pressure or Maturation? While June’s $3.3 billion in unlocks is lower than May’s record, the sudden liquidity—especially from cliff unlocks—can potentially weigh on token prices, particularly if recipients choose to liquidate their allocations. However, some analysts argue that token unlocks also represent a maturation milestone for projects, reflecting continued development, new product launches, and evolving utility.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-27 05:30:00

Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ever wonder what the collective mood of the market is? Are traders feeling optimistic and ready to buy everything in sight, or are they huddled in fear, panic selling their holdings? That’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes in. This popular metric gives us a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , and right now, it’s flashing ‘Greed’ with a reading of 74. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Provided by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a unique tool designed to gauge the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a temperature check for investor psychology. Emotions can significantly influence trading decisions, often leading to irrational behavior. When the market is rising, greed can kick in, pushing prices unsustainably high. Conversely, when prices plummet, fear can lead to panic selling, driving values even lower. The index distills these complex emotions into a simple score ranging from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried. This can signal a potential buying opportunity for those brave enough to enter the market against the prevailing mood. 25-49: Fear – Anxiety is present, but not at extreme levels. Caution is advised. 50-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic or outright greedy. This suggests the market is getting expensive. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria is widespread. This can indicate a market bubble that might be due for a correction. The core idea behind the index is based on a classic investment principle: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” By understanding the dominant sentiment, traders and investors might identify potential turning points or confirm existing trends. How Does the Index Get Its Score? Diving into the Data The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number. It’s calculated using a weighted average of several different data points. Alternative.me uses six specific factors to arrive at the daily score. Understanding these factors helps us appreciate the nuance behind the single number: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum to the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market indicates greedy or optimistic behavior. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts and hashtags on platforms like Twitter. A rapid increase in specific hashtags and high engagement rates can indicate heightened interest and potentially greedy behavior. Surveys (15%): While paused at times, this factor previously incorporated weekly sentiment surveys. (Note: The index description indicates this is still a factor, though its current implementation might vary). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear (as investors flee riskier altcoins to BTC, seen as a safer haven), while falling dominance can signal increasing greed and a willingness to invest in altcoins (often preceding or accompanying an altcoin season ). Google Trends (10%): This looks at Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” indicates fear, while terms like “buy crypto” or “Bitcoin rally” suggest greed. Each of these factors contributes to the final score, providing a multi-faceted view of the market’s emotional state. It’s important to note that the index is heavily weighted towards Bitcoin data (Volatility, Momentum, Bitcoin Dominance, Google Trends are largely BTC-centric), as Bitcoin remains the dominant force influencing overall crypto market sentiment . Understanding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 74 Mean Right Now? As of May 27, the index stands at 74, firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, just one point shy of ‘Extreme Greed’. A reading of 74 indicates that investors are feeling confident, optimistic, and perhaps even a bit overly enthusiastic about the market’s prospects. This level of greed typically emerges after a period of price increases, where participants have seen their portfolios grow and are anticipating further gains. When the index is high, it suggests: Increased Buying Pressure: More people are looking to buy, and fewer are looking to sell, driving prices up. Reduced Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): The prevailing narrative is positive, reducing the anxiety that might otherwise deter new investment. Potential for Overextension: High greed can lead to prices becoming detached from fundamental value or sustainable growth rates. A Possible Precursor to Correction: Historically, periods of extreme greed have often been followed by market corrections or significant pullbacks as early investors take profits and the buying pressure wanes. For those watching the Bitcoin price , a high index reading like 74 often correlates with strong upward price action or recent highs. It reflects the bullish conviction currently present in the market. Historical Context: When Has Greed Peaked Before? Looking back at the history of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can provide valuable context. During the peak of the 2021 bull run, the index frequently hit the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, often exceeding 90. These periods coincided with rapid price increases across the market, but were also often followed by sharp, albeit sometimes temporary, downturns. Conversely, during the depths of the 2022 bear market, the index languished in ‘Extreme Fear’ (below 20) for extended periods, marking points of maximum pessimism that, in hindsight, represented significant buying opportunities before subsequent rallies. A reading of 74 is high, but not historically unprecedented extreme. It suggests strong positive sentiment, but perhaps not yet the full-blown euphoria seen at the very top of major market cycles. However, being this close to the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone warrants careful consideration. Benefits: How Can You Use the Index in Your Crypto Trading Strategy? While not a standalone trading signal, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a valuable addition to your toolkit. Here are some ways traders and investors utilize it: Counter-Trading Signal: The most common approach is to use it as a contrarian indicator. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be a good time to consider buying (when others are panic selling). When it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (like it’s approaching now), it might be a time to consider selling or reducing exposure (when others are rushing to buy). Sentiment Confirmation: Use the index to confirm signals from other technical or fundamental analysis tools. If your analysis suggests a potential downturn and the index is showing high greed, it adds weight to your bearish outlook. If your analysis suggests a potential upturn during extreme fear, the index supports a bullish view. Emotional Check: The index can serve as a reminder to check your own emotions. If the index is high and you feel an overwhelming urge to buy aggressively, it might be your own greed influencing your decisions, prompting you to pause and re-evaluate. Spotting Potential Altcoin Season: Keep an eye on the Bitcoin Dominance factor within the index calculation. If the overall index is high (greed) and Bitcoin dominance starts to fall, it could signal that investors are rotating profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, potentially kicking off an altcoin season . Using the index requires discipline and an understanding that sentiment is only one piece of the puzzle. Limitations: Why the Index Isn’t a Crystal Ball It’s crucial to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a perfect predictor of future Bitcoin price movements or overall market direction. It has limitations: Correlation, Not Causation: The index reflects current sentiment, which often correlates with price movements, but it doesn’t *cause* the market to move. Other factors like regulatory news, technological developments, and macroeconomic events play significant roles. Lagging or Coinciding Indicator: The index reacts to market conditions. By the time it hits ‘Extreme Greed’, the market might have already made a significant move up. Similarly, ‘Extreme Fear’ often appears after a crash has already occurred. Limited Data Scope: While it incorporates several factors, it doesn’t capture everything influencing market sentiment or price, such as large institutional moves or private investor activity not reflected in public data. Potential for Manipulation: Social media sentiment, one of the factors, can potentially be influenced or manipulated. Not a Standalone Tool: Relying solely on the index for trading decisions is risky. It should be used in conjunction with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and sound risk management. Treat the index as a helpful indicator of the market’s emotional temperature, not a definitive buy or sell signal. Actionable Insights: Incorporating the Index into Your Strategy So, how should you approach the current reading of 74 in the ‘Greed’ zone? Here are some actionable steps to consider as part of your crypto trading strategy : Exercise Caution: A high reading suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself. This isn’t necessarily a signal to sell everything, but it is a good time to be more cautious with new investments. Avoid chasing pumps driven purely by FOMO. Review Your Portfolio: If you’ve accumulated significant gains during the recent uptrend, consider taking some profits. Selling a portion of your holdings in the ‘Greed’ zone aligns with the contrarian principle. Tighten Stop Losses: If you are holding positions, consider tightening your stop-loss orders to protect against a sudden downturn if sentiment shifts rapidly. Look for Divergences: Compare the index’s movement with price action. If the market continues to rise sharply while the index plateaus or starts to dip from extreme levels, it could be a subtle sign of weakening underlying sentiment despite price strength. Research Altcoins (Carefully): With the index in Greed and potentially signaling an upcoming altcoin season (depending on the Bitcoin Dominance factor), this might be a time to research promising altcoin projects. However, be highly selective and aware that altcoins are generally riskier than Bitcoin, especially if a market correction occurs. Combine with Other Indicators: Always use the index alongside other tools. Look at chart patterns, support/resistance levels, volume analysis, and fundamental news before making decisions. A high index reading is a reminder that market cycles exist and sentiment can shift quickly. Prepare, don’t panic. Is an Altcoin Season on the Horizon? As mentioned, the Bitcoin Dominance factor within the index plays a role in assessing the potential for an altcoin season . When overall market sentiment is greedy (high index) and Bitcoin dominance is falling, it often suggests that capital is flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins. While the index itself at 74 indicates overall greed, keeping an eye on the specific Bitcoin Dominance chart can provide further clues about whether altcoins are likely to outperform Bitcoin in the near term. A high overall index reading combined with decreasing BTC dominance is a classic recipe for altcoin rallies, but always remember that market dynamics are complex and no single indicator guarantees future performance. Conclusion: Summing Up the Sentiment Signal The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sitting at 74 places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. This reflects strong positive sentiment driven by factors like market momentum and social media buzz. While a high reading indicates optimism and can coincide with upward price action, it also serves as a crucial warning sign that the market may be getting frothy. Historically, periods of high greed have often preceded market pullbacks or corrections. For anyone involved in crypto, understanding this sentiment is vital for making informed decisions and refining their crypto trading strategy . Don’t let the prevailing greed cloud your judgment; use the index as a tool for awareness, caution, and strategic planning alongside other forms of analysis to navigate the exciting, but volatile, world of cryptocurrency.

Deputy Governor Lee Jong-ryeol outlined the bank’s vision during the ‘Blockchain Leaders Club’ event on Tuesday. “We are considering a plan to link the Bank of Korea’s deposit tokens with the public blockchain system,” Lee said, according to a News1 report . He described state-backed deposit tokens as a “type of stablecoin,” issued within the bank’s digital currency framework. “These projects are being promoted by the Bank of Korea as a monetary and foreign exchange authority, with the aim of safely and soundly developing the digital currency ecosystem from a national perspective.” Further, Lee noted that the tokens could potentially operate alongside privately issued stablecoins within the crypto ecosystem. Influx of Global Stablecoins is Concerning: BOK Deputy Governor As reported by Cryptonews , stablecoins drove around 47% of South Korea’s Q1 crypto outflows. Stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, such as USDT and USDC, made up 26.87 trillion won (USD $19.1 billion) or 47.3%. South Korean traders prefer stablecoins due to their price stability, which enables them to access foreign crypto markets like Binance. Dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC accounted for 26.87 trillion won of South Korea’s crypto outflows in Q1 2025. Are stablecoins driving the surge in global crypto trading? #Stablecoins #SouthKorea https://t.co/9DT0K4IsBz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 Bank of Korea deputy governor Lee called the influx of global stablecoins “concerning.” He added that if stablecoins are used as a substitute for currency, it would lead to problems, including violation of monetary sovereignty, financial instability and money laundering. Further, leading legal and financial experts have warned political leaders that stablecoin adoption could pose a danger to the South Korean economy. On the global front, stablecoin growth has reached new heights. For instance, its total market value surpassed $230 billion in March 2025. At press time, the total stablecoin market stands at $247.483 billion, which is up $3.537 billion over the past week. Source: DeFiLlama The Tuesday’s event saw attendance from key government officials and several representatives of major virtual asset exchanges, including Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, among others. Is Korean Won-Backed Stablecoin Coming Soon? Earlier, South Korea’s opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, touted the launch of Korean won-backed stablecoin. He proposed that the stablecoin would stem the 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) crypto outflow and reduce dependence on foreign private stablecoins. Jae-myung, the frontrunner in the South Korean presidential elections, has been pressured by lawmakers over fast-tracking the rollout of a KRW stablecoin . Min Byoung-dug, a lawmaker for the Democratic Party and the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee, recently said that the country needs to “ take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins ” before the USD-backed stablecoins become prominent. “That is the only way we can secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony,” Min said last week.

They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave. However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation. This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price. Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.” “Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.” BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Even though Japan’s net external assets reached a record level , the stronger euro, the yen depreciation, and Germany’s export-led surplus also tilted the balance. At the end of 2024, Japan’s net external assets were ¥533.1 trillion (about $3.73 trillion), its Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday. The figure was up nearly 13% from last year, indicating an increase in foreign investment by Japanese companies. But Germany’s net external assets grew even steeper to ¥569.7 trillion ($3.99 trillion). That makes Germany the largest creditor nation on the planet. China held third place, with net external assets of ¥516.3 trillion ($3.62 trillion). Germany’s rise to the top is largely due to its huge current account surplus. In 2024, it rose to $282.99 billion, boosted by robust exports, particularly of luxury machinery, automobiles, and industrial equipment. By contrast, the surplus in Japan’s current account was ¥29.4 trillion, or about $205 billion. That’s a healthy number but nowhere near enough to keep up with Germany. Weak yen fuels Japan’s asset growth, but not enough to lead The devaluation of the yen was a big factor behind the growth of Japan’s foreign assets . The value of assets in the currencies appreciated when they were converted back into yen as the yen weakened against the euro and dollar. The yen fell roughly 11.7% against the U.S. dollar in 2024 and 5% against the euro. This caused euro-denominated German assets to look much larger in yen terms. By the end of 2024, Japan had gross external assets of ¥1,659 trillion ($11.61 trillion), or ¥169 trillion ($1.18 trillion) more than the preceding year. And yet its liabilities also surged, rising by ¥109 trillion ($0.76 trillion) to ¥1,126 trillion ($7.88 trillion). Although Japan posted strong figures, Germany’s surge in external surplus combined with favorable currency movements ultimately gave it the edge. Trade pressures push Japan to invest overseas Japanese businesses maintained their momentum of aggressive overseas investments in 2024, especially in finance, insurance, and retail. The United States and the United Kingdom remained key targets for these investments. Mergers and acquisitions overseas by Japan saw particularly strong growth. Such investments helped boost overall foreign assets but may not result in short-term gains. In the future, Japan’s status as a global creditor will hinge on how its companies fare in the global economy, particularly as rising geopolitical tensions and evolving tariff rules loom. President Donald Trump’s resurgence and trade policies may also influence where and how Japanese companies invest more. Some may move manufacturing or assets to the United States as an insurance policy against future tariffs or other trade blocks. Japan is still one of the world’s most fiscally solid countries. However, whether the country can sustain its economic success is uncertain, as longer-term challenges, such as the impact of an aging population, stubbornly low wages, and persistent deflation, threaten to hobble its economic growth over the long term.

Cetus, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on Sui, has recently disclosed a major security incident. We’re talking about a significant financial blow – an estimated $220 million lost in a sophisticated exploit that occurred on May 22, 2025. This isn’t just another blip on the radar; a loss of this magnitude sends ripples through the entire DeFi space. Cetus has been quick to respond, publishing a detailed report titled “Cetus Incident Report: May 22, 2025 Attack Disclosure.” This report outlines their immediate actions and forward-looking strategy to navigate this crisis. Let’s dive into what happened and what Cetus plans to do next. What Happened During the Cetus Exploit? The core of the issue revolves around the Cetus exploit that targeted the DEX on May 22, 2025. While the full technical details of the exploit vector are still under wraps or being investigated, the outcome is clear and stark: approximately $220 million in user funds, primarily from liquidity pools, were siphoned off. For context, $220 million represents a substantial amount within the DeFi landscape, highlighting the critical vulnerabilities that can exist even in seemingly robust protocols. Decentralized exchanges like Cetus rely on complex smart contracts to manage liquidity, execute trades, and handle user funds without intermediaries. These smart contracts are the backbone of the operation, but they also represent potential attack surfaces. A single vulnerability, if discovered and exploited by malicious actors, can lead to catastrophic losses, as sadly demonstrated by this incident. The immediate aftermath of such an exploit is chaotic. Users panic, liquidity dries up, and the protocol’s reputation takes a severe hit. The Cetus team’s priority has been to assess the damage, understand the exploit mechanism, and formulate a plan to address the fallout and prevent future occurrences. Strengthening Decentralized Exchange Security After the Breach One of the absolute top priorities for Cetus moving forward, as outlined in their report, is a significant push to strengthen decentralized exchange security . Exploits like this are a harsh reminder that security in DeFi is not a one-time audit; it’s an ongoing, evolving process. Cetus has committed to implementing more rigorous security measures. What might this involve? Typically, enhancing smart contract security after a major incident includes: Comprehensive Code Audits: Engaging multiple, reputable third-party security firms to conduct deep dives into the entire codebase, looking for vulnerabilities missed in previous reviews. Formal Verification: Using mathematical methods to prove that smart contracts behave as intended under all possible conditions, reducing the risk of unexpected exploits. Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivizing ethical hackers to find and report vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. Improved Monitoring and Alerting: Implementing systems that can detect suspicious activity or unusual transactions in real-time, allowing for quicker response times. Access Control & Multi-Signature Wallets: Reviewing and tightening control over critical functions and potentially requiring multiple team members to authorize large transactions or code changes. The report emphasizes that bolstering their security framework is foundational to rebuilding trust and ensuring the long-term viability of the platform on Sui. This commitment to enhancing security is crucial not just for Cetus, but serves as a case study for other DEXs operating in the high-stakes DeFi environment. Navigating the Crypto Exploit Recovery Journey Perhaps the most pressing concern for affected users is the crypto exploit recovery plan. Losing $220 million is devastating for liquidity providers (LPs) who trusted Cetus with their assets. The Cetus team acknowledges this and has made recovery for affected LPs a central pillar of their response. According to their report, the recovery plan is multi-faceted: Working with Ecosystem Partners: Cetus is collaborating closely with other projects and entities within the Sui ecosystem and the broader crypto space. This could involve tracing funds, seeking assistance from exchanges, or leveraging collective security expertise. Restoring LP Withdrawals: A key technical challenge is safely enabling withdrawals for LPs, especially those in affected pools, while preventing further losses or manipulation. This requires careful technical work to isolate compromised funds and ensure remaining assets are secure. On-Chain Vote for Fund Recovery: Cetus has initiated an on-chain governance vote. The specifics of this vote (e.g., proposing a mechanism for distributing recovered funds, approving a recovery fund creation) are vital and require community consensus to accelerate the recovery process legally and transparently. Negotiations with the Attacker: In parallel with other efforts, Cetus is attempting to negotiate with the attacker. This often involves offering a bounty (the ‘white hat’ opportunity) in exchange for the return of funds, minus a percentage as a reward for identifying the vulnerability. Pursuing Legal Action: Alongside negotiation, legal avenues are being explored to identify and pursue the attacker. This is a complex process in the pseudonymous world of crypto but is often pursued in large-scale exploits. Pending Final Notice: The report mentions a ‘final notice’ is pending, likely related to the negotiation deadline or the next steps in the recovery or legal process. Successfully executing a crypto exploit recovery plan of this scale is incredibly challenging. It requires technical skill, legal strategy, community coordination via governance, and sometimes, a bit of luck in recovering funds or negotiating with the exploiter. The transparency and steps outlined by Cetus are a crucial starting point, though the path ahead for affected LPs will undoubtedly be long and complex. What Does This Mean for the Sui DEX Ecosystem? An exploit of this size on a major Sui DEX like Cetus naturally raises questions about the security posture of the entire ecosystem. While the vulnerability might have been specific to Cetus’s smart contracts, it underscores the inherent risks in DeFi, regardless of the underlying blockchain. For users of other protocols on Sui, this incident serves as a stark reminder to: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand the risks associated with depositing funds into any DeFi protocol. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed: Follow official channels for updates on security incidents and recovery efforts. Understand Smart Contract Risk: Be aware that even audited contracts can have vulnerabilities. The Sui community and other projects on the chain will be watching closely to see how Cetus handles the recovery and implements new security measures. A successful and transparent recovery process could help restore confidence, while missteps could further damage trust in the ecosystem. Beyond the Headlines: The Broader Impact on Crypto Security The Cetus incident is unfortunately not an isolated event in the world of decentralized finance. It highlights the continuous arms race between protocol developers and malicious actors. Ensuring robust crypto security is paramount for the growth and adoption of DeFi. This involves not only technical safeguards but also community education and vigilance. As users, understanding the risks is the first step in protecting your assets. As developers and projects, continuous auditing, testing, and rapid response plans are non-negotiable. The $220 million loss is a painful lesson, but the response from Cetus, involving technical fixes, community governance, legal action, and even negotiation, provides a template for how protocols attempt to navigate such crises. The success of their crypto exploit recovery will be a key factor in how the community perceives both Cetus and the resilience of the Sui ecosystem. Conclusion: A Difficult Path to Recovery The Cetus exploit resulting in a shocking $220 million loss is a significant setback for the Sui DEX and its users. The team’s detailed report outlines a clear, albeit challenging, path forward involving strengthening decentralized exchange security , pursuing a comprehensive crypto exploit recovery plan for LPs, and engaging in both legal action and potential negotiation with the attacker. While the road to full recovery will be arduous, the proactive steps, including the on-chain vote and collaboration with ecosystem partners, demonstrate a commitment to addressing the crisis head-on. This incident serves as a critical reminder of the inherent risks in DeFi and the absolute necessity of robust crypto security measures and vigilant community participation.

Google researchers have revealed that RSA encryption, which protects systems from internet banking to Bitcoin wallets, can be broken by quantum computers with 20 times fewer resources than previously thought. In a study published in 2019, Google Quantum Researcher Craig Gidney predicted that 2048-bit RSA encryption could be broken in eight hours with a quantum computer with 20 million noisy qubits. However, in his new study, he significantly revised this number: This process can now be done in less than a week with a quantum computer with less than 1 million qubits. “This represents a 20-fold reduction in the number of qubits compared to our previous estimate,” Gidney wrote in his blog post.

Currently, IBM's most powerful quantum computer, called Condor, has a capacity of 1,121 qubits; Google's Sycamore works with only 53 qubits. However, the pace of progress in the quantum field shows that it could pose serious risks to security systems in the future. Google said there are two main drivers behind this development: faster algorithms and more efficient error correction methods. The researchers managed to speed up one of the most difficult operations in cryptography, “modular exponential computations,” by a factor of two. They also improved the error correction layer, allowing more “logical qubits” to operate in the same physical space. This significantly increased processing efficiency. Another technical innovation is a method called “magic state cultivation,” which allows quantum computers to perform complex tasks with higher accuracy and fewer resources. Unlike RSA, Bitcoin is protected by a system called elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). However, both encryption systems are based on similar mathematical foundations. Google’s new finding on RSA could mean that ECC could also be broken sooner than expected. While the 256-bit encryption that Bitcoin uses is currently quite strong, the exponential development of quantum computers could erode this security over time. *This is not investment advice.

The Altcoin Season Index is a key indicator that provides valuable insights into whether smaller cryptocurrencies are outperforming Bitcoin, or vice versa. Recently, this index has dropped, signaling a significant shift: we are currently in Bitcoin Season . Understanding this dynamic is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. It helps investors and traders gauge market sentiment and potentially adjust their crypto trading strategy accordingly. Let’s dive deeper into what the Altcoin Season Index tells us and what the prevailing Bitcoin Season implies for the broader crypto market trends . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index, as tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is a simple yet powerful metric designed to measure the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. It’s essentially a snapshot of market sentiment and capital flow between Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens). Here’s how it works: It typically looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens). The performance is measured over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. A score of 75 or higher indicates Altcoin Season, meaning at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. A score of 25 or lower indicates Bitcoin Season, meaning 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Scores between 25 and 75 suggest a neutral period or a transition phase, where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin have a clear dominance in performance. Think of it as a barometer for market dominance. When the index is high, capital is flowing into altcoins, leading to potentially explosive gains in various smaller cap assets. When the index is low, Bitcoin is the primary beneficiary of market liquidity and momentum. The Current State: Altcoin Season Index at 25, Signaling Bitcoin Season As of a recent reading (May 27, 00:30 UTC), the Altcoin Season Index registered 25. This figure is down slightly from previous days, reinforcing the current market narrative. A score of 25 falls precisely at the threshold for what is defined as Bitcoin Season . What does this number specifically tell us? It means that over the last 90 days, only a quarter or less of the top 100 altcoins have managed to post better performance figures than Bitcoin. This is a strong signal that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer in the recent past, attracting a larger share of investment and showing relative strength compared to the broader altcoin market. This isn’t just a random number; it reflects real capital movements and investor preferences over the preceding three months. During Bitcoin Season, it’s common to see Bitcoin’s market dominance (its percentage of the total crypto market cap) increase or remain high. Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Right Now? Several factors can contribute to a period of Bitcoin Season . Understanding these drivers helps paint a clearer picture of the current crypto market trends : Safe Haven Narrative: In times of market uncertainty or macroeconomic volatility, investors often flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as the most established and relatively ‘safer’ asset in the crypto space compared to more speculative altcoins. Institutional Interest: Significant institutional investment often targets Bitcoin first, especially through products like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Large capital inflows into these instruments directly boost Bitcoin’s price and can draw liquidity away from altcoins. Halving Cycles: The period following a Bitcoin halving event can sometimes see Bitcoin consolidate or make significant moves first, with altcoins potentially lagging before their own rally later. Dominance Rotation: Market cycles often involve a rotation of capital. Sometimes Bitcoin leads the charge, consolidating gains, and then capital rotates into larger cap altcoins, followed by smaller cap altcoins. Bitcoin Season can be the initial phase of this rotation. Liquidity Crunch: In less liquid market conditions, capital tends to concentrate in the most liquid assets, and Bitcoin is by far the most liquid cryptocurrency. The current environment likely involves a combination of these factors, making Bitcoin the preferred asset for many investors in the short to medium term. Navigating the Market: Implications of Bitcoin Season for Altcoins and Your Strategy If you are primarily invested in altcoins, the current Bitcoin Season can present challenges. Many altcoins may struggle to gain significant traction against Bitcoin, or even against the US dollar, while Bitcoin continues to perform relatively well. However, it also presents opportunities for a savvy crypto trading strategy . Challenges for Altcoin Holders: Underperformance: Your altcoin portfolio may underperform Bitcoin, leading to frustration. Increased Volatility: Altcoins can be more susceptible to sharp downturns when Bitcoin dips, often falling harder than BTC. Stagnation: Some altcoins might trade sideways or even decline while Bitcoin makes upward moves. Opportunities and Actionable Insights: Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be a good time to accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Focus on Bitcoin: Consider increasing your allocation to Bitcoin or focusing trading efforts on BTC pairs if you anticipate its dominance to continue. Research: Use this period to research projects with strong fundamentals that might lead the next altcoin rally. Risk Management: Given the increased risk for altcoins relative to Bitcoin, tight stop-losses and careful position sizing are essential. Consider Stablecoins: If uncertain, moving some capital into stablecoins is a valid strategy during periods of market uncertainty or strong Bitcoin dominance. Look for Outliers: Even during Bitcoin Season, some altcoins will still outperform. These are often driven by specific news, developments, or unique narratives. Identifying these requires diligent research. Understanding the difference between altcoin vs bitcoin performance is key. During Bitcoin Season, the correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin remains high, but the beta (the degree to which altcoins move relative to Bitcoin) often favors Bitcoin. When Might the Shift Occur? From Bitcoin Season Back to Altcoin Season Market cycles are fluid, and Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever. The transition back to Altcoin Season typically happens when certain conditions emerge: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a significant run-up, Bitcoin’s price might enter a period of consolidation. This allows capital that profited from the BTC rally to potentially rotate into altcoins seeking higher returns. Increased Risk Appetite: As market confidence grows, investors become more willing to take on the higher risk associated with altcoins in pursuit of larger gains. Major Altcoin Developments: Significant upgrades, launches, or positive news within major altcoin ecosystems (like Ethereum’s developments, Layer 2 growth, specific sector trends like DeFi, NFTs, AI coins) can attract significant capital. Narrative Shifts: New, compelling narratives can emerge around specific altcoin sectors or technologies, driving focused rallies. Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained period where Bitcoin’s market dominance starts to decline is a strong indicator that altcoins are beginning to outperform. There’s no fixed timeline for how long Bitcoin Season lasts. It could be weeks, months, or even longer. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index itself, along with Bitcoin dominance charts and overall market sentiment, helps identify potential shifts. Challenges and Limitations of the Altcoin Season Index While the Altcoin Season Index is a useful tool, it’s important to be aware of its limitations: Historical Data: The index is based on past performance (the last 90 days). The market can change rapidly, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Top 100 Focus: It only considers the top 100 coins. Many innovative or high-performing projects exist outside this list. Excludes Stablecoins/Wrapped Tokens: While necessary for its purpose, it doesn’t reflect the full breadth of the crypto market. Lagging Indicator: The 90-day lookback means it confirms a trend that has already been underway rather than predicting future movements. Doesn’t Differentiate Altcoins: The index treats all altcoins equally. Performance varies significantly between large-cap altcoins (like Ethereum) and small-cap altcoins. Therefore, the index should be used as one of many tools in your analysis, not the sole basis for your crypto trading strategy . Combine it with technical analysis, fundamental analysis of specific projects, and broader market sentiment. Comparing Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Here’s a quick comparison of the typical characteristics of each season: Characteristic Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Altcoin Season Index 25 or lower 75 or higher Bitcoin Performance Strong, often leading the market Consolidating or lagging behind altcoins Altcoin Performance Generally underperforming Bitcoin; some outliers Strong, often posting higher percentage gains than Bitcoin Market Dominance Bitcoin dominance tends to increase or stay high Bitcoin dominance tends to decrease Capital Flow Flows primarily into Bitcoin Flows from Bitcoin (or stablecoins) into altcoins Risk Appetite Lower; focus on ‘safer’ Bitcoin Higher; willingness to invest in more speculative altcoins Recognizing which season the market is in helps set realistic expectations for your portfolio’s performance and guides your approach to managing risk. Summary: Adapting to the Current Bitcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 25, clearly indicating that the crypto market is in Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin has been the dominant performer over the past 90 days, with most altcoins struggling to keep pace. This phase is often driven by factors like increased institutional interest, safe-haven demand, or capital rotation dynamics. For investors, this period highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between altcoin vs bitcoin performance. While it presents challenges for altcoin-heavy portfolios, it also offers opportunities for strategic accumulation, focusing on Bitcoin, and refining your crypto trading strategy . Remember that market conditions are constantly evolving, and while the index signals the current state, staying informed about broader crypto market trends and project-specific developments is vital for long-term success. Use the index as a guide, but always conduct your own research and manage your risk prudently.

His support helped close a $2.2 million convertible loan round , with the remaining $700,000 coming from other strategic backers. Health Tech Meets Bitcoin: A Surprising Treasury Shift On May 22, H100 Group confirmed the purchase of 4.39 BTC using excess liquidity , signaling a strategic pivot amidst financial pressures. In 2024, H100 reported a 38% revenue drop and a loss of 9.77 million SEK , prompting it to explore new avenues for financial resilience . But this move isn’t just about diversifying reserves. According to CEO Sander Andersen, Bitcoin aligns with H100’s mission of individual sovereignty, decentralization, and transparency —the same principles that drive its AI-powered digital health ecosystem. “Bitcoin is not just a hedge—it’s a cultural and strategic fit,” said Andersen. A Ripple Effect Beyond Tech Inspired by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, non-tech companies around the world are waking up to Bitcoin . From Latin America to Europe, BTC is making its way into diverse corporate treasuries. H100’s adoption shows the movement is expanding into sectors like healthcare , where Bitcoin’s core values deeply resonate. Currently, only 4.4% of Bitcoin’s supply is held by companies . But with figures like Adam Back stepping in, that number may rise fast. After the BTC announcement, H100’s stock jumped 37% , and another 5.33% the next day—despite still being 35% below its yearly high. What This Means for the Future Adam Back’s endorsement could signal a turning point in corporate Bitcoin adoption , especially outside the U.S. H100’s dual focus— digital healthcare and Bitcoin integration —is attracting attention from both investors and industry observers. It may well become a model for how mission-driven companies can blend technology, finance, and values into one strategy.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 05:51:23

ACEA data show that overall car sales in Europe dipped 0.3% year-on-year. Electric and plug-in hybrid models posted the strongest growth, helping to balance losses elsewhere. Tesla’s continuing slide in Europe reflects a shift away from the U.S. EV maker as competition from Chinese brands gains strength. Some buyers are also pushing back against Elon Musk’s political views. According to a Reuters report , European automakers are under pressure to lower local costs and face headwinds from U.S. tariffs on imports and a slowing global economy. The resulting uncertainty clouds the industry’s outlook despite easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. April registrations in the European Union, Britain, and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) fell to 1.07 million cars, after a 2.8% gain in March. Sales at state-owned SAIC Motor climbed 24.5%, while Mitsubishi rose 22.1% and Mazda fell 24.5%. Tesla’s deliveries in Europe have now dropped for four months straight, down 49% year-on-year, and its market share has nearly halved to 0.7% from 1.3%. EU car sales drop for fourth straight month Looking at the EU alone, total car sales fell 1.2% year-on-year, marking a fourth straight month of decline. Within that figure, registrations of battery electric vehicles (BEV) jumped 26.4%, plug-in hybrids (PHEV) gained 7.8%, and hybrid electrics (HEV) rose 20.8%. In April, electrified models accounted for 59.2% of all passenger car registrations, up from 47.7% a year earlier. Among major EU markets, Spain saw a 7.1% rise in sales and Italy 2.7%, while France and Germany recorded drops of 5.6% and 0.2% respectively. Europeans are buying more electric cars because of strict emissions rules and lower prices, even as trade tensions, slow overall sales, and possible factory closures threaten jobs.

In 2023, he said a sweeping political shift in Washington, DC, would be necessary to enact pro-industry legislation. That shift appeared to materialize following Donald Trump’s presidential victory last November. However, shortly after the election, Giancarlo quashed rumors that he would succeed outgoing Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. He also shot down reports that he was interested in a crypto-related role at the US Treasury.

In the United States, Bitcoin ETFs are on track for a record-breaking month , drawing $1.5 billion in inflows over just two days. On the regulatory front, the Senate passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. If enacted into law, the bill could further accelerate institutional adoption , according to DWF Labs managing partner Andrei Grachev. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rally to all-time highs has created a positive feedback loop where more institutions view BTC as a mature asset worthy of inclusion in modern portfolios, according to a recent report by Fidelity Digital Assets . Crypto also shows positive growth in places Sygnum is active, like Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. However, Sygnum’s CEO, Matthias Imbach, recently warned that the company’s native Switzerland may lose its competitive advantage as a crypto destination if it fails to keep innovating.

Meanwhile, analysts tracking on-chain activity suggest that the recent price pullback may have cleared the path for more sustainable market behavior. Related Reading: $200,000 Bitcoin ‘Is Real’ By Year-End, Says Top Researcher High Leverage Triggers Liquidations Below Key Support Levels Amr Taha, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlighted how Bitcoin’s price action flushed out over-leveraged traders while presenting an opportunity for long-term investors to reinforce their positions. His post titled “Late Longs Wiped Out — Long-Term Holders Seize the Opportunity to Accumulate Bitcoin” points to distinct market behavior unfolding in real time. Taha noted that Bitcoin’s recent drop below the psychological $111,000 threshold led to two significant long liquidation clusters on Binance. The first wave occurred around the $110,900 mark, wiping out over $97 million in long positions. Shortly after, a second wave hit as the price breached $109,000, resulting in a further $88 million in liquidated positions. These back-to-back events reflected cascading margin calls from traders using high leverage, a pattern often seen during sharp short-term corrections. Notably, liquidation clusters tend to emerge when rapid price movements force the automatic closure of margin positions, intensifying sell pressure in the process. This volatility tends to shake out speculative positions and can signal a temporary pause or consolidation phase in the broader trend. According to Taha, while the market absorbed these liquidations, it simultaneously witnessed a contrasting pattern among long-term holders (LTHs), who remained active throughout the volatility. Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Liquidations Unfold While short-term participants absorbed the brunt of the sell-off, LTHs appeared to interpret the price dip as a buying opportunity. Taha highlighted on-chain metrics showing that the LTH realized cap, a measure of the total value paid for held coins by long-term investors, has surged past $28 billion. This level had not been observed since April, reinforcing the narrative that seasoned market participants are increasing their exposure during moments of market dislocation. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going The behavior of long-term holders is often seen as a barometer for market health. Their steady accumulation during liquidation events suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value trajectory. Historically, accumulation by LTHs during volatile periods has coincided with later upward price expansions, as coins are removed from circulation and selling pressure is reduced. With leveraged positions reset and structural accumulation underway, the groundwork may be forming for Bitcoin to attempt another breakout beyond its previous highs.

The Indian crypto industry is actively engaging with the government, hoping to secure crucial tax relief that could redefine the future of cryptocurrency trading in the nation. Why is the Indian Crypto Industry Lobbying for Change? For a few years now, the crypto sector in India has operated under a stringent tax regime implemented in 2022. This policy included a flat 30% tax on capital gains from crypto assets and a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on every single transaction, regardless of profit or loss. The intention behind these measures was reportedly to deter illicit activities and bring clarity to the nascent sector. However, the industry quickly felt the pinch. The high tax burden, particularly the 1% TDS, made frequent trading significantly more expensive. This led to a dramatic exodus of trading volume from Indian exchanges to offshore platforms. Research by the Esya Centre highlighted this challenge, estimating that over 90% of Indian crypto trades migrated away. This outflow meant reduced revenue for Indian businesses, fewer opportunities for local innovation, and potentially less visibility for regulators into actual trading activity. What are the Proposed Changes to India Crypto Tax ? Industry leaders are not asking for a complete removal of taxes but rather a more balanced approach. A key proposal is to significantly reduce the Transaction Tax (TDS) from 1% to a much lower rate, perhaps 0.1%. Executives like Ashish Singhal, co-founder of the prominent Indian exchange CoinSwitch India , argue that a 0.1% TDS would still serve the government’s goal of tracking transactions effectively without placing an excessive burden on traders. A lower rate could incentivize users to return to regulated Indian platforms, providing regulators with better oversight. Is the Government’s Stance on Crypto Regulation India Softening? Reports suggest that there is indeed a more favorable environment emerging for dialogue between the government and the crypto sector. Industry executives have noted increased willingness from regulators to engage and understand the nuances of the digital asset space. This contrasts with previous periods where the official stance appeared more cautious or even skeptical. Several factors might be contributing to this potential shift: Global Trends: Many major economies are moving towards clearer regulatory frameworks rather than outright bans or punitive taxes. India might be observing these international developments. Industry Dialogue: Persistent engagement and education efforts by the Indian crypto industry seem to be bearing fruit, fostering better understanding among policymakers. Changing Geopolitical Landscape: Some reports suggest that the pro-crypto stance of global leaders, such as former U.S. President Donald Trump (mentioned in the original report), could indirectly influence perceptions and approaches internationally, including in India. While no concrete policy changes have been announced, the fact that regulators are reportedly engaging more closely with industry representatives like those from CoinSwitch India is seen as a positive sign. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Tax India ? The ongoing lobbying efforts represent a critical juncture for the Indian crypto market. A reduction in the transaction tax could have several positive outcomes: Bring Trading Back: A lower TDS could encourage traders who moved offshore to return to Indian exchanges, boosting liquidity and volume on regulated platforms. Boost Innovation: Increased activity and clearer rules could foster innovation within the domestic crypto and blockchain ecosystem. Increase Government Revenue: While the TDS rate would be lower, a higher volume of transactions on regulated platforms could potentially lead to greater overall tax collection from other sources like capital gains (though the 30% CGT remains a point of discussion). Improved Regulatory Oversight: Having trading activity concentrated on domestic, regulated exchanges provides regulators with better tools for monitoring and preventing illicit activities. The challenges remain significant. The government needs to balance the industry’s demands with its concerns about financial stability, investor protection, and preventing misuse of digital assets. However, the reported shift towards more open dialogue offers hope for a more balanced and pragmatic approach to crypto regulation India . Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for India’s Crypto Future The push by the Indian crypto industry for tax relief is gaining momentum, coinciding with what appears to be a more receptive government ear. The current high taxes, particularly the 1% TDS, have undeniably hindered domestic trading activity, pushing it towards less regulated offshore markets. Industry proposals, such as reducing the TDS to 0.1%, aim to strike a balance between effective tracking and fostering a healthy domestic market. While the path forward involves complex discussions around India crypto tax and broader crypto regulation India , the increased engagement between regulators and platforms like CoinSwitch India signals a potential turning point. Stakeholders across the board are watching closely, hoping that these dialogues will pave the way for policies that unlock the full potential of the digital asset space in India while addressing regulatory concerns.

Meanwhile, other firms are embracing Bitcoin. Paris-based Blockchain Group raised $72 million to buy 590 BTC, and plans to control 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2032. Similarly, Strategy—the largest corporate Bitcoin holder—added 4,020 BTC to its portfolio for $427.1 million, pushing its total stash to 580,250 BTC. However, executive stock sales and a securities fraud lawsuit weighed on Strategy’s share price. Trump Media Rejects Bitcoin Buying Rumors Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, denied reports that it is preparing to raise $3 billion to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The denial came in response to a May 26 article by the Financial Times, which referred to six sources who are familiar with the matter. Trump Media criticized the report by stating, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.” According to the Financial Times, Trump Media was allegedly planning to raise $2 billion through an equity offering and an additional $1 billion via convertible bonds—which are securities that can be converted into equity at a later stage. The proposed equity issuance was said to be pegged to the market price as of May 23, when shares of Trump Media (DJT) closed at $25.72, pushing the company’s market cap to $5.7 billion after a 4.6% daily increase. Trump Media share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) If the company actually followed through, the move would have made Trump Media part of the many other publicly traded firms like Strategy, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific that started accumulating Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset. These companies argue that crypto holdings serve as a hedge against inflation and a safeguard against becoming financially stagnant or obsolete. The rumour spread during a growing scrutiny over the Trump family's expanding involvement in the crypto space. Over the past few weeks, Democratic lawmakers raised concerns over what they view as potential conflicts of interest, particularly after Trump hosted a controversial “meme coin dinner” on May 22 that attracted a lot of media attention and protest. Trump’s crypto footprint includes various initiatives like non-fungible token (NFT) collections, the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins, a DeFi project called World Liberty Financial, and a dollar-pegged stablecoin. (Source: Bluesky ) Adding to the complexity, Trump reportedly transferred his 53% ownership in Trump Media to a revocable trust managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr., which raised even more questions about potential financial entanglements after Trump returned to office. Blockchain Group Raises $72M to Buy More Bitcoin While Trump Media made it very clear that it has no interest in buying crypto, the same cannot be said for other companies. Paris-based crypto firm Blockchain Group is expanding its Bitcoin treasury with a new €63.3 million ($72 million) bond sale, to purchase an additional 590 BTC. The announcement was made on May 26, and shared details about the firm’s goal of growing its Bitcoin reserves to 1,437 BTC. At current Bitcoin prices above $109,000, the funds raised could theoretically buy around 658 BTC, though only 95% of the proceeds are earmarked for Bitcoin purchases. The remainder is allocated to management fees and operational costs. The bulk of the bond sale was backed by Fulgur Ventures, which invested €55.3 million ($62.9 million), while Moonlight Capital added another €5 million ($5.7 million). The bonds are structured to be convertible into Blockchain Group shares at €3.809 ($4.34) each. Listed under the ticker ALTBG on Euronext Paris, Europe’s second-largest stock exchange, Blockchain Group has gained a lot of attention since it began acquiring Bitcoin on Nov. 5. After its initial Bitcoin purchase, the stock surged 225% to €0.48 ($0.52) and has soared by 766% year-to-date despite a 5.5% drop on May 26. According to its April 30 financial disclosure , the Blockchain Group reported a yield of over 709% from its Bitcoin holdings. However, the company’s total revenue for the 2024 fiscal year came in at €13.86 million ($15.8 million), which was down 32.1% from €20.4 million ($23.2 million) the year before. The firm also revealed an ambitious long-term objective of buying 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply by 2032, which would equate to more than 170,000 BTC. The Blockchain Group also joined the growing list of companies adopting a Bitcoin-focused treasury strategy. Swedish health tech firm H100 Group AB announced its own Bitcoin pivot on May 22, while Strive Asset Management declared on May 7 that it would also become a Bitcoin treasury company. Strategy Buys 4,020 More Bitcoin Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, also continued its aggressive accumulation strategy with a new purchase of 4,020 BTC for $427.1 million between May 19 and May 23. The company revealed the acquisition on May 26, and pointed out that the latest purchase was made at an average price of $106,237 per coin. This buy coincided with Bitcoin’s sharp rally past $110,000 on May 22. With this addition, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at a staggering 580,250 BTC, which was bought at a cumulative cost of approximately $40.6 billion. The average purchase price for its entire position sits at $69,979 per coin. Despite the bullish accumulation, internal stock sales by company executives have attracted some attention. Jarrod Patten, a director at Strategy, sold 2,650 shares of the company’s Class A stock between May 16 and 21, netting nearly $1.1 million. Since April 22, Patten sold 17,050 shares worth about $6.7 million in total. Meanwhile, Strategy CFO Andrew Kang sold 2,185 shares on May 23, generating proceeds of $719,447. These executive stock sales happened at a time when Strategy’s own shares ( MSTR ) faced sharp declines. After peaking at an all-time high of around $474 in November of 2024, MSTR dropped roughly 12% over the past week, trading down from approximately $420 to $369. Strategy stock price over the past 5 days (Source: TradingView ) The stock decline followed the filing of a class-action lawsuit on May 19, which accuses Strategy of securities fraud. The suit claims that the company misrepresented aspects of its Bitcoin investments, which allegedly led to investor losses in April of 2025.

This increase is largely attributed to a sudden tariff announcement by former President Donald Trump , which instigated concerns about a potential trade war, thus driving investors towards the relative safety of cryptocurrencies. Why Bitcoin Is Considered a Safe Haven The resilience of Bitcoin during times of economic uncertainty is not new. Historical precedents show its price resilience in face of geopolitical tensions, reflecting its role as a macroeconomic hedge. This inherent stability makes Bitcoin a preferred choice among investors during times of financial unpredictability.

Crypto YouTuber Lark Davis was among those who observed that “don’t really do anything” while Bitcoin hits a peak, retreats, and recovers. “That’s the state of the crypto market right now,” he said on X on May 26. It is true, the majority of altcoins are still way down from their peak prices during the last bull market in 2021, so when is altseason coming ? Altseason Coming Soon … Really The majority of analysts and crypto traders share the opinion that it won’t be long, looking at current market conditions. On May 27, Bitcoin OG Kyle Chassé said this altseason will be “epic,” but it won’t be like previous altseasons because there are just too many tokens for everything to go up. Coingecko currently lists more than 17,000 tokens, and CoinMarketCap has a whopping 16 million crypto tokens tracked . However, the vast majority of these are worthless meme coins on Solana and Base.

Some have disagreed, saying that nobody is interested in altcoins anymore. However, the trader replied that “institutions are coming for them,” especially those with real utility.

It hit its highest level since January 2021 on May 7 at 65.4% but has declined marginally since. Nevertheless, the metric has been in a clear uptrend since the beginning of 2023. Altcoins Not Ready to Pop Yet Crypto trader “Moustache” echoed the sentiment, stating that altcoins are “on the verge of a parabolic rally like in 2017 or 2021,” as chart patterns show major similarities from previous market cycles. #Altcoins Imagine you’re only in the early stages of an altseason.

The World Robot Competition Mecha Fighting Series had four human-controlled robots built by China-based firm Unitree compete in three, two-minute rounds with winners crowned through a points system, according to a May 26 report from the China state-owned outlet the Global Times. Chen Xiyun, a Unitree team member, said the “robots fight in a human-machine collaborative way,” with the machines pre-taught moves, but ultimately, a person controls the bot’s movements. The robots reportedly weighed 35 kilograms and stood 132 centimeters tall. Ahead of the boxing rounds, the pint-sized robots were put through tests to demonstrate a variety of kicks and punches and assist the organizers in refining the rules. The team with the highest points across the three rounds moves on to fight another opponent. A punch to the head was worth one point, and a kick to the head was worth three. Teams lost five points if their robot fell and 10 points if their robot was down for over eight seconds.

Among the contenders are Dogecoin (DOGE), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Mantix (MTX). Each offers unique advantages and challenges in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Understanding Dogecoin’s Position in the Market Dogecoin has maintained a cult status among meme coins, backed by a strong community. Yet, its recent price trends suggest a roller-coaster ride. According to recent price movements , Dogecoin's value has fluctuated between $0.211 and $0.259 over the past fortnight, indicating volatility that might not favor long-term gains unless influenced by major market movers like celebrity endorsements. Hyperliquid: The Rising Star in DeFi The DeFi sector is witnessing significant innovation, and Hyperliquid is at the forefront. With a focus on high-speed transactions and low fees, this platform has caught the attention of both users and investors. It has been reported that Hyperliquid's trading volume is soaring, potentially setting the stage for substantial short-term profits. However, with stiff competition in the DeFi market, it's uncertain how much room there is for growth. The Promise of Mantix: A Comprehensive Analysis Mantix is emerging as a formidable contender in the realm of decentralized exchanges. This platform distinguishes itself with features like AI-driven trading and a robust tokenomics structure promising scalable growth. Currently, in the initial phase of its presale, Mantix offers its tokens at just $0.02, a fact that might intrigue savvy investors about its future potential. Discover more about Mantix and its offerings on their official website . Investment Outlook: Which Cryptocurrency to Bet On? With Dogecoin's popularity, Hyperliquid's innovative approach, and Mantix's strategic market entry, investors are faced with varied options. While Dogecoin offers familiarity, Hyperliquid promises growth, and Mantix teases the possibility of high returns from a low entry point—making the decision all the more challenging.

As some established names like Solana (SOL) and Bittensor (TAO) face challenging times, a new player, Mantix, is making headlines with its promising entry into the market. The Current State of Solana and TAO Recently, Solana's market performance has been less than stellar. The cryptocurrency has seen its value decrease by nearly 8% in the past week, now trading around $177, which is below the previously breached $180 resistance mark. The technical analysis of Solana shows it trading beneath the Ichimoku cloud, indicating potential continued price weakness. The presence of a red and wide cloud suggests that the bearish trend might extend in the near future. Insights into TAO's Market Dynamics Moving to Bittensor (TAO), this crypto asset hasn't fared much better. Its price has dropped by about 10% recently, pushing it to around $442. This decline has taken TAO much closer to its $400 psychological support level. Despite the bearish market signals, some investors remain optimistic about TAO's future, though the weakening RSI divergence points towards a potential near-term price decline. Mantix: A New Contender in DeFi Amid these turbulent conditions, Mantix is emerging as a beacon for crypto investors. Stepping boldly into the DeFi sector, Mantix offers promising features such as cross-chain swaps, futures with up to 1000x leverage, and profit-sharing for token holders. Since the launch of its presale, Mantix has successfully raised over $600,000, with tokens priced at just $0.02. Its quick acceptance and integration within the Ethereum platform ensure high liquidity and swift transaction capabilities, which have been crucial in attracting an early following. Apart from its promising financial structure, Mantix is also commendable for its secure foundation. The project boasts an audited contract , ensuring safety and reliability for its investors. Comparative Analysis and Future Outlook While Solana and TAO are currently navigating through bearish trends, Mantix’s innovative approach and robust technological backing could potentially lead it to outperform these established players. If Mantix continues to develop its platform and maintain security standards, it might just redefine the DeFi landscape, offering substantial returns to its early adopters.

This move is crucial for the network’s evolution and signals upcoming enhancements that could redefine user and developer experiences on the platform. What is the Maxwell Hard Fork for BNB Chain? Before diving into the specifics of the Maxwell upgrade, let’s quickly touch upon what a hard fork entails in the context of a blockchain. A hard fork is essentially a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, or vice versa. It requires all users and nodes to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software. If a hard fork is not adopted by all participants, it can lead to a split in the blockchain, creating two separate chains. The Maxwell hard fork represents a planned and coordinated upgrade for the BNB Chain. Its primary goal is to introduce several technical improvements aimed at optimizing network performance and preparing it for future growth and increased adoption. Unlike contentious hard forks, this type of upgrade is designed to improve the existing chain collaboratively. Why is Testnet Activation a Crucial Step? The activation of the Maxwell hard fork didn’t happen directly on the main BNB Chain that millions of users interact with daily. Instead, it was first deployed on the network’s testnet. The Testnet activation phase is an absolutely critical step in the blockchain development lifecycle for several vital reasons: Risk Mitigation: Testnets are isolated environments that mimic the main network but use valueless tokens. This allows developers to deploy and test significant protocol changes like a hard fork without risking real user funds or disrupting live applications. Bug Identification: Complex software upgrades almost always have unforeseen issues. The testnet provides a safe space to identify and fix bugs, vulnerabilities, or performance bottlenecks before they can impact the main network. Community Readiness: Testnet deployment gives node operators, validators, developers building on the chain, and other ecosystem participants time to prepare for the mainnet upgrade. They can test their software, infrastructure, and applications against the new protocol rules. Performance Validation: It allows the core development team and the community to validate whether the intended improvements, such as reduced block times or enhanced scalability, actually work as expected under realistic simulated load conditions. Successfully deploying and running the Maxwell hard fork on the testnet is a strong indicator that the upgrade is stable and ready for the next phase – a potential mainnet deployment. Unpacking the Key Improvements of Maxwell According to reports, the Maxwell hard fork brings several significant technical enhancements to the BNB Chain. These improvements are designed to make the network faster, more efficient, and better equipped to handle a higher volume of transactions and decentralized applications (dApps). Let’s break down the key upgrades: Faster Block Time: Targeting 0.75 Seconds One of the most impactful changes introduced by Maxwell is the reduction in Block time . Block time refers to the average time it takes for the network to generate a new block of validated transactions and add it to the blockchain. A shorter block time generally means faster transaction confirmation times. The stated goal of reducing the block time to 0.75 seconds is a significant step. For context, the current average block time on BNB Smart Chain (BSC), a key part of the BNB Chain ecosystem, is typically around 3 seconds. Reducing this to 0.75 seconds would represent a roughly 75% decrease in the time it takes to produce a new block. This has direct implications for the speed at which transactions are processed and confirmed on the network, leading to a more responsive user experience for dApps, DeFi protocols, and everyday transfers. Support for Producing 16 Consecutive Blocks Another notable improvement is the enhanced capability for validators to produce up to 16 consecutive blocks. In many blockchain protocols, validators (or miners) take turns proposing and validating blocks. Limiting the number of consecutive blocks a single validator can produce is often a measure to promote decentralization and prevent potential malicious behavior. Allowing validators on the BNB Chain to produce more consecutive blocks, specifically up to 16, can contribute to increased transaction throughput and potentially smoother block production, especially during periods of high network activity. This change, combined with the reduced block time, aims to optimize the flow of transactions through the network. Enhanced Network Scalability Ultimately, the combination of faster block times and the ability to produce more consecutive blocks points towards the overarching goal of enhanced Scalability . Scalability is a critical challenge for many blockchain networks, referring to their ability to handle a growing number of transactions and users without sacrificing performance or increasing fees prohibitively. By making the block production process faster and more efficient, the Maxwell hard fork aims to increase the overall transaction processing capacity of the BNB Chain. This is essential for supporting the increasing demand from existing dApps, attracting new projects, and accommodating a larger user base. Improved scalability means the network can potentially handle more transactions per second, reduce congestion, and keep transaction costs (gas fees) relatively low, even as network usage grows. Here’s a quick summary of the key improvements: Reduced Block Time: From ~3 seconds to target 0.75 seconds. Consecutive Blocks: Support for up to 16 consecutive blocks per validator. Overall Goal: Enhanced network scalability and throughput. What Do These Changes Mean for BNB Chain Users and Developers? While these improvements sound technical, they translate into tangible benefits for those interacting with the BNB Chain: Faster Transactions: Users will likely experience quicker confirmation times for transfers, swaps on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and interactions with dApps. Improved dApp Performance: Applications built on BNB Chain, especially those requiring frequent interactions, should feel more responsive. Lower Potential Congestion: Increased scalability helps the network better handle traffic spikes, potentially reducing instances of high fees or delayed transactions during peak times. More Headroom for Growth: The enhanced capacity makes the BNB Chain a more attractive platform for developers looking to build high-throughput applications, fostering ecosystem growth. For developers, the improved infrastructure means a more robust and efficient environment to deploy and scale their applications. This can lead to better user experiences within their dApps and potentially lower operational costs related to network interactions. The Road Ahead: From Testnet to Mainnet The successful Testnet activation of the Maxwell hard fork is a major milestone, but it’s not the final step. The next phase involves rigorous testing and monitoring on the testnet to ensure stability and identify any remaining issues. The BNB Chain core development team will gather feedback and data from the testnet environment. If the testnet phase proves successful and the upgrade is deemed stable and safe, the community will likely prepare for a mainnet hard fork activation. This process involves coordinating all network participants – including validators, exchanges, wallets, and dApp providers – to upgrade their software simultaneously by a specific block height. The transition from testnet to mainnet is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning and execution. However, the successful testnet deployment indicates strong progress towards bringing these valuable improvements to the live BNB Chain network. Conclusion: A Leap Forward for BNB Chain Scalability The activation of the Maxwell hard fork on the BNB Chain testnet marks a crucial step in the network’s continuous evolution. By focusing on reducing Block time to an ambitious 0.75 seconds and enhancing the validator’s ability to produce consecutive blocks, the upgrade directly addresses the vital need for increased Scalability in the blockchain space. This successful Testnet activation phase is essential for proving the stability and effectiveness of these changes before they are potentially rolled out to the main network. The Maxwell hard fork holds the promise of delivering a faster, more efficient, and more robust platform for users and developers alike, positioning BNB Chain for continued growth and adoption in the competitive decentralized landscape.

XRP, Solana, and Hyperliquid are making waves again, and there’s solid reason to believe this may be the start of something bigger. According to Altcoin Buzz analyst Maddie , from the YouTube channel Altcoin Buzz, whale activity is often a strong signal ahead of a breakout. In this roundup, we dive into three altcoins—XRP, Solana, and Hyperliquid, which are seeing major whale activity, and explore why these tokens are catching big players’ attention. XRP and Solana: Steady Movers in the Top 10 XRP and Solana are both ranked in the top 10 cryptos by market cap. XRP currently holds around $92 billion, while Solana leads with $137 billion. Since the start of 2025, XRP has gained about 12% , but Solana is still down over 7%. However, looking at the last 90 days, Solana has made a strong comeback with a 25% rise, while XRP has only gained around 1.5%. Recent whale moves suggest growing interest in both tokens. Over $500 million worth of XRP has been moved across exchanges. This comes as Ripple works on a potential $11 billion deal to acquire Circle , the USDC issuer. If successful, it could make Ripple a major player in the stablecoin game. 639,887 #SOL (108,640,417 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/1IiG27Ypap — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 21, 2025 Meanwhile, Solana is gaining traction after its recent “Accelerate” event. Nearly $485 million worth of SOL was moved by whales, showing confidence in the chain’s growing DeFi and Real-World Asset (RWA) use cases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Ethereum and XRP Price Prediction For This Week: Is Another Rally Coming? , Hyperliquid (HYPE): New Highs and Strong Momentum Hyperliquid is another altcoin that’s turning heads. The token just hit a new all-time high of $39.80 after a 12% weekend rally. It’s now in price discovery mode, but with RSI at 86, some traders are being cautious of a possible pullback. Still, whales are stacking. Five large wallets scooped up nearly $28 million worth of HYPE recently, suggesting that many are betting on a $50–$100 range in the near future. Interestingly, HYPE whales are finally taking profits after 5 months. They started selling off 395k tokens at $36.69, making $14.51M so far. That’s a $28.4M profit on initial investment. Trust Wallet: More Than Just a Wallet Interestingly, whales are also using Trust Wallet as a smart yield tool. It’s new “Stablecoin Earn” feature offers up to 7% APY on coins like USDT, USDC, and DAI across multiple blockchains. With over $20 million in TVL already, it’s becoming a key tool for whales looking to earn passive income while waiting for the next big move. From large-cap names like XRP and Solana to rising stars like Hyperliquid, whales are quietly positioning themselves. For investors watching closely, this might just be a hint at which altcoins are gearing up for a breakout. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It’s no news that cryptocurrency investors are always searching for high-potential altcoins to buy. And $MTX is turning investors’ heads, making them consider their investment decisions in SUI and AVAX. Although Sui (SUI) and Avalanche (AVAX) were once top investment choices, the tokens seem to have run out of momentum. With no major upgrades, enthusiasm or utility, SUI and AVAX’s outlook is bearish. BanklessTimes , a crypto update platform, predicted a bearish outlook for the Avalanche price: “Avalanche price has remained in a technical bear market after crashing by over 30% from its highest level in December. The AVAX token crashed to $36 as other cryptocurrencies plunged. The outlook isn’t looking good.” So why is Mantix making investors excited? A Revolutionary Dex Unlike typical decentralised exchanges, Mantix offers a clear vision and ready-to-deploy utility. It offers every utility a trader can ever dream of: cross-chain swaps, bridge, deep liquidity and stake across different blockchain networks all at a low fee. It also offers up to 1000x leverage for futures traders, a feature typically reserved for centralised platforms like Binance or BitMEX, but now fully decentralised. Revenue-sharing and governance perks Mantix isn’t just a regular Dex; it’s built on transparency and decentralised governance, prioritising its community. Mantix’s native token, $MTX, functions beyond a trading token; it’s a utility and governance asset. Presale buyers and early holders will benefit from a revenue-sharing model they will earn passively by holding a token and participating on the platform. This is a fantastic offer to Sui (SUI) and Avalanche (AVAX) investors, who are used to staking and participating in risky liquidity pools before earning. Mantix is built on decentralised governance, holders can vote and participate in decisions about the platform’s future upgrades and direction. The bigger your $MTX bag, the greater your voting power. Mantix is transparent and there’s no risk of whales manipulating the $MTX price or making decisions in the dark. Scarcity, burns and long-term sustainability The Mantix presale is pegged at a fixed supply of 1.2 billion tokens. With a $10 million soft cap and a $30 million hard cap, the ICO is designed for long-term sustainability. Furthermore, Mantix’s token burn mechanisms and buybacks from trading revenues will help control supply, which will cause scarcity over time and increase the token price. $MTX is clearly a better option than SUI and AVAX. You are still early. Join the $MTX presale now at $0.02 before the 100x surge!

As some established names like Solana (SOL) and Bittensor (TAO) face challenging times, a new player, Mantix, is making headlines with its promising entry into the market. The Current State of Solana and TAO Recently, Solana's market performance has been less than stellar. The cryptocurrency has seen its value decrease by nearly 8% in the past week, now trading around $177, which is below the previously breached $180 resistance mark. The technical analysis of Solana shows it trading beneath the Ichimoku cloud, indicating potential continued price weakness. The presence of a red and wide cloud suggests that the bearish trend might extend in the near future. Insights into TAO's Market Dynamics Moving to Bittensor (TAO), this crypto asset hasn't fared much better. Its price has dropped by about 10% recently, pushing it to around $442. This decline has taken TAO much closer to its $400 psychological support level. Despite the bearish market signals, some investors remain optimistic about TAO's future, though the weakening RSI divergence points towards a potential near-term price decline. Mantix: A New Contender in DeFi Amid these turbulent conditions, Mantix is emerging as a beacon for crypto investors. Stepping boldly into the DeFi sector, Mantix offers promising features such as cross-chain swaps, futures with up to 1000x leverage, and profit-sharing for token holders. Since the launch of its presale, Mantix has successfully raised over $600,000, with tokens priced at just $0.02. Its quick acceptance and integration within the Ethereum platform ensure high liquidity and swift transaction capabilities, which have been crucial in attracting an early following. Apart from its promising financial structure, Mantix is also commendable for its secure foundation. The project boasts an audited contract , ensuring safety and reliability for its investors. Comparative Analysis and Future Outlook While Solana and TAO are currently navigating through bearish trends, Mantix’s innovative approach and robust technological backing could potentially lead it to outperform these established players. If Mantix continues to develop its platform and maintain security standards, it might just redefine the DeFi landscape, offering substantial returns to its early adopters.

The upcoming expiry has nearly $14 billion in options set to impact the market, potentially introducing volatility that could shape Bitcoin's pricing. As Bitcoin navigates through these crucial times, a specific price point, $107,000, is predicted to form a resistance level. This anticipation has led to a shift in the investment pattern, where traders are diversifying their portfolios by exploring emerging platforms like Mantix , which promises innovative DeFi solutions. Anticipating Volatility: Bitcoin's Critical Week Ahead On the brink of the largest monthly options expiry of 2025, Bitcoin's price fluctuated around $108,000 on May 24. According to derivatives data from Laevitas.ch , with over $13.8 billion worth of Bitcoin options preparing to expire on May 30, traders and bulls are in a tug-of-war, pushing for a price position over $110,000. The market's current state shows bullish dominance, with Bitcoin's price increasing by 25% in the last 30 days. This surge has caught bearish traders off-guard, leading to a reevaluation of strategies across futures and options markets. Despite bullish efforts, the possibility of a downturn remains, prompting some investors to turn their sights towards newer and potentially more stable ventures like Mantix. The Rising Appeal of Mantix Among Crypto Traders Mantix is carving its niche in the decentralized trading market with features like 1000x leveraged futures and enhanced cross-chain exchanges. The platform's core, the $MTX token, extends governance rights and financial benefits, making it an attractive alternative amid uncertain Bitcoin forecasts. The governance model of Mantix not only fosters community involvement and trust but also propels the project's growth through strategic fee-based buybacks. This model contrasts sharply with Bitcoin, which is currently grappling with price consolidation and inherent volatility. With its promising framework and investor-friendly model, Mantix is poised to outshine traditional crypto entities, especially as Bitcoin encounters critical resistance at $107,000. Emphasizing the potential of Mantix and its early investment opportunities, the first stage of its presale is already underway, with tokens priced attractively at $0.02. This presents a lucrative opportunity for forward-thinking investors. Learn more about this burgeoning trading platform at Mantix .

Ever wondered how traditional finance might blend with the decentralized world you love? Well, buckle up, because the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is having some pretty significant conversations that could shape the future of finance, particularly concerning tokenized securities . Recently, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force sat down with major players like Nasdaq , alongside crypto innovators Plume Network and Etherealize. The hot topic? Exploring how public blockchains can become the backbone for issuing and trading securities that are represented as digital tokens. This isn’t just theoretical chat; these firms came prepared with concrete proposals. Understanding Tokenized Securities: What’s the Buzz? Before we dive into the details of the meeting, let’s quickly touch upon what tokenized securities actually are. Imagine traditional assets like stocks, bonds, or even real estate, but represented by digital tokens on a blockchain. This process, known as tokenization, aims to bring the benefits of blockchain technology – like increased efficiency, liquidity, transparency, and fractional ownership – to regulated financial markets. The potential is huge, but so are the regulatory questions. How do existing securities laws apply? How do you ensure investor protection in a decentralized environment? These are exactly the kinds of challenges the SEC and the industry are trying to navigate together. Pushing for a Regulatory Sandbox: Testing the Waters One key proposal that emerged from all three participants – Nasdaq , Plume Network, and Etherealize – was the idea of creating a regulatory sandbox . Think of a sandbox as a controlled environment where companies can test innovative financial products and services based on blockchain technology under slightly more flexible oversight from the regulator. Why a sandbox? Because the current regulatory framework, largely designed for traditional finance, doesn’t always fit neatly with the unique characteristics of blockchain and digital assets. A sandbox allows firms to experiment, demonstrate the technology’s capabilities and risks, and work closely with the SEC to figure out how best to apply or adapt regulations without immediately facing the full weight of complex rules. It’s a way to learn by doing, which is crucial for rapidly evolving tech like blockchain. Nasdaq’s Vision: An ATS-Digital Platform The world-renowned stock exchange operator, Nasdaq , wasn’t just there to listen; they presented their own ambitious plan. Nasdaq proposed launching a platform they’re calling “ATS-Digital.” An ATS, or Alternative Trading System, is essentially a venue for matching buyers and sellers of securities. Nasdaq’s vision is an ATS specifically designed to handle digital assets. This platform would allow firms to list not only digital asset investment contracts (which could include tokenized securities) but also potentially commodity-style tokens. This suggests a desire to create a regulated marketplace that bridges the gap between traditional securities and certain types of digital assets. To make this happen smoothly, Nasdaq also called for a joint safe harbor with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). A safe harbor would provide temporary relief from certain regulatory requirements, giving firms time to develop and operate while regulators figure out the long-term rules, especially important where asset classification (security vs. commodity) is ambiguous. Plume Network on Real-World Assets and Law Reform Plume Network brought the focus squarely onto real-world assets (RWAs). RWAs are physical or intangible assets that exist outside of the blockchain but are represented on-chain as tokens. Examples include real estate, art, company equity, credit, or even intellectual property. Plume highlighted that permissionless blockchains (like Ethereum or others where anyone can participate) are ideally suited for RWA tokenization due as they offer transparency and accessibility. Plume didn’t stop there. They went further, recommending significant updates to foundational U.S. securities laws – specifically the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Their argument is that these laws need to be modernized to effectively accommodate decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and promote what they called “credible neutrality” in regulation. Credible neutrality implies rules that are applied fairly and predictably, without favoring specific technologies or market participants. Etherealize’s Call for Blockchain as Shareholder Registry Rounding out the industry perspectives, Etherealize presented proposals focused on core corporate functions. They urged the SEC to formally recognize secure blockchains as official shareholder registries. Traditionally, tracking who owns shares in a company is done through centralized databases and intermediaries. Using a blockchain could potentially make this process more transparent, immutable, and efficient. Furthermore, Etherealize supported the use of smart contracts for automating corporate actions. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. For tokenized securities, smart contracts could automatically handle tasks like distributing dividends to token holders or facilitating shareholder voting, potentially reducing administrative overhead and increasing efficiency. The SEC’s Response and What Comes Next According to the report, the SEC is currently reviewing these various proposals. This engagement, initiated by the SEC’s own Crypto Task Force, signals a proactive (though cautious) approach from the regulator towards understanding and potentially integrating blockchain technology into traditional financial markets. It shows they are listening to industry concerns and exploring pathways forward, even if the path is complex and fraught with regulatory hurdles. While the creation of a full-fledged regulatory sandbox or significant law reform won’t happen overnight, these discussions are crucial first steps. They open the door for continued dialogue and potential future policy developments that could pave the way for the wider adoption of tokenized securities and real-world assets on the blockchain. The journey towards integrating blockchain into traditional finance is long and requires careful consideration of investor protection, market integrity, and systemic risk. However, the fact that major players like Nasdaq are engaging directly with the SEC on these topics, alongside innovative crypto firms, is a positive sign for the evolution of both industries. We’ll be keeping a close eye on how the SEC responds to these proposals and what steps are taken next in exploring the exciting potential of tokenized securities and real-world assets .

But what’s driving these big price changes? A new update from Glassnode, a leading blockchain data firm, helps explain. It shows how the two main types of buyers, long-term believers and first-time investors are play very different roles in the market. And yes, emotions are still a big part of the story, too. Why Conviction Buyers Matter at Turning Points Glassnode’s latest analysis looks at investor behavior using spending patterns on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ERC-20 tokens. According to the data, conviction buyers and first-time buyers play very different roles. Conviction buyers are long-term believers. They don’t get shaken during downturns. In fact, Glassnode shows that these buyers usually appear around market bottoms, when fear is at its highest. In bull markets, they help by buying the dips, preventing steep pullbacks, and adding support during minor corrections. Understanding who is behind price moves is critical to navigating market cycles. This new visualization, based on spending patterns, reveals how investor behavior shapes trend reversals and continuation – available across $BTC , $ETH , and #ERC20 tokens. For example: pic.twitter.com/sDsLQ0Cvml — glassnode (@glassnode) May 26, 2025 But conviction alone isn’t enough to push prices higher. For that, you need something else, fresh demand. First-Time Buyers Push Prices Higher To get a strong rally, Glassnode says you need “First-Time Buyers.” These are people who are buying Bitcoin or Ethereum for the first time. When lots of new buyers come in, they bring fresh money into the market, and that’s what often causes prices to rise fast. For example, from July to December 2024 and again from March to May 2025, Glassnode saw a big jump in these new buyers. Both times, Bitcoin’s price went up quickly afterward. This shows how powerful new demand can be. Emotions Still Rule the Market Even though charts and data are helpful, most traders still act based on emotion. Many retail traders follow fear, hype, or social media buzz. On the other hand, professional market makers use this emotional trading to their advantage. That’s why Glassnode created something called the “FOMOmeter.” It helps track when traders are getting too excited or too scared.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 07:15:11

A key area gaining global attention is the regulation of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value. Recently, a significant development occurred that could shape the future of digital finance in the country: the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) has signaled its intent to prioritize and push for clear policies around stablecoins. This move is crucial for market participants and observers interested in the direction of South Korea stablecoin regulation . Why is Korea Crypto Policy Focusing on Stablecoins? Stablecoins play a vital role in the crypto ecosystem, acting as a bridge between volatile digital assets and traditional fiat currencies. They are used extensively for trading, lending, and increasingly, payments. However, their rapid growth has also highlighted potential risks, including lack of transparency regarding reserves, potential for market instability (as seen with algorithmic stablecoin collapses), and use in illicit finance. For a nation like South Korea, with a robust and active crypto market, establishing a clear framework is essential for several reasons: Market Stability: Ensuring stablecoins are truly stable and backed appropriately prevents contagion risk to the broader crypto market and potentially the traditional financial system. Consumer Protection: Clear rules protect users from fraudulent stablecoin projects and the risks associated with poorly managed reserves. Financial Sovereignty: As stated by the DPK, developing domestic stablecoin policies is seen as key to preserving national currency sovereignty in an increasingly digital world. Innovation Promotion: A clear legal framework removes uncertainty, encouraging legitimate businesses to build and innovate using stablecoins within South Korea. Global Alignment: Major jurisdictions like the EU and the US are actively developing stablecoin regulations. Aligning with global standards is important for international competitiveness and interoperability. This focus indicates a maturing perspective on digital assets within the political landscape, moving beyond simply addressing risks to actively building a framework for growth and integration. What Did the DPK Crypto Initiative Reveal? The Democratic Party of Korea’s position was highlighted at a significant policy forum held on May 27th. The venue itself was notable – the headquarters of Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest crypto exchanges, operated by Dunamu. This choice of location underscores the party’s direct engagement with key industry players. Attendees at the forum included: Ahn Do-geol, Senior Vice Chairman of the DPK’s Economic Growth Committee Lee Sirgoo, CEO of Dunamu (Upbit operator) Lee Jae-won, CEO of Bithumb (another major exchange) Kim Jae-jin, Standing Vice Chairman of DAXA (Digital Asset eXchange Association) The presence of senior party officials alongside the heads of the country’s leading exchanges and their industry association signifies a serious intent to collaborate and understand the practical implications of future policies. The discussions reportedly centered on developing policies that: Encourage Healthy Market Growth: This suggests a desire to create an environment where legitimate crypto businesses, including those utilizing stablecoins, can thrive under clear rules. Protect Users: This is a consistent theme in crypto regulation globally, focusing on preventing fraud, ensuring transparency, and providing recourse for investors. Preserve National Currency Sovereignty: This points towards potential considerations for how foreign stablecoins operate within Korea and the potential role of Korean Won-backed stablecoins or even a future central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the ecosystem. Drive Innovation: Regulation is not just about restriction; effective policy can provide the certainty needed for innovation to flourish responsibly. Establish a Legal Framework: The clear recognition of the need for specific stablecoin legislation, not just shoehorning them into existing financial laws. This meeting serves as a concrete step in the legislative process, moving from general discussion to specific policy formulation with direct input from the industry. Understanding the Potential Scope of Stablecoin Law Korea While specific details of the DPK’s proposed legislation are yet to be fully unveiled, the stated goals provide strong clues about the likely direction of stablecoin law Korea . Based on global trends and the concerns raised, potential areas of focus could include: Policy Area Potential Measures Definition & Classification Legally defining stablecoins; distinguishing between different types (fiat-backed, crypto-backed, algorithmic); classifying them as securities, payment instruments, or a new category. Reserve Requirements & Transparency Mandating what assets can back stablecoins (e.g., cash, short-term government bonds); requiring regular audits by independent third parties; public disclosure of reserve composition. Licensing & Authorization Requiring stablecoin issuers and potentially service providers (like custodians) to obtain specific licenses; setting minimum capital requirements. Consumer Protection Rules around disclosure of risks; segregation of customer funds; mechanisms for redemption; dispute resolution processes. Interoperability & Systemic Risk Considering how stablecoins interact with the traditional financial system; addressing potential concentration risks if one stablecoin becomes dominant. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) Applying existing or new AML/CTF obligations to stablecoin issuers and platforms. The interaction with the industry leaders suggests that the DPK is likely seeking input on how to implement these measures effectively without stifling the very innovation they aim to foster. The balance between robust regulation and supporting technological advancement will be key. How Does This Relate to Broader Crypto Regulation South Korea ? This focus on stablecoins is not happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger, ongoing effort to refine crypto regulation South Korea . The country already has frameworks in place, particularly concerning exchanges and AML/CTF compliance, largely overseen by the Financial Services Commission (FSC). However, the regulatory landscape has been evolving, with discussions around areas like token classification, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and decentralized finance (DeFi). The push for specific stablecoin legislation indicates that policymakers view stablecoins as a distinct category requiring tailored rules, potentially due to their unique role as a value peg and their potential interaction with traditional money. This move by the DPK, as a major political party, suggests that stablecoin regulation is moving up the legislative agenda. While the ruling party’s stance is also critical, the DPK’s public commitment adds significant momentum and brings the issue into sharper focus for the National Assembly. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges Ahead? Implementing comprehensive stablecoin regulation offers several potential benefits for South Korea: Increased Confidence: A clear framework can attract more institutional investors and cautious retail users into the regulated crypto space. Reduced Risk: Strong rules on reserves and transparency minimize the likelihood of stablecoin failures impacting users. Enhanced Reputation: Robust regulation can position South Korea as a leader in responsible crypto innovation. Level Playing Field: Clear rules create certainty for businesses, fostering fair competition. However, challenges remain: Balancing Act: Crafting rules that protect without being overly burdensome or stifling innovation. Cross-Border Issues: Regulating stablecoins issued in other jurisdictions but used in Korea. Technological Pace: Keeping regulation relevant in a rapidly changing technological environment. Enforcement: Effectively monitoring and enforcing compliance with new rules. The collaboration seen at the forum suggests an attempt to navigate these challenges by involving those directly affected by the regulation. Actionable Insights for the Market For anyone involved in the South Korean crypto market – whether as an investor, a business, or a developer – the DPK’s initiative is a signal to pay close attention. Key takeaways include: Stay Informed: Follow legislative developments closely. The specifics of the proposed laws will significantly impact how stablecoins can be used, issued, and traded. Prepare for Changes: Businesses dealing with stablecoins should anticipate requirements around licensing, reserves, reporting, and compliance. Understand Risks: Even with regulation, understanding the specific mechanisms and risks of individual stablecoins remains crucial for investors. Engage (if possible): Industry participants may have opportunities to provide feedback on proposed regulations. This push by the DPK is not just political posturing; it represents a tangible step towards creating a more defined legal environment for a critical component of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Step Towards Regulatory Clarity The Democratic Party of Korea’s announced focus on stablecoin policy marks a significant moment for the country’s digital asset landscape. By prioritizing the development of a clear legal framework, the DPK aims to simultaneously foster healthy market growth, protect users, and safeguard national financial interests. The engagement with leading figures from Upbit, Bithumb, and DAXA at the recent forum underscores a collaborative approach to tackling this complex issue. While the specifics of the future South Korea stablecoin regulation are still being formed, this initiative signals a strong political will to bring clarity and stability to the use of stablecoins, aligning Korea with global regulatory trends and paving the way for potentially broader adoption and innovation within a regulated environment.

The regulator laid out clear rules on G-Tokens, emphasizing that the intention is not to use them for trading like other cryptocurrencies, per a Bangkok Post report . “We want to ensure that G-Token serves as a useful, technology-driven investment innovation — not merely a speculative tool,” SEC secretary-general Pornanong Budsaratragoon said. On May 13, Thailand’s Ministry of Finance announced the launch of $150 million worth of digital investment tokens , to allow the general public to purchase government bonds via blockchain-based tokens. G-Token will be the first government-issued digital token to raise public funds and help cover its budget deficit. G-Token to Be Issued Through IPO Jomkwan Kongsakul, SEC’s deputy secretary-general, noted that the government tokens would be issued via an initial coin offering (ICO) portal. The Finance Ministry would serve as the registrar, she said. The SEC further said that the official launch is scheduled for July this year, and details, including interest rate, maturity, and collateral, will be announced before the launch. Besides, the regulator held public talks on the regulatory framework of G-Token to gather feedback, with a 15-day window. “Unlike government bonds or equities, a G-Token is not a debt instrument, and therefore it falls under the Digital Asset Act, not traditional public debt laws,” Jomkwan Kongsakul, deputy secretary-general of the SEC noted. Investors having digital wallets with authorized crypto exchanges can directly invest in G-Token, the rules read. Meanwhile, for investors using security firms as intermediaries, the firm will keep custody of the token. Thailand is set to launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens, marking a step toward financial inclusivity for retail investors. #Thailand #SEC https://t.co/2akullmpsP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 Thailand’s Digital Bond Tokens Tradable on Secondary Market Jomkwan noted that these tokens can be tradeable on a secondary market. This provides investors “with options to either trade or hold until maturity.” “This structure offers exit opportunities while maintaining a savings-oriented investment approach,” she added. The SEC will be responsible for the supervision of G-Token trading in the secondary market. Besides, the regulator will focus on anti-market manipulation measures, trading transparency, and investor protection.

The plan was announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira during an investment seminar in Bangkok on May 26, according to reports from Bangkok Post and The Nation . The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases. Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place. “This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.

Pichai said the government needs to unify the legal treatment of the traditional capital market and the digital asset space, which are currently governed by separate acts. Pichai also said the government is reviewing outdated restrictions on institutional investors as part of broader capital market reform. Life insurers and large funds holding hundreds of billions of Thai baht are restricted to government bonds. Upcoming changes may open more funds to equities and private sector assets.

He mentioned the rollout of “G-Tokens,” a blockchain-based initiative aiming to allow retail investors to buy government bonds in fractional units. These tokens, he said, are expected to improve returns for savers and raise the global profile of Thai sovereign debt. On May 13, the Ministry of Finance announced plans to issue $150 million worth of digital investment tokens that allow retail investors to buy government bonds. This came after the country’s securities regulator revealed plans to launch a tokenized securities trading system for institutional investors back in February. In March, the Thai SEC also approved Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) for cryptocurrency trades, allowing the stablecoins to be listed on regulated exchanges across the country.

Cardano (ADA), continues to attract attention due to its strong development roadmap and increasing DeFi adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE), is riding a wave of meme momentum, but its lack of real utility raises questions. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi-powered newcomer rapidly gaining traction for its innovative lending protocol and viral presale performance. The MUTM presale has attracted over 12,000 participants ahead of a token price to rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 100% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. The race to $5 is heating up, and as these three coins are leading the charge in very different ways, Mutuum Finance is likely to hit $5 faster. Cardano and Dogecoin: Diverging Paths Under $1 with Big Potential Cardano (ADA) near $0.75 trading is investors’ bet that appreciates scalable blockchain platforms and smart contract products led by ongoing network upgrades and rising DeFi usage. Dogecoin (DOGE) near $0.22 trading, however, still depends on its strong community and social media frenzy, but its future hinges more on investor sentiment than intrinsic utility. Both tokens have distinctive value offerings in the sub-$1 altcoin market and are attractive to other categories of investors as the market gets set for the next big rally. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also joins this crowded landscape with robust initial velocity. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.3 million and accumulated 12,000 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Certik Audit Officially Completed, Stablecoin Secures Trust and Stability Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified complete by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. While Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) each bring their unique strengths to the table, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the most promising contender to reach $5 first from under $1. Over $9.3 million has been raised and 12,000 investors already on board during its presale. Current presale prices near $0.03, poised to rise to $0.035 in the next phase, offer early investors up to 100% gains ahead of the official launch price of $0.06.

While this new ATH excites investors and the market, there are many speculations about the source of the record. While some analysts attribute the decline to US President Donald Trump's decision to begin ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine, others attribute it to increased corporate demand and macroeconomic factors. André Dragosch, Head of European Research at Bitwise, argued that the recent rally was due to ongoing problems in the Japanese bond market. Pointing out that risks in Japanese government bonds have increased, Dragosch noted that the 30-year yield on government bonds reached an all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025. “Government bonds are often considered safe haven assets. But when yields rise sharply, it usually signals investor concerns about fiscal sustainability and the country’s ability to repay its debts. At this point, instability in Japan’s bond market has increased credit risk concerns and led to greater Bitcoin adoption among TradFi participants. Because Bitcoin is an immutable asset. It is free from counterparty risk. It is a hedge against sovereign risk and sovereign default.” The Bitwise executive finally added that if the risk concerns in sovereign bonds of Japan and other countries continue to increase, the Bitcoin price could reach $200,000 in the long term. *This is not investment advice.

HYPE price is currently taking a breather, down 2% over the past 24 hours and trading around $37.50. While it’s too early to call the next move, it appears to be entering a consolidation phase because the RSI is deep in the overbought zone at 77. However, the underlying trend remains strong. The EMA 20 remains above the SMA 50, with the bullish crossover holding since mid-April. Trading volume stands at $358 million, still significant though down 25% over the past day, indicating cooled momentum in the short term.

Russia ‘s state-controlled lender Sberbank is getting ready to play a bigger role in the country’s crypto scene by acting as a market maker and providing liquidity on the new regulated crypto platforms that are expected to launch soon. Alexander Zozulya, head of global markets at Sberbank, told local media that the lender will be present as a liquidity provider and market maker on Russian regulated platforms, where super-qualified investors will be allowed to conduct operations directly with cryptocurrencies. The move comes as Russia’s central bank pushes ahead with its experimental legal regime for crypto trading. The Bank of Russia wants crypto operations to happen within a legal “sandbox” and only for a limited group of wealthy investors. You might also like: Russia moves to seize crypto: new bill classifies Bitcoin as property Elvira Nabiullina, head of the central bank, said earlier at a conference that “investments directly in cryptocurrencies” will require new regulations and dedicated infrastructure. Under the plan, investors will qualify if they have over 100 million rubles (around $1.25 million) in securities and deposits or earned more than 50 million rubles (around $625,000) in the past year. Sberbank also plans to offer crypto-linked investment products that don’t involve direct ownership. Per Zozulya, these could be structured products, digital financial assets, or mutual funds that provide exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ethereum ( ETH ), but without direct ownership. Following this approach, the bank expects a “new world” of investing to open up once the legal framework is updated. Zozulya added that the infrastructure “is already ready,” and it’s just a matter of adding new instruments to the market.

According to data from crypto.news, Quant ( QNT ) jumped over 10% in the past 24 hours, reaching an intraday high of $106.67 on the morning of May 27. This move pushed its market cap to around $1.55 billion, placing QNT nearly 80% above its year-to-date low. Daily trading volume also shot up by more than 200%, hitting over $50 million. Meanwhile, its open interest spiked 43% to $22.9 million, its highest level since February, hinting at a strong wave of speculative activity. The recent uptick in momentum followed an announcement from CEO Gilbert Verdian, who revealed that Overledger Fusion will begin rolling out in June 2025. The new upgrade, described as a “Layer 2.5” network, introduces multi-chain rollups, secure cross-chain smart contracts, and improved privacy tools, all aimed at helping blockchains work more smoothly with both enterprise systems and DeFi applications. According to Quant, the goal is to fix major pain points that have slowed down institutional adoption of public blockchains, such as compliance risks, data privacy concerns, and poor scalability. By allowing smoother asset and data movement between private and public chains, Fusion could appeal to banks, fintech firms, and other organizations exploring blockchain integration.

As the tech landscape evolves at lightning speed, so too does the path into a technology career. If you’re an aspiring developer or tech enthusiast looking to land your first professional role, you might be finding the door surprisingly hard to open. It’s not just you; the tech job market for newcomers has fundamentally shifted, presenting significant hurdles that weren’t there just a few years ago. Understanding the Shifting Tech Job Market The traditional path into a tech role often involved securing an entry level tech job right after graduation. These roles served as crucial stepping stones, allowing new professionals to gain practical experience, build networks, and develop specialized skills. However, recent data paints a challenging picture for this conventional route. Reports indicate a substantial pullback in hiring new graduates by large technology companies. Data from venture firm SignalFire shows that hiring of new grads by the 15 largest tech companies has dropped over 50% since 2019. Before the pandemic, graduates made up about 15% of hires at these firms; that figure has now fallen to just 7%. This significant reduction means fewer openings for those just starting their tech careers . Why Entry Level Tech Jobs Are Harder to Secure Several factors contribute to the increased difficulty in landing those initial roles: Economic Climate: The broader economic environment has led many companies, including tech giants, to become more cautious with hiring, prioritizing experienced talent who can immediately contribute to critical projects. Automation and AI: As highlighted by experts like LinkedIn’s chief economic opportunity officer, Aneesh Raman, AI is automating tasks that were previously handled by entry-level staff. This effectively removes some of the traditional ‘bottom rung’ positions on the career ladder. Basic data entry, preliminary coding tasks, and support functions are increasingly being handled by intelligent systems. Increased Competition: While the number of tech graduates continues to grow, the reduced supply of dedicated entry-level roles intensifies competition for the remaining positions. Higher Skill Requirements: Companies are increasingly seeking candidates who can contribute value quickly, often requiring more specialized skills even at the entry level than in the past. The Growing Demand for AI Skills Amidst the challenges, a clear demand signal is emerging: the need for AI skills . While AI might be contributing to the reduction in some traditional roles, it is simultaneously creating a surge in demand for new expertise. A survey found that 87% of hiring leaders now value AI experience, and nearly a quarter of all job postings now require it. This isn’t just about building AI models; it includes a range of competencies: Understanding machine learning concepts Data analysis and interpretation Prompt engineering and working with large language models Integrating AI tools into existing workflows AI ethics and governance For those aiming for AI jobs , demonstrating practical experience with AI technologies is becoming essential. Navigating Tech Careers in a Changing Landscape Despite the hurdles in securing traditional entry level tech jobs at big tech firms, the overall outlook for tech employment remains positive. The tech industry itself isn’t shrinking; rather, technology roles are becoming embedded across virtually all sectors. This presents a significant opportunity for aspiring professionals willing to look beyond the typical Silicon Valley giants. Tech jobs are projected to grow from 6 million this year to 7.1 million by 2034. While big tech hiring of new grads is down, companies in healthcare, finance (including FinTech and crypto), retail, manufacturing, and countless other industries are actively seeking tech talent. The unemployment rate for software developers, while not at historic lows, remains relatively low at 2.2%, half the national average. So, how can you position yourself for success in this evolving market? Here are some actionable insights: Acquire AI Skills: This is non-negotiable. Invest time in learning machine learning fundamentals, data science, or how to effectively use AI tools. Online courses, bootcamps, and personal projects are invaluable. Build a Portfolio Demonstrating AI Proficiency: Create projects that showcase your ability to work with AI, analyze data, or develop software that integrates AI functionalities. Highlight these on platforms like GitHub. Look Beyond Big Tech: Explore opportunities in various industries. Companies in healthcare, finance, energy, and agriculture need tech professionals, and they may offer more accessible entry points. Network Strategically: Attend industry events (both tech and AI-focused), connect with professionals on LinkedIn, and participate in online communities. Networking can uncover hidden opportunities. Emphasize Adaptability and Continuous Learning: The pace of technological change means that the ability to quickly learn new tools and concepts is highly valued. Make this a core part of your professional narrative. The Future of AI Jobs and Tech Careers The trajectory suggests a future where tech roles are pervasive, and AI skills are foundational. The growth in AI jobs isn’t limited to specialized AI researcher positions; it extends to developers who can integrate AI, data analysts who can interpret AI outputs, and product managers who can build AI-powered products. For those interested in the crypto space, this convergence is particularly relevant, with increasing applications of AI in areas like market analysis, security, and decentralized applications. While the path to an entry level tech job might be more challenging than in previous years, it is far from impossible. It requires a more strategic approach, a focus on in-demand skills like AI, and a willingness to explore opportunities across a broader range of industries. The demand for tech talent, especially those with relevant AI expertise, is projected to grow, offering a promising future for those who adapt and prepare effectively.

At the forefront of this call is pseudonymous analyst Rekt Fencer, who recently outlined several tokens he claims are primed for explosive gains of between 50x and 100x, provided market momentum holds. Altseason Indicators Align Rekt Fencer’s thesis, shared in a May 27 thread on X, rests on a confluence of macro and technical indicators. Chief among them is the uptick in stablecoin supply, a leading metric often interpreted as latent purchasing power. “More capital flowing in means risk-on is coming,” stated the analyst. “Time for alts is closer than u think.” He also shared a series of charts in his thread showing that the total stablecoin supply has grown from around $50 billion in early 2021 to nearly $250 billion by mid-2025. This influx, he argued, reflects rising capital readiness to enter riskier altcoin positions. His view is supported by a simultaneous dip in Bitcoin’s dominance, which has slipped from 65.4% to 61.2% in recent weeks. Ethereum’s ETH/BTC ratio has also rebounded from a five-year low of 0.018 to 0.025, breaking a three-year downtrend and creating what has historically been a setup for alt rallies. “BTC Dominance at supply, ETH/BTC at demand. This exact pattern triggered the last alt run,” wrote Rekt Fencer. The shifting flows suggest investors are beginning to rotate into altcoins, and in this context, the market observer spotlighted five tokens he believes could lead the charge. The 5 Altcoins in Focus Rekt Fencer’s first pick was Grass (GRASS). Trading at $2.40 at the time of writing, it is down 2.5% in the last 24 hours. However, the altcoin still gained nearly 12% in the past week and almost 50% in 30 days, as investors bet on decentralized infrastructure. His second choice was Pendle (PENDLE), ranked #131 in terms of market cap. The altcoin offers exposure to tokenized yield futures and is currently trading at around $4.39. Its value has jumped more than 17% in the previous seven days, adding a slight 0.4% in 24 hours. However, zooming out, the last 12 months haven’t been particularly kind, with data showing that it shed nearly 36% of its price in that time. Still, PENDLE has performed markedly better in the last 30 days, gaining just under 30% riding the broader wave of decentralized finance (DeFi) revival. Another DeFi darling on Rekt’s list is Ondo (ONDO). Priced at $0.9315 and with a $2.9 billion valuation, it has seen steady growth amid rising demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. However, its latest price action is nothing to write home about. The asset is down roughly 2% in the last 24 hours and in the last seven days, while across 12 months, it has registered a 24.5% drop. Ethena (ENA), currently at $0.37 and a $2.1 billion market cap, offers a yield-bearing synthetic dollar via delta-neutral stETH positions. It is the fourth token the analyst sees spearheading the next altcoin season. While its price has been flat in the past seven days, there is a belief that the protocol’s utility could drive a revaluation if market sentiment flips risk-on. Finally, Sei (SEI), the native token of the Sei Network, wraps up Rekt Fencer’s list. Down more than 59% year-on-year, the coin has still managed a 10.7% uptick in the past month, with the expert suggesting its high-speed architecture and DEX focus could position it as a rebound candidate.

While tokens like BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) had their time in the spotlight, 2025 is shaping up to crown a new breakout star. If you’re on the hunt for the next big meme coin with real momentum and 1000x potential, Punisher Coin stands out as the one to watch. Punisher Coin: The Best Crypto for Passive Income and Viral Momentum Punisher Coin ($PUN) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, but don’t be fooled — it’s no ordinary meme coin. With a revolutionary “Punisher Energy” system, the project is rewriting the rules of meme warfare. Here’s the play: target weaker meme coins, incentivize their holders to jump ship, and reward them with bonus $PUN tokens. This tactic drains liquidity from competitors and boosts Punisher Coin’s ecosystem. But that’s not all. The team behind $PUN is hyper-focused on community. With mission-based rewards, users can earn both real cash and $PUN tokens by participating in challenges. It’s more than holding a coin — it’s joining a movement. Add to that an explosive presale ($30K raised in the first hour) and upcoming staking rewards, and you’ve got one of the top cryptos for passive income and high-growth speculation alike. BONK: Solana’s Meme Experiment Peaks Early BONK, the original meme coin of the Solana network, saw early success thanks to its community-first approach and massive airdrops. However, volatility and a lack of evolving utility have stalled its momentum. While it benefited from being first on Solana, its long-term upside is increasingly tied to Solana’s broader performance — and that’s a risky dependency in 2025’s uncertain DeFi landscape. Dogwifhat (WIF): Viral Sensation, But What Comes Next? WIF charmed the internet with its Shiba Inu mascot sporting a beanie — a perfect recipe for meme coin virality. It thrived on Reddit and X (formerly Twitter), gaining traction purely on vibe. Yet that’s also its Achilles’ heel: no staking, no missions, no unique strategy. As the meme coin market matures, investors are demanding more than memes. Punisher Coin delivers. Punisher Coin vs. BONK & WIF: The Strategic Advantage BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) run on Solana, while Punisher Coin is built on Ethereum (ERC-20). Passive income is minimal with BONK and nonexistent with WIF, but Punisher offers high potential through staking and mission rewards. Community engagement is limited to airdrops for BONK and virtually absent with WIF. Punisher Coin, however, drives activity with structured missions and rewards. Neither BONK nor WIF has a defined liquidity strategy, whereas Punisher leads with aggressive “raids” powered by Punisher Energy. As BONK peaks and WIF fades, Punisher Coin’s presale is gaining explosive momentum. This isn’t just hype—Punisher delivers results. With staking, token burns, and an offensive liquidity model, it’s built for long-term success. For serious meme coin investors, Punisher is a fresh and strategic play. The Meme Coin of the Year? BONK and Dogwifhat created waves. But Punisher Coin is creating a storm. It’s not only the best meme coin to buy today — it may be the most strategic meme asset launched this year. With robust tokenomics (2B supply, 33% for presale, 22% for staking) and a multi-layered brand (Enforcer, Strategist, Executioner), it’s designed to do more than trend — it’s built to conquer. Don’t settle for old hype. Be part of a new narrative with actual mechanics behind the meme. The Punisher Coin presale is live — join now and ride the wave of 2025’s most tactical meme coin.

In the visual shared, this moving average, colored yellow, runs just beneath the current market price, which is approximately $2.2962. Despite recent downward movement, this SMA has consistently maintained its role as dynamic support. Egragnotes that it is “keeping us steady,” suggesting buyers are actively defending this level. The proximity to the 0.702 Fibonacci level at $2.2293 adds another layer of support, reinforcing the argument that this zone is technically important. #XRP – 21 SMA & 33 SMA Support Levels: On the 5-day timeframe, the 21 SMA is acting as a strong support, keeping us steady! Meanwhile, on the 3-day timeframe, the 33 SMA is providing crucial support, reinforcing our bullish outlook. These moving averages are key to… pic.twitter.com/0UKxOqfaSM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 25, 2025 33 SMA Support Reinforced on the 3-Day Chart In the 3-day timeframe, attention turns to the 33-period SMA, shown in green. According to Egrag Crypto, this moving average provides “crucial support” and helps sustain the current bullish setup. The XRP price remains closely aligned with this average, suggesting a continuation of support-driven consolidation. A highlighted level of $1.9600 serves as a reference point for lower bounds observed in recent market activity. This level has previously marked a reversal zone, indicating that market participants have shown strong buying interest when prices reached this area. Horizontal Resistance and Key Fibonacci Levels Both charts in the tweet include marked horizontal resistance and support lines, with the $2.4100 and $2.6544 levels of particular interest. The latter aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, suggesting that a break above this point could trigger stronger bullish activity. The ultimate Fibonacci target labeled on the charts is $3.3170, which is derived from the full retracement extension and marks a longer-term technical objective. On the downside, support levels at $2.1500 and $1.9555 are also emphasized, providing reference zones during further corrective moves. Outlook and Interpretation from Egrag Crypto Egrag Crypto’s commentary maintains a focused and technical tone. The post stresses the importance of the moving averages in sustaining upward momentum without offering exaggerated predictions. Instead, the tweet emphasizes that staying above these SMAs is essential to preserving the bullish outlook. No speculative timeframes or dramatic scenarios are introduced, and the analysis is grounded in the visual strength of trend-following indicators. For traders monitoring XRP , this structured approach provides a roadmap of current support levels and confirms the analyst’s preference for a measured, mid-term view of the asset’s price trajectory.

The Bank of Japan (BOJ), long an outlier with its ultra-loose monetary policy, is now hinting at a significant change. This potential shift in Bank of Japan strategy could have far-reaching implications, even for digital assets. Understanding the Bank of Japan’s Stance For decades, the Bank of Japan has maintained exceptionally low, and sometimes negative, interest rates. This was a deliberate strategy aimed at stimulating economic growth and combating deflation, a persistent decline in price levels. While other major central banks like the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank began hiking rates aggressively in recent years to fight rising inflation, the BOJ largely stuck to its easing stance, including yield curve control. This divergence in Monetary Policy Japan pursued created a significant gap between Japanese interest rates and those elsewhere, influencing global capital flows and the value of the Japanese Yen (JPY). The carry trade, where investors borrow in low-interest rate currencies like the JPY to invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere, became a prominent market feature. Is Japan Inflation Finally Taking Hold? Recent data suggests that Japan inflation is finally reaching levels not seen in decades. After years of struggling to meet its 2% target, consumer prices have risen consistently, driven by factors including global commodity price increases, supply chain issues, and a weaker yen pushing up import costs. Governor Kazuo Ueda’s recent remarks acknowledge this shift. Speaking at a conference, Governor Ueda indicated that Japan is now closer to its 2% inflation target than it has been in the past three years. This sustained period of rising prices provides the central bank with the economic conditions it has long sought to justify normalizing Monetary Policy Japan has followed. BOJ Policy: What Did Governor Ueda Signal? According to reports, Governor Ueda explicitly stated that the central bank is prepared to continue raising Japan interest rates if economic conditions improve as anticipated. This is a pivotal statement, moving beyond hypothetical discussions to a more concrete commitment based on current economic trajectory. He emphasized the need to adjust monetary easing as necessary to maintain price stability, a core mandate of the BOJ. Key takeaways from his comments: Conditionality: Rate hikes are contingent on continued economic improvement aligning with the BOJ’s forecasts. Inflation Target: The 2% target is becoming a reality, strengthening the case for policy adjustment. Flexibility: The BOJ is prepared to adjust its stance to ensure long-term price stability. This signals a potential end to the era of ultra-low Japan interest rates that has defined the country’s economic landscape for so long. The Potential Impact of Rising Japan Interest Rates A shift in BOJ policy away from ultra-easing carries significant weight, both domestically and internationally. For Japan, it could mean higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially impacting investment and spending. It could also strengthen the Japanese Yen, making imports cheaper but potentially hurting exporters. Globally, the impact could be felt through: Yen Carry Trade Unwinding: Higher JPY rates could make borrowing in yen less attractive, potentially leading investors to sell assets bought with borrowed yen, impacting markets worldwide. Global Liquidity: Japan’s ultra-loose stance has contributed significantly to global liquidity. Tightening Monetary Policy Japan employs could reduce this liquidity. Investor Sentiment: A major central bank exiting an extreme easing stance can influence overall market sentiment regarding global monetary conditions. While the pace and extent of rate hikes remain uncertain, the signal from the Bank of Japan is clear: the path towards normalization is becoming more likely. Monetary Policy Japan and Global Ripples: What About Crypto? How does this seemingly distant central bank policy affect the volatile world of cryptocurrency? The connection lies in global liquidity and risk appetite. Historically, periods of abundant global liquidity (often fueled by central bank easing, including the Bank of Japan ) have coincided with increased investment in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, as central banks tighten Monetary Policy Japan included, global liquidity tends to decrease. This can lead investors to become more cautious, potentially reducing appetite for high-risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. The unwinding of the yen carry trade, if it occurs on a large scale, could also add selling pressure to various asset classes globally, including potentially crypto. Investors in the crypto space should monitor the BOJ policy trajectory closely. While not a direct driver, changes in major global monetary policies, especially from a significant player like the Bank of Japan, contribute to the broader macroeconomic environment that influences crypto market dynamics. Conclusion: A New Era for Japan’s Economy and Beyond? Governor Ueda’s recent comments mark a potentially significant turning point for the Bank of Japan and Japan’s economy. After decades of battling deflation and maintaining ultra-low rates, sustained Japan inflation is paving the way for a shift towards higher Japan interest rates . This move away from the long-standing ultra-easy BOJ policy is not just a domestic matter; it has the potential to send ripples through global financial markets, impacting everything from bond yields and currency values to potentially influencing the tides of global liquidity that affect asset classes like cryptocurrency. As the BOJ navigates this transition, market participants worldwide will be watching closely.

Known for his unwavering bullish stance on Bitcoin, Saylor often sparks significant discussion with his views. His latest comments, delivered at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, have once again grabbed headlines, this time focusing on a controversial topic: on-chain proof-of-reserves for institutional players. And his take? It’s a “bad idea” that introduces significant Crypto Security Risks . Why Michael Saylor Calls On-Chain Proof-of-Reserves a “Bad Idea” Michael Saylor didn’t mince words when discussing the practice of institutions publicly disclosing their wallet addresses as a form of Proof-of-Reserves . While the concept of PoR gained traction after events like the FTX collapse to foster transparency and trust, Saylor argues that the on-chain method, specifically for large entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin , creates more problems than it solves. According to reports from the conference, Saylor highlighted several key concerns: Increased Attack Surface: Publicly known wallet addresses become prime targets for malicious actors. Knowing where significant reserves are held provides hackers with a clear target, potentially increasing the risk of sophisticated attacks. Privacy Concerns: While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, linking a large, known institution to specific wallet addresses can compromise operational privacy and potentially reveal strategic movements or holdings. Vulnerability for All Parties: Saylor suggested that this exposure isn’t just risky for the institution publishing the data. It could also make their custodians, exchanges they interact with, and even their investors more vulnerable indirectly. Limited True Proof: Saylor has argued in the past that simply showing assets in a wallet isn’t sufficient proof without simultaneously proving liabilities. An institution could show large holdings but have even larger debts against them. This stance positions Saylor against a trend some in the industry see as essential for rebuilding trust, particularly among users interacting with centralized exchanges and custodians handling significant Institutional Crypto holdings. Understanding Proof-of-Reserves: The Goal vs. The Method Let’s take a step back. What is Proof-of-Reserves , and why did it become a hot topic? In essence, PoR is an audit method to verify that a custodian (like an exchange or financial institution) holds the assets they claim to hold on behalf of their customers. The goal is transparency and solvency assurance. Following major collapses in the crypto space, many called for mandatory PoR audits. The idea was simple: if platforms could definitively prove they held user funds 1:1, confidence would be restored. However, there are different ways to implement PoR: On-Chain Proof (Saylor’s Critique): Publishing a list of wallet addresses and signing messages from those wallets to prove ownership, coupled with a list of user balances (often anonymized using Merkle Trees). Third-Party Audits: Engaging an independent accounting firm to verify holdings and liabilities off-chain. Hybrid Approaches: Combining some level of on-chain verification with traditional auditing methods. Saylor’s criticism specifically targets the *on-chain publication* aspect, particularly for large, visible entities like those involved in Institutional Crypto . He’s not necessarily against proving reserves in principle, but the method of doing so by exposing addresses is where he sees significant Crypto Security Risks . Institutional Crypto and Unique Challenges Why might on-chain PoR be different for an individual user holding Bitcoin versus a large institution or custodian managing billions? The scale and complexity are vastly different. Institutions: Hold much larger amounts, making them bigger targets. Often use complex custody solutions, potentially involving multiple addresses, cold storage, and hot wallets. Face stricter regulatory scrutiny, and revealing too much operational detail could be problematic. Manage significant liabilities that aren’t easily verifiable on-chain. For Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy, managing a large corporate treasury holding like theirs requires a high level of security discretion. Exposing their entire wallet structure could be seen as irresponsible from a security standpoint. Is There a Safer Way to Achieve Transparency for Institutional Crypto? Saylor’s warning raises a critical question: how can institutions provide assurance to their users and the market without exposing themselves to undue Crypto Security Risks ? The industry is still grappling with the best practices. Possible alternatives or complementary methods include: Regular, Independent Audits: Engaging reputable accounting firms to conduct comprehensive audits of both assets and liabilities. While not real-time on-chain proof, this is a standard financial practice. Attestations: Less formal than a full audit, an attestation confirms the accuracy of management’s assertions about their reserves at a specific point in time. Enhanced Internal Controls: Focusing on robust internal security measures and compliance frameworks that reduce the risk of mismanagement or loss of funds. Selective Proofs: Perhaps proving ownership of a *portion* of reserves or using more sophisticated cryptographic methods that don’t require revealing all addresses. The debate highlights the tension between the crypto ethos of radical transparency and the practical realities of managing large-scale, secure operations in a high-value target environment. For Bitcoin holders and those interacting with Institutional Crypto platforms, understanding these nuances is key. Conclusion: Balancing Transparency and Security in the Age of Bitcoin Michael Saylor ‘s recent comments serve as a potent reminder that while transparency is vital in the crypto space, the method matters, especially for large institutions. He argues that blindly pursuing on-chain Proof-of-Reserves for entities holding significant amounts of Bitcoin introduces unacceptable Crypto Security Risks that could harm the very users it aims to protect. The industry must continue to explore secure and effective ways for Institutional Crypto players to demonstrate solvency and build trust, perhaps leaning more towards robust independent audits and advanced cryptographic techniques rather than simply publishing wallet addresses for the world to see. Saylor’s warning encourages a more cautious and strategic approach to transparency in the face of evolving digital threats.

At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,564, reflecting a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. While the broader crypto market remains in a bullish structure, largely driven by Bitcoin’s sharp upward movement, Ethereum’s relative momentum appears more tempered, raising questions among traders and analysts about its current positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Its Footing: Bulls Prepare for Another Push Retail Quiet, Institutions Watchful Despite the price remaining above key levels, some analysts believe Ethereum has yet to fully capture the broader market’s enthusiasm. One such observation was presented by CryptoQuant’s analyst Burak Kesmeci, who noted that retail activity around Ethereum remains low compared to previous cycles. This could suggest that Ethereum’s rally is still in its early stages, with potential upside left unpriced by the market. The absence of retail enthusiasm, which historically coincided with local tops, may signal that Ethereum has not yet reached a peak for this cycle. Kesmeci’s analysis highlighted a notable shift in retail engagement around Ethereum. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 bull run, the analyst pointed out that earlier rallies were often accompanied by sharp spikes in retail trading frequency. However, during the current cycle, retail interest has been largely muted, even as Bitcoin surged from $16,000 to over $111,000. While ETH saw a brief uptick in retail activity in December 2024, that momentum faded quickly amid broader market reactions to geopolitical developments, including renewed tariff tensions. The analyst concluded that the market may still be in a phase of accumulation, as the typical retail-driven euphoria has yet to materialize. In this scenario, Ethereum could benefit from increased participation in the coming months, particularly if macroeconomic sentiment stabilizes. The potential for delayed retail entry suggests that Ethereum’s current rally might only be at its midpoint rather than nearing a local top. Ethereum Technical Setups Suggest Bullish Continuation On the technical front, several market analysts continue to hold a positive outlook for ETH. A pseudonymous analyst known as Crypto Busy posted on X that the asset’s monthly chart remains structurally intact, referencing a previous key resistance level near $1,410. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? According to the post, Ethereum’s breakout above this long-standing barrier has turned it into support, replicating a setup that historically preceded major rallies. Further reinforcing this perspective, analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s price action near the $2,400 level. He noted that this zone offered a strong buying opportunity and believes that if Ethereum can successfully retest and hold above this threshold, a move toward $3,000 could follow.

Memecoins have been going downhill lately, and even top assets like the DOGE token have not been spared. Following a strong start to the month, the coin has slipped over the past week. With other altcoins witnessing a different fortune, DOGE holders are disappointed at the token’s current movement. But Unilabs is showing a dominant market ICO display, thus positioning itself as a utility-based alternative for Dogecoin traders to recover their losses. Dogecoin Price Decline: Utility Issues Weigh Heavy Dogecoin (DOGE) debuted in the cryptosphere as the first-ever memecoin. It was created as an internet joke to mock the rapid increase of low-utility digital assets flooding the market at the time. In the years that followed, the Dogecoin price was relatively stable, as most crypto fans paid little attention to DOGE. But things took a different turn in 2021 when the Dogecoin price stunned traders with a mind-blowing price bump. Within the first five months of the same year, the DOGE token had skyrocketed to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.73. However, the Dogecoin price has not been able to sustain this remarkable rally, falling 70% below its ATH as of the time of writing. At present, the DOGE token is hovering around $0.21 after slipping close to 6% in the last four weeks. Source: CoinCodex The Dogecoin price is facing a major hurdle on its road to a recovery: it lacks real utility. Like other memecoins, Dogecoin does not solve any real issue that everyday crypto users face. Instead, the Dogecoin price trend heavily relies on its online community and virality. Another major setback is that the coin is an inflationary asset. Every year, about 5 billion DOGE is pumped into the crypto market. This high token supply creates an imbalance between supply and demand, which in turn affects the coin’s price. Given these circumstances, Dogecoin holders have turned their attention to utility-based projects like Unilabs. Unilabs (UNIL): New DeFi Token Offers Strong Passive Income Potential While DOGE runs on hype, Unilabs could offer several passive income strategies for those who want to earn from the market without active involvement. The stablecoin savings account is a safe and simple way for investors to earn interest without trading. It is pegged to trusted stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI. This way, investors could earn consistent interest without worrying about the price swings experienced by the Dogecoin price. Once a user deposits into the stablecoin account, Unilabs uses AI technology to find the best and safest strategies to grow the investment while keeping the principal deposit stable. Plus, the funds are highly liquid, meaning a user could take them out anytime without having to wait or pay penalties. Traders could also earn income by referring new participants to the ecosystem. Early entrants are also positioned to benefit from Unilabs’ transparent reward model, which is divided into twelve tiers. The platform will distribute 30% of all fees it generates to users across these levels. Unilabs is now in its presale phase and has raised over $1.1 million in less than one month. Investors are entering the project at a fast rate, with about 233 million UNIL tokens sold so far. Buyers could increase their UNIL stash by 30% when they apply the “UNIL30” code during checkout. With this, they stand to earn more returns once the project trades on exchanges. Given its performance, experts are tipping Unilabs to touch a fraction of the billion-dollar DeFi sector upon going mainstream. If this happens, UNIL could surge 10x from its current price, giving early adopters significant returns. Unilabs Could Be a Doorway for 10X Gains Even though early DOGE holders profited massively from its 2021, its lack of utility has proved to be a major setback in the current crypto atmosphere. After its recent weak outing, investors are now sceptical of the future trajectory of the Dogecoin price. Luckily, Unilabs offers investors a low-cost opportunity to reroute their portfolios for better market openings. With its user-tailored use cases, Unilabs could be the next 10x token in 2025. Investors can buy UNIL directly from the website at a discounted price of $0.0051.

While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not recognized as legal tender, they operate in a regulatory grey area with evolving tax and compliance frameworks. Over 107 million Indians now engage with crypto assets. Below is a timeline of key crypto regulation updates in India during 2025, Crypto Regulation India Timeline – 2025 May 22, 2025 : FSB Peer Review Preparation India gears up for the Financial Stability Board (FSB) review in October , aiming to align local crypto regulation with global regulatory standards . April 1, 2025 : SEBI Oversight Begins SEBI starts monitoring crypto tokens that resemble securities . A multi-agency regulatory model is proposed, including RBI, SEBI, and the Finance Ministry. February 13, 2025 : VDA Income Tax Amendment Bill Introduced The bill expands the scope of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) to include NFTs and undisclosed income . However, the 30% tax rate remains unchanged . February 10, 2025 : Crypto Exchanges Declared Reporting Entities Exchanges, wallets, and even mining pools are categorized as “reporting entities.” They must report all transactions to tax authorities under the new AML guidelines. February 1, 2025 : Union Budget 2025-26 Highlights FM Nirmala Sitharaman mandates crypto exchanges to report buyer/seller details under Section 285BAA of the Income Tax Act, enhancing transaction transparency. Crypto Tax in India – 2025 (Fact-Checked) As of now, no official reduction has been made to the 30% tax on crypto gains or the 1% TDS , despite industry demands. 1. For Investors and Traders Flat 30% Tax on gains from crypto sales, swaps, or gifts. No deductions allowed except for cost of acquisition. 1% TDS on transfers above ₹10,000 (buyer deducts and remits). No loss set-off or carry-forward permitted. Example: Buy BTC at ₹2.72 lakh → Sell at ₹8.72 lakh → ₹6 lakh profit → Tax = ₹1.8 lakh + TDS = ₹6,000 2. For Crypto Companies & Exchanges KYC/AML compliance is mandatory. 1% TDS to be collected and remitted on every qualifying user transaction. Transaction reporting to tax authorities under PMLA and IT laws. Category Tax Rate TDS Example Investors 30% 1% if >₹10k ₹50k profit → ₹15k tax + ₹500 TDS Traders 30% 1% if >₹10k Taxed as business income Companies NA 1% collected ₹10L transaction → ₹10k TDS Crypto Adoption in India (2025 Snapshot) Active Users : Over 107.3 million Indians (7.37% of population) hold or trade crypto. Revenue Forecast : India’s crypto market is projected to hit $6.4 billion by year-end. Exchanges : Platforms like CoinDCX, CoinSwitch, and Mudrex offer access to over 500 tokens. Growth Drivers : Rising financial inclusion, smartphone penetration, and blockchain innovation. Government Holdings : No official disclosure yet; policies prioritize transparency and user safety. Conclusion India’s crypto regulation in 2025 reflects a delicate balance between enabling innovation and enforcing oversight. With strict taxes (30% + 1% TDS) and real-time transaction reporting, the government is creating a compliant ecosystem without enforcing an outright ban. As the FSB review nears, clarity in crypto regulation India could open new doors for mass adoption and position the country at the forefront of the $7 trillion global digital economy . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Strategy recently purchased 4,020 BTC at an estimated cost of $427 million, fueling speculation about a potential leg up. However, the market seems divided by views. While price holds above $109k, investors are now eyeing the on-chain trends, liquidation data, and whale moves for clues on the next move. Smart Money vs. Retail Money? Recent insights from Glassnode reveal a crucial shift, where the greater than 10k BTC cohort (the market’s largest players) have moved into a net distribution zone with a score around 0.3. This is an obvious reversal from earlier in the year, when whales were leading accumulation during price rallies. Other cohorts like the 1k to 10k holders and the 100 to 1k BTC holders are also slowing down. While wallets with 10 to 100 BTC and sub-1 BTC continue their shopping spree. Further suggesting that leadership is moving downward on the wallet-size curve. This implies that the retail is buying the dip, while whales may be booking profits or analysing an incoming volatility. What Does the Liquidation Heat Map Say? The liquidation map by Kingfisher gives another layer of insight. With Bitcoin currently priced around $109k, there’s a significant buildup of long liquidation just below the $109k, $108.5k, and $107k mark. This indicates a potential liquidity grab to the downside that could be in the works, which could be driven by leveraged long positions at a risk of being wiped out. It is to note that, above the present BTC price, short liquidation levels seem to be weak, indicating less momentum for an upward squeeze. Correlating this with the distribution by large holders paints a picture where short-term downside volatility is not just possible, but is statistically favored. However, it is worth citing that such moves often reset leverage and provide stronger bases for continuation.

He also told them to ask the AI how it might undermine the security of someone’s company over time. According to Saylor, the AI would write 50 pages of security problems. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.” -Michael Saylor, Co-founder of Strategy. Saylor made global headlines in 2020 when he announced that Strategy would convert its treasury holding into BTC. At the time of publication, Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth around $63 billion. BitcoinTreasuries showed that Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings follows with 48,137 Bitcoin. Crypto exchanges use proof-of-reserves to verify that the company holds sufficient crypto reserves to cover customer deposits. Saylor believes the crypto industry has much to learn from the collapse of FTX and Mt. Gox crypto exchanges. He says proof of reserve isn’t the correct measure for institutions. Cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians began publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022. The move was to establish transparency and prove they hold enough digital assets to back customer deposits. Exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, and OKX, have adopted the transparency measure. Saylor also argued that proof-of-reserves often only shows one side of the picture — what the firm holds — and not what they owe. Powell says proof-of-reserves is pointless without including liabilities Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell noted that exchanges began sharing wallet addresses to prove the existence of users’ funds following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. He argued that a complete proof-of-reserve audit must include the sum of client liabilities; otherwise, it would be “pointless .” According to Powell, a complete proof of reserve audit must include user-verifiable cryptographic proof that each account was included in the sum and signatures proving the custodian’s control over the wallets. He called out industry players who have missed out on including accounts with negative balances. Kraken’s co-founder previously called out CoinMarketCap for sharing incomplete proof of reserves, as it lacked cryptographic proof of client balances and wallet control. Powell mentioned that reserves are not the list of wallets but assets minus liabilities. Powell also asked the media to refrain from overselling and misleading consumers with the transparency measures. He recommended they take time to understand the motive behind proof-of-reserves.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Pepe holds strong at a $5.5b market cap, new contenders like MIND of Pepe and Pepeto are making waves, each promising to be the next big leap in the memecoin saga. Table of Contents Pepe Coin: Still trending, but is the best phase already gone? Another frog joins the hype: MIND of Pepe gears up for big launch The frog who started it all: Pepeto returns for his crown The market is mixed today. According to Nasdaq, the NASDAQ composite is at 18,737.21, showing cautious movement. DOGE is around $0.22, down 3 percent. ETH is holding steady near $2,522. PEPE is still hot at $0.000013 with a $5.5 billion market cap, according to CoinMarketCap and crypto news outlets. Pepe Coin: Still trending, but is the best phase already gone? Pepe Coin is all over the charts again , trending on exchanges, buzzing on social media, and holding a strong place in the memecoin world. Its current price is $0.00001312, with a massive 420 trillion token supply. According to CoinMarketCap, Pepe now has a market cap over $5.5 billion and trades more than $500 million daily. It’s also listed on top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and KuCoin. So yes, it’s visible and active. But here’s the part most people forget: Pepe launched back in April 2023. The real winners were the early buyers, the ones who got in before the noise. For Pepe to simply double in price now, it would need another $5.5 billion to come in. And with no clear roadmap or real use, that’s not easy. So while Pepe still has the spotlight, it may no longer have the upside. The biggest wave might’ve already passed. Another frog joins the hype: MIND of Pepe gears up for big launch Now that we’ve looked at Pepe, let’s take a closer look at another frog making noise, MIND of Pepe. This memecoin mixes Pepe-style branding with AI technology. Its presale is ending soon, and it has already raised a massive amount. Investors who join early will get access to an AI-powered terminal that promises to give market insights, trading ideas, and data tools. The MIND AI agent even posts on social media by itself, building a following on its own. Once the platform goes live, users will be able to interact with the AI directly, with early investors getting first access. Some crypto analysts say the project could grow fast once listed, thanks to the mix of trending meme culture and useful tools. Still, many investors are watching closely for the next token that carries not just hype, but real meaning and direction. That brings us to Pepeto, the God of frogs, and a memecoin with much more story and value. You might also like: Pepe price forms golden cross despite whale and smart money selling The frog who started it all: Pepeto returns for his crown Investors have seen the hype around Pepe, and they’ve watched MIND of Pepe try to mix memes with machines. But neither of them tells the full story. Because before any of these frogs hopped into crypto, there was Pepeto, the true God of frogs, and he’s back to finish what was stolen from him. The lore behind Pepeto According to the lore, before Pepe became a memecoin, it stole the four key documents — the letters P, E, P, E — and ran with the spotlight. But something was missing. Something important. The final two letters — T and O — were never theirs. They belonged to Pepeto. And he waited. Watching in silence as others took credit for his name, his story, his vision. Now he’s here, and he’s not just another meme. Pepeto is a correction. A comeback. A reckoning. The market is ready for more than hype. It’s asking for value, for meaning, for something real. Pepeto is ready to answer. Why Pepeto is more than just a memecoin A full exchange focused on memecoins alone Zero-fee swaps, giving power back to users Bridge technology for smooth cross-chain trading A mission to expose scams and protect traders Inspired by history and crypto betrayal A strong, growing community with a shared purpose The same 420 trillion supply as Pepe, but at a presale price of $0.000000130 Pepeto is fully audited, and all details about its value and features can be verified directly through the official website. Rumors say that one of Pepe’s original founders was removed before the launch, betrayed and shut out. He stayed silent, watched from a distance, and came back with Pepeto, holding the final two letters that Pepe never had. That’s why the listing day is now known as the Day of Redemption.

45149948,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=163175,1748333445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45149948.jpeg,Shocking Solana Co-Founder Raj Gokal’s Personal Data Leaked Via Migos Instagram Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-raj-gokal-leak/,"BitcoinWorld Shocking Solana Co-Founder Raj Gokal’s Personal Data Leaked Via Migos Instagram Hack In a bizarre and concerning incident that highlights the ever-present risks in the digital age, particularly for high-profile individuals in the cryptocurrency space, personal information belonging to Solana co-founder Raj Gokal was reportedly leaked online. The unexpected conduit for this sensitive information? The official Instagram account of the popular American hip-hop group, Migos. What Happened: The Raj Gokal Personal Data Leak Reports emerged detailing a significant Personal Data Leak affecting Raj Gokal, one of the key figures behind the Solana blockchain. According to news outlet The Block, the Instagram account associated with the group Migos briefly posted highly sensitive personal documents belonging to Gokal. This included images of his driver’s license and passport. While the posts were quickly deleted, the fact that they appeared on a widely followed celebrity account adds an unusual twist to what appears to be a targeted cyberattack. The posts reportedly contained a stark message: “You should’ve paid the 40 BTC.” This specific phrase strongly suggests that Gokal may have been subjected to extortion attempts or threats prior to this public leak. The demand for 40 Bitcoin (BTC) is a substantial amount, underscoring the severity of the alleged ransom request. The Celebrity Connection: Migos Instagram Involved The involvement of the Migos Instagram account in this incident is particularly perplexing and attention-grabbing. It raises questions about how the attackers gained access to such a prominent social media profile. Was the Migos account itself compromised? Was it used as a staging ground or a means to amplify the pressure on Raj Gokal? While the exact connection and mechanism remain unclear based on the initial reports, the use of a celebrity platform adds a layer of public spectacle to the privacy violation. It’s crucial to understand that the appearance of Gokal’s data on the Migos account does not imply any involvement or culpability from the music group themselves. It points more towards the sophisticated and often unpredictable tactics employed by cybercriminals who exploit various digital pathways to achieve their goals. Understanding Crypto Security Risks in the Digital Age This incident serves as a stark reminder of the pervasive nature of digital threats, especially for individuals associated with valuable digital assets and prominent projects like Solana . While Raj Gokal is a public figure, the attack vector highlights vulnerabilities that can affect anyone. Key risks demonstrated by this event include: Social Engineering: Attackers often use psychological manipulation to gain access to accounts or information. Account Takeovers: Compromising email, social media, or other online accounts can provide pathways to more sensitive data. Data Exploitation: Once personal information is obtained, it can be used for identity theft, further extortion, or targeted attacks. Interconnected Vulnerabilities: A weakness in one service (like email or social media) can be leveraged to compromise accounts on other, seemingly unrelated, platforms (like crypto accounts or financial services). Raj Gokal himself had previously warned about attempts to compromise his digital life. Just last week, he posted on his X account (formerly Twitter) detailing how exploiters were actively trying to take control of his email, social media, Google, Apple, and other critical online accounts. This indicates he was already under siege, and the Migos Instagram leak appears to be a potentially escalated tactic by the attackers after their initial attempts may have failed or were detected. Protecting Your Personal Data: Actionable Insights While this specific incident involved a high-profile individual, the tactics used underscore the importance of robust Crypto Security practices for everyone interacting with digital assets. Protecting your Personal Data Leak is paramount. Here are some actionable steps you can take: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Everywhere: Use strong 2FA methods (like hardware keys or authenticator apps) on all critical accounts, including email, social media, crypto exchanges, wallets, and cloud services (Google, Apple, etc.). Avoid SMS-based 2FA if possible, as it can be vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Use Unique, Strong Passwords: Never reuse passwords. Use a password manager to create and store complex, unique passwords for each account. Be Wary of Phishing Attempts: Be extremely cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or calls asking for personal information or login credentials. Always verify the source. Separate Sensitive Accounts: Consider using dedicated email addresses and devices for your most sensitive activities, like managing cryptocurrency holdings. Regularly Review Account Activity: Check your account logs and linked devices regularly for any suspicious activity. Limit Public Information: Be mindful of the personal information you share publicly online, especially on social media. The challenge lies in the interconnectedness of our digital lives. A compromise on a seemingly innocuous platform can have cascading effects, potentially impacting financial security or access to valuable digital assets like those on the Solana network. The Solana Angle: Implications Beyond the Individual? While this attack targeted an individual associated with Solana , it’s important to clarify that there is no indication that the Solana blockchain itself was compromised. The attack vector appears to be centered around Raj Gokal’s personal digital footprint and associated accounts, including the bizarre link to the Migos Instagram . However, incidents involving prominent figures in the crypto space naturally draw attention and can raise questions about the broader ecosystem’s resilience. It underscores the fact that human and operational security surrounding key personnel is just as vital as the technical security of the blockchain protocol itself. Summary: A Wake-Up Call for Digital Vigilance The unprecedented incident involving the Migos Instagram account leaking Solana co-founder Raj Gokal’s personal data serves as a dramatic illustration of the lengths cybercriminals will go to. The alleged 40 BTC ransom demand highlights the financial motivation behind such attacks. Coming on the heels of Gokal’s own warnings about attempted account takeovers, this event reinforces the critical need for robust Crypto Security and vigilance in protecting one’s Personal Data Leak across all online platforms, not just those directly related to crypto. This story is a powerful reminder that in the digital world, our security is interconnected. A breach on a social media account, even one as unexpected as the Migos Instagram , can be part of a larger, targeted effort to compromise individuals involved in valuable sectors like cryptocurrency. Staying informed and implementing strong security practices is no longer optional – it’s essential.

Our long-term goals remain the same,” the company said. This comes as Circle is gearing up for its IPO, aiming for a valuation of at least $5 billion. Earlier, Circle reportedly turned down a $4–5 billion offer from Ripple. Circle’s IPO Plans While there are rumors that Ripple may have raised its offer to around $11 billion, Circle appears to be focused on going public. Circle had filed paperwork in early April and had hired investment banks to help with its IPO plans, but the timing is not confirmed yet. In January 2024, Circle had mentioned that it was reconsidering going public after it had delayed a planned IPO in December 2022. Who Could Be the Buyer- Ripple or Coinbase? Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently weighed in on the idea of Ripple buying Circle, saying it could improve the crypto space. “There’s this Coinbase-A16Z-Circle mafia where they’ve built an ecosystem that’s self-serving. If you’re outside it, you get blacklisted — it’s hard to get listed, hard to get liquidity, and hard to access stablecoins,” Hoskinson said. By getting Ripple into the stablecoin game, he believes it could break the monopoly and make way for newer, more diverse projects. Is Coinbase A More ‘Suitable’ Candidate? On the other side, Coinbase and Circle have deep ties: they co-created USDC, share revenue from its reserves, and Coinbase even owns a stake in Circle. Coinbase gets 100% of USDC earnings if funds are held on its platform. Also, Circle cannot enter new USDC-related partnerships without Coinbase’s approval, and Coinbase gets partial IP rights if Circle goes bankrupt. With so much control and shared profit already in place, many see Coinbase as the most likely buyer. Will Circle Go Ahead With IPO? But since Circle has clarified now, only time will tell what happens next.

On May 25, 2025, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced the bold strategy, stating, “This strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.” Here’s why Pakistan is taking this high-voltage leap into the digital future: Driving Digital Growth Through Surplus Power Pakistan has experienced an electricity surplus due to heavy investment in power infrastructure and reduced industrial activity. Instead of wasting this power, the government plans to repurpose it for Bitcoin mining operations and AI data centers, enabling economic returns from otherwise idle resources. Attracting Investment and Revenue By legalizing and promoting Bitcoin mining, Pakistan aims to: Attract foreign and local investors Generate new streams of tax revenue Earn foreign exchange reserves Position itself as a sovereign digital economy in the global crypto space With crypto assets and AI technologies booming worldwide, this move could help Pakistan ride the next big digital wave. Building Tech Infrastructure and Jobs This initiative is not just about mining Bitcoin—it’s about building a digital ecosystem. By powering AI infrastructure: Pakistan boosts its domestic AI capabilities Creates high-skilled job opportunities for youth Encourages growth in fields like blockchain, data science, and cloud computing It’s a strategic approach to tackle unemployment and prepare the workforce for the future of tech. Clear Regulations, Real Impact Bilal Bin Saqib, Head of Crypto Council, called the move a “turning point” for Pakistan’s economy. He emphasized the need for transparent regulations and proper systems to fully unlock the potential of this transition. “With clear guidelines and secure systems, Pakistan can be a major player in the global crypto economy.” Joining Asia’s Crypto-Forward League Pakistan is now following in the footsteps of Kazakhstan, Japan, Malaysia, and Bhutan, all of which have embraced legal Bitcoin mining to fuel their economies. These countries have already cracked down on illicit mining and established regulated environments for digital growth. Final Take As Bitcoin prices continue to surge and AI becomes a cornerstone of global tech, Pakistan’s 2,000MW commitment signals a forward-thinking strategy.

The bold remark has reignited debate around transparency and trust in crypto. In a recent interview, Saylor outright rejected the idea of publishing on-chain proof of reserves, a practice seen by many in the crypto space as essential for transparency and trust. Saylor’s Security Concerns Saylor argued that current PoR methods weaken security by exposing sensitive data. He likened it to publishing bank account details and insisted AI analysis would reveal dozens of ways such disclosures could compromise long-term safety. Drawing from the FTX and Mt. Gox disasters, Saylor suggested that blindly chasing transparency without secure methods could do more harm than good.

Notably, Bitcoin veteran Whale Panda (Stefan Jespers) called it a “major red flag,” stressing that Bitcoin’s core value lies in its transparency. Critics argue that there are ways to verify holdings securely, without compromising asset safety. For example, Bitwise uses a “proof of holdings” method for its crypto products, and many crypto exchanges regularly publish audit reports to prove solvency. These examples contradict Saylor’s claim that such actions are inherently risky. Old Wounds and New Doubts Resurface The backlash has even reignited old doubts. Some critics pointed to Saylor’s infamous $6 billion loss in 2000 due to an accounting scandal, suggesting a pattern of avoiding transparency. Others are reviving conspiracy theories that MicroStrategy may not hold actual Bitcoin, but instead, paper-based derivatives. While Saylor remains a central figure in Bitcoin advocacy, this latest remark has cast a shadow over his approach to transparency, raising new questions about how institutional players should handle crypto accountability.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 08:16:49

On May 27, an Instagram account belonging to American rap trio, Migos, was reportedly compromised by hackers who gained access to Gokal’s personal information and used it to dox him and his wife. The now-deleted Instagram posts featured pictures of the Solana ( SOL ) Labs President holding his driver’s license and passport, both unredacted. Another post featured a woman, claimed by the hackers to be Gokal’s wife, holding her driver’s license. The seven pictures were shared to the 13 million followers on Migos’ Instagram account. One of the posts shared Gokal’s personal contact information, including his phone number. The poster then urged people to “spam” the Solana co-founder, effectively doxxing him. A caption written on the post that showed Gokal holding his driver’s license seemingly implied that he was initially blackmailed before his personal information was leaked on social media. Tagging Gokal’s Instagram account, the hacker wrote: “you should’ve paid the 40 BTC.” At current prices, 40 Bitcoin ( BTC ) would be equal to around $4.3 million.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-supporter-michael-saylor-says-publishing-proof-of-reserves-could-be-risky-for-investors-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin advocate and Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) executive chairman Michael Saylor called the approach “a bad idea” because publishing institutional-grade on-chain proofs of reserves could pose serious security risks. Michael Saylor: “Proof-of-Reserve Chain Threatens Corporate Security” “The conventional way of issuing proof of reserves today is actually insecure,” Saylor said at a side event at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. “This method undermines the security of the issuer, the custodian, the exchanges and the investors. This is not a good idea, on the contrary, it is a bad idea,” he said. Saylor declined to directly respond to Blockware Solutions principal analyst Mitchell Askew’s question about whether Strategy would publish its own proof of reserves. “Publishing Wallet Addresses Puts Company Security at Risk” Cryptocurrency exchanges and ETF issuers have started publishing proof of reserves to ensure transparency and show that user assets are actually available, especially after the collapse of FTX in 2022. Major players such as Binance, Kraken, OKX, and Bitwise have adopted this method. However, Saylor argued that this practice offered one-way transparency, emphasizing that it only showed the assets held by the company and not its liabilities, that is, its debts. Saylor also noted that publishing wallet addresses openly would leave organizations open to cyberattacks, adding, “Ask an AI, ‘How would publishing all wallet addresses compromise company security over time?’ It will give you 50 pages of security risks.” Strategy is currently the world’s largest institutional Bitcoin holder with 576,230 Bitcoins. The company’s reserves are worth around $62.6 billion. It is followed by mining company MARA Holdings with 48,137 Bitcoins. Today, more than 110 publicly traded companies around the world hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. But according to Saylor, not every practice implemented in the name of transparency, especially methods such as onchain proof of reserve, aligns with the basic principles of corporate security. *This is not investment advice.

The stock has surged due to short squeezes and meme-stock dynamics in the latest days as the company continues to ""aggressively"" accumulate Bitcoin and adopt a meme-stock character. Ultimately, it's a public listing that could be enhanced by short squeezes as it's heavily shorted, but Bitcoin underlies it, and it is already extremely volatile. Discussing a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) levered play like Tokyo-based Metaplanet Inc. ( MTPLF ) is not in the norm for us, but it has been hit by some interesting dynamics a little bit unique to a Japanese issue. There has been a short squeeze as the company adopts some meme-stock trading characteristics, and its exceptional short selling ratios has meant a squeeze has been in with a major scarcity of stocks available across the illiquid US listing and the Japanese listing that further rocketed the shares. It gained almost 200% since late April, moving up by a multiple of BTC's rise in that period, prior to that mostly trading in line with BTC. The company pivoted into this Bitcoin strategy recently, and we will say right away we have no interest in the company. They are raising major funds to speculate on Bitcoin, and their income generating strategies will to a significant degree be driven by selling put options. They may be hedging, but we couldn't find any disclosure to that effect. They did say they were cash collateralised in their option writing strategy at least. Of course, they hold massive amounts of Bitcoin, an asset whose long-term viability we seriously question, and their operating business also depends on Bitcoin going up it would seem, something we aren't going to bet on. Breakdown As far as we understood, the company is employing an all in strategy on Bitcoin. Initially, the business was focused on a hotel location in central Tokyo and also something in Hiroshima, doing hospitality, but then one day they decided that on the conviction that Bitcoin is somehow going to be the future, they would raise considerable amounts of cash, around 40 billion JPY it would seem in equity based on the balance sheet , and also some debt it would seem though they've repaid some of it, cumulatively raising around 80 billion JPY, with a plan of putting it into Bitcoin. Additionally, they have a "" treasury management "" business which is basically dominated by selling put options that are ""cash collateralised"" also on Bitcoin. They hold around 51 billion JPY in Bitcoin as of the quarterly figures, around 90% of the company's total assets. Though now it would seem that have over 100 billion JPY in Bitcoin . They seem to have gotten into this already from the beginning of 2024 when they started to purchase Bitcoin. Segment Results (Q1 Earnings) The majority of their earnings at this point at the operating level, before accounting for the impact of gains on Bitcoin, are now from the Bitcoin income generation strategy. The ordinary income contains the gains they are making on Bitcoin, which they are accumulating ""aggressively"" and as a long-term investment. In other words, Metaplanet is a Bitcoin bet, a bit like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). Metaplanet is one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin in the world. Comments There are some advantages to Metaplanet: There are some tax advantages in investing in Metaplanet as opposed to directly in Bitcoin, but this only seems to apply to Japanese tax residents. The fact that they can raise capital, particularly from debtors but also from shareholders despite the NAV premium, is very good for prior shareholders. Debt capital is also very cheap in Japan. Despite Metaplanet's employment of leverage, investors in Metaplanet are limited in liability by virtue of it being a public limited company, provided investors aren't using leverage to invest in the stock. It is highly shorted , meaning short squeezes are possible with stock to cover shorts possibly becoming suddenly very scarce, and this could become a new majorly followed meme stock. With the TSE circuit breakers kicking in frequently with it is also causes covering to be harassed. It is the most shorted stock in Japan as of a few days ago. But then there are clearly some major questions: There is no track record, yet the company is filling their presentations with data about how they're the best performing stock in the Japanese market, dominated mainly by industrial auto names and other slow movers (not as big of an accomplishment). Similarly, we don't really have much information on their income generating strategy other than that they are writing put options, which of course could one day go very badly for them. At least it's cash collateralised, which we'll take to mean they are not employing a lot of leverage. We entirely question the viability of Bitcoin. Other than the obvious, which is that it's very volatile (not a good store of value), mining is very energy and relatively time intensive, and it's not a practical currency especially compared to more reasonably managed fiat currencies, we also doubt the validity of the decentralisation principle which is at the centre of Bitcoin. In short, pool mining is the only logical way to go about finding nonces in a proof of work system. This means that coordinated miners are essentially causing centralisation , and pool mining has to be administrated by some entity. These could be compromised or may already be compromised. It's a vulnerability, and the more threatening Bitcoin becomes as an alternative to fiat, the more likely this vulnerability will be exploited if possible - though this risk is remote. It trades above NAV consistently. Currently, it is trading at multiples of its approximate NAV (around 100 billion JPY in Bitcoin, but market CAP is around 580 bn) Bottom Line As far as Metaplanet is concerned, while it may be interesting as an enhanced Bitcoin play in the event of a short squeeze, also because if it becomes used as a speculative tool to trade Bitcoin on the public markets at key moments shares will become especially scarce and buyers can also worsen squeezes by competing for shares looking to be used for cover, it is ultimately a newfangled Bitcoin play. You have to want to own Bitcoin to be interested in Metaplanet. If it becomes a meme stock, it may rocket, but it will also become incredibly volatile.

In a post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author tells his 2.7 million followers that a sudden lack of demand for US bonds is resulting in money printing, which debases the dollar. “The end is here: what if you threw a party and no one showed up? That is what happened [May 20th]. The Fed held an auction for US Bonds and no one showed up. So the Fed quietly bought $50 billion of its own fake money with fake money. The party is over. Hyperinflation is here. Millions, young and old to be wiped out financially.” Kiyosaki also says that silver, gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) are a hedge against rising inflation, and he predicts massive price targets for the assets as a result. “Good news. Gold will go to $25,000. Silver to $70. Bitcoin to $500,000 to $1 million… The end I have been warning the world about is here. May God have mercy on our souls.” Lastly, he says that the dwindling supply of available BTC for sale will drive the flagship crypto asset’s price higher. “I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich, so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years – and maybe make you very rich.

As per the local media report , Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira unveiled the country’s bold new direction at a May 26 investment seminar in Bangkok. The best part of this plan is that it will not impact the local currency, and no one knows that the user paid in crypto. It’s indeed a great initiative since many foreign nationals were in favour of this innovative move. Crypto Spending Without the Hassle Thailand, to attract tourists, will soon allow them to link their crypto holdings to credit card platforms for seamless spending. In this model, users pay in crypto, but merchants receive Thai baht, often without knowing crypto was used. This clever setup minimizes risks to the domestic currency and could be rolled out quickly, pending infrastructure and regulatory readiness. Sweeping Financial Reforms Coming Alongside the crypto tourism push, Thailand is reviewing outdated laws that separate the traditional capital markets and digital assets. Pichai emphasized the need for a unified legal framework and fewer restrictions on institutional investors like life insurers, who are currently limited to low-risk government bonds. Upcoming reforms may let them invest more freely in equities and private assets. To enhance enforcement and market fairness, a draft law is being prepared to expand the Thai SEC’s authority, allowing it to take major cases straight to prosecutors. The government is also eyeing tighter rules on high-frequency trading and reforms around treasury stocks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Goes All In on Bitcoin Mining With 2,000MW Energy Move , Pichai Backs Blockchain Innovation Pichai reiterated his support for digital assets, highlighting the upcoming launch of blockchain-based “G-Tokens” that will allow retail investors to buy fractional government bonds.

After going back down as far as $106,600 over the last few days, Bitcoin is now consolidating above this level. Is this about to become good horizontal support and a springboard into the next stage of this bull market? Bond market under severe duress Cracks are opening in the global monetary system. Bond markets across the world are in disarray. In the US, buyers just cannot be found for longer duration bonds, and this is revealed in constantly rising 10, 20, and 30 year yields that just can’t seem to be kept down no matter what the US treasury does about it. The 10 year yield has dropped over the last few days from over 4.6% to 4.45%, but a higher high was put in, and this could be followed by a higher low, meaning that the trend could continue to go up. It might be argued that trust is the main element that is lacking in government bonds in these incredibly uncertain times, as more people begin to realise that governments are being forced to debase their currencies, thereby stealing the purchasing power of citizens, in order to be able to roll over the debt and keep the system going - albeit on life support. Bitcoin becoming more attractive It’s in this world that the Bitcoin life raft is floating. It has just surpassed both Amazon and Google to become the 5th biggest asset by market capitalization , at around $2.17 trillion. That said, there are still many across social and mainstream media platforms that would have us think that Bitcoin has made a market cycle top and that it’s generally downhill from here. With the greatest respect to many of these detractors who undoubtedly do have sound economic credentials, why would investors sell their Bitcoin now into fiat currency? Fiat is the problem - not Bitcoin. Fiat can be magicked into existence in the blink of an eye - Bitcoin cannot. This gives Bitcoin an attraction that puts it in the same category as gold, although more gold can be dug out of the ground to boost its supply. $BTC short-term chart Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the $106,000 horizontal support (orange line) has been well respected. The previous all-time high resistance (blue line) is now in the process of being flipped into support. If the bulls are successful in doing this it would likely only be a matter of time before a new all-time high is made, and a more sustained surge takes the price to higher levels. The importance of the $106,000 horizontal support Source: TradingView The daily chart shows just how important the $106,000 horizontal level has become. It rests on some of the daily candle tops of the big bull flag, and this support is also noticeable in recent price action. It may be that the bulls aren’t ready to make their move higher yet, and there could be some more sideways price action that tests this strong support base. Having said that, if the current resistance does become support, we would perhaps be more likely to see upwards price action from here. Of course, there is also the possibility of a negative or positive catalyst that spurs the price in one direction or the other. Bitcoin is the life raft out of the system Nevertheless, asset prices are imaginably going to rise from here, benefitting from the amount of money printing or other methods that introduce more liquidity into the system. Ready to climb higher into the final stage of a cycle that could be about to increase in duration, Bitcoin is the soundest money out there. If central banks are buying gold, it means that trust in the monetary system is dwindling. Buying Bitcoin is your life raft out of this system.

Here’s How to Turn $1K to $20K,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-coming-heres-how-to-turn-1k-to-20k/,"The post Altcoin Season Coming? Here’s How to Turn $1K to $20K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With crypto markets heating gain and Bitcoin just hitting a new all-time high . Many people are now wondering, can $1,000 turn into $10K, $20K, or even more with crypto in 2025? George from CryptosRUS says it’s possible, but only if you’re smart about it. He recently shared his plan for 2025, including which coins to choose, when to buy, and what mistakes to avoid. Don’t Chase 100x Dreams Too Fast In a recent interview with Altcoin Daily, George laid out his thoughts on how newcomers can grow small investments without falling into risky traps. George started by saying it’s not realistic to expect a 100x return overnight. Trying too hard to turn $1,000 into $100,000 quickly often leads people into bad trades. Instead of gambling, he recommends aiming for steady gains and keeping your expectations in check. Don’t Ignore Bitcoin For someone just starting, George believes the best place to put most of your money is in pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. While many skip Bitcoin because it looks “too expensive,” to make real money, he sees it differently. He points out that even a 10x or 20x return is possible over a full cycle—which still turns $1K into $10K or $20K. Compared to traditional investments like stocks or bonds, crypto still wins on speed and return. Look Out for Meme Coins—but Be Smart George doesn’t dismiss meme coins . In fact, in previous cycles, he mentioned coins like Pepe that saw massive growth, 20x to 50x in some cases. However, he stresses that this space is tricky. Thousands of new meme coins launch daily, but only a tiny few go viral. Even popular ones like WIF, Bonk, or Pepe are currently down 50% or more from their peaks. His advice? Don’t jump into every new coin blindly. Instead, watch the market, look for momentum, and if the meme coin trend heats up again, then it might be time to take a chance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price to Hit $135K by July 2025 , Strategy Over Hype In the end, George suggests a simple plan: put a good portion into reliable names, likely Bitcoin and a few strong altcoins, and keep an eye on the market. If conditions improve and memes regain strength, shift some money into trending tokens. “$1,000 might not become $100K fast,” he said, “but turning it into $10K or $20K? That’s very possible—if you play it smart.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The material is suspected to be KYC images, which raised questions about whether the source may be linked to a recent Coinbase data breach. The caption accompanying the doxxed information read, “You should’ve paid the 40 BTC,” suggesting an extortion attempt. The bio was also changed to “CHECK BIO FOR MEMECOIN” after the hack. Gokal’s accounts were reportedly socially engineered, and the attackers posted the materials via the hijacked Migos IG account after he refused to pay. Solana’s Gokal says hackers have been attempting to control his social media accounts TLDR >Raj got social engineered for access to an email account a few days ago >Attacker attempted to extort him with PII obtained from the account after but he didn’t pay >Same attacker compromised Migos Instagram account today >Attacker posted Raj’s PII from the Migos account — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) May 27, 2025 Last week, Solana’s Raj tweeted that attackers tried to gain control of his email and social media accounts. On May 27, hackers hijacked the Migos Instagram account, which has over 13 million followers, and leaked personal information about Solana co-founder and his wife in a blackmail attempt. The attackers demanded a ransom of 40 BTC (~$4.4 million) through posts that remained live for roughly 90 minutes, gaining thousands of interactions before being deleted. Experts like online sleuth ZachXBT believe phishing and social engineering were used in the breach and highlighted persistent security flaws on Instagram, mainly affecting inactive celebrity accounts. Meta is under fire for its slow response, prompting renewed calls for stronger security measures and quicker user support in hacking incidents. The Roll Up’s co-founders and host, Andy, claimed that the Migos had not posted anything since February 15th, 2024, adding that the incident was very unfortunate for Gokal and made IG policies against doxxing look weak so far. “Attackers have been trying to take control of my email, social media, Google, Apple, etc. this past week. If you see anything suspect (token launch, soliciting funds, etc) that means they got through. Be careful out there.” – Raj Gokal , Co-founder of Solana According to Andy, Instagram deleted the posts to cover up Gokal’s personal information as best as possible. Still, he added that there appeared to be a guy, “Arvind,” who also had their SOL balance leaked through the same Migos IG. Also, a link was posted to a Telegram group that appeared to be selling unreleased music. Coinbase discloses a months-long breach of data affecting 69.46K customers Coinbase disclosed last week that a months-long data breach resulted in the theft of personal and financial information from at least 69,461 customers, less than 1% of Coinbase’s monthly transacting users. The US-based crypto company’s filing said the breach dated back to December 26, 2024, and continued until earlier this month. Coinbase also faces an action lawsuit after its stock prices dipped because of the disclosure of data breaches. Plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase failed to disclose the breach on time, leading to a stock price dip. The breach occurred when cybercriminals used social engineering to bribe overseas customer support agents into stealing sensitive data from Coinbase systems. The company received an anonymous email from the hackers on May 11, which included a ransom demand for $20 million in exchange for not releasing the stolen information. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, responded to the incident by stating that the company had notified the DOJ and was working with other U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to pursue criminal charges against these bad actors. The U.S. Justice Department has since opened an investigation into the security breach. Coinbase clarified that some personal information was compromised, including names, contact details, masked Social Security numbers, and bank account information. However, no customer funds, passwords, private keys, or wallet access were affected. Additionally, the attackers did not gain access to hot or cold wallets. Coinbase Prime users were also not compromised.

It points out that Bitcoin’s existing cryptographic protections— SHA-256 and ECDSA —are secure against classical computers but could be broken by quantum algorithms like Shor’s. This concern echoes the findings in NIST’s 2024 post-quantum cryptography standards . Adding urgency to this, Google’s recent breakthrough , led by Craig Gidney, shows that cracking RSA encryption could be possible with less than 1 million qubits , a sharp drop from earlier estimates of 20 million. As quantum computing advances, with IBM aiming for 100,000 qubits by 2033 , the crypto industry faces a shrinking timeline to adapt. The Bitcoin developer community is already aware of the threat. According to @21Mfacts on X, it’s possible to introduce quantum-resistant cryptography via soft forks , avoiding full network splits. Meanwhile, companies like SEALSQ are ahead of the curve, using NIST-approved algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium to secure blockchain systems—signaling that industry solutions are already taking shape.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-27 09:22:20

Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $20.52 level by 2027 and above $42.11 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing an increasing phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining value, and so is UNI. As buyers gained confidence around $6.728, positive sentiment took over the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $9.72, while the average price is expected to be around $8.10. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.2 and $8.3; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $42.11 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

Crypto whales have been accumulating SOL betting on its continued dominance as Ethereum’s top competitor. Meanwhile rising star Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention for potentially steeper gains. The project is currently in Presale Phase 5, already raking in over $9.3 million with over 11,500 investors participating. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 5 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 100% by the time the token hits exchanges. Mutuum Finance could hit $2 soon after launch. Solana (SOL) Targets $250 in June Amid Bullish Momentum Solana (SOL) is experiencing renewed investor enthusiasm with its current price around $174.17. Analysts are eyeing a potential surge to $250 in June fueled by a combination of institutional interest ecosystem growth and DeFi resurgence. As developers flock to Solana for its high-speed low-fee infrastructure its utility continues to drive long-term investor confidence. The network’s high-speed transactions and low fees continue to attract developers and users alike, solidifying Solana’s position as a leading layer-1 blockchain. As the broader crypto market gains momentum emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also capturing investor attention for their growth potential. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Certik Audit Completed: Mutuum Finance Solidifies Trust and Transparency Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance has now officially completed its Certik smart contract audit, reinforcing the platform’s commitment to safety and reliability. Their open-source smart contracts are secure in design, instilling trust among users. Additionally, the platform is built for compatibility with both non-EVM and EVM blockchains, broadening access and increasing liquidity across ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.03, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A 16.67% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.035 in the next phase. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. Both Solana and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are capturing major attention in the crypto space, each offering compelling value in their own right. Solana is poised for a potential breakout to $250 by June, powered by strong institutional interest, expanding DeFi activity, and its unmatched transaction efficiency. Meanwhile Mutuum Finance has surged past $9.3 million raised in Presale Phase 5 drawing over 11,500 investors with its dual lending model and recently completed Certik audit. At the current presale price of $0.03 and a confirmed listing price of $0.06 early participants could realize up to 100% gains—or more with post-launch projections as high as $3. Now is the time to explore Mutuum Finance before the next price phase kicks in.

Metaplanet is currently the most shorted stock in Japan, data shows, reflecting mounting skepticism among hedge funds over the company’s valuation and perceived NAV distortion. Currently trading at 1,116 yen, Metalpanet’s stock is up over 400% in the last six months and over 200% this month alone, fueled by the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy.. Often dubbed as ‘Japan’s Strategy,’ Metaplanet adopted a Bitcoin-first treasury strategy in 2024, which has contributed to its meteoric stock rally.

The UK-based exchange plans to open a physical office during the second quarter in Nigeria — its “fastest-growing market” in West Africa — along with broader expansion efforts in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, according to a May 27 report by Bloomberg. “Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa, reportedly said. The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

The altcoins are slightly in the red on a daily scale, including the recent high-flyer HYPE, which has lost some steam after the latest ATH. BTC Back to $109.5K History was made last Wednesday when, after a few days of substantial volatility and rejection below the $107,000 level, the primary cryptocurrency managed to break through and shot past its January 2025 all-time high of around $109,100. The asset flew to $109,800 that day but was quickly stopped and driven south by around three grand. However, that correction was short-lived as the bulls resumed control of the market and initiated an even more impressive leg up on Thursday – the so-called Bitcoin Pizza Day. Back then, BTC skyrocketed to almost $112,000 to chart a fresh all-time high. Trump’s tariff recommendations against the EU on Friday brought some pain and uncertainty to the market, as BTC slipped back down to $107,500. However, it defended that level and stood just above it during the weekend. Bitcoin started to gain traction again on Monday and jumped to a daily high of $110,500 before it slumped to $107,500 later in the evening.

This development, alongside the launch of RLUSD on Multi-Asset Margining, is already stirring conversations about its potential ripple effects across the broader XRP ecosystem. Bill Morgan, a prominent legal expert and well-known voice in the XRP community, reacted to the announcement on X, calling it “doubly good news for the XRP ecosystem.” However, despite recognizing the significance of this update, Morgan tempered expectations by noting that he did not expect the market to react immediately with a price surge. He stated plainly, “I expect the market not to react to the news and no increase in the price of XRP.” Doubly good news for the XRP ecosystem. I expect the market to have no reaction to the news and now increase in the price of XRP. https://t.co/dOtl18CByw — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 27, 2025 BitMEX Expands XRP Utility for Derivatives Traders BitMEX, one of the world’s largest and most established cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, has long been a major player in offering leveraged trading products to institutional and retail traders. By adding XRP as a margin asset, BitMEX is effectively increasing XRP’s utility, allowing traders to use it as collateral in derivative contracts. This development is significant because it expands XRP’s role beyond cross-border payments, establishing it as a valuable asset in high-volume crypto trading. Introducing RLUSD to Multi-Asset Margining further enhances BitMEX’s ecosystem by allowing traders to optimize capital efficiency, reduce liquidation risks, and gain broader flexibility in managing leveraged positions. The addition of XRP to BitMEX, alongside RLUSD, has sparked renewed debate about XRP’s market potential and its prospects for institutional adoption. Why the Market Reaction May Lag Despite the clear technological and functional advantages, Bill Morgan’s tempered expectations reflect a broader understanding of how the crypto market processes news. Historically, XRP’s price movements have not always correlated immediately with positive ecosystem developments. For instance, regulatory overhang from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ongoing legal entanglements with Ripple has cast a long shadow over investor sentiment, sometimes dampening the impact of fundamentally positive news. Morgan’s comment underscores the gap between ecosystem progress and price action. While XRP’s increased integration into trading platforms like BitMEX signals growing institutional and retail utility, such advancements often require sustained market confidence and broader adoption to translate into meaningful price rallies. Investors have grown cautious, frequently waiting for clear legal resolutions or macroeconomic shifts before piling into speculative price movements. The Broader Legal Context and Market Sentiment Bill Morgan’s influence in the XRP community stems from his legal expertise and commentary on the SEC vs. Ripple case, one of the most closely watched legal battles in the crypto world. Since Judge Analisa Torres’ landmark ruling in July 2023 concluded that Ripple’s programmatic XRP sales did not constitute securities offerings, XRP has been fighting to reclaim its position among top-tier digital assets. However, the lingering effects of the lawsuit, pending appeals, and broader regulatory uncertainties have made market participants hesitant, even as Ripple secures new global partnerships and expands its technological footprint. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This BitMEX development adds to a growing list of use cases and integrations that strengthen XRP’s fundamental value proposition. Nevertheless, as Morgan rightly points out, legal clarity and regulatory confidence remain key levers for unlocking widespread market enthusiasm and boosting the XRP price. A Stronger Ecosystem, But Cautious Optimism XRP’s integration as a margin asset on BitMEX is undeniably a major step forward, marking another milestone in XRP’s journey from a specialized remittance token to a multifaceted digital asset with diverse use cases. It reflects a vote of confidence from one of the industry’s top derivatives exchanges and offers practical utility for traders seeking liquidity, flexibility, and capital efficiency. Yet, as Bill Morgan’s commentary emphasizes, the road to sustained price appreciation may be longer than market participants hope. While announcements like these lay the foundation for future growth, they do not guarantee immediate rallies. Instead, they represent part of a larger puzzle: strengthening the ecosystem, deepening market integrations, and, most importantly, navigating the complex legal and regulatory landscape that still defines XRP’s trajectory. In summary, while the BitMEX announcement is indeed “doubly good news” for XRP, investors and traders may need to balance their excitement with measured patience. With ongoing legal challenges and a cautious market environment, the path to a sustained XRP price rally will likely require more than technical integrations — it will demand regulatory breakthroughs and renewed market confidence.

Foreign sales, adjusted for seasonal changes, fell by 36% compared to March. Imports from the US also decreased by 15%, according to a statement from the customs office in Bern. The sharp downturn follows two months of robust export activity to the US, suggesting that Swiss exporters had accelerated shipments ahead of the anticipated tariffs, which President Trump signaled on April 2. Switzerland seeks a trade agreement with the US Switzerland’s overall trade figures showed a decline in exports and imports, resulting in a record trade surplus of 6.3 billion Swiss francs worth $7.7 billion. According to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Switzerland had taken the lead in seeking a trade agreement with the United States. Bessent revealed this after the Alpine nation hosted the US-China trade discussions over the weekend. Before the talks with the two countries, Swiss officials met with Bessent, his team, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to discuss Switzerland’s trade issues with the US. These concerns were raised after the United States imposed a 31% tariff on Switzerland, while it set tariffs of 20% on the European Union and 10% on Britain. This decision surprised Swiss officials, and since then, major Swiss companies have committed to investing significantly in the US. It is worth noting that Trump later suspended many global tariffs, lowering them to a standard rate of 10%. Following Switzerland’s extensive talk on Trump’s tariffs, Bessent noted that the UK and Switzerland had moved to the front of the line for trade deals, but the EU has been much slower. During a press conference in Geneva, he commented about Switzerland’s role as a go-between, especially as its neutrality appears to be changing and Gulf countries are becoming more active. The reason for the EU being slower in reaching a trade deal was that the EU had indicated that it would not agree to an unfair deal on US tariffs and has suggested possible counteractions. Last week, Britain quickly finalized a trade agreement with US President Donald Trump’s administration, but it is limited in scope. On the other hand, Switzerland long aimed to be a mediator during global crises, and analysts noted that it made a special effort this time. They highlighted the choice of location for the negotiations, which took place at the private home of Switzerland’s UN ambassador. Switzerland seeks closer ties with the EU as Trump’s tariff becomes more uncertain US President Donald Trump’s choice to impose higher tariffs on Switzerland than on most European countries shocked the export-driven nation, leading it to seek closer ties with the European Union as it worked to manage the consequences. In December, Switzerland took a first step toward deeper economic ties by reaching a political agreement with Brussels to improve their trading relationship. Though this EU agreement needed to go through a lengthy approval process, Swiss President and Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter highlighted it in an interview as she evaluated Switzerland’s options after the US trade decision. In the Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Keller-Sutter Highlighted the urgency of the relationship, revealing that they wanted to stabilize and deepen relations with the EU. One of the reasons behind the urgency for this relationship was that Neutral Switzerland had built a successful, open economy based on a low-tax business model and direct democracy, making it wealthier than almost all EU member states. This success fostered national pride and resistance to becoming part of the EU. After the tariffs were imposed, Keller-Sutter quickly contacted EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and agreed to keep close communication.

Speaking at a side event during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 26, Saylor called the widely adopted transparency method “a bad idea.” Saylor was responding to a question from Blockware Solutions’ lead analyst Mitchell Askew, who asked whether Strategy would consider publishing its own proof-of-reserves . While Saylor did not provide a direct answer, he made it clear that he believes the practice is fundamentally flawed. “The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” he stated, adding that it weakens the overall security framework by making wallet addresses traceable. A Growing Industry Trend Post-FTX The push for proof-of-reserves gained momentum after the high-profile collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. In the wake of that event, many crypto firms — including Binance, Kraken, OKX, and Bitwise — began publishing cryptographic proof that they held enough assets to back customer deposits. The goal was to restore trust in the industry and assure users their funds were safe. But Saylor remains unconvinced. He pointed out that these proofs often only demonstrate what a company owns, not what it owes, offering an incomplete picture of its financial health. He also emphasized that publicizing wallet addresses opens the door to serious vulnerabilities. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses,” he said. “Go to AI, put it in deep think mode… it would write 50 pages of security problems.” Saylor: A Bitcoin Maximalist Saylor’s Strategy is currently the largest corporate Bitcoin holder , with 576,230 BTC worth around $62.6 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. The company is followed by MARA Holdings, which holds over 48,000 BTC. Globally, more than 110 publicly listed companies have Bitcoin on their balance sheets. While the crypto community continues to debate the merits of transparency versus security, Saylor’s stance signals a cautionary approach. For him, safeguarding digital assets means more than public accountability — it means keeping critical data private.

Here Are Analyst Views and Technical Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-a-correction-coming-for-bitcoin-btc-here-are-analyst-views-and-technical-data/,"Bitcoin Could Retreat to $100K, Technical Signals: Sign of Weakening Momentum According to technical analyst Omkar Godbole, the BTC price could rally outside the ascending channel and test the key support level at $100,000. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the highest market value, was trading at $109,500 at the time of writing, according to Binance TR data, testing the ascending trend line stretching from $75,000 to above $110,000. According to TradingView data, price action has struggled to gain upward momentum over the past 24 hours. Despite reports that the Trump family-owned media company was planning to buy $3 billion worth of crypto, the market did not react strongly to this development. What Do Technical Indicators Say? Godbole noted that the 30-day rate of change (ROC), a key indicator measuring Bitcoin’s momentum, is showing a “distinctive negative divergence.” This indicator is indicating weakening momentum, with Bitcoin price forming lower highs, although it is still within an ascending channel. Another noteworthy signal is the MACD histogram. The transition of this indicator into the negative territory indicates a decrease in trend strength and that the upward movement may slow down. The combination of these technical developments means that Bitcoin could break out of the current ascending channel and retest the $100,000 psychological support level. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Despite all these short-term risks, the overall outlook remains positive. In particular, the “golden cross” formed by the intersection of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) indicates that the long-term uptrend continues. According to analysts, this short-term correction can be considered a healthy consolidation process and will not shake the foundations of the bull market. However, investors are advised to closely monitor technical indicators. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is a Correction Coming for Bitcoin (BTC)?

Life insurance companies in Japan—known for holding long-term government bonds—are now selling off these assets. They’re not doing it to make profits or to react to short-term market trends. They’re doing it because they have no choice. These insurers have long been seen as reliable holders of government debt , often ignoring price swings because they invest for the long haul. But rising interest rates and changing financial conditions have made that strategy too risky. They are now being forced to sell, not out of strategy, but out of necessity. Understanding the Duration Gap Problem This crisis starts with something called the “duration gap.” Simply put, this is the mismatch between how long insurers expect to hold assets like bonds and how quickly they may need to pay out liabilities. Japanese insurers typically hold long-term bonds—some lasting 10 to 30 years—but now, rising interest rates are making these holdings too dangerous. The value of long-term bonds drops sharply when interest rates rise, leaving insurers exposed to sudden losses. They’re being margin-wrecked —meaning their losses are so big they’re being forced to sell to protect their capital. Why Japan’s Bond Market Matters to the World This is not just a Japan issue. Japan is a major player in global finance , holding large amounts of U.S. and European government debt. Its institutions also play a big role in currency markets, especially in how they use Japanese yen (JPY) to invest in other countries. When they start pulling back, the effects are global: Yields (interest rates) on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) rise The Bank of Japan may have to act, or risk losing control The yen weakens, while the U.S. dollar strengthens Risky assets worldwide start to drop in value as money moves to safety The Last Safety Net Is Breaking For years, the world believed that government bonds were “safe” assets—things that never lose value and always have a buyer. That belief is now under pressure. Japanese life insurers were the last big investors who didn’t care about short-term losses , and now they do. Their sudden exit is a sign that even the most trusted part of the financial system is no longer stable. This is causing reactions like: Bigger price swings in U.S. government bonds More investment in gold and Bitcoin Less money flowing into riskier emerging markets Bitcoin’s Moment in the Spotlight When trusted financial systems start to show cracks, people look for alternatives. Assets like Bitcoin and gold—things that don’t rely on governments or interest rates—become attractive . Not because the world is ending, but because the idea of “safe” government bonds is being questioned. This is one of those rare moments when the financial world wakes up and realizes: what we believed to be stable may not be so after all.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-27 09:52:13

Schwartz’s remarks, shared through multiple clips of a recent stage talk, emphasized the challenges Ripple has faced and the foundation now being laid for a more viable and institutionally integrated crypto ecosystem. Schwartz clarified that the route for Ripple and XRP has been indirect and complex. He explained that while Ripple committed to payments in 2014, the process has not followed a linear path. Schwartz emphasized that for global adoption to materialize, users must be able to access their funds instantly, especially for essential expenses. His statements suggest that while the journey has been long, adoption has begun, and the path is becoming clearer. This wasn’t a roadmap. It was a confession. Ripple’s CTO just admitted that crypto’s path to adoption won’t be clean or direct, but it’s already begun. And for the first time in years, XRP is in position to lead. Here’s what David Schwartz just revealed and why it matters now… pic.twitter.com/We71vwlugV — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) May 23, 2025 Functional Balance and Ledger Evolution Discussing the XRP Ledger (XRPL), Schwartz positioned it between Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of capability. Bitcoin offers limited functions, and Ethereum is broadly programmable, but the XRPL is designed for fixed functions, covering most financial use cases without the unpredictability of custom smart contracts. The XRPL’s fixed function design lets users engage with the blockchain without the uncertainty they would have on Ethereum’s network, where they cannot verify the functions of smart contracts or audit them. He also pointed to recent advancements, including the addition of decentralized identity features and automated market makers (AMMs), decentralized ID, lending protocols, and more. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 U.S. Market Reentry and Regulatory Clarity One of the most notable admissions in Schwartz’s remarks involved Ripple’s strategic shift away from the U.S. due to unclear regulatory pressures. He explained that Ripple had to move hiring, development, and customer acquisition overseas. However, the climate is beginning to shift . Ripple’s licensed payment product, Ripple Payments, now operates within the U.S., and Schwartz expressed optimism that soft regulatory barriers are starting to ease. Schwartz highlighted the need for “predictability,” stressing that Ripple will comply with regulations as long as they are clearly defined. Liquidity, Rational Markets, and the Path Forward Schwartz noted that crypto markets behave rationally with sufficient liquidity and access, with prices reflecting adoption odds. Applying this rationale to XRP, Jungle Inc. emphasized that recent gains are not driven by speculation, but by increasing institutional access and improved infrastructure. Schwartz highlighted increasing ties between traditional finance and crypto, expecting tokenized real-world assets to boost DeFi. According to Jungle Inc., XRP is now positioned to lead in this emerging phase, having navigated years of regulatory uncertainty and infrastructure development.

The company announced that BGUSD offers an annual yield of 4%, which is credited daily to users’ spot accounts. Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC ( USDC ) or USDt ( USDT ), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand. The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph. The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestations In response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing. “Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.” Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph. Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply. Related: Stablecoins’ dominance due to limitations of US banking — Jerald David Yield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11 billion Bitget’s move into yield-bearing stablecoins comes as the asset class has surged to $11 billion . According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US.

As per stats, there is a high chance that Bitcoin might go up to $250,000 by 2026, but what about coins like Shiba Inu and Cardano? How high can they go? Besides, the meme-utility project, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , would have officially launched by then surpassing both SHIB and ADA. With YETIO 100K giveaway now live, attracting more investors to its presale. Shiba Inu and Cardano’s State in 2026 The meme coin Shiba Inu has been showing its potential since Bitcoin climbed the ladder. Though it has been experiencing a dip of 1.14% in the past 24 hours , the entire week was quite prosperous for Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu price went as high as $0.0000160 on May 23, 2025, the time when Bitcoin was moving past the $111,000 mark. It clearly shows that Shiba Inu’s growth depends majorly on Bitcoin. Besides, the burn rate of Shiba Inu has increased by more than 108% in the last 24 hours which is increasing its scarcity in the market. Looking at the token burn mechanism of Shiba Inu, and its exponential growth as compared to Bitcoin, there are high chances that the meme coin might be somewhere near the $0.001 mark by 2026. On the other hand, Cardano has also been showing the same pattern as Shiba Inu in terms of growth. Though its value has decreased by 1.05% in the past week (currently standing at $0.7363), Cardano did show some pretty good growth on Friday. ADA price went as high as $0.8395 on May 23, 2025. As per reports, the trading volume of Cardano has increased by $1.2 billion despite the coin showing declining values. Moreover, the Cardano ecosystem is also growing, and as per data, the stablecoin market cap of the said coin has increased to $30.1 million, a whopping 30% rise . As Cardano continues to move forward, there are high chances that it will reach the $0.1 mark by the end of 2025, and it might hover around the same in 2026. YETIO Rising In 2026 Despite being in the presale era, YETIO has managed to bring in more than 200% profit for the investors. From a $0.012 token value to currently marked at $0.041, YETIO has managed to raise more than $4.2 million during this period, which is quite remarkable for any project. The growing value and investors’ interests show trust that the project will do well after the launch period. The way YETIO engages with its community through various activities and bonuses ensures that the project will remain in the market for a long time. One of the classic examples of YETIO’s community-engaging activity is its current giveaway of $100,000 worth of tokens . The team is conducting a massive giveaway where five users will be rewarded with $20,000 of YETIO tokens. The giveaway is already live and has captured the attention of all YETIO investors. The project is also offering investors a 20% bonus on token purchases with an additional 5% for purchases over $500. Since the project has a limit of 1 billion tokens, it is already making YETIO availability scarce, which will increase its demand post-launch as well. The tactic of limiting the token supply has worked wonders for various projects in the past, and the chances of it working in YETIO’s favor are also high. Besides, the Yeti Ouro team has been working on its main project, the upcoming game, Yeti Go, which will also serve as a space for earning and spending the YETIO tokens. The racing game is still being developed, but the team has already revealed some of its unique features, one of which includes the play-to-earn tactic. Upon completing missions and races, the users will be rewarded with YETIO tokens, which will cause more investors to flock toward the project. However, the game itself has managed to capture the attention of the gaming community through its cutting-edge technology, amazing graphics, PVP mode, mini-games, and much more, which have been revealed in recent trailers. Yeti Go drops you into a sleek, high-speed world where every turn, sound, and visual is engineered for impact. Built with the expertise of the studio behind iconic titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, this game is all about intensity and immersion. The soundtrack—produced by industry pros who’ve worked alongside Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid—adds a cinematic pulse that keeps the action flowing. All these factors increase the chances of YETIO growing at an incredible speed after its official launch.

For those invested in the future of digital assets, virtual worlds, and the metaverse, the ability to generate complex environments quickly is paramount. This is where the next wave of innovation lies, and it’s precisely the challenge a new European venture, SpAItial, is tackling head-on, aiming to revolutionize how we create and interact with AI 3D models. AI 3D Models: The Next Frontier in Digital Creation While AI has already mastered generating realistic images from text prompts, the creation of full, coherent 3D online environments is still in its early stages. This represents a significant leap forward, moving from flat visuals to immersive, navigable spaces. Matthias Niessner, a leading figure in European AI and visual computing research at the Technical University of Munich, is at the forefront of this transition. Recognizing the immense potential, he has taken a leave to launch SpAItial, a startup dedicated to cracking the code for generating advanced AI 3D models. Fueling Innovation: $13M Seed for Foundation Models SpAItial has burst onto the scene with an impressive $13 million seed funding round. This is a notably large amount for a European startup at such an early stage, especially considering they have primarily shown teaser videos demonstrating text-to-3D room generation. The round was spearheaded by Earlybird Venture Capital, a prominent European early-stage investor known for backing successful tech companies. Additional support came from Speedinvest and a group of high-profile angel investors. This substantial investment underscores the market’s belief in the potential of developing powerful foundation models for 3D content creation. Building the Dream Team for Generative AI The confidence from investors is largely attributed to the caliber of the team Niessner has assembled. Joining him are: Ricardo Martin-Brualla: Previously worked on Google’s innovative 3D teleconferencing platform, now known as Beam. David Novotny: Spent six years at Meta, where he led their project focused on generating 3D assets from text descriptions. This collective experience from tech giants provides SpAItial with a strong technical foundation. They are also joined by Luke Rogers, a former Cazoo executive, who will focus on the business side, ensuring the venture has a solid commercial strategy for its ambitious generative AI goals. Navigating the Competitive Landscape for AI Startups While the text-to-image space is crowded, the field for text-to-3D environment generation is less so, though competition exists. Companies like Odyssey, which has raised $27 million for entertainment applications, and World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li and already valued over $1 billion, are also working in similar areas, often with a focus on photorealism. However, Niessner sees this as relatively little competition compared to other AI model types and, more importantly, against the backdrop of the ‘bigger vision’ he is pursuing for AI startups in this domain. Cracking the ‘Holy Grail’ of Text to 3D Niessner articulates this ‘bigger vision’ as the true ‘Holy Grail’ of 3D generation. It’s not just about creating a static 3D world, but one that is interactive and behaves realistically. Imagine a virtual glass that can shatter or a door that can be opened naturally. Achieving this level of fidelity and interactivity from a simple text prompt is the ultimate goal, something nobody has fully cracked yet. This capability would unlock a vast range of applications, from highly realistic video games and entertainment experiences to practical uses in 3D visualizations for construction, digital twins, and even training environments for robotics. The potential market opportunity, often cited as a ‘trillion-dollar’ space encompassing everything from augmented reality to simulations, is immense, though defining a precise go-to-market strategy remains a key challenge for companies developing these advanced foundation models. SpAItial’s Strategy and Roadmap To navigate the broad potential market, SpAItial plans to initially license its foundation model API to developers. This approach allows downstream partners to build specific applications for various uses, bypassing the need for SpAItial to become an expert in every potential vertical. A key early task will be identifying partners who can work with earlier model versions versus those requiring higher quality outputs. Niessner emphasizes a focus on quality over quantity in hiring, stating the team won’t immediately grow to hundreds. The immediate roadmap involves generating larger and more interactive 3D spaces. Niessner believes that enabling a 10-year-old to create their own video game in 10 minutes via text is a more achievable ‘Holy Grail’ than simply generating static 3D objects, given current platform restrictions. Ultimately, SpAItial aims high, potentially disrupting established industries like CAD design as the next chapter in 3D generation unfolds, powered by advanced text to 3D capabilities. SpAItial’s significant seed funding and experienced team position it as a key player in the emerging text-to-3D space. Their focus on interactive, realistic environments represents a bold step towards unlocking the full potential of generative AI for digital worlds. While challenges remain in defining the market and scaling the technology, the pursuit of the ‘Holy Grail’ of 3D creation promises exciting developments for developers, creators, and anyone interested in the future of digital interaction.

The decision is being weighed by the Ministry of Finance, according to Reuters , and will likely be finalized in June after talks with market participants. This possible cut targets bonds with the longest maturities—specifically 20-, 30-, and 40-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs)—after demand dropped sharply and yields surged to multi-year highs. Traditional buyers like life insurers have started pulling back, while global investors have grown cautious as Japan’s massive public debt raises questions about long-term sustainability. Bond yields fall as market reacts to possible cuts The market responded fast. The 30-year JGB yield fell by 12.5 basis points to 2.91%, hitting its lowest level since May 14. At the same time, the benchmark 10-year yield fell 5 basis points to 1.455%. The news dragged down the yen, which weakened 0.3% against the dollar to 143.275. Even US Treasuries moved, with the 30-year Treasury yield falling 7 basis points to 4.963% in early London trading. The sharp moves started after the finance ministry sent out a questionnaire to financial institutions, asking how much super-long debt should be issued for the rest of the fiscal year. Traders saw that as a clear hint that officials want to scale back the long end of the curve to calm the volatility and match weak demand. Following that, Japan’s 20-year yield dropped 19.5 basis points to 2.31%, and 40-year yields tumbled 25 basis points, further confirming how sensitive the market has become. The effects also spilled into US bond markets, where the decline in Japanese yields triggered a global wave of buying, especially in longer-dated securities. Japan’s total bond issuance to remain at 172.3 trillion yen Despite the possible cuts to longer-term bonds, the overall amount of debt Japan plans to issue this fiscal year will stay the same—172.3 trillion yen, or $1.21 trillion, until March 2026. What might change is the composition. If the ministry trims super-long maturities, it will likely sell more shorter-term debt instead. That could include 2-, 5-, or 10-year bonds, depending on where demand is stronger. Analysts like Shier Lee Lim, lead FX and macro strategist at Convera Singapore, believe the change is being driven by pressure from bond vigilantes—investors who sell off debt to protest irresponsible fiscal behavior. “The shift in issuance strategy is seen as a response to rising pressure from bond vigilantes — investors who push back against unsustainable fiscal policies,” Shier said. “While short-term sentiment has improved, the increased reliance on shorter-dated issuance may lead to higher rollover risks over time.” That risk is real. Swapping long-dated debt for short-term notes might help lower current yields and calm traders, but it also means Japan will have to refinance its debt more frequently—and in possibly worse conditions. For now, the finance ministry hasn’t announced how much of each maturity it’ll sell. That decision will depend on the outcome of June’s market meetings. What’s clear is that confidence in Japan’s bond market has been shaky. Last week, 30-year US Treasury yields climbed toward levels not seen since 2007, as debt concerns slammed developed markets. Japan’s central bank has also been signaling it may reduce its massive holdings of JGBs, adding even more uncertainty. While the Bank of Japan hasn’t acted yet, the talk alone is enough to make investors uneasy. The fear is that once the bank pulls back, there won’t be enough demand left to support longer maturities—especially with insurers now stepping aside. That leaves the Ministry of Finance with limited options: either face rising borrowing costs or adjust the supply before it gets worse. So far, the government is choosing to act. The question is whether this tweak will be enough, or just a temporary fix that leads to bigger problems down the road. Investors will be watching June’s decision closely to see if Japan can strike the balance between market stability and fiscal survival.

As its popularity has grown, so has the price of its native HYPE token. This has seen it rally even at a time of bearish divergence in the crypto market, moving up by more than 50% in one week to reach new all-time highs. Factors Driving The Hyperliquid Price The main driver behind the Hyperliquid price pushing to new all-time highs has been the rise in attention being paid to the platform. As crypto investors are pivoting toward more decentralized platforms for their perpetual trading activities, HYPE’s mindshare has grown exponentially over the last few months. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going This rising interest translated to a major surge in the platform’s trading volume over the last few weeks. Most notable were the billion-dollar bets placed by James Wynn, who has quickly risen to become the most popular crypto trader on Hyperliquid. His trades garnered the interest of thousands, putting more eyes on the platforms as onlookers stood by to see the outcome of his trades. In particular, over the last week, the platform recorded its highest weekly volume since it was launched, reaching $78.672 billion in trading volume between May 11 and May 18, 2025. Daily trading volumes have also not been left out, consistently crossing the $2 billion mark daily. Its highest daily trading volume yet was recorded on May 21, 2025, with $17.731 billion trade on the platform. Cumulatively, the Hyperliquid platform has reached $1.156 trillion in volume in three years of operation, DefiLlama data shows. Other major developments that the platform has seen is the rise in the open interest. The platform celebrated a new all-time high after open interest crossed the $10.1 billion mark on the platform. The amount of USDC locked on the platform also climbed to $3.5 billion, with $5.6 million in fees generated in only a 24-hour period. In one week, the platform was able to generate over $22 million in fees alone.

Daily trading volumes crossed $460 million on May 26, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Crypto whales have been especially active during this time, as Lookonchain reported three whales spending $5.33 million to buy HYPE on Monday. With volumes rising and prices going up, it suggests that a lot of the volume is actually from buyers. If this buying pressure continues, then it is likely that the price sees further upside before putting in a correction.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.31, reflecting a 1.22% decline over the past 24 hours and a 1.63% dip on the week, marking a notable uptick in trader positioning despite a minor decline in the underlying token’s spot price. However, the growing open interest signals that market participants remain highly engaged, even as price consolidates. XRP futures open interest. Source: CoinGlass What futures open interest means for XRP Open interest in futures markets represents the total value of outstanding derivative contracts that have not yet been settled or closed. In other words, it tracks the number of active long and short positions in the market at any given time. A rising open interest, particularly when accompanied by growing volume, typically reflects fresh capital entering the market. It’s often interpreted as a sign of building momentum or conviction among traders. However, it doesn’t indicate whether traders are positioning long (bullish) or short (bearish); only that risk exposure is increasing. In XRP’s case, the rise to $4.77 billion in futures open interest is a significant move. Over the past three days, open interest has climbed steadily from around $4.48 billion, marking a shift in sentiment after several weeks of relative stagnation. While this is not yet a return to the peak levels seen in late January, it is the strongest futures interest recorded since the sharp unwind in mid-February, suggesting that traders are once again actively deploying capital into XRP markets. XRP derivatives dashboard signals broader reacceleration Complementing the chart data is a snapshot of XRP’s broader derivatives landscape, which reinforces the idea that trading activity is heating up again. Overall volume in XRP derivatives has risen 3.44% in the last 24 hours to $3.11 billion. More striking is the spike in options market activity, with options volume exploding 303.42% to $1.63K, and options open interest climbing 6.32% to $2.03 million. Although the notional value of XRP options remains small compared to futures, the massive jump in daily options volume suggests an increased appetite for directional bets or hedging strategies typically seen when traders anticipate higher volatility or trend continuation.

Japan’s bond market is unraveling fast and it’s not just a local problem. More than half a trillion dollars in value has been wiped out in just weeks, triggering alarm bells across global markets. Bond volatility is now back at levels not seen since the 2008 crisis, and the ripple effects are just beginning to surface. If you think this is just another macro event, think again. From Tokyo to Wall Street, this collapse is driving a quiet – but growing – shift into Bitcoin. And it’s happening under the radar. What’s really going on in Japan’s economy? Why are long-dated bonds plunging? And what does all this have to do with crypto? Let’s break it down. A $500B Crash and the Return of Bond Volatility Over the past 45 days, Japan’s 30-year government bond yield has surged by 100bps, hitting a record 3.20%. The 40-year bond, often seen as a long-term safe haven, has dropped over 20% in value, triggering losses of more than $500 billion across the market. This isn’t normal volatility. According to analyst Financelot , “Japan’s bond market liquidity has dropped to 2008 Lehman crisis levels. Are we about to experience another financial crisis?” Let’s talk about the why. Understanding the Japan Bond Crisis The Bank of Japan is unwinding years of ultra-loose policy. After aggressively buying up government bonds for years, the central bank is now stepping back – and that flood of supply is overwhelming buyers. With the BOJ still holding over $4.1 trillion in bonds – 52% of the entire market – even a small shift in policy is enough to rattle the system. Japan’s Debt Machine Is Overheating Japan’s economic numbers aren’t helping. GDP shrank by 0.7% in Q1, more than double the expected drop, while inflation has crept up to 3.6%. Real wages, meanwhile, are down 2.1% year over year. This mix of slowing growth and rising prices – classic stagflation – is squeezing both investors and policymakers. And it’s hitting Japan’s global strategies hard. The yen carry trade, once a go-to for global liquidity, is under pressure as rising Japanese yields flip the math. “The huge mess is coming home to roost,” wrote Wolf Street , pointing to the growing cracks in Japan’s once-stable financial structure. In the background, Japanese institutions are pulling back from U.S. Treasuries too; selling off $119.3 billion in just one quarter. That’s the largest quarterly drop since 2012. Bitcoin Becomes the Go-To Saviour It’s clear traditional markets are struggling. Now, some investors are quietly moving toward crypto, especially Bitcoin. With bonds no longer feeling so “safe,” BTC is starting to look like a viable hedge against global debt risks. “Is it a coincidence that the UK and Japan are seeing huge demand for bitcoin exposure?” asked analyst James Van Straten , as long-term bond yields in both countries spike. Bitwise’s Andre Dragosche and Cauê Oliveira, Head of Research at BlockTrendsBR echoed the trend – hinting that institutional capital is starting to see Bitcoin in a new light. That shift won’t happen overnight. If the yen continues to fall and the dollar strengthens, crypto markets could still feel pressure from a broader carry trade unwind. But in the long run, the trend is clear: as trust in traditional debt markets wavers, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge is getting harder to ignore.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 10:07:07

Bitcoin (BTC) has been showing strength, and it seems traders are betting heavily on continued upside. But a recent analysis points to a potential red flag hidden within the options market. Let’s dive into what the latest Bitcoin options skew is telling us. Understanding Bitcoin Options Skew First off, what exactly is Bitcoin options skew ? In simple terms, it’s a way to measure the relative cost of buying protection against a price drop (put options) versus betting on a price increase (call options) for Bitcoin. Options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price (strike price) by a certain date. The skew is calculated based on the implied volatility of these options. Implied volatility reflects the market’s expectation of how much Bitcoin’s price will move. When the implied volatility for call options is significantly higher than for put options, it means traders are willing to pay a higher premium for the chance of profiting from a price surge compared to protecting against a price fall. This indicates strong bullish sentiment. Conversely, if put options have higher implied volatility, it suggests traders are more concerned about downside risk and are paying more for protection. What the Current BTC Options Data Shows According to a recent Chart of the Day shared by Matrixport crypto on May 27, the Bitcoin options skew has reached an extreme level. Matrixport reported that the skew has fallen to nearly -10%. What does a negative skew mean? A negative skew indicates that call options are significantly more expensive than put options. Specifically, implied volatility for calls is now approximately 10% higher than for puts. This highlights a strong bias among traders towards expecting and positioning for further upward price movement in Bitcoin. It suggests traders are prioritizing potential gains over hedging against potential losses. This isn’t just a slight lean towards bullishness; a -10% skew is considered an extreme reading, reflecting a high degree of optimism prevailing in the market. Is Extreme Crypto Market Sentiment a Warning Sign? While it feels good to see high optimism, especially after periods of consolidation or downturns, extreme sentiment can sometimes be a contrarian indicator. This is a key point highlighted by the Matrixport crypto analysis. Why is excessive optimism potentially problematic? When too many market participants are positioned on one side of the trade (in this case, betting heavily on upside via calls), the market can become vulnerable. If something triggers a shift in sentiment or a wave of profit-taking, there might not be enough buyers to absorb the selling pressure, leading to a sharper-than-expected pullback. Matrixport specifically noted that such extreme bullish sentiment readings from the options skew have historically preceded short-term market pullbacks in Bitcoin. Historical Context and Bitcoin Price Analysis Looking back at historical data, there have been instances where a highly negative options skew (indicating extreme bullishness) coincided with or shortly preceded local price tops before a correction occurred. This doesn’t mean a crash is imminent, but it suggests that the market might be getting a little ahead of itself. Consider this simplified idea: Sentiment Indicator (Options Skew) Trader Positioning Potential Market Reaction Extremely Bullish (Negative Skew) Heavy buying of calls, less demand for puts Increased risk of profit-taking or reversal Neutral Skew Balanced interest in calls and puts More stable market conditions Extremely Bearish (Positive Skew) Heavy buying of puts, less demand for calls Increased potential for a relief rally or bottoming This historical pattern is why Bitcoin price analysis often includes looking at derivatives data like options skew. It provides insight into the collective positioning and sentiment of sophisticated traders. Actionable Insights for Your BTC Options Strategy So, if the Bitcoin options skew is flashing an extreme bullish signal that has historically preceded pullbacks, what should traders and investors consider? For Call Buyers: Be cautious. While the trend might still be up, the premium for calls is high. Consider if the potential upside justifies the cost, or if scaling back exposure or using tighter stop losses is warranted. For Put Buyers: Puts are relatively cheaper right now (in terms of implied volatility). If you are concerned about a potential short-term dip, buying puts could be a relatively cost-effective way to hedge your spot holdings or short-term long positions. For Option Sellers: Selling calls when premiums are high might seem attractive, but be aware of the risk if the bullish trend continues strongly. Selling puts could be an option if you expect the market to hold up or rebound, but this also carries significant risk if a sharp downturn occurs. Overall Strategy: This signal doesn’t necessarily mean you should abandon your long-term Bitcoin strategy. However, for short-term trading or managing risk, paying attention to this extreme skew and considering hedging strategies or reducing leverage might be prudent. It’s crucial to remember that options skew is just one indicator among many. A comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis should also include technical indicators, on-chain data, macroeconomic factors, and news events. Beyond the Skew: Other Factors Influencing Crypto Market Sentiment While the Bitcoin options skew provides valuable insight into trader positioning, the overall crypto market sentiment is influenced by numerous factors: Macroeconomics: Interest rates, inflation data, and global economic stability play a significant role. Regulatory News: Developments regarding crypto regulation in major economies can heavily impact sentiment. Institutional Adoption: News about large institutions investing in Bitcoin or offering crypto services often boosts optimism. Technological Developments: Upgrades or issues with the Bitcoin network or other major blockchains can affect confidence. Geopolitical Events: Global events can drive risk-on or risk-off sentiment across all markets, including crypto. Therefore, while the options skew is a powerful tool for understanding derivatives market positioning, it should be viewed as part of a larger mosaic when assessing the overall market outlook. Challenges and Nuances Interpreting the Bitcoin options skew isn’t always straightforward. Extreme readings don’t guarantee an immediate reversal. Sometimes, extreme sentiment can persist for a while before a correction occurs. Also, the skew can be influenced by factors other than pure directional bets, such as large players hedging existing positions. The analysis from Matrixport crypto provides a valuable data point, but it’s essential for traders to do their own research and consider their individual risk tolerance and investment goals. Conclusion: Caution Amidst the Optimism The current state of the Bitcoin options skew , as highlighted by Matrixport, points to a level of bullishness that is historically associated with increased risk of a short-term pullback. While the overall trend for Bitcoin may remain positive, the derivatives market is signaling that caution might be warranted at these elevated levels of optimism. Paying attention to indicators like the Bitcoin options skew is crucial for understanding the underlying dynamics of the market beyond just price action. It helps reveal how traders are positioned and the collective sentiment regarding future price movements. As always, a balanced approach that considers multiple data points and risk management is key in navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency.

The acquisition comes after a bond sale of over $72M, 95% of which will be used to acquire approximately 658 $BTC at the current price of $109K. If the investment goes through, Blockchain Group would rank 15th on the list of companies with the most $BTC holdings , right behind NEXON’s 1,717 Bitcoin holdings and in front of Semler Scientific’s 1,273 holdings. At the same time, Pakistan is intensifying its crypto mining efforts through a bigger and better electrical grid. The country also hired World Liberty Financial’s crypto advisor for guidance on key decisions. So, if you were looking for 3 cryptos to 100x as France and Pakistan embrace crypto, this is the time to get your wallet ready. France and Pakistan Join the Global Adoption Wave and Prove the Crypto Narrative While France is making steady progress in its crypto race, Pakistan is another forefront runner, as it just announced the appointment of World Liberty Financial advisor Bilal Bin Saqib as Special Assistant in crypto-related affairs. Saqib is a Blockchain Advisor and crypto expert featured in Forbes as one of the most influential 30 entrepreneurs under 30, which makes his expertise invaluable to Pakistan. This comes in parallel with Pakistan’s efforts to expand its electrical grid to accommodate its growing Bitcoin mining ecosystem. The 2,000 Megawatt surplus will support the country’s mining operations and fuel its AI developmental center as part of Pakistan’s digital transformation efforts. These two announcements come just over a month after Pakistan’s newly formed Crypto Council appointed Binance’s co-founder, Chanpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, as external crypto advisor . Pakistan’s shift to crypto isn’t isolated. According to Chainalysis, Pakistan ranks 9th in the world in terms of crypto adoption , after countries like the US, India, Ukraine, and Nigeria. Crypto Efforts Are Making a Splash Worldwide: What’s In Store Next? This comes in the context of Central & Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO) leading the global race to crypto adoption in 2024, with 7 countries in the top 20 in the world. This positions CSAO behind North America and Western Europe with over $750B in crypto asset inflows, accounting for 16.6% of the global value. At this point, it’s safe to say we’re seeing a pattern—growing Bitcoin adoption no longer comes in waves, but rather a continuous stream. Michael Saylor’s Strategy just acquired an additional batch of 7,390 $BTC (worth roughly $764M), and leads the pack with the largest Bitcoin reserve today, at exactly 580,250 tokens. Only Satoshi Nakamoto has more, with around 1M coins, worth over $109B at the current price. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, as the number of cryptocurrency owners worldwide currently stands at over 560M , according to a Triple-A report. In this context, we should expect the crypto market to reach new heights, with upcoming meme coins hitting the charts hard. Some of the best crypto projects to invest in today are Solaxy ($SOLX) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . But these aren’t the only ones that promise to make waves, when considering the influx of good news that may rally the whole crypto market. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Upcoming Layer 2 Upgrade Promises Faster Transactions and Lower Fees Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s Layer 2 upgrade that comes with significant improvements to Solana’s functionality and ecosystem stability. Among these is the promise of faster transactions and lower blockchain fees. Solana has long struggled with problems like downtime during network congestion hours and slow ( or even failed) transactions. Solaxy’s off-chain execution and parallel processing promise to solve that, offering ultra-low latency, speed, and infinite scalability. The presale has accumulated an impressive $41M so far, with a token price of $0.001736, and the future looks promising. Thanks to Solaxy’s utility and potential, our analysts predict a fiery 2025–2030 era , with a projected ROI of 11,420% by the end of 2026 if the token’s price reaches $0.2. This means that, for a $100 investment, you could get back around $11,520 in less than a year, if the prediction holds true. The project is in its last presale phase, set to launch on DEXs in just over 20 days. So, this is one of the last chances to buy Solaxy and diversify your portfolio. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bitcoin’s Official Meme Coin Offering $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) offers you $BTC airdrops if you keep your tokens in Best Wallet . The airdrop system is linked to Bitcoin’s chart performance, with airdrop events scheduled at key $BTC price points ($150K and $ 200K). The project relies on the idea that Bitcoin will eventually reach and exceed $1M. With that in mind, the BTC Bull Team tries to rally the Bitcoin community and attract investors to the BTC Bull Token herd along the way. The presale is pushing to new heights with over $6.4M accumulated in the four months since it started, on February 10, 2025. You can grab your $BTCBULLs right now for the FOMO-glazed price of $0.002535 per token. If things move in the same direction, our analysts predict that $BTCBULL could reach a price point of $0.006467 by the end of 2025. This means buying Bitcoin Bull Token now would bring you an ROI of 155% if you invest at today’s price. Keep the momentum going, and $BTCBULL could be worth as high as $0.0497 by the end of 2030, for a return of 1,864%. 3. PancakeSwap ($CAKE) – One of the Most Popular DEXs with 9+ Chains and Fees as Low as 0.01% PancakeSwap ($CAKE) is currently one of the most popular DEX exchanges in the world, with over 9 chains and fees as low as 0.01%. The platform features over 4.4M active users and over 140M trades over the last 30 days, and $2.2B value locked. $CAKE is booming on CoinMarketCap with a boost of 25% over the past 7 days, and it doesn’t seem to slow down. With a market cap of over $917M, over 2M HODLERS, and a token price of $2.85, currently going up, investing seems the only reasonable choice. For an even clearer context, the token’s pump started today, and it’s currently almost vertical, so you may want to tune in before it deflates. Will Bitcoin’s Bull Ride Ever End? Given the current global context, it doesn’t seem like Bitcoin’s bull run will end anytime soon. We may even see a complete shift in Bitcoin’s behavior, as mass adoption and increased investor trust may eliminate bull runs completely; instead, we may get a bull marathon with no end in sight. In preparation for that, don’t forget to diversify your portfolio with upcoming hot tokens like Solaxy ($SOLX) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . As always, don’t take this as financial advice.

Don’t you hate it when you see yet another layer-1 launch, claiming one million, 10 million, or even 100 million TPS? “How can I cash in on the hype?” you ask. Well, today is your lucky day! Here’s a step-by-step guide on building your very own 1 billion TPS layer-1 network that’ll leave those posers in the dust. You might also like: From crypto projects to digital asset companies: It’s time to level up web3 comms | Opinion Step 1: Get a supercomputer and run EVM on it A single high-end machine can run transactions in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to ~100k TPS—a pretty well-documented technical fact. But to reach this level of throughput, you do need to bypass the Patricia Merkle Trie during reads and writes to permanent state, in order to remove a major throughput bottleneck that limits the standard EVM to just under 100 TPS. This mechanism in the EVM exists to ensure that the network, sorry, the single machine, is able to correctly handle any state rollbacks and network reorganizations…anyway, who cares, it’s slow, it’s gone, don’t worry about it. We’re using the EVM because being EVM-compatible, or better yet, EVM-equivalent, is pretty important these days, since it has become a standard in web3 development. The majority of the world’s web3 applications are written in Solidity or other languages that compile into the EVM bytecode. This way, you can attract more developers to build on your new 1 billion TPS network. Trust me, bro, “EVM-equivalent” totally sells. Step 2: Forget the network A single machine is also a network on its own, technically speaking. Why complicate this side hustle with more than one machine? Besides, having other machines on the network just slows things down. If you have a network filled with different machines run by different people, they now suddenly have to agree with each other on what happens on the network. This involves communicating information across the network, coming up with mechanisms to agree on what’s happening, and then reaching a consensus before making progress. Sounds slow af. This consensus mechanism is just a lot of wasteful overhead. Who needs it? Let’s just stick with a single machine. Check out all these hot projects called layer-2s; their networks are all just a single machine. If you worry about being called out for being centralized, simply create a number of other machines on the network and assign them fancy names, such as “data availability nodes” or similar. Everyone’s doing it. Step 3: Make 100 shards Get ready, this is where we elevate your game, with sharding. You take your network of one machine and make 100 copies of it; we’ll call this sharding, very on-trend. Technically speaking, a sharded network’s state is only temporarily sharded across machines and will eventually be partially or fully synchronized to guarantee consistency during cross-shard transactions. In adversarial environments such as crypto, machines across shards are often shuffled to prevent collusion. But let’s not get technical. These 100 copies don’t need to synchronize anything; they don’t even need to communicate with each other. It’s a network of 100 shards! If you’re keeping score, we now have 100 shards * 100k TPS = 10 million TPS! Step 4: Ditch the EVM Did we say EVM-equivalent is all the rage? That’s old news. Now it’s all about being the EVM-killer. EVM is just so slow. It’s a stack-based interpreted virtual machine that was designed to be fully agnostic to the underlying hardware architecture and operating systems, to maximize repeatability and execution correctness, so that a large group of disparate machines can safely and securely operate on the same network. But man, is it slow. Let’s go with something sexy like WASM-JIT. It’s highly performant, mature, and most major programming languages can be compiled into WASM. Since it does compile to native register-based machine code that targets specific hardware architectures, it is inherently less portable than a purely stack-based VM like EVM. In real-world implementations, WASM-JIT can outperform the EVM up to 100x in execution speeds. Ditch the EVM, we now have 10 million TPS * 100 = 1 billion TPS. You did it! Stay tuned, and we’ll teach you how to further elevate your 1 billion TPS layer-1 network even further with unrealistically-optimistic concurrency!

While this may indicate confidence in long-term fundamentals, it also reflects a broader pattern: capital is rotating from mature assets into earlier-stage opportunities with greater return potential. With ADA’s growth trajectory tapering and staking yields flat, many institutional wallets are reallocating exposure toward projects with fixed supply, real user participation, and defined token scarcity. According to analyst reports, Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as one of the top destinations for that capital. The project’s architecture, mobile-first distribution model, and decentralized reward system are drawing both retail and whale-tier interest for the same reason: it mirrors the early economic blueprint that made Bitcoin and Ethereum wealth engines. Smartphones Become Crypto Mining Infrastructure At the core of Bitcoin Solaris is the Nova App, a mobile mining interface that turns any modern smartphone into a yield-generating asset. Users allocate 1–5 GB of storage and idle CPU to the app, which runs passively while the device charges. Mining rewards are distributed daily in BTC-S based on uptime. This direct protocol-level access stands in sharp contrast to Cardano, where delegation mechanics still favor large pools and require ecosystem fluency. Bitcoin Solaris removes these technical and financial barriers, giving early adopters consistent rewards for real network contribution. Designed for Decentralized Throughput at Global Scale Bitcoin Solaris achieves scalability through a dual-layer blockchain. The Base Layer secures the ledger using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), while the Solaris Layer executes smart contracts and mobile mining via Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT). This enables the network to process 10,000+ transactions per second with 2-second finality — a throughput that outpaces Cardano’s current benchmarks. This design supports real-time reward issuance across tens of thousands of nodes while keeping energy use minimal. For whales entering at scale, the network can support high-volume participation without bottlenecks or centralization risks. Security Audits Back Investor Confidence Bitcoin Solaris has completed comprehensive security and compliance checks. The Cyberscope audit validated smart contract logic and token mechanics. The Freshcoins audit tested mobile mining performance and scalability. The team also passed KYC verification , confirming transparent governance and traceability. This audit trail ensures that BTC-S enters the market as a verified asset, not a speculative token launch. Early Access Window Closes as Network Activation Nears Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, with BTC-S priced at 5 USDT. Of the fixed 21 million BTC-S supply, 4.2 million (20%) are allocated to the full presale. There will be no inflation or new token creation post-launch. Participants in the presale also secure early Nova App mining access before broader user growth drives up difficulty. As history has shown with Bitcoin and Ethereum, network positioning ahead of public saturation is often the defining factor in long-term returns. In a recent market briefing, Crypto Volt explained why large Cardano holders are shifting toward Bitcoin Solaris. His analysis focuses on token scarcity, mining-first distribution, and why early protocol access through smartphones is becoming the new strategy for crypto-native wealth growth. Cardano remains a leading Layer 1 — but for investors seeking transformative upside, its phase of exponential gains appears to have passed. Bitcoin Solaris presents a structurally different opportunity, one defined by scarcity, real-time rewards, and early-phase access. Now in Presale phase 5 at 5 USDT, BTC-S is drawing both institutional and retail attention as a credible next-generation wealth builder — before the door closes.

45156021,https://zycrypto.com/?p=106626,1748345918,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Google Researchers Claim Quantum Computers Could Break Bitcoin with 20x Less Effort than Previous Estimates,https://zycrypto.com/google-researchers-claim-quantum-computers-could-break-bitcoin-with-20x-less-effort-than-previous-estimates/,"Google has released a research paper which suggests that quantum computers may be able to crack encryption standards, such as those used by Bitcoin , with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. A Google quantum researcher, Craig Gidney, said developers must ascertain the costs of creating quantum-safe cryptocurrencies to achieve the transition process. Cryptography standards, such as RSA, may be at a higher risk of being cracked than previously thought. Bitcoin users, especially those with custodial funds, may need to measure the risks to safeguard their crypto from quantum attacks. Quantum computing can solve complex puzzles, such as the ones used by Bitcoin to measure proof-of-work, thus presenting a new threat vector that places Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at risk. Bitcoin was designed for older computers, which are quickly becoming obsolete. Peter Shor, cryptographer and computer scientist, created a method called Shor’s algorithm to solve the complex puzzles used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Shor’s algorithm could be combined with a quantum computer to crack crypto wallets rapidly. An efficient algorithm, combined with a powerful computer, could increase the risk of a crypto portfolio, including digital assets that use proof-of-stake algorithms. Craig Gidney and Sophie Schmieg, quantum researchers at Google, discussed their findings on their Google security blog. They addressed the ability of quantum computers to crack public key cryptography, particularly RSA, which could be compromised with a quantum computer of around 1 million noisy qubits. They made this conclusion after taking into account recent advancements in quantum computing. The number of qubits required to crack cryptography is lower than previous estimates. The researchers outlined strategies corporations could take to mitigate the risks of quantum computers, such as collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to transition to a post-quantum computing world. Symmetric cryptography is largely unaffected by this attack. However, cryptography, such as that used by cryptocurrencies, is vulnerable to this attack due to the public exposure of addresses and the longevity of these wallets, providing attackers with a target they can attack for an extended period. NIST has set a timeline to phase out vulnerable systems by 2030 and ban them by 2035. Google has been confirming its strategy with NIST by implementing PQC signatures on its Cloud KMS service. IBM’s Condor, the most powerful quantum computer to date, can only reach 1,121 qubits, which is way short of the million qubits needed to crack RSA encryption. Cryptocurrency seems to be safe for now, unless a new technological innovation can dramatically increase the number of qubits. Google’s Sycamore, another quantum computer, can only get 53 qubits. However, the trend of quantum development suggests that crypto users must take these risks seriously. The Google researchers argue that the increased risk occurs because of technological advancements such as improved error correction and better algorithms. Modular exponentiation, for example, has been made more efficient, effectively doubling its speed. Modular arithmetic is a vital part of cryptographic systems. Further, the researchers found that error correction improvements can speed up their algorithm. They found that creating a separate layer for error correction allowed the qubits layer to be more dense, holding more information to be processed, speeding up the algorithm overall. The researchers could drop the qubit requirement by optimising code at a programmable level. Hackers could further exploit such optimizations to secretly lower the qubit requirements until a future date when quantum computers are more accessible. In early May 2025, BlackRock added a line to their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing, stating that quantum computing poses a risk to the long-term security of Bitcoin. The filing states that if quantum computing advances enough, it could be used to crack the underlying encryption algorithms used to power Bitcoin. BlackRock is concerned that quantum computers will undermine crypto markets and technology. Quantum computers can potentially disrupt the business model of Silicon Valley, potentially causing a market crash. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, should consider the potential risks of quantum computers. The fact that such a large bank like BlackRock is taking the risk seriously shows that quantum risks could be closer than we think.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Google,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ZRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-27 11:38:38

The $DON token has a trading volume of $4.45 million each day with a market cap of $2.21 million. As $DON gets listed on more exchanges, experts say the daily trading volume could grow to around $20 million. With the rise of meme coins’ popularity, Salamanca is ready for additional growth. Solana (SOL) Emerges as a Key Platform in the Digital Asset World Solana (SOL) is a top blockchain platform, providing a scalable environment for decentralized applications (dApps). Solana uses the innovative Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) models, which attract both developers and institutions that need fast and affordable blockchain solutions. SOL’s success is due to its increasing adoption, as its price steadily increases. The price of Solana has seen a 5.19% increase to $177.80 in the last 24 hours. Currently, Solana has a market cap of $92.46 billion with a daily trading volume of $6.31 billion. The Solana Foundation intends to improve DeFi and Web3 features, which has resulted in more projects being developed on the network. Additionally, with improved network stability and continuous upgrades, Solana attracts both developers and investors. Bitcoin’s Slipping Dominance Opens the Door for Altcoins Bitcoin (BTC) has recently seen a decline in its market dominance due to its high cost. With a market cap of $2.2 trillion and a price of $110,715.23, Bitcoin continues to attract investors. The rise in popularity for alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) is changing the market outlook. Bitcoin’s market share has increased to 64.18%, after an earlier dip below 62%. This shift in investors is due to including altcoins in their investments. As Solana and Salamanca become more popular, the rise of ecosystem-focused tokens and meme coins is expected to continue. This could position altcoins to compete more directly with Bitcoin in the next few years. Solana and Salamanca show great potential for growth as the cryptocurrency markets continue to develop. The tokens could see new updates in the coming week, which shows their potential in the digital asset world.

In November of last year, 11 state attorneys general, led by Texas AG Ken Paxton, accused the three financial firms of engaging in an anticompetitive conspiracy to drive down coal production. The attorneys general allege the firms tapped their influence as shareholders in competing coal companies to reduce industrywide coal output, illegally sharing competitively sensitive information in the process. Now, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) have filed a “Statement of Interest” in support of the AGs’ case. The federal officials argue that BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard’s alleged conduct increased energy prices for consumers and businesses. “This case is not about ordinary activity by asset managers such as passive index investing or even pro-competitive activism. As alleged, the holders of large quantities of stock in competing companies agreed to use those shareholdings to reduce the output of US coal to increase profits at the expense of American consumers and businesses. This case is about precisely the sort of conduct, including concerted efforts to reduce output, which have long been condemned under the antitrust laws.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Investors who rely on the idea that bonds cushion equity losses are now watching both assets sink in tandem. The problem hit hard in May, when 30-year Treasury yields shot past 5%, dragging stock prices down with them. That’s a direct blow to anyone still betting on the old rule that when equities fall, bonds rise. This time, everything’s just falling. The 60/40 model (60% stocks, 40% bonds) had been clawing back relevance in 2025 after years of being dismissed. Through mid-May, the setup was up about 1.6% on the year, beating the S&P 500’s returns while keeping volatility lower. The comeback had one thing going for it: the return of the classic inverse correlation between stocks and bonds. Source: Bloomberg That relationship, for six months straight, was the most negative it’s been since 2021. But that dynamic broke fast. Investors are now looking at a market where rising yields are hammering both asset classes. Yields jump, bonds lose their safety role The selloff in Treasuries is being driven by growing fear around Washington’s out-of-control debt and deficit problem. The surge in yields means prices on long-term bonds are plunging, making them behave more like risky assets than the low-volatility shield investors are used to. “Longer-term Treasuries are behaving like risk assets, not like the typical kind of defensive risk-averse assets,” said Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income, during an interview with Bloomberg Television. That shift is wrecking the 60/40 setup, which depends on bonds providing balance. Greg made it clear: if you want to hedge stock exposure, don’t go long. The professionals are pointing toward short-term Treasuries instead, which are still seen as relatively safe and income-generating without the extreme volatility. The uncertainty in fixed income comes as equity markets try to rebound from a rough stretch. On Tuesday, stock futures rose sharply after President Donald Trump said over the weekend that he’d agreed to delay a planned 50% tariff on the European Union. The Dow Jones futures climbed 543 points, or 1.3%, the S&P 500 gained 1.5%, and the Nasdaq 100 popped 1.7%. Trump said he would push the deadline from June 1 to July 9, after a request from Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission. Tariff delay lifts futures, but nerves remain That announcement came after a rough week, where the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all dropped more than 2%. Trump’s proposed tariffs on the EU — including on Apple products — had been weighing on markets. Monday’s holiday closure for Memorial Day didn’t help the tension. The delay announcement helped cool some fears temporarily, but traders stayed nervous. “We’re still wary about chasing the SPX at these levels given complacency around two major areas of macro risk (tariffs and fiscal policy/yields) along with elevated equity valuations,” said Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge. Adam pointed out that while Trump’s most extreme tariff threats may not actually happen, he’s already introduced serious new import taxes over the past four months. And he’s likely not finished. This week, investors are watching earnings reports closely. Okta is set to release after the bell Tuesday. Reports from Nvidia, Macy’s, and Costco will follow later in the week. FactSet data shows that over 95% of S&P 500 companies have already posted their numbers this season, with nearly 78% beating analyst estimates. But that’s not enough to calm everyone.

In its latest research note, the global banking giant forecasted that Solana could climb to $275 by the end of 2025, and even hit $500 by 2030. That’s a big jump from its current price of around $175. Ethereum, meanwhile, is trading near $2,632. But here’s where it gets interesting: even with such bullish targets for SOL, Standard Chartered isn’t calling it a flippening. In fact, the bank says Ethereum’s dominance isn’t going anywhere just yet. So, what’s driving this confident prediction and why does ETH still come out on top? The deeper you look, the more revealing it gets. Solana is rising, but Ethereum still leads According to Geoff Kendrick, head of FX and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, the forecast hasn’t changed since March. Solana is still “cheap” relative to Ethereum, based on metrics such as active users and transaction counts. That’s the key message: Solana’s got room to grow, but Ethereum’s already won the long game – for now. Kendrick also noted the ETH/SOL price ratio, which is currently around 16, is expected to hold between 14 and 17 through 2025–2027. That means both can rise together, but ETH stays ahead. The bank also points to a few headwinds for Solana in recent months, mainly a slowdown in memecoin activity and the fact that its application revenue is still undervalued compared to its growth potential. Ethereum vs Solana: A Comparison Here’s how the two chains stack up on the key battlegrounds. TVL (Total Value Locked): Ethereum continues to dominate with over $71 billion in TVL, thanks to a mature DeFi ecosystem and institutional-grade platforms. Solana, by contrast, sits around $9 billion – a fraction of ETH’s size. Still, its fast, low-cost infrastructure is pulling in newer DeFi protocols. Memecoins: Ethereum is the original home of memecoins – SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI. While much of the recent memecoin volume is shifting to Ethereum L2s, the chain still leads in brand and liquidity. Solana had its moment earlier this year with coins like BONK and WIF, but that wave has cooled significantly, which probably has hurt near-term sentiment. dApps and Developer Activity: Ethereum remains the heavyweight in decentralized applications, with a deep bench of projects and long-standing developer loyalty. But Solana is gaining momentum, especially in performance-first apps like Jupiter and Raydium. The community is scrappy, fast-moving, and increasingly well-funded, fueled by grants and dev bootcamps like mtnDAO. Security and Past Network Issues: Solana has had its fair share of turbulence, including DoS attacks and major network outages. But 2024 brought serious upgrades: the rollout of Firedancer, a second validator client built with Jump Crypto, and the adoption of QUIC. Solana also implemented stake-weighted Quality of Service and real-time network monitoring tools to strengthen its reliability under pressure. Ethereum, meanwhile, has the benefit of time. Post-merge, Ethereum’s Proof of Stake model has made attacks more costly and introduced slashing penalties for misbehaving validators. Add in rigorous smart contract audits and L2 adoption, and you’ve got a network that’s been battle-tested and hardened over years. Decentralization at the Core: Solana’s design trades some decentralization for speed. High-performance nodes require costly infrastructure, which can concentrate control. Ethereum, on the other hand, operates with a vast network of nodes, made more accessible after the move to PoS. The lower barrier to entry has helped decentralize control and preserve Ethereum’s ethos as a trustless, globally distributed blockchain. Can Solana close the gap? It could – but not overnight. Solana’s strengths are clear: fast transactions, low fees, and a growing developer community. But Ethereum’s lead is built on more than just price. It’s built on network effects, years of developer loyalty, and a strong track record with institutions. For Solana to catch up, it has a long way to go.

Saylor's Security Concerns Saylor argues that requiring exchanges to publish their public wallet addresses leaves them in high risk. ”If you force companies to disclose all their addresses, you open up an executive kidnapping risk and a security nightmare for the company,” he said. Saylor also warned that openness could draw MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks, where malicious actors exploit transaction ordering for profit. Instead of on-chain proofs, Saylor favors third-party auditing as a more pragmatic and secure means. ”The correct answer is a reputable, independent, trusted auditor,” he stated, suggesting that conventional financial regulation offers superior protection for both corporations and clients. Alternative Approaches: Binance and Kraken Saylor's move comes as leading exchanges test different proof-of-reserves protocols. Binance, for example, uses a Merkle-tree-based protocol. The system allows users to verify that their funds are part of the exchange's overall reserves, without revealing the entire list of balances or addresses. The Merkle tree system provides cryptographic proof of reserves while maintaining an element of privacy. Kraken, however, has implemented a zero-knowledge proof system. This advanced cryptographic technique enables Kraken to prove to users that it has sufficient reserves to cover customers' balances without disclosing any sensitive on-chain data. Zero-knowledge proofs are praised for their ability to balance transparency and confidentiality, addressing most of the concerns Saylor has. The proof-of-reserves argument is wide open. On-chain transparency supporters argue that public audits need to be in place in order to bring back confidence in the wake of prominent exchange collapses. Opponents, like Saylor, counter that full transparency brings new risks to exchanges and users alike. Industry norms are still in development. Although Merkle-tree and zero-knowledge proofs offer promising alternatives, these also require users to assume that exchanges utilize these systems honestly and efficiently. Third-party audits, Saylor's preference being noted, can provide another layer of assurance, yet their usefulness rests in the auditor's reputation and liberty. Practical Challenges and Regulatory Perspectives Aside from technical and security concerns, exchanges also have to contend with a complex regulatory landscape. Regulators in different jurisdictions have varying requirements for transparency and auditability, which would complicate the ability of global exchanges to adopt a one-size-fits-all solution. Furthermore, the rapid progress of cryptographic verification means that best practice today would not be very long-lived. For clients, the answer lies in remaining vigilant and informed. As the proof-of-reserves brouhaha continues, users must look not only at exchanges' practices but also at how frequently and transparently they report. At the end of the day, the goal is to keep user balances safe, accessible, and auditable without exposing exchanges or their users to excessive risk. The bottom line Michael Saylor's warning about the danger of on-chain proof-of-reserves has put into question an important debate in the crypto world. With the consideration of advantages and disadvantages between openness, privacy, and security by the exchanges, the search for best practices continues. Regardless of whether the future of proof-of-reserves is cryptography, third-party auditing, or a combination of both, one thing is for sure: openness must be matched with protection in order to preserve user trust and security.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-27 11:53:12

QCP Capital Says Bitcoin Trades in a Tight Range Ahead of Major Conference In a market update, QCP noted that investors are closely monitoring this week’s Bitcoin 2025 conference, which has become a key event for sentiment in the digital asset space. The firm said short-term volatility remains high, leading traders and institutions to take a more cautious approach. Despite the choppy price action, underlying ETF flows remain robust, a sign that long-term interest in Bitcoin remains robust. “Markets are in a holding pattern. We are seeing healthy ETF demand, but traders are waiting for clarity after the conference before taking big directional bets,” QCP said. The firm expects both sentiment and volatility to subside once the event is over, potentially paving the way for a more stable trading environment.

Giancarlo's move comes at a time of leadership turmoil at the CFTC, with Commissioner Kristin Johnson announcing her resignation, joining several other high-profile exits that could allow the Trump administration to fully reshape the agency. Meanwhile, the crypto industry is pressuring the SEC for clarity on staking rules, especially for ETFs tied to protocols like Solana. Although recent SEC guidance under Trump’s presidency has been a lot more favorable to crypto, formal policy on staking is still elusive. For now, it seem slike industry leaders are autiously optimistic about regulatory progress in the months ahead. Crypto Dad Joins Sygnum Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), joined Swiss crypto bank Sygnum as a senior policy adviser. His appointment was announced on May 27,and it places him alongside 11 other experts on the bank’s Advisory Council. In this role, Giancarlo will help steer the company through changing global regulations and advise on strategic partnerships across both public and private sectors. Christopher Giancarlo Sygnum is widely recognized as the world’s first digital asset bank, and recently achieved unicorn status after a $58 million funding round. The firm operates in several international hubs including Switzerland, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates, and offers a suite of regulated crypto asset services that are tailored for institutional clients. Giancarlo served at the CFTC from 2017 to 2019, and has long been a vocal advocate for digital innovation in financial markets. This even earned him the nickname “crypto dad.” While he previously said that a broad political shift in Washington will be needed to pass meaningful pro-crypto legislation, that shift likely arrived with Donald Trump’s re-election in November. Nonetheless, Giancarlo dismissed speculation that he would take on a leadership role at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the US Treasury after the election. His move to Sygnum comes at a time when institutional adoption of digital assets is gaining good momentum. In the United States, inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recently surpassed $1.5 billion in just two days, which means that there is strong demand from professional investors. The progress of the GENIUS Act in the Senate also proves that there is growing political support for crypto. According to Fidelity Digital Assets , Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs is reinforcing its reputation as a credible, long-term asset class. This sentiment is echoed in international markets, particularly in regions where Sygnum is active, like Singapore and the UAE. However, Sygnum CEO Matthias Imbach recently warned that Switzerland, despite being an early leader in digital finance, risks falling behind if it doesn’t maintain its innovative edge. CFTC Faces Major Leadership Shakeup Kristin Johnson, a commissioner at the CFTC, also recently announced her plans to step down from the agency later in 2025, after the conclusion of her term in April. Johnson was nominated by former President Joe Biden and began her tenure in March of 2022. She revealed her departure in a statement that was issued on May 21. During her time at the CFTC, Johnson served as the sponsor of the Market Risk Advisory Committee, where she focused on issues related to decentralized financial products, including digital assets and cryptocurrency. (Source: CFTC ) Her resignation adds to a wave of high-level exits from the five-seat commission, which is currently experiencing a major leadership reshuffle. Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero both announced plans to leave by the end of May, and acting Chair Caroline Pham indicated she will transition to the private sector if the Senate confirms Brian Quintenz as the next CFTC chair. One seat remained vacant since former Chair Rostin Behnam stepped down in February, leaving the agency potentially without any of its current leadership by early 2026. Kristin Johnson The timing of Johnson’s departure means it is possible that her replacement, along with the rest of the commission’s leadership, could be chosen by President Donald Trump and confirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate. Trump nominated Quintenz to lead the CFTC in February, but the Senate has yet to vote on his confirmation. Under agency rules , commissioners are allowed to continue serving beyond their terms until successors are confirmed, provided it is before the next session of Congress. The leadership turnover comes at a critical moment for digital asset regulation in the United States. The CFTC, alongside the SEC, plays a central role in overseeing aspects of the crypto market, though the current regulatory framework has been criticized by lawmakers and industry participants as lacking clarity. This fueled bipartisan efforts to establish formal legislation that defines how digital assets should be regulated and delineates the responsibilities of the CFTC and SEC in overseeing this sometimes complicated sector. Crypto Industry Presses SEC for Staking Clarity While the CFTC is dealing with its leadership shakeup, crypto industry groups are calling on the SEC to provide formal guidance on staking. They argue that continued regulatory uncertainty poses serious challenges for Web3 infrastructure providers. According to Allison Muehr, head of staking policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, clarifying the SEC’s stance has become one of the industry's top policy priorities. At Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York, Muehr explained that although there has been a recent increase in constructive dialogue with the SEC, the industry is still far from regulatory clarity. “We’re about 25% of the way there,” she said, and pointed out that the past four months have seen more engagement from the SEC than the previous four years combined, yet formal staking guidance is still lacking. Allison Muehr Under the previous presidential administration, the SEC was very aggressive in its enforcement actions against crypto firms offering staking services. The regulator alleged that they were unregistered securities offerings. However, since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the SEC appears to have softened its position. In February, the agency clarified that meme coins do not qualify as investment contracts under US law. Then, in April, the SEC further stated that stablecoins do not qualify as securities when marketed purely as payment instruments. Despite these developments, the agency still has to issue any official position on staking in ETFs, which leaves a big gap in regulatory guidance for financial products that involve staking mechanisms. Muehr expressed optimism that the SEC may eventually greenlight staking in ETFs, including proposals tied to Solana. She mentioned that recent meetings with the agency have been productive, and she is still hopeful that the US market will soon see both a Solana ETF and a staked Solana ETF.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-27 11:54:40

Price action has been choppy as the market digests early listing excitement, speculative volume, and a relatively tight circulating supply. With the token navigating within a tightening structure on lower timeframes, traders are now watching closely for a breakout move ahead of May 28. What’s Happening With Huma Finance’s Price? HUMA price forecast (Source: TradingView) The Huma Finance price action on the 15-minute chart shows price caught between a rising support trendline and a descending resistance line, forming a converging triangle pattern. The most recent breakout attempt above $0.0659 failed, triggering a sharp sell-off that found support near $0.0605. Since then, the token has entered a phase of compression, with price now trading between $0.0625 and $0.0635. The upper resistance line near $0.0659 remains key, while support near $0.0610 aligns with the breakout region and is now being retested.

Circle is expanding globally, securing regulatory approval in Abu Dhabi and launching more partnerships. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has launched its initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise as much as $624 million on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “CRCL.” The fintech firm plans to offer 9.6 million shares of Class A common stock, while selling shareholders will offer an additional 14.4 million shares, according to a May 27 press release . The IPO is priced between $24 and $26 per share, with underwriters granted a 30-day option to purchase up to 3.6 million additional shares to cover over-allotments. If fully exercised, the offering would total 27.6 million shares. Circle’s Long-Awaited IPO Signals New Era for Stablecoin Giant The IPO marks Circle’s long-anticipated public debut, signaling a new chapter for one of the most prominent players in the stablecoin sector. The timing comes as regulatory scrutiny on digital asset firms remains high, with investors watching closely to gauge sentiment on publicly listed crypto infrastructure companies. J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs are serving as joint lead active bookrunners. Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and Société Générale are also acting as bookrunners, while a long list of co-managers includes BNY Capital Markets, Canaccord Genuity, Oppenheimer & Co., and Santander.

Circle’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still pending effectiveness. Therefore, the offering remains subject to market conditions and regulatory approval. The company had previously attempted to go public via a SPAC deal with Concord Acquisition Corp in 2021, but the agreement was mutually terminated in 2022. Since then, Circle has continued to position itself as a central figure in dollar-backed stablecoin infrastructure, with USDC currently holding a market capitalization of over $32 billion. If successful, Circle’s IPO would mark one of the largest public offerings by a crypto-focused firm since Coinbase’s 2021 listing. Circle Rejects Ripple’s $5B Bid Last month, Circle reportedly declined a $4–5 billion acquisition offer from Ripple. The bid was considered too low as Circle remained committed to pursuing its own path forward through a public offering. Separately, Circle secured in-principle approval from the Abu Dhabi Financial Services Regulatory Authority to operate as a money services business in the region. The milestone came following its recent incorporation in the UAE and expansion of its regulatory footprint in the Middle East. Circle also partnered with Hub71, a government-backed tech hub in Abu Dhabi. The collaboration will allow Circle to test its stablecoin offerings, including USDC and EURC, within a local regulatory sandbox, as competition in the stablecoin space continues to intensify.

As part of the partnership, Taurus has integrated its product suite into Parafin’s institutional platform, creating an end-to-end solution for digital asset management, including custody, governance, and compliant token issuance, the companies announced on May 27. Financial institutions using the integrated Taurus-Parafin solution will gain access to custody and tokenization services, real-time wallet execution and a full range of trading capabilities. Taurus is an enterprise digital asset custody and tokenization solution that enables businesses to issue, store and trade a range of crypto products. Parafin, by contrast, is not a blockchain-native company; instead, it offers financial infrastructure and merchant services for small businesses. In December, the company was valued at $750 million following a $100 million late-stage funding round.

The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year. StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.” According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further. Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge prover StarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.” Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.

With bullish sentiment surging and presale milestones rapidly surpassed, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to legendary early-stage breakouts and positioning itself as the must-watch altcoin for the year. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a standout crypto project for 2025. Its presale is attracting both new and experienced investors. The project’s fixed supply and audited contracts add significant credibility. Analysts see potential for massive returns if momentum remains strong. This unique blend of community and security is setting new standards. Bitcoin (BTC): Record Highs, Modest Upside Ahead Bitcoin recently smashed past $111,000, setting new all-time highs fueled by institutional inflows and ETF demand. While BTC’s outlook remains positive, analysts note that its current price leaves limited short-term upside—projecting only a 35% gain even if BTC reaches $150,000. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exponential growth potential for early investors. XRP: Bullish Momentum, But Growth Slowing XRP is trading around $2.34, buoyed by regulatory clarity and institutional interest, with long-term forecasts suggesting a possible rise to $8 by year-end. However, XRP’s recent breakout is showing signs of cooling, and while it remains a top asset, its upside is expected to be outpaced by MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale momentum. Injective (INJ): Steady Growth, Limited Explosiveness INJ continues to impress with ecosystem growth and technical innovation, but its price is expected to remain stable in the $17–$19 range in the near term. With ROI potential of around 48% for the year, INJ is a solid investment but lacks the multi-thousand-percent upside that MAGACOIN FINANCE is projecting. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts While BTC, XRP, and INJ remain market leaders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top opportunity for outsized returns in 2025 .

But crypto expert George from CryptosRUS believes a big move is coming. In a talk with Altcoin Daily , he predicted XRP could reach $8 to $10 by 2025, calling it a “conservative” estimate. With shrinking supply and rising demand, some say XRP’s scarcity could fuel a major price surge. Analyst Believes XRP to Make 4x Jump In an interview, George explained that XRP has survived many crypto cycles, which shows its strength in the market. He pointed out that XRP has strong fundamentals, a loyal community, and a clear use case. He also highlighted one of the key reasons George is hopeful about XRP’s price is the possible launch of XRP ETFs in the future. He believes ETFs could bring in more big investors, just like they did with Bitcoin and Ethereum. This could help XRP’s price rise even faster. When asked about XRP’s price potential, he said Bitcoin might still grow 1.5x to 2x, and Ethereum could go up 3x to 4x. For XRP, as the current price is trading around $2.3, it would possibly jump to $8 to $10, meaning a 4x gain, which he says is very possible. XRP’s Unique Token Burn Strategy Beyond these predictions, XRP works differently from most other digital coins because it doesn’t use mining. All of its 100 billion tokens were created at launch. With every transaction, a tiny amount, like 0.00001 XRP, is permanently destroyed to fight spam. Over time, this has led to more than 13.9 million XRP being burned forever , shrinking the total supply little by little. Some experts see this as a sign of future price growth due to increasing scarcity, even as some critics argue that the supply remains large enough to dampen any real impact. Together, the promise of shrinking supply and the potential for future ETF launches have many XRP supporters hoping for a big price surge ahead. XRP Price New As of now, XRP is trading at around $2.31 , showing a slight 1% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite the dip, its market cap stands strong at $136 billion, and interestingly, the 24-hour trading volume has jumped 8%, reaching approximately $2.2 billion.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 12:03:59

As we approach the end of Q2, investors and enthusiasts are recalibrating their portfolios to hop on the most promising crypto projects, tokens and opportunities that will deliver a possible 10x in June. Three names that continue to stand out are; Litecoin (LTC), Bitget (BGB) and Mantix (MTX) . Why are these tokens tagged as the most promising investments ahead of Q3? Let’s analyze. Litecoin (LTC): The forgotten blue-chip staging a comeback Litecoin (LTC) was created off Bitcoin’s original open-source code with few modifications to serve as a competition. Investopedia named LTC “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold” and at its peak, was once the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. LTC is one of the most reliable, battle-tested, and payment-integrated tokens. Unlike other blockchains, Litecoin offers fast, low-cost payments making it a go-to for users who value efficiency and network stability. Recently, enthusiasm and attention around LTC seem to have renewed again, as it is recording a surge in payment adoption gateways, and retail platforms. With this recent development, many believe LTC is poised for a bullish run to the upside. With over a decade of holding strong and maintaining its stance, LTC is one of the most promising crypto investments for June and beyond. Bitget (BGB): From exchange token to ecosystem powerhouse Bitget is one of the fastest-growing crypto exchanges in Asia and Europe. Its native token, BGB is gaining traction and is widely adopted in these regions. BGB was initially launched as a utility token for fee discounts. However, BGB has evolved into a power key in the Bitget ecosystem – fueling staking, launchpad access, and exclusive rewards. Bitget (BGB) is compliant with regulations, transparent and not under scrutiny like many other decentralized exchanges. BGB is no longer just a token but a sustainable one with long-term potential. Mantix (MTX): The new trending dex In the crypto space, it’s well known that getting or investing in a project or token at its early stage is always the target. Mantix ($MTX) is offering another early-stage opportunity for investors who missed exchange tokens like BNB, OKB or BGB at their early stage. Mantix ($MTX) is currently in Stage 1 of its presale, trading at $0.02. $MTX powers a revolutionary decentralized exchange built for cross-chain trading, staking, and leveraged futures up to 1000x. Unlike other decentralized exchanges, Mantix offers real utilities, and analysts have proven it to outrun existing platforms such as Hyperliquid and DYDX . Some of the utilities include; A revenue-sharing model, which rewards token holders with a portion of the platform’s trading profits. Combined with a fixed supply of 1.2 billion tokens, periodic burns and buybacks. All $MTX holders have governance rights to vote and participate in all decision-making regarding Mantix.

A London School of Economics grad, he also made it to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 and earned an MBE from King Charles III for his social impact work.

This comes as Pakistan prepares to use 2 thousand megawatts of electricity to power… pic.twitter.com/0cbA24O5jx — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) May 26, 2025 Saqib will be responsible for drafting crypto rules that follow FATF standards, leading government Bitcoin mining, and bringing blockchain to areas like land records and finance. He’s been given the rank of a minister of state but will work without a salary or any official perks. Pakistan Backs Crypto This move follows a series of government initiatives in Pakistan’s digital space. Recently, the government endorsed the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), which will oversee crypto exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, DeFi apps, and more. It was also announced that it will dedicate 2,000 megawatts of extra electricity to bitcoin mining, to support both mining and AI data centers. This initiative is led by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to boost revenue, create tech jobs, and attract foreign investment. Former Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, joined the Council as an advisor in April, after he served a four-month U.S. prison sentence for breaking anti-money laundering laws. Pakistan’s Growing Ties With WLF Pakistan’s growing involvement with cryptocurrency has also raised concerns. One reason why Pakistan may be pushing crypto is due to the dip in its foreign investment, which has dropped 45% in February. In January, Pakistan had also hired a U.S. lobbyist in January to set up meetings in Washington. During a visit, the interior minister even asked for more U.S. investment, according to The Wall Street Journal. Shortly after that, the country started building ties with the Trump-linked crypto project World Liberty Financial. In April, Bin Saqib joined as an advisor following a visit by co-founder Zach Witkoff, who signed an agreement with Pakistan’s ministry to explore using World Liberty’s stablecoin for trade and remittances. The WSJ report claimed that Zhao was helping with World Liberty’s foreign connections, but Zhao denied, calling it “ another hit piece .” The PCC has signed a series of deals with WLF to boost crypto investment and innovation.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 12:07:02

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-youre-about-to-become-extremely-rich-heres-why/,"The XRP community is once again buzzing with excitement following a striking update shared by the popular crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO. According to a recent post on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO presented an XRP chart showing the cryptocurrency consolidating firmly around the $2.40 mark. The analyst expressed a strong belief that this consolidation phase is not a sign of weakness but rather the groundwork for what could become an astronomical surge in XRP’s value. Dear #XRP holders, You’re about to become extremely rich. pic.twitter.com/vP9E7utBAU — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 26, 2025 Technical Strength Behind the Consolidation Technical consolidation is often misunderstood in the crypto market. While some traders interpret sideways movements or price plateaus as stagnation, seasoned analysts like STEPH IS CRYPTO understand that these phases often precede explosive breakouts. In the case of XRP, the $2 zone has become a critical support level, where buying pressure is steadily absorbing any selling activity. This creates what’s known in technical analysis as an accumulation zone—a phase where larger players quietly build their positions before a sharp upward move. Market data from major exchanges and on-chain trackers confirm that XRP’s liquidity profile is tightening. Trading volumes have remained robust, with price volatility gradually narrowing, suggesting that both retail and institutional investors are positioning themselves for the next major leg up. Historical patterns show that XRP has a tendency to surge dramatically after prolonged consolidation periods, as seen in past cycles when price resistance levels were systematically breached. Broader Market Context: A Perfect Storm for XRP Beyond technicals, the broader crypto environment is setting the stage for XRP’s rise. Regulatory clarity has increasingly swung in Ripple’s favor since Judge Analisa Torres’ pivotal 2023 ruling, which clarified that XRP sold on exchanges does not constitute a security. This landmark decision dismantled much of the legal uncertainty that had weighed on XRP’s price for years, unlocking new avenues for institutional adoption. Furthermore, Ripple’s strategic partnerships continue to expand across cross-border payment corridors, with a growing number of banks and financial institutions integrating RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solutions. This utility-driven demand for XRP strengthens the asset’s underlying value proposition, positioning it as not just another speculative token but a key infrastructure component in the evolving digital payments ecosystem. Investor Sentiment: A Surge in Confidence Investor sentiment surrounding XRP is palpably bullish. Social media platforms, particularly X, have seen a marked increase in positive sentiment metrics, with hashtags like #XRPARMY and #XRPCommunity trending regularly. Influencers and analysts, including STEPH IS CRYPTO, are amplifying this optimism, reinforcing the community’s belief that XRP is poised for a monumental rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What distinguishes this moment from previous XRP hype cycles is the convergence of technical, regulatory, and fundamental drivers. Unlike past runs fueled primarily by speculative mania, today’s XRP market is underpinned by solid institutional interest, growing real-world use cases, and a legal environment that now offers greater clarity and confidence. A Word of Caution Amid the Optimism While the excitement is justified, investors must approach the market with prudence. Crypto markets are inherently volatile, and even the most promising assets can experience sharp pullbacks. Analysts like STEPH IS CRYPTO emphasize the importance of watching key technical levels and maintaining a disciplined investment strategy. Should XRP break decisively above its current consolidation range, it could indeed unlock parabolic upside—but traders must also be prepared for potential retracements along the way. The message is clear: according to STEPH IS CRYPTO and a growing chorus of analysts and investors, XRP holders may be on the cusp of extraordinary wealth. The cryptocurrency’s strong technical setup around $2.40, coupled with improving regulatory clarity and surging institutional demand, paints a compelling picture of a digital asset ready to soar. As always, those in the XRP community are reminded to stay informed, stay strategic, and—above all—stay patient. If the current signals prove true, XRP’s next chapter could indeed be one of historic gains. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Synthetix Coin price analysis gives out a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. SNX coin has spiked up to $0.8 in the past 24 hours. If buyers maintain the current momentum, SNX price might witness further surges above $0.8, potentially retesting $0.9. On the other hand, if sellers emerge and defend further surges, SNX price might drop below EMA trend lines. In such a case, the altcoin price might aim for a drop below $0.7. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $4.96 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is under bullish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price increased up to $0.795 recovering 1.64% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.31 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2030. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.69, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.69 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. At the start of May, SNX is trading in a range of $0.663 to $0.753.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SNX|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-27 12:10:00

Crypto exchanges continue to carry high risks of money laundering , according to Luxembourg’s latest National Risk Assessment, which warns that the risks remain elevated despite a drop in transaction volumes over the past two years. In the 2025 report , Luxembourg writes that the inherent risk of crypto businesses remains “high,” with the main drivers being “volume of clients/transactions and distribution channels, followed by size, ownership/legal structure, products/activities and the international nature of the business.” According to the report, the use of crypto, especially with regard to investment fraud , “has become more prevalent,” adding further that the surge in fraud is linked to “the increase in value of certain crypto assets and growing media attention around crypto investments.” You might also like: Standard Chartered wins license in Luxembourg to offer crypto custody services “The involvement of non-compliant crypto service providers with insufficient levels of KYC in offshore jurisdictions remains one of the main challenges in many cryptocurrency investigations as they often give rise to lengthy MLA procedures.” Luxembourg’s NRA report Luxembourg-registered crypto exchanges processed 30.2 million transactions worth €106.8 billion in 2021, the data shows.

The framework deploys AI agents to autonomously search, shop, and carry out crypto payments on both online and offline merchants. According to a recent blogpost , the crypto payment protocol plans to build a comprehensive framework that would enable AI agents to take on a more active role than simply facilitating crypto payments. Through AI Payment, AI-powered agents will be able to shop online like real customers; learning user preferences, compare between products and make purchases without human intervention. So far, the protocol has developed an integrated stack that enables different crypto payments to be made through the new feature. The protocol claimed that AI agents will not only be able to complete online crypto payments, but they will also be able to perform QR-code based payments in physical retail stores. With the help of AEON’s Swap Pay, the protocol hopes to give users a smooth and automatic process of paying with crypto assets on various blockchain networks, and upcoming NFC-based functionality will further expand real-world usability. By 2025, AEON plans to deploy its AI agent payment service in North American and European regions through its partnership with Visa and Mastercard . Then in the following year, the protocol hopes to fully establish itself as the industry standard for AI agent payments and agent verification.

So far, the protocol has partnered with projects like PIN AI and SendAI, which will help it embed AI agents more deeply into real-world commerce. AI Payment is meant to be an omni-chain feature that can support crypto wallet from any blockchain network. To make this vision possible, AEON has partnered collaborated with major blockchain ecosystems including BNB Chain ( BNB ), Solana ( SOL ), TON ( TON ), TRON ( TRX ), Stellar ( XLM ), Plume, Bitget Wallet ( BGB ), and KuCoin Pay. Moreover, AEON’s AI Payment comes with a built-in infrastructure complete with KYA or Know-Your-Agent requirements which is used to verify agent identity and behavior, much like how Know-Your-Customer applies to human-controlled accounts. In addition, the framework also abides by LLM-based payment intent verification to make sure its actions align with user intent, and ZKP-based identity and authorization using a decentralized node network. Last week, AEON announced a partnership with KuCoin Pay to enable crypto payments at both physical and online merchants. Earlier in April, the protocol also integrated Stellar network assets, including XLM and USDC ( USDC ), into its AEON Pay solution.

According to Reuters, Circle will be issuing around 9.6 million shares, while some of its shareholders are looking to offload around 14.4 million shares, priced between $24 and $26 each, in a bid to raise $624 million. Once the listing completes, Circle will be trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) carrying the CRCL ticker. Circle’s Upcoming IPO As CryptoPotato reported previously, the company filed for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) back in April. Operating the world’s second-largest stablecoin by means of total market capitalization, Circle also posted impressive revenue reports. The firm posted steadily increasing revenue (up 16% year over year) but decreasing EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) and net income. Back then, Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, said in a letter to investors: “For Circle, becoming a publicly traded corporation on the NYSE is a continuation of our desire to operate with the greatest transparency and accountability possible,” said Allaire, who added: “We are building what we believe to be critical infrastructure for the financial system, and we seek to work with leading companies and governments around the world in shaping and building this new internet financial system.” At the time of this writing, there is no further information on the details of the initial public offering.

Starting today, May 27, users can trade pairs such as PI/USD1 and SOL/USD1 on the exchange. What is USD1? As explained by Dr Altcoin, USD1 is a fiat-backed stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar. It is supported by US Treasuries, cash, and cash equivalents, and was introduced in April 2025 by World Liberty Financial, a Miami-based fintech company. What makes USD1 stand out is its high-profile backing. The company is majority-owned by entities connected to the Trump family business. A Trump-owned entity holds 60% of World Liberty Financial and is entitled to 75% of all revenue from coin sales. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are also actively involved in managing the company. Why This Matters for Pi Network This new trading pair is more than just another market listing — it marks a big step for Pi Network as it moves toward broader adoption. By pairing with a compliant, dollar-backed stablecoin, Pi gains access to regulated liquidity and greater institutional exposure. After more than six years of development, mining, and community building, Pi Network is now being recognized alongside established cryptocurrencies like Solana. This listing could open doors to regulated financial infrastructure, attract attention from mainstream investors, and provide access to traditional financial networks. However, Pi coin price is yet to react to this news. The price has dipped more than 3% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $0.74. After hitting a monthly high of $1.57, Pi is now trading sideways.

Ripple CTO Explains the Truth Behind the Controversy,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-xrp-centralized-ripple-cto-explains-the-truth-behind-the-controversy/,"The post Is XRP Centralized? Ripple CTO Explains the Truth Behind the Controversy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recently, the crypto community has been buzzing about whether XRP is centralized, especially after MMA star Conor McGregor tweeted about the US government potentially investing in XRP, SOL, and ADA. This sparked fresh debates: Is XRP truly decentralized like Bitcoin, or is it controlled by Ripple and its leaders? Unlike Bitcoin – which has no known leader since Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared – Ripple’s well-known CEO Brad Garlinghouse often draws suspicion. Does having public faces mean XRP is centralized? Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, stepped up to explain how XRP’s decentralization really works and why many assumptions miss the mark. Schwartz Explains XRP’s Design: No Issuer, No Control Schwartz quickly tackled the key question: XRP has no issuer. The entire supply of XRP was created at the launch of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and no new XRP tokens have been issued since then. Most cryptocurrencies rely on mining or gradual token releases, but XRP was designed differently. Its full supply was available from day one, allowing anyone to claim XRP without competition or mining. This means Ripple doesn’t control how XRP is distributed. “The XRP Ledger has no mechanism for creating new XRP,” Schwartz stated , firmly dispelling notions of Ripple’s control over the asset. What Does Decentralization Really Mean? Schwartz encourages the crypto community to move beyond debating labels like “centralized” or “decentralized.” Instead, he suggests focusing on the purpose of decentralization: preventing censorship, avoiding control by a single party, and ensuring the network’s integrity. By shifting the conversation to these practical goals, it becomes easier to judge whether XRP’s system can be controlled or compromised. When viewed this way, XRP’s decentralization is more complex, and arguably stronger, than many think. Ripple’s Leadership vs. XRP Control: What’s the Difference? A major source of confusion comes from Ripple’s public leadership. CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other executives are often seen as the faces of XRP in industry and regulatory talks. But Schwartz makes it clear: just because Ripple has visible leaders doesn’t mean it controls XRP. The XRP Ledger operates independently of Ripple’s business. Having a well-known company behind the technology does not translate to centralized control over XRP or the network. Understanding XRP’s Decentralization Today David Schwartz’s explanation reaffirms XRP’s status as a decentralized asset – even if it doesn’t look like Bitcoin’s leaderless model. He reminds us that decentralization isn’t just about having no CEOs or issuing new tokens. It’s about whether the network can protect users from censorship and control. As debates continue in the crypto space, Schwartz’s view challenges us to focus on what truly matters: whether a blockchain is secure, fair, and resistant to central points of failure. In this light, XRP’s decentralization is clearer than ever.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MINING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 12:19:27

Over the past 24 hours, SHOGGOTH experienced a remarkable price increase, leaving many wondering about the catalyst behind this rapid ascent. It appears the powerful Elon Musk effect may once again be at play. What Triggered the SHOGGOTH Memecoin Surge? According to data from CoinGecko, the SHOGGOTH memecoin price jumped an impressive 84.1% within a single day, reaching a peak of $0.0135. This significant crypto pump occurred shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk reposted content from an X account titled “AI Notkilleveryoneism Memes.” While Musk’s repost itself didn’t directly mention SHOGGOTH, the profile picture of the account he amplified prominently features an image associated with the SHOGGOTH token. In the often speculative and sentiment-driven memecoin market, even indirect association with a figure as influential as Elon Musk can trigger massive trading activity. Understanding the Shoggoth AI Meme The origin of the Shoggoth imagery tied to this memecoin stems from broader discussions surrounding artificial intelligence. The AI meme itself is rooted in H.P. Lovecraft’s cosmic horror mythology, where Shoggoths are amorphous, protoplasmic entities capable of mimicking forms but possessing terrifying, unknowable inner realities. In the context of AI discourse, the Shoggoth meme is often used to symbolize the complex, opaque, and potentially uncontrollable nature of advanced AI systems. They might appear friendly or simple on the surface, but their true workings and potential capabilities are hidden and perhaps unsettling. This narrative adds a layer of cultural relevance for those following AI developments. The Potent Elon Musk Effect on Crypto Elon Musk’s influence on cryptocurrency markets, particularly memecoins, is well-documented. His tweets, reposts, or even subtle mentions have historically caused significant price swings for various tokens, most notably Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This phenomenon is often referred to as the Elon Musk effect . Here’s why his social media activity holds such sway: Massive Following: Musk commands an enormous audience on X (formerly Twitter), ensuring his posts reach millions instantly. Cultural Icon Status: He is a prominent figure in technology, space exploration, and pop culture, giving his opinions outsized weight. Memecoin Enthusiast: Musk has openly expressed interest in and posted about memecoins before, making his account a key source of potential catalysts for this market segment. Market Sentiment Driver: In highly speculative markets like memecoins, sentiment is a primary price driver. A nod from Musk can instantly generate positive sentiment and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). The recent SHOGGOTH surge serves as another prime example of how a single social media interaction from a high-profile individual can lead to a substantial crypto pump . Navigating the Memecoin Market: Risks and Rewards While the 84% jump in SHOGGOTH memecoin price highlights the potential for rapid gains in this market sector, it’s crucial for investors to understand the inherent risks. Potential Rewards: High volatility can lead to quick, significant profits. Often driven by community and social media trends, which can create strong momentum. Low entry price for many tokens. Significant Risks: Extreme volatility leading to rapid, substantial losses. Lack of underlying fundamentals or utility compared to other cryptocurrencies. High susceptibility to manipulation and pump-and-dump schemes. Reliance on social media trends and celebrity endorsements (like the Elon Musk effect ), which are unpredictable and fleeting. Many memecoins have short lifespans. Investing in tokens like SHOGGOTH memecoin should be approached with extreme caution, acknowledging that the potential for loss is high. Price movements are often driven purely by speculation and hype, not intrinsic value. What’s Next for SHOGGOTH? Predicting the future trajectory of a memecoin, especially one whose recent pump is linked to an external social media event, is challenging. The price could consolidate, continue rising if hype builds, or rapidly fall back down as early buyers take profits. The sustainability of the SHOGGOTH memecoin price will depend on whether it can build a lasting community, develop any perceived utility (which is rare for pure memecoins), or benefit from further positive attention. For now, its movement is a clear illustration of the power of social media and key figures in the crypto space. Conclusion: The Power of the Repost The recent surge in SHOGGOTH memecoin value serves as a compelling case study of the Elon Musk effect and its impact on the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. A simple repost, amplifying an account featuring the token’s associated imagery, was enough to trigger a massive crypto pump , driving the memecoin price up by over 84%. While the underlying AI meme adds an interesting cultural layer, the primary driver was undoubtedly the exposure gained through Musk’s vast platform. This event underscores both the exciting potential for rapid gains and the significant risks inherent in the memecoin market, reminding investors that social media sentiment can be a powerful, albeit unpredictable, force.

XRP, SOL, and DOGE also have multiple spot ETF filings, with Polymarket suggesting strong approval chances before the end of 2025. The Odds are Rising The leading digital asset manager, Grayscale, filed for a spot Cardano (ADA) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States in February this year. The authority responsible for approving or denying that type of product is the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Numerous X users have recently pointed out that the agency has until May 29 to either approve or reject Grayscale’s application . It is important to note that the SEC has a maximum of 240 days to review Grayscale’s proposed spot ADA ETF and may choose to delay its decision multiple times. The regulator officially acknowledged the filing on February 24, meaning it has until October 22 to give its final answer. Launching such an investment vehicle will give investors additional options to gain exposure to Cardano’s native token and could positively impact its price. After all, buying a spot ETF is as simple as purchasing regular stocks, all done through standard brokerage accounts. In the aftermath, investors hold shares of the product, while the fund itself acquires and securely holds the underlying cryptocurrency on their behalf. Toward mid-April, the chances of an approved spot ADA ETF before the end of 2025 dropped to 37% (according to Polymarket). In the past several days, though, there has been renewed optimism, and the odds have risen to 70%. Nearly a month ago, Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, estimated that the product has a 75% chance of seeing the light of day sometime this year. He later predicted that many of the spot crypto ETF applications standing on the SEC’s desk could receive a green light as early as this summer. XRP, SOL, and DOGE Аre Also in the Game Introducing spot ETFs with various leading altcoins as underlying tokens has been a mission for numerous well-known companies. XRP leads the number of pending applications in the United States, with active filings submitted by Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and others. According to Polymarket, the odds of an approved fund before the end of 2025 currently stand at 84%. When moving the deadline to July 31 , though , the percentage drops to 22%. Solana’s native token has also garnered significant interest. VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise are among the popular names competing to become the first to introduce a spot SOL ETF in America. Polymarket estimates the odds of the financial vehicle to go live in 2025 are 83%. The biggest meme coin in terms of market capitalization – Dogecoin – is on that list, too. The companies willing to launch a spot DOGE ETF in the world’s largest economy include Bitwise, REX Shares, and 21Shares . The approval chances before July 31 are a mere 16%, but those climb to 67% when the deadline is set for New Year’s Eve.

Punisher Coin Can Be Your Second Chance For 1000x Gains,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/punisher-coin-can-be-your-second-chance-for-1000x-gains/,"The post Still Thinking About Missing Dogecoin And Shiba Inu’s Meteoric Rise? Punisher Coin Can Be Your Second Chance For 1000x Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Still regretting not riding the DOGE or SHIB rocket to wealth back in 2021? You’re not alone — but the meme coin market never stops offering second chances. In 2025, investors are asking one crucial question: What’s the next meme coin to explode? The answer might just be Punisher Coin . With a bold strategy, powerful community rewards, and aggressive market positioning, Punisher Coin is emerging as a top crypto for 1000x gains. Why Punisher Coin Could Be the Best Meme Coin to Buy in 2025 Punisher Coin ($PUN), built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, isn’t just riding the meme wave — it’s rewriting the playbook. It introduces a unique “Punisher Energy” mechanism that actively targets weaker meme coins and incentivizes their holders to swap into $PUN by offering bonus tokens. This calculated raid on competing projects drains liquidity and strengthens Punisher Coin’s dominance. But it’s not just about disruption — it’s about engagement. Punisher Coin’s community missions reward holders with real money and $PUN tokens for participation. This gamified layer promotes loyalty and viral growth, setting it apart from the hype-only coins of past cycles. Its presale is already creating a buzz, raising over $30,000 in its first hour — an indicator that $PUN might just be the next big thing in meme coins with 1000x potential. Dogecoin: The Meme King That Started It All Dogecoin’s rise was the stuff of legends. From a joke to a multi-billion-dollar market cap, DOGE proved that community-driven crypto could defy all odds. Yet in 2025, Dogecoin’s returns have plateaued. Its tech is dated, its use case remains limited, and its growth has slowed. While DOGE still holds nostalgic appeal, it lacks the innovation and strategic aggression that newer tokens — like Punisher Coin — bring to the table. Shiba Inu: Ecosystem Builder or Faded Star? Shiba Inu (SHIB), known as the “Dogecoin Killer,” built an entire ecosystem with ShibaSwap, Shibarium, and a loyal community. But even with utility upgrades, SHIB’s price action has largely stagnated. It’s increasingly difficult for SHIB to replicate its original gains, and the influx of new, high-utility meme coins is drawing investor attention elsewhere. Punisher Coin doesn’t just compete — it attacks. By offering financial incentives to switch, it’s not just another meme coin. It’s a threat to legacy meme tokens like SHIB. Punisher Coin vs. DOGE & SHIB: A Comparative Look Dogecoin operates on its own native blockchain, while both Shiba Inu and Punisher Coin are built on Ethereum, with Punisher Coin using the ERC-20 standard. When it comes to community incentives, Dogecoin offers limited options, Shiba Inu provides moderate engagement, and Punisher Coin stands out with high community involvement through missions and rewards. Strategically, Dogecoin lacks a defined market approach, Shiba Inu is developing its own ecosystem, and Punisher Coin employs a unique “raiding” strategy fueled by Punisher Energy. In terms of timing, the early investment window for both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has passed, whereas Punisher Coin is currently in an active presale phase—offering a new opportunity for early backers. Looking ahead to 2025, Dogecoin is unlikely to achieve a 1000x return, Shiba Inu faces challenges, but Punisher Coin is positioned with strong potential for such a leap. Don’t Miss This Wave DOGE and SHIB had their time. Punisher Coin is built for what comes next: a more strategic, more engaged, and more rewarding meme coin era. With aggressive tokenomics, active staking in development, and a strong presale showing, it’s not just a meme — it’s a mission. The crypto market loves a comeback story. If you missed the first wave, Punisher Coin might be your redemption. Join the presale, grab your $PUN tokens, and be part of the revolution that could define meme coins in 2025.
