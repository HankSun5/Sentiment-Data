After weeks of steady gains and strong consolidation above the $100K level, BTC appears ready to break higher and extend its macro uptrend. The market is watching closely, as a clean move above $112K could trigger a wave of bullish continuation and renewed institutional interest.

Specifically, the analysis of UTXOs—Unspent Transaction Outputs—provides a deeper understanding of the state of unrealized profits across the network. UTXOs are the core technical structure that ensures a single bitcoin can only be spent once. But beyond that, they offer critical insight into the profitability of held coins. Currently, the market is nearing the 99% threshold, meaning 99% of all BTC holdings are in profit. This level historically aligns with periods of market euphoria and strong uptrend, but can also signal potential overheating if sustained too long. As Bitcoin inches toward new highs, this metric reinforces the strength of the rally while reminding investors that such high profitability often comes with increased volatility. Bitcoin Thrives In Volatile Times As Market Nears 99% Profit Threshold Bitcoin is showing remarkable strength as it flirts with new highs this week, trading just below $112,000. While global markets react to rising U.S. Treasury yields and persistent inflation, Bitcoin appears to be thriving in the chaos, solidifying its role as both a risk asset and a macro hedge. As traditional markets face pressure, BTC continues to lead with resilience, even as geopolitical and policy-related uncertainty clouds investor sentiment. Top analyst Darkfost shared fresh insights on Bitcoin’s on-chain condition, focusing on the utility of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). UTXOs are the technical mechanism that ensures a single BTC can only be spent once on the blockchain. But beyond that, they serve as a powerful tool for assessing unrealized profits across all held BTC. One key metric derived from UTXOs is the percentage of BTC supply in profit. Currently, Bitcoin is approaching the critical 99% threshold, meaning nearly all coins are in unrealized gain territory. Historically, this level is associated with periods of market euphoria and sustained uptrends, but it also comes with a warning: elevated unrealized profits often precede spikes in profit-taking. While BTC’s structure remains bullish, macro uncertainty—especially around the Trump administration’s policy direction—keeps risk-on conviction muted. As Darkfost notes, “We’re not fully euphoric yet, but we’re entering a zone where late buyers should be cautious.” If the 99% profit signal drops, it may trigger a wave of selling as gains shrink and weaker hands capitulate. For now, though, Bitcoin remains strong, and the uptrend is intact. The market is watching closely because in times like these, BTC tends to move first.

The price recently bounced off the 100 SMA ($105,586) and is now hovering above the 34 EMA ($108,280), signaling continued bullish momentum. All key moving averages are aligned to the upside, reflecting a strong and healthy trend. Volume has remained relatively stable during the pullback and recovery, suggesting no major distribution phase is underway. The 50 SMA ($107,679) also acted as dynamic support during the recent dip, reinforcing the strength of the $107K–$108K zone. The $103,600 level, previously a major resistance, continues to serve as solid structural support. As long as BTC remains above this zone, the broader uptrend remains intact. Short-term resistance now sits near the $110,200–$112,000 range. A breakout above this level would likely trigger the next leg higher, potentially toward the $120,000 mark.

A recent announcement has caught the attention of many, particularly those interested in the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape built on Bitcoin. YZi Labs , a major player in the crypto investment space, has made a strategic move that could accelerate growth for a promising project. What is This Significant YZi Labs Investment? In a move signaling continued interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem, YZi Labs , known for its strategic investments in innovative blockchain projects, recently announced its investment in Avalon Labs . This announcement, shared via their official communication channels, highlights a commitment to supporting platforms that are building foundational infrastructure in key areas of the crypto market. Avalon Labs is specifically focused on developing a robust Bitcoin DeFi platform. While much of the DeFi activity has historically centered around Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, building decentralized financial applications on top of the Bitcoin network, the most secure and decentralized blockchain, is gaining significant traction. Avalon Labs aims to be a key contributor to this growing segment. Beyond its core DeFi platform, Avalon Labs is also the issuer of the USDa Stablecoin . Stablecoins play a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem by providing a stable medium of exchange and store of value, mitigating the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A well-integrated stablecoin is often essential for facilitating lending, borrowing, and trading activities within a DeFi protocol. How Will Avalon Labs Use the New Crypto Investment? According to the announcement, the funding secured through this Crypto Investment from YZi Labs is earmarked for two primary strategic objectives for Avalon Labs : Pursuing Regulatory Licenses: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape is critical for any financial platform, especially one aiming for institutional adoption. Securing the necessary licenses in various jurisdictions will legitimize Avalon Labs’ operations and open doors to a wider range of users and partners. Expanding Institutional Lending Operations: A major goal for many DeFi projects is bridging the gap between decentralized protocols and traditional finance, particularly institutional capital. Expanding institutional lending operations means building the infrastructure, partnerships, and compliance frameworks needed to onboard large financial entities, bringing significant liquidity and credibility to the platform. This focus indicates Avalon Labs’ ambition to not only serve retail DeFi users but also tap into the vast potential of institutional finance looking for compliant and reliable avenues to participate in the crypto space, particularly leveraging Bitcoin’s underlying security. What’s the Connection to the MVB Program? This investment isn’t a standalone event. It follows Avalon Labs’ participation in the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) incubation program. This program is a significant initiative in the blockchain space, co-led by prominent entities like BNB Chain, YZi Labs (in its former capacity or through its continued association), and CoinMarketCap. Participation in such a rigorous program often signifies a project’s potential, innovation, and readiness for growth. The MVB program provides selected projects with mentorship, resources, and networking opportunities, helping them refine their technology, business model, and market strategy. Avalon Labs’ successful navigation of this program likely played a crucial role in attracting the subsequent Crypto Investment from YZi Labs, validating their progress and future potential. Why is Bitcoin DeFi Gaining Momentum? For years, Ethereum has been the undisputed king of DeFi. However, the narrative is shifting. The desire to leverage Bitcoin’s unparalleled security, liquidity, and brand recognition for decentralized financial applications is driving innovation in the Bitcoin DeFi space. Projects are exploring various technical approaches, including: Layer 2 solutions (like Lightning Network extensions or sidechains) Cross-chain bridges and wrapped Bitcoin assets New protocols built directly on or interacting with the Bitcoin base layer Innovative uses of Bitcoin scripting or other functionalities Avalon Labs, with its platform and the USDa Stablecoin , is positioning itself within this exciting frontier, aiming to unlock the potential of Bitcoin’s dormant capital within the DeFi ecosystem. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? An investment like this brings several potential benefits: Accelerated Development: Funding allows Avalon Labs to hire more talent, improve technology, and expedite product launches. Enhanced Credibility: An investment from a reputable entity like YZi Labs boosts Avalon Labs’ standing in the market. Wider Reach: Resources can be allocated to marketing and business development, attracting more users and institutions. Regulatory Progress: Dedicated funding for licenses can significantly speed up compliance efforts. However, challenges remain: Regulatory Uncertainty: The pace and nature of crypto regulations are unpredictable globally. Competition: The Bitcoin DeFi space, while younger than Ethereum DeFi, is becoming increasingly competitive. Technical Hurdles: Building complex DeFi protocols securely on or connected to Bitcoin can be technically challenging. Market Adoption: Educating users and institutions about new Bitcoin DeFi solutions takes time and effort. Examples in the Bitcoin DeFi Space Avalon Labs is not the only project building in this area. Other examples of platforms contributing to the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem include projects focused on lending, borrowing, trading, and asset issuance using Bitcoin as the base layer or underlying asset. This growing ecosystem signifies a broader trend towards making Bitcoin more programmable and useful within decentralized finance. Actionable Insights for Readers What does this development mean for different stakeholders?

Although Liu has remained on the sidelines of XRP until now, he believes an upcoming market shift could present a viable entry point. I’ll buy $XRP when this happens I’ve never held $XRP . But that might be about to change. One key signal is setting up and if it triggers in the next 3–6 months, I’ll finally add $XRP to my portfolio. Here’s what I’m watching — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 24, 2025 XRP Price Trails Bitcoin’s Rally As of this year, XRP has seen a modest gain of 12.54%. Despite this upward movement, it continues to struggle near the $2.50 range and has yet to establish a decisive breakout. In contrast, Bitcoin has recently surpassed new all-time highs, reaching $112,000. This disparity has highlighted XRP’s relative underperformance, leading some investors to reconsider its mid- to long-term potential. Investor’s Strategy Focuses on XRP/BTC Ratio Liu’s approach does not rely on speculative price targets or broader community sentiment. Instead, he is closely monitoring the XRP/BTC trading pair, which he believes holds the key to a more sustainable investment entry. As of now, the pair is trading at 0.00002136. According to Liu, this ratio has maintained support near 0.000022 since November 2024 and has formed a rounded top, signaling potential downside. The investor has identified a value range between 0.000017 and 0.000019 BTC. If the ratio drops into this zone, representing a 20% to 23% decline from current levels, he would consider initiating a position. He referred to this price band as the zone where other altcoins, including Ethereum and Solana, have historically begun significant upward movements. Price Scenarios That Could Lead to a Buy Signal Liu outlined two possible developments that might push the XRP/BTC pair into his target zone. One scenario involves XRP declining to around $1.80 while Bitcoin remains stable near $100,000 . Another possibility is that Bitcoin increases further, potentially reaching $128,000, while XRP remains stagnant. In either case, the result would likely be a lower XRP/BTC ratio, creating the conditions Liu is waiting for. He also cautioned that a quick dip to the $1.80–$1.85 range could act as a short-term correction, potentially forcing weaker investors to exit before a recovery begins. This, he believes, would represent a favorable buying opportunity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strengthening Fundamentals Support Long-Term Outlook Beyond price dynamics, Liu cited multiple developments that have improved XRP’s market fundamentals. These include the resolution of Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the listing of XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the approval of a Canadian spot XRP ETF, and the recent filing of a similar ETF application in the U.S. He also mentioned the increasing traction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Additionally, Liu noted that XRP has consistently underperformed Bitcoin since 2017. A reversal of this trend would mark a significant shift, not only for XRP but also for other long-standing altcoins that have lagged during recent market cycles. Liu has set clear conditions for his potential entry into XRP, a drop in the XRP/BTC ratio to the 0.000017–0.000019 range, and a possible price dip to around $1.80. While he has yet to take a position, the next three to six months will be critical in determining whether those technical conditions are met. If they are, Liu has confirmed he is ready to act on what he considers a data-driven and strategically timed opportunity.

While factors like the halving event and U.S. spot ETF inflows are often cited, analysts are pointing to a less obvious, yet significant, driver: instability in Japan’s bond market. Understanding the Bitcoin price Japan connection reveals fascinating dynamics at play in the global financial system. Is Japan’s Bond Market Shaking Up Bitcoin? Yes, according to some prominent market watchers. The core idea is that rising yields in Japan’s government bond market signal potential stress and increased sovereign credit risk for one of the world’s largest economies. When the cost for a government to borrow money (the yield on its bonds) goes up significantly, it can make investors nervous about the stability of that nation’s finances. Here’s a breakdown of the situation: Japan has maintained ultra-low interest rates and bond yields for decades as part of its economic policy. Recently, yields on longer-term Japanese government bonds (JGBs), particularly the 30-year yield, have been climbing, reaching levels not seen in years or even decades. This rise suggests market participants are demanding higher returns to hold Japanese debt, indicating concerns about future inflation or the government’s ability to manage its considerable debt load. This volatility in the Japan bond market is reportedly causing institutional investors to look for alternative assets that are not tied to traditional government debt or fiat currencies. Why is Japan Bond Volatility Driving Bitcoin Interest? The link stems from the perception of Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional financial system risks. When sovereign debt markets in major economies show signs of stress, investors, especially large institutions, begin searching for assets that are uncorrelated or even negatively correlated with these risks. Bitwise Asset Management’s Senior Macro Analyst, André Dragosch, highlighted this trend, noting the record high hit by the 30-year Japanese government bond yield. His analysis suggests this move prompted institutional investors to consider Bitcoin as a hedge against potential sovereign default risk. Unlike government bonds or fiat currency tied to a specific nation’s economy, Bitcoin is decentralized and operates outside the direct control of any single government or central bank. Think of it this way: If you are a large fund holding significant amounts of Japanese government bonds, and you see their value potentially eroding due to rising yields or concerns about Japan’s fiscal health, you might seek an asset that behaves differently. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and global, decentralized network, presents itself as one such alternative. Is Bitcoin a True Safe Haven Asset? The debate around whether Bitcoin safe haven status is legitimate continues. Traditionally, assets like gold, certain currencies (like the Swiss Franc), or even specific government bonds (in times of global turmoil) have been considered safe havens – places investors flock to during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Arguments for Bitcoin as a safe haven: Decentralization: Not controlled by any government or central bank, immune to national monetary policy shifts or political instability (unlike fiat currencies or government bonds). Scarcity: Fixed supply cap (21 million coins) provides a perceived store of value similar to precious metals. Global Accessibility: Can be accessed and transferred anywhere in the world, bypassing traditional banking systems. Arguments against Bitcoin as a safe haven: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings, which contradicts the traditional definition of a stable safe haven asset. Lack of Long-Term Track Record: Relatively young asset class compared to gold or reserve currencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Its decentralized nature also means it operates in a complex and evolving regulatory landscape across different countries. However, the current narrative linking it to Japan’s bond market suggests that, for some sophisticated investors, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed through this ‘digital gold’ or uncorrelated asset lens, particularly when specific sovereign risks emerge in major economies. The Role of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The thesis put forward by analysts like Dragosch heavily relies on Institutional Bitcoin adoption. It’s not just retail traders reacting to news; it’s the movement of significant capital by large funds, corporations, and asset managers that can truly impact market prices. Several factors point to growing institutional interest: Spot ETF Approvals: The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided a regulated and accessible avenue for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Corporate Treasury Strategies: Some corporations have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Fund Allocations: Macro hedge funds and other investment vehicles are increasingly including Bitcoin in their portfolios as part of diversification strategies. The idea is that the scale of capital managed by these institutions means even a small allocation to Bitcoin as a hedge against sovereign risk, especially from a market as large as Japan’s, can create substantial buying pressure. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Market Analysis? This connection between the Bitcoin market analysis and traditional macroeconomics, specifically sovereign debt markets, adds a new layer of complexity. It suggests that global financial stability (or lack thereof) in major economies can become a significant factor influencing Bitcoin’s price movements, alongside crypto-specific events like the halving or ETF flows. Analyst predictions, such as Dragosch’s projection of Bitcoin potentially reaching $200,000, are often contingent on the continuation of these macro trends and sustained institutional buying. If Japan’s bond market volatility persists, or if similar sovereign risk concerns arise in other major economies, the demand for perceived uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin could continue to grow. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Pay attention not just to crypto news but also to major global macroeconomic developments, particularly sovereign debt markets in large economies. Understand the Narrative: Recognize that part of Bitcoin’s value proposition for institutions is its potential as a hedge against traditional financial risks. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin is volatile, its potential uncorrelated nature might make it a component of a diversified portfolio for some investors. Evaluate Predictions Carefully: Price targets like $200,000 are based on specific conditions and trends continuing; they are not guarantees. Potential Challenges: Correlation Risk: Bitcoin could still correlate with traditional markets during extreme stress events. Regulatory Headwinds: Increased institutional adoption could also bring more regulatory scrutiny. Market Sentiment Shifts: The narrative could change rapidly, impacting demand. Compelling Summary The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price appears to be influenced not just by crypto-native factors but also by macro-financial dynamics in distant markets like Japan’s. Volatility and rising yields in the Japan bond market are prompting some institutional investors to view Bitcoin as a potential Bitcoin safe haven or hedge against sovereign risk. This growing trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption, driven partly by global financial instability, is a significant element in the current Bitcoin market analysis and future price predictions, including projections like $200,000, provided this institutional interest and the underlying macro drivers persist. The Bitcoin price Japan connection highlights the increasing integration of the crypto asset into the broader global financial landscape.

In an announcement today, the firm said the feature will empower its community. According to the announcement , the Live Trading feature allows verified creators on Binance Square to livestream their trading strategies to users. The users can also place futures or spot trades directly within the live stream. By introducing this feature, the exchange plans to make crypto trading more accessible and engaging with the friction between learning a trading strategy and executing it completely removed. The announcement reads: “This feature is part of our ongoing commitment to provide cutting-edge tools and resources to empower our community and make trading more accessible and engaging for users globally.” The Live Trading feature is similar to the one released by Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun in early 2025. At the time, the feature generated controversy for its abuse, leading to Pump.fun shutting it down before reopening in April with more safety restrictions. However, Binance’s Live Trading focuses on helping users copy and execute trading strategies from experienced traders. The firm highlighted the several benefits of the Live Trading feature, noting that it will allow users to connect with the creators on Binance Square and gain real-time insights from them. This is expected to improve understanding of the crypto market and enable global crypto adoption while also allowing users who participate in such live streaming to gain more knowledge about strategies for crypto trading. The feature is already live on the Binance app and website. How the Live Stream feature works Meanwhile, the Binance announcement also included a comprehensive explainer of how the feature works for users and creators. According to the explainer, users can join a livestream and check the Strategy Tab to find trades that the creators share during the session. By selecting any trade, they get to see all the details, such as order size, pair, and direction, and can easily place their order, which copies the exact trade directly from the stream. Creators can share up to 100 spot or futures trades during a live session and pin trades in the strategy cards for viewers to gain easy access. Interestingly, this comes with perks for the creators, who earn 50% of trading fees when users copy their strategies from the live stream. The announcement added that creators can get more visibility by participating in Live Trading Competitors and other events organized by the exchange. However, only traders with at least 1,000 followers on Binance Square qualify to be creators. For experienced traders who do not have the required followers to be eligible for the feature, Binance is offering participation in its Binance Square Live Trading Incubation Program. Binance’s new products and features to help market dominance Meanwhile, Live Trading continues a trend of new features and products that Binance has launched in the past few months. The exchange recently launched Grid Trading 2.0, a feature that allows users to customize bot settings and optimize trading experience. This week alone, it has also integrated Bio Protocol on Base Network while introducing new offers through Binance Earn. It also recently added the World Liberty Financial stablecoin USD1 to the Earn, Buy Crypto, Convert, and Margin products. One of the key features that the exchange has launched recently is Binance Alpha, a platform within the Binance wallet that spotlights early crypto projects that have potential, allowing users to buy tokens of such projects. All these new features appear to be part of the exchange’s effort to remain dominant as competitors continue encroaching on its market share. According to Token Insight, Binance remains the largest crypto exchange, with 36.5% of the market share for spot trading in Q1 of 2025. Interestingly, it also dominated derivatives trading with 45% of the market share. However, its spot market shares declined by 1.38% in 2025 Q1, and it has faced some headwinds due to reports of links to the Trump family and the poor performance of new tokens listed on the exchange. Those headwinds could become more serious as competing exchanges continue to expand. For instance, Robinhood recently bought BitStamp while Kraken acquired Ninja Traders, deals that could expand their product offerings and attract more users.

These networks, also known as “fei qian” or flying money, operate in the shadows and function outside traditional banking regulations, and as a result, facilitate an array of illicit activities, from drug trafficking to cybercrime. The symbiotic relationship between global crime networks and Chinese underground banks According to TRM Labs’ report , there is a symbiotic relationship between Chinese underground banks and organized crime groups worldwide, and it operates beyond regulatory oversight. These networks have been known to use informal value transfer systems, such as “mirror exchanges,” to move funds across borders, which helps them avoid triggering the AML alarms in regulated banking systems. This network allows a broker in the U.S. to collect drug cartel cash and provide equivalent value in China—often in cryptocurrency or through trade-based money laundering (TBML)—without any cross-border wire transfers. In this way, cartels have been able to repatriate illicit earnings while helping wealthy Chinese clients interested in capital flight evade China’s strict capital controls, creating a mutually beneficial partnership. TRM Labs says these networks’ reach now extends globally, allowing them to serve a diverse clientele of criminal organizations from Mexican cartels to North Korean hackers. The cartels, for example, reportedly rely on Chinese underground bankers to launder drug proceeds, as seen in a Los Angeles-based ring that laundered over USD 50 million in narcotics revenue via crypto and trade-based schemes. Similarly, North Korean hackers depend on Chinese over-the-counter (OTC) brokers to convert stolen digital assets into fiat currency or commodities, evading global sanctions. The symbiotic ecosystem thrives on the ability of underground banks to act as a bridge between the cash-heavy criminal underworld and the formal economy. It depends on encrypted communication platforms like WeChat and Telegram, and exploiting regulatory gaps in jurisdictions with weak oversight, to ensure that illicit funds remain obscure. The financial pipeline for drug trafficking One particularly alarming thing about Chinese underground banking networks is that their capabilities have allowed them to evolve into a shadowy financial pipeline that boosts illicit activities, especially the lucrative drug trafficking between America and China. TRM’s report claims the system, which operates outside regulated channels, allows cartels like Sinaloa to launder hundreds of millions annually while Chinese brokers profit from small commissions, typically 1-2%. The increased adoption of crypto has revolutionized this pipeline, as it enables these groups to make faster, larger and more anonymous transactions. For example, TRM Labs reported cases where Sinaloa Cartel-linked launderers in the U.S. deposited drug cash into crypto ATMs or exchanges, converting it to Bitcoin for transfer to Chinese-controlled wallets. These funds are then used to purchase precursor chemicals for fentanyl production or other goods, which are reinvested into the drug trade. The pipeline not only encourages the opioid crisis but also supports a broader illicit economy, including North Korean sanctions evasion and Russian military supply chains. Disrupting the pipeline will require advanced blockchain analytics, international cooperation, and proactive measures, such as targeting key nodes like OTC brokers. There have been successful cases, such as Binance freezing accounts linked to North Korean launderers in 2022. However, the networks’ constant innovation means law enforcement has to remain on their toes and get even better at their jobs.

Recently, a significant announcement sent ripples through the community: the Alpaca Finance shutdown . As a prominent DeFi platform known for its leveraged yield farming, Alpaca Finance has revealed plans to cease operations, citing ongoing financial difficulties . This development is crucial for current users and provides valuable insights for anyone involved in yield farming or following crypto news . What Exactly Happened with Alpaca Finance? In an official announcement shared via their Medium blog, the team behind Alpaca Finance communicated the difficult decision to wind down the platform’s services. This wasn’t a sudden impulse but a step taken after facing persistent financial headwinds. Official Announcement: The news was delivered directly to the community through their established communication channels. Reason Cited: The primary driver for the shutdown is stated as ongoing financial difficulties. Impact on Services: The core offering, farming services, will be discontinued soon. Despite efforts, including downsizing the team, the platform continued to experience consistent losses. This unsustainable situation ultimately led to the decision to cease operations rather than continue under duress. Understanding Alpaca Finance’s Financial Difficulties Running a DeFi platform , especially one centered around yield farming and leverage, involves complex economic models and faces market volatility. The announcement points to ‘consistent losses’ as the core issue leading to the Alpaca Finance shutdown . What could contribute to such difficulties? While the specific details for Alpaca Finance are internal, common challenges for DeFi protocols can include: Market Downturns: Prolonged bear markets reduce trading volume, TVL (Total Value Locked), and overall user activity, impacting revenue streams (like fees). Competition: The DeFi space is highly competitive, with many platforms vying for users and liquidity. This can drive down fees or require costly incentives. Operational Costs: Running a secure and functional DeFi protocol involves significant costs, including development, security audits, marketing, and team salaries. Tokenomics Pressure: If the platform’s native token value declines significantly, it can impact incentives and the protocol’s treasury health. Smart Contract Risks: While not explicitly mentioned for Alpaca Finance’s shutdown, exploits or bugs can lead to massive losses and erode user trust and TVL. The fact that downsizing wasn’t enough to offset these losses highlights the severity of the financial strain faced by the platform. Urgent Actions Required for Alpaca Finance Users For anyone currently using Alpaca Finance for yield farming or other services, the most critical part of this crypto news is the set of deadlines and required actions. Ignoring these could result in loss of access to funds or positions. Here are the key dates and what you need to do: Cessation of Farming Services: All farming services will stop by June 2024 . This means you won’t be able to maintain or open new farming positions after this point. Deadline to Close Positions: Users are strongly advised to close all their open leveraged positions by June 30, 2024 . Failing to do so before the front-end services are significantly reduced or removed could make accessing and managing your funds extremely difficult. Front-End Availability for Withdrawals: The front-end website will remain accessible for withdrawals until December 31, 2024 . This provides a window to withdraw any remaining assets after closing positions. However, relying on the last day is risky; it’s best to act sooner. Actionable Insight: If you have funds or open positions on Alpaca Finance, log in immediately and plan your exit strategy well before the June 30th deadline. Understand the process for closing your specific positions and withdrawing your assets. Broader Implications for the DeFi Ecosystem and Yield Farming The Alpaca Finance shutdown is more than just news about one platform; it’s a reminder of the inherent risks and challenges within the DeFi platform landscape, particularly in complex areas like leveraged yield farming . This event underscores several points for the wider community: Sustainability Matters: Protocols need robust and sustainable revenue models that can withstand market cycles. Relying solely on token emissions or high, unsustainable APYs is risky. Risk Management: For users, this highlights the importance of understanding the risks associated with specific platforms, especially those offering leverage. Protocol failure is a real risk, separate from market price risk. Due Diligence: Always do your own research (DYOR) on the financial health, security audits, and team behind a DeFi protocol before committing significant capital. Market Maturity: While DeFi is innovative, it’s still a relatively young and volatile space. Not all projects will succeed, and failures are part of the maturation process. While this news is unfortunate for Alpaca Finance and its users, it serves as a valuable case study for the entire DeFi space, prompting reflection on resilience and risk. What Can We Learn from This Crypto News? The Alpaca Finance shutdown offers concrete lessons for both users and developers in the crypto space: For Users: Don’t Get Complacent: Even established platforms can face insurmountable challenges. Regularly review your exposure. Understand Leverage Risk: Leveraged yield farming amplifies both gains and losses, including the risk of liquidation and platform failure. Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into a single DeFi protocol. Stay Informed: Pay attention to official announcements and crypto news regarding the platforms you use. For the DeFi Space: Focus on Sustainable Models: The focus should shift further towards protocols with clear, long-term viable revenue streams. Transparency: Greater transparency about a protocol’s financial health (where feasible and safe) could help users make informed decisions. Robustness: Building protocols that can weather market downturns is crucial for long-term success. This event is a stark reminder that even in the innovative world of DeFi, traditional financial challenges like consistent losses can lead to difficult outcomes. Conclusion: Navigating the Aftermath of the Alpaca Finance Shutdown The announcement of the Alpaca Finance shutdown due to ongoing financial difficulties marks a significant event for the platform’s users and the wider DeFi platform ecosystem. As a platform known for leveraged yield farming , its closure underscores the economic pressures faced by crypto projects in challenging market conditions. The most critical takeaway for users is the urgency to act: close positions before June 30 and withdraw assets before the end of December 2024. This piece of crypto news serves as a vital case study, reinforcing the importance of due diligence, understanding risks, and staying informed in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance. While unfortunate, such events contribute to the market’s maturity and highlight the need for robust and sustainable models in DeFi.

The popular cryptocurrency exchange has just announced a significant expansion, bringing enhanced crypto access Germany . This move is set to provide German crypto users with even more opportunities to explore the diverse and rapidly evolving world of digital assets directly on the Coinbase platform. What New Tokens Coinbase Are Now Available in Germany? Coinbase made the announcement via their official communication channels, confirming that residents in Germany can now trade a fresh batch of altcoins. This listing includes tokens from various sectors of the crypto market, ranging from liquid staking and restaking to decentralized infrastructure and yield protocols. Here are the specific new tokens Coinbase has added for German users: Rocket Pool (RPL): A leading decentralized Ethereum staking protocol, offering liquid staking solutions. Reserve Rights (RSR): The utility token for the Reserve Protocol, which aims to facilitate stablecoin creation. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): A token likely associated with the popular NFT collection and its expanding ecosystem. Renzo (REZ): A liquid restaking protocol built on EigenLayer, focusing on yield opportunities in the restaking space. Aethir (ATH): A decentralized cloud infrastructure network, often categorized under DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). Syrup (SYRUP): Details on this specific token might vary, but it typically relates to yield farming or governance within a specific DeFi ecosystem. (Note: Users should research the specific SYRUP token listed by Coinbase). Pendle (PENDLE): A protocol that enables the tokenization and trading of future yield, offering advanced yield strategies. Layer3 (L3): A platform focused on web3 discovery and earning through interactive experiences and quests, often bridging users to various chains and protocols. This diverse selection of new tokens Coinbase brings represents various trending narratives within the blockchain space, offering German users exposure to different types of crypto assets beyond the major ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why is Coinbase Expanding Crypto Access Germany? Germany is a significant economic powerhouse in Europe with a growing interest in digital assets. Expanding offerings in such a key market is a strategic move for Coinbase. Providing broader crypto access Germany helps the platform solidify its presence and cater to the increasing demand from German crypto users looking for regulated and accessible ways to invest in altcoins. Coinbase operates under regulatory oversight in many jurisdictions, including Germany, where it holds a crypto custody license from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). Expanding the range of tradable assets, while adhering to local regulations, enhances Coinbase’s appeal and competitive edge in the European market. What Does This Mean for German Crypto Users? For German crypto users , this announcement is overwhelmingly positive. It directly translates to several key benefits: Increased Investment Opportunities: Access to a wider array of altcoins means more potential investment strategies and diversification options. Users can now easily explore tokens related to cutting-edge areas like liquid staking, restaking, and decentralized infrastructure. Convenience and Accessibility: Trading these tokens on a familiar and regulated platform like Coinbase simplifies the process compared to using multiple smaller or less-regulated exchanges. Exposure to Emerging Trends: The listed tokens represent sectors gaining significant traction in the crypto world. This allows German users to participate in these trends early on. Enhanced Portfolio Diversification: Adding tokens from different categories (DeFi, NFTs, Infrastructure) helps users build more robust and diversified crypto portfolios, potentially mitigating risks associated with concentrating investments in just a few assets. This expansion of crypto access Germany by Coinbase underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing demand for a broader range of assets from mainstream investors. Navigating the New Options: Risks and Considerations While the addition of new tokens Coinbase offers exciting possibilities, it’s crucial for German crypto users to approach these new listings with caution and a clear understanding of the associated risks. Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps or newer projects, can be significantly more volatile than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Key considerations include: Volatility: Prices of these altcoins can experience rapid and unpredictable swings. Research is Crucial: Understand the technology, use case, team, and market position of each token before investing. Don’t invest based purely on hype. Regulatory Landscape: While Coinbase is regulated, the regulatory status and tax implications of trading various cryptocurrencies in Germany should be understood by users. Market Liquidity: While Coinbase listings typically bring liquidity, some newer or smaller tokens might still have lower trading volumes compared to major assets. Education is your best tool. Take the time to research RPL, RSR, PENGU, REZ, ATH, SYRUP, PENDLE, and L3 to understand their fundamentals and potential risks. Getting Started: Actionable Tips for German Users Ready to explore the new tokens Coinbase has listed? Here are some actionable tips for German crypto users : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This cannot be stressed enough. Visit the official websites of Rocket Pool, Renzo, Pendle, Aethir, and others. Read their whitepapers or documentation. Understand what problem they solve and their long-term vision. Start Small: Don’t feel pressured to invest heavily right away. Begin with smaller amounts to get a feel for the market dynamics of these specific altcoins Germany now has easier access to. Understand the Technology: Gain a basic understanding of the underlying blockchain technology and the specific niche each token occupies (e.g., liquid staking vs. decentralized cloud). Utilize Coinbase Resources: Coinbase often provides educational content about the assets listed on its platform. Leverage these resources to learn more. Consider Your Investment Goals: Are you looking for long-term investments, or are you interested in short-term trading? Your goals should influence which tokens you consider and how you approach them. This expansion by Coinbase significantly enhances crypto access Germany , opening doors to a broader universe of digital assets. By staying informed and cautious, German users can potentially benefit from these new opportunities. Summary: A Win for German Crypto Users Coinbase’s decision to list Rocket Pool (RPL), Reserve Rights (RSR), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Renzo (REZ), Aethir (ATH), Syrup (SYRUP), Pendle (PENDLE), and Layer3 (L3) marks a positive development for the German cryptocurrency market. This move not only increases the range of investment options available to German crypto users on a trusted platform but also signifies the growing importance of Germany in the global crypto landscape. As Coinbase continues to expand its offerings, it provides more pathways for users to engage with innovative projects across various blockchain sectors. While the opportunities are exciting, remember the importance of thorough research and risk management when exploring these altcoins Germany now has easier access to via Coinbase.

As altcoin season heats up, TRUMP Coin, Cardano (ADA), and the ultra-cheap FloppyPepe (FPPE) are surging into the spotlight. Unsurprisingly, this rising meme star, FloppyPepe (FPPE), is making the loudest entrance as it nears the $2 million presale milestone. Its early-stage presale is ending in just a few hours, and momentum has sharply intensified. With an 80% bonus currently active using code “ FLOPPY80 ,” buyers are rushing to grab tokens before the next price hike hits. In a market this bullish, it aims to deliver powerful returns, generous coin incentives , and high-yield rewards. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Surges Into Stage 2 Presale With 80% Bonus As Altcoin Season Heats Up As FARTCOIN enjoys a wave of weekly growth, the altcoin market is firing all around with meme token FloppyPepe (FPPE) charging ahead. While TRUMP Coin and Cardano (ADA) also led the altcoin season, the meme coin has recently climbed to Stage 2 of its presale, already surpassing the last phase’s $2 million mark. Just hours into this new stage, investors are swarming in, drawn by its rock-bottom price of $0.00000035 and an ongoing 80% bonus using code “ FLOPPY80 .” This limited-time reward is pushing demand higher by the minute, especially as the bullish altcoin season fuels more decisive presale action. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Floppynomics Fuels Real Value And Long-Term Growth FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) unique Floppynomics brings real value to its utility and reward-based token. With a massive 120 trillion total supply, its deflationary structure is designed to benefit long-term holders. Each transaction carries a modest 3% fee, divided equally into 1% redistribution to loyal investors, 1% token burn to reduce supply and support price stability, and 1% directed to wildlife conservation efforts. With altcoin season heating up, investors are rushing to scoop up its tokens at $0.00000035 . The project is backed by a SolidProof-audited smart contract, 7.8% staking rewards, liquidity pools, and free airdrops. FARTCOIN Shows Strong Gains Amid Altcoin Season, But Investor Caution Remains FARTCOIN is gaining traction as altcoin season kicks in, with a 42% spike last month, 25% in the previous two weeks, and another 30% this past week. Still, FARTCOIN investor confidence wavers after a drop from its $1.70 high to $1.63, sparking fears of another reversal. While market analyst VikingXBY claims the retest is done and a run to $2.60 is next, many FARTCOIN holders remain cautious. Some are eyeing early-stage presale tokens with higher ROI potential, questioning if the FARTCOIN price momentum can truly hold in this volatile cycle. TRUMP Coin Gears Up For Breakout As Buying Pressure Builds Building on the momentum seen in leading meme coins, TRUMP Coin is positioning itself for a strong rebound as altcoin season heats up. Currently valued at $13.93, TRUMP Coin dropped 7% in 24 hours but gained 8% over the past week, according to CoinGecko data. Crypto analyst Kamil shared on X that TRUMP Coin must break above $15 to target $17 and beyond. With growing buying pressure, the TRUMP Coin shows clear potential to rally past the $13 mark, signaling renewed investor interest and momentum building. Cardano (ADA) Price Wobbles Under Bearish Pressure As Altcoin Season Heats Up Investors are closely watching the Cardano (ADA) price potential as altcoin season gains momentum, while rival FloppyPepe (FPPE) claims to offer better opportunities for high returns. Despite a brief climb to $0.85 last week, Cardano (ADA) has struggled to maintain momentum, slipping back to around $0.80. Crypto analyst THEDEFILINK warns that Cardano (ADA) is flashing multiple bearish signals, including a looming death cross, declining volume, and fading whale support. He adds that without a quick shift in sentiment, the Cardano (ADA) token may slide deeper, breaking key support levels and losing bullish momentum. Altcoin Season Is Brewing—And FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Racing Ahead Of The Pack Crypto expert Crypto Rover just fired up the space with a bold update on X (formerly Twitter), declaring that altcoin season is loading. He reminded investors that every four-year cycle ends with an explosive altcoin run, and this time should be no different.

While he was handed a significant 25-year prison term in 2023 for orchestrating an $11 billion fraud, recent reports suggest his time behind bars might be shorter than initially expected. This development has sparked considerable discussion within the crypto community and beyond, raising questions about the nuances of the U.S. penal system. Understanding the SBF Prison Sentence and Potential Reduction Sam Bankman-Fried’s 25-year sentence was a landmark moment following his conviction on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the misuse of customer funds at FTX and the intertwined operations with Alameda Research. However, according to reports citing Business Insider and CoinDesk, there’s a possibility his actual time served could be reduced by over four years. Why the potential reduction? The U.S. federal prison system allows for sentence reductions based on several factors: Good Conduct Time: Inmates can earn credit for maintaining good behavior. For federal sentences over one year, inmates can earn up to 54 days of credit for each year of their sentence served, provided they avoid disciplinary infractions. Participation in Programs: Engaging in educational, vocational, or rehabilitative programs offered by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) can also earn inmates time credits under the First Step Act. These programs aim to reduce recidivism. Credit for Time Served: Any time spent in federal custody before sentencing for the offense for which the sentence was imposed is typically credited towards the final sentence. Sam Bankman-Fried was held in custody for a period before his sentencing. Applying these factors could potentially shift his projected release date from around March 2049 to December 2044, a significant difference of more than four years. It’s important to note that this projected date is based on current calculations and assumes continued good behavior and program participation. What Does This Mean for Sam Bankman-Fried and His Future? For Sam Bankman-Fried himself, a reduced sentence means an earlier return to life outside prison walls. While still a lengthy term, shaving off several years is a substantial change. It highlights that even after a high-profile conviction, the standard processes and regulations of the federal prison system apply. This situation also brings attention to the complexities of sentencing and incarceration in the U.S. legal system. The initial 25-year sentence reflected the severity of the crimes involving FTX and Alameda , but mechanisms like Good Conduct Time exist as incentives for rehabilitation and orderly prison management. Public perception versus the legal and penal process is often a point of discussion in such cases. Understanding Good Conduct Time and other sentence reduction mechanisms is crucial for interpreting such news. It’s not an overturning of the sentence itself, but rather an application of existing federal rules that govern how sentences are served. Key Takeaways on the SBF Prison Sentence The potential reduction in the SBF prison sentence underscores several points: The U.S. federal prison system has established rules for sentence reduction based on inmate behavior and participation. Good Conduct Time and program credits are standard mechanisms, not unique to this case. Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction for the massive FTX and Alameda fraud remains, and he will still serve a very substantial prison term. The projected release date is subject to change based on future conduct and BOP calculations. While the headlines focus on the reduction, the core fact remains: Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of egregious financial crimes and is serving a significant sentence as a consequence of the collapse of FTX and the actions at Alameda Research. In conclusion, the news of a potential reduction in Sam Bankman-Fried’s prison term is a detail within the larger narrative of the FTX collapse and its legal ramifications. It demonstrates the application of standard federal prison regulations, primarily involving Good Conduct Time and program participation, which could result in an earlier release date than his initial 25-year sentence implied. This development, while notable, doesn’t diminish the gravity of the crimes for which he was convicted.

The exchange performs regular buy-backs and burns, which reduce the circulating supply, creating upward pressure on value. As of now, only 60 million OKB tokens remain in circulation out of a total 300 million. This token model mirrors deflationary blueprints adopted by successful exchanges, giving OKB the structural foundation to become a store of value within the trading ecosystem. The all-time high of $73.83 set in March 2024 is still fresh in memory, and with exchange-based tokens rising again, long-term projections remain bullish. Market Catalysts That Could Fuel OKB’s Future Price The current global push toward crypto regulation has significantly impacted centralized exchange tokens. OKX has proactively implemented industry-grade compliance measures, strengthening its trustworthiness. The platform’s integration of institutional features and participation in global DeFi protocols further enhances OKB’s use cases. OKB’s value may also benefit from broader crypto adoption trends, particularly those involving tokenized assets and real-world utility. As token economies mature, exchange tokens with embedded governance and reward mechanisms, such as OKB, are likely to become indispensable. OKB Price Prediction 2030: Analysts Weigh In According to recent projections by Changelly, OKB could reach a maximum value of $494.76 by 2030. The forecasted average sits at $411.32, while conservative estimates suggest a floor of $285.55. These predictions are anchored in OKX’s growing market share, the scarcity created by token burns, and enhanced interoperability initiatives across its product suite. Such a price outlook is contingent on sustained exchange dominance and ecosystem expansion. OKB’s long-term price may also be influenced by macroeconomic factors, such as inflation hedging, dollar devaluation, and integration with tokenized financial systems. The upward trajectory is plausible, though not guaranteed. This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Readers should conduct their own research before making any investment decisions. Risks to Consider with OKB’s Long-Term Forecast Despite positive outlooks, OKB is not without risk. Regulatory crackdowns on centralized exchanges, particularly in high-stakes markets like the U.S., could stifle OKX’s operations. Furthermore, exchange hacks, smart contract vulnerabilities, or declines in trading volume could erode OKB’s utility. Competition from decentralized exchanges and emerging blockchain ecosystems may also impact OKB’s market share. While the token burn mechanism supports scarcity, demand-side stagnation can diminish its impact. Price forecasts are speculative and depend heavily on evolving market sentiment. Qubetics: Redefining Interoperability and Token Utility While OKB commands attention, another crypto project is gaining rapid momentum in parallel: Qubetics. This emerging Layer-1 platform is making headlines for its powerful application interoperability framework. Qubetics enables seamless communication between distinct blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos. Its architecture is designed for enterprise-grade scalability, with zero-knowledge proofs and secure validator layers ensuring high throughput and privacy. Qubetics eliminates the silos between blockchain ecosystems, allowing smart contracts to operate across platforms without compromising speed or trust. In an era where interoperability defines usability, Qubetics offers a unique value proposition. Qubetics Presale Momentum Signals Early Community Confidence Qubetics is currently in its 36th presale stage. The presale has already sold over 514 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,100 holders. The platform has raised more than $17.4 million, showcasing strong market demand and early community engagement. The current token price stands at $0.3064, still considered an entry point by many analysts. The ongoing crypto presale campaign is structured to reward early adopters. Analysts estimate that if $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the return on investment could be 226%. Should the token rise to $5, ROI jumps to 1,531%. At $6, the return expands to 1,857%. If the token hits $10, community members could see gains of 3,163%. A potential surge to $15 after the mainnet launch could bring a staggering 4,794% ROI. These projections underscore why Qubetics is being closely watched. The protocol’s focus on technical innovation, combined with a strong presale performance, gives it a viable chance to emerge as a leading utility asset over the next few years. This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Always perform your due diligence before participating in any crypto presale or investment. Final Thoughts OKB stands as a proven asset within the exchange-token niche. Its established utility, deflationary tokenomics, and exchange dominance offer a level of security that few other projects can replicate. The 2030 price prediction of $494 is ambitious, but achievable if current trends persist. On the other hand, Qubetics represents the frontier of what next-generation blockchains aim to accomplish. Its focus on interoperability and early presale traction suggest that it may follow a high-growth trajectory. While OKB offers stability and proven utility, Qubetics offers transformative potential for those willing to embrace calculated risk. Both assets occupy different ends of the crypto spectrum: one rooted in existing infrastructure, the other trailblazing the future. For community members looking to diversify between growth and security, watching both OKB and Qubetics could be a prudent strategy.

Reports indicate that Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), known for its social media platform Truth Social, is exploring a massive fundraising effort specifically aimed at venturing into the crypto space. This potential move could signal a significant embrace of digital assets by a prominent media entity. What is Trump Media Planning for Crypto Investment ? According to the Financial Times, citing unnamed sources familiar with the company’s plans, TMTG is looking to raise a substantial $3 billion. The primary target for deploying these funds is reportedly Crypto Investment , with particular interest in established digital currencies like Bitcoin . The proposed fundraising structure involves a two-pronged approach: Share Issuance: TMTG aims to secure $2 billion by issuing new shares. This would dilute existing ownership but provide a significant capital injection. Convertible Bonds: The remaining $1 billion is planned to be raised through the issuance of convertible bonds. These bonds can later be converted into equity under certain conditions, offering another pathway for capital generation. This ambitious Fundraising goal highlights the company’s apparent conviction in the potential of digital assets as a future area of growth and diversification. Why Would Trump Media Enter the Crypto Space? The potential entry of a company like Trump Media into the cryptocurrency market raises several interesting questions. While the company’s core business is social media and technology, expanding into crypto could be driven by various factors: Diversification: Investing in cryptocurrencies could offer a way to diversify the company’s assets beyond its primary operations, potentially hedging against volatility in the tech or media sectors. Engagement with a Tech-Savvy Audience: The user base for platforms like Truth Social often overlaps with individuals interested in technology, finance, and alternative investments, including cryptocurrencies. A direct involvement in crypto could resonate with this audience. Exploring New Revenue Streams: Beyond direct investment, TMTG could explore integrating crypto features into its platforms, such as payments, NFTs, or tokenized content, tapping into new revenue possibilities within the Digital World . Strategic Positioning: Embracing technologies like Bitcoin and blockchain could be seen as a strategic move to position TMTG at the forefront of digital innovation, aligning with themes popular among its user base. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and the Market? A $3 billion investment, even if phased over time, represents a significant capital allocation. If a substantial portion of this were directed towards Bitcoin , it could have several implications: Increased Institutional Interest: While not a traditional financial institution, a publicly traded media company making a large crypto allocation adds to the narrative of increasing institutional adoption, potentially encouraging others. Market Impact: A large purchase of Bitcoin could exert upward pressure on its price, depending on market conditions and the timing of the investment. Validation: A high-profile company publicly backing crypto through investment can lend further legitimacy to the asset class in the eyes of mainstream investors. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is currently a report based on unnamed sources. The actual investment amount, the specific cryptocurrencies targeted beyond mentions of Bitcoin , and the timeline for both the Fundraising and investment remain subject to change or confirmation. Navigating the Digital World of Crypto: Challenges and Opportunities While the potential opportunities are clear, venturing into crypto also presents challenges for Trump Media : Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its significant price swings, which could impact the value of TMTG’s investment portfolio. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing potential risks and compliance hurdles. Technical Complexity: Managing and securing significant crypto holdings requires specialized expertise and infrastructure. Public Perception: Crypto remains a polarizing topic for some, and TMTG’s move could face scrutiny or criticism. Successfully navigating these challenges while capitalizing on the opportunities presented by the Digital World will be key to the success of this potential venture. Actionable Insights for Readers For those following the market or interested in TMTG: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from TMTG regarding their Fundraising efforts and investment plans. Monitor Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin , reacts to confirmed news regarding TMTG’s entry. Research Due Diligence: If considering investment in TMTG or cryptocurrencies based on this news, conduct thorough research on both the company’s fundamentals and the specific digital assets. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Digital World ? The report that Trump Media is planning a substantial $3 billion Fundraising effort for Crypto Investment , with a focus on Bitcoin , is a significant development. If confirmed and executed, it represents a bold step by a prominent media company into the rapidly evolving Digital World of digital assets. While opportunities for growth and diversification exist, the company will need to navigate the inherent volatility and regulatory complexities of the crypto market. This potential move underscores the increasing convergence of traditional industries and decentralized finance, signaling a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in corporate strategies.

Data from CoinShares shows institutions poured $3.3 billion into Bitcoin ETFs last week alone, $10.8 billion YTD. This is Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a portfolio diversifier with US Treasury yields rising and fiscal outlook cloudy. US led the inflows with $3.2 billion, Australia, Hong Kong and Germany followed with smaller allocations. Source: CoinShares But not all flows were bullish: XRP saw outflows of $37 million, breaking its 80 week inflow streak as Bitcoin and Ethereum took center stage. Market Sentiment: Institutions Strong, Retail Eyes Altcoins Institutions are betting on Bitcoin as a macro hedge, retail is getting cautious. Social media is shifting to smaller cap tokens like FloppyPepe (FPPE) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) with influencers highlighting their upside as Bitcoin consolidates. On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows 99% of BTC supply is in profit, a level associated with market euphoria but also profit taking.

High US Treasury yields, potential Moody’s downgrade and geopolitical concerns are keeping investors on edge. But Bitcoin’s resilience in these conditions reinforces its dual role as risk asset and safe-haven. Technical Outlook: Key Levels for Bitcoin Price Bitcoin 2 hour chart is consolidating just above the 50 EMA at $108,731 and the ascending trendline from $102,190. The 0.236 Fibonacci level at $109,653 has been a pivot with small bodied candles and doji formations showing market indecision.

A failure to hold above $108,731 could see a pullback to $107,078 or $105,905. For now, wait for clear signals before entering and Bitcoin’s resilience in macro headwinds is short term bullish. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.33M Mark as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With BTC/USD dipping below $110,000, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,384,454/ $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

Under the surface, U.S. fiscal policy decisions and the advancement of the GENIUS Act are redefining how institutional capital, retail investors, and policymakers approach the crypto sector. Bitcoin recently set a new all-time high near $112,000 before pulling back slightly. That move wasn’t just technical — it was driven by macroeconomic shifts, including concerns over U.S. sovereign debt, inflationary pressure, and a recalibration of monetary policy. For many investors, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as both a high-growth asset and a long-term hedge against monetary uncertainty . The GENIUS Act: Opening the Door to Regulated Crypto Integration The GENIUS Act , recently passed in the U.S. Senate, focuses on establishing clearer frameworks around stablecoins, on-chain payments, and digital asset disclosures . It represents a formal shift in Washington’s tone — from adversarial to strategic. While not Bitcoin-specific, the Act provides institutional players with a pathway to explore digital asset exposure under clear rules. This regulatory clarity may help reduce the friction for broader adoption, especially among traditional financial institutions that have been cautious due to compliance risks. Bitcoin’s Role in a Changing Policy Landscape As U.S. fiscal dynamics remain volatile, Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized, supply-capped store of value continues to grow. With ETFs now active, institutional inflows are reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin isn’t speculative — it’s strategic. But as capital flows into blue-chip crypto assets, investors are also seeking earlier-stage exposure to high-upside opportunities. One project benefiting from this parallel trend is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a fast-growing crypto asset designed with a $0.007 listing target , fixed 100 billion supply , and upcoming staking utility . While Bitcoin remains the macro hedge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a strategic early-stage entry point with future utility built in. As regulation and fiscal conditions evolve, both institutional giants like Bitcoin and emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are playing key roles in what could be a transformative crypto decade.

As market sentiment tilts bullish, only a few names are turning heads. At the top is BlockDAG, rolling out a rare deal where topping up $100 on a $200 spend unlocks a 4X stack. With a $269 million presale and 21.3 billion BDAG coins already sold, BlockDAG easily leads the most promising cryptos in 2025. Here’s what makes it, and three other standout projects, worth watching. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Limited-Time 4X Stacking Opportunity Leading the Presale Boom Among the most promising cryptos in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with a strategic offer tailored for quick gains. It has already secured $269 million in presale funding and introduced a unique bonus system, contributing 50% of your initial spend again earns you 4x the original BDAG coins. For example, a $200 spend with an added $100 gives users four times the original allocation. The figures tell the story: over 21.3 billion BDAG sold, price locked at $0.0020 until June 13, and an ROI since batch 1 reaching 2,520%. The team is also prepping for listings across 20 exchanges during its upcoming GO LIVE Reveal. Once the price lock ends, this offer is gone. It’s a high-reward window rarely seen in presale phases, making BlockDAG a top name among the most promising cryptos in 2025. 2. Near Protocol (NEAR): High-Speed Blockchain for User-Friendly dApps NEAR is securing its position among the most promising cryptos in 2025 by combining performance with ease of use. Its advanced sharding tech boosts transaction speed, while its environment supports both new and experienced devs. This makes NEAR a preferred choice for high-speed apps needing low fees. The NEAR Foundation has helped drive growth by backing developers with grants and key resources. Now expanding into multichain support and Web3 usability upgrades, NEAR is doing more than just keeping up, it’s building. This push toward functional adoption helps it stay relevant among the most promising cryptos in 2025. 3. Polygon (MATIC): Scalable Ecosystem Bridging Enterprise and DeFi Polygon is making its mark among the most promising cryptos in 2025 with its real-world tech reach. Beyond its ties to Ethereum, Polygon is powering big brand rollouts, from Starbucks to Reddit. The integration of zkEVM further proves its push for greater privacy and efficiency. Polygon’s support for zero-knowledge rollups and modular networks shows it’s focused on next-gen scaling. With use cases rising in both business and DeFi spaces, MATIC continues to offer real traction, ensuring it remains among the most promising cryptos in 2025. 4. Celestia (TIA): Data-Focused Blockchain With Modular Architecture Celestia is shaking up standard blockchain frameworks, giving developers more power to build tailored chains. It separates the consensus layer from execution, allowing teams to optimize performance and efficiency. This design helps reduce limitations seen in older blockchain models. With rollups and Layer 2 projects demanding scalable data layers, Celestia fits naturally into the upgrade path. Its modular design avoids typical performance blocks and enhances security. These factors place TIA firmly in discussions about the most promising cryptos in 2025. Final Thoughts! Few presales can match what BlockDAG is offering right now. With a $200 spend followed by a $100 top-up delivering 4x coin holdings, it’s a rare chance that won’t last beyond June 13. Add in a fixed price of $0.0020, 21.3 billion coins already sold, and upcoming listings on 20 exchanges, and the numbers speak loud. NEAR, Polygon, and Celestia deserve attention for their strong fundamentals and tech routes. But for those after near-term returns and strategic entry, BlockDAG clearly leads among the most promising cryptos in 2025 . If you’re building your 2025 game plan, this list is your starting point.

45136554,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=163028,1748304025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45136554.jpeg,Circle Firmly Denies Sale Rumors: What It Means for USDC Stability,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/circle-denies-sale-rumors/,"BitcoinWorld Circle Firmly Denies Sale Rumors: What It Means for USDC Stability In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, rumors can spread like wildfire, often causing market jitters and speculation. Recently, a report surfaced suggesting that USDC issuer Circle , one of the most prominent companies in the stablecoin space, might be considering a sale. This news sent ripples through the crypto community, given Circle’s central role in the digital asset ecosystem. However, Circle has stepped forward to directly address and firmly deny these claims, providing clarity amidst the noise. What Were the Circle Sale Rumors All About? The speculation originated from a report by Fortune, which cited unnamed sources suggesting that Circle had engaged in informal discussions about a potential sale of the company. The report specifically mentioned potential talks with two other major players in the crypto industry: Coinbase and Ripple. Coinbase, a long-standing partner of Circle and co-founder of the Centre Consortium which initially governed USDC, and Ripple, a blockchain payments company, were named as parties with whom Circle allegedly held these preliminary discussions. Considering Circle’s significant market position, particularly with its widely used USDC stablecoin, the idea of a potential crypto company sale involving such a key player is naturally a major news item. A sale could have significant implications for the stablecoin market, regulatory landscapes, and the broader crypto industry structure. Circle Denies Sale : Setting the Record Straight Responding to the report, Circle issued a clear and unequivocal denial. According to reporting by PYMNTS, Circle stated directly that the company is not for sale. This statement aims to quell the speculation and reassure partners, customers, and the wider market about the company’s future direction and stability. Circle emphasized that its long-term goals remain unchanged. While the specific details of these goals weren’t reiterated in the context of the denial, Circle has historically communicated ambitions related to the expansion of USDC adoption globally, compliance with evolving regulations, and the development of financial infrastructure built on stablecoins and blockchain technology. Here’s a quick comparison of the rumor vs. reality: Rumor: Circle is considering selling the company and talking to potential buyers like Coinbase and Ripple. Reality (According to Circle): The company is not for sale, and its long-term strategic objectives remain the same. This direct denial from Circle is a crucial development. In the absence of a clear statement, rumors can persist and potentially impact market sentiment or even Circle’s business operations and partnerships. Why Does This Matter? Understanding USDC Issuer Circle ‘s Role Circle isn’t just any crypto company; it’s a foundational piece of the current crypto financial system, primarily through its role as the issuer of USDC. USDC is one of the largest and most widely used stablecoins globally, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Stablecoins like USDC are vital for the crypto market as they provide a stable store of value and a medium of exchange that avoids the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, while still operating on blockchain networks. Circle’s operations involve managing the reserves that back USDC, ensuring transparency and compliance, and facilitating the issuance and redemption of the stablecoin. This requires significant regulatory engagement and financial partnerships. Any uncertainty about Circle’s ownership or strategic direction could theoretically impact confidence in USDC itself, which is why the company’s swift denial was important. Key Aspects of Circle and USDC: Stability: USDC aims for a stable 1:1 peg to the USD, crucial for trading, lending, and payments in crypto. Transparency: Circle provides regular reports on the reserves backing USDC. Adoption: USDC is integrated across numerous exchanges, DeFi protocols, and payment platforms. Regulation: Circle actively engages with regulators globally, aiming to operate within compliant frameworks. Given this central role, the idea of a sale or significant change in ownership naturally sparks interest and concern about how it might affect the stablecoin’s future management, regulatory approach, and overall reliability. The Context: Why Would Coinbase, Ripple, Circle Talks Be Speculated? While Circle denies the talks, it’s worth briefly considering why such speculation might arise, even if unfounded. The crypto industry is constantly evolving, with companies seeking strategic advantages, partnerships, or potential acquisitions to grow and navigate challenging market conditions or regulatory shifts. Coinbase already has a deep relationship with Circle through USDC. Ripple is focused on global payments and expanding its services. In a consolidating market, strategic moves are common. However, speculation doesn’t equate to reality, as Circle’s denial clearly indicates. Potential Reasons for M&A Speculation (Generally in Crypto): Market downturns can lead to consolidation. Companies seek to acquire technology or user bases. Strengthening competitive positions. Navigating complex regulatory environments together. It’s important to differentiate between general industry trends that might fuel speculation and specific, denied reports like the one concerning Circle. Actionable Insights for the Reader For individuals holding or using USDC, or participating in the crypto market, Circle’s denial offers a degree of reassurance. It suggests that, from the company’s perspective, it is maintaining its current course and commitment to its stablecoin operations and growth strategy. This reinforces the narrative of stability that is fundamental to a stablecoin’s value proposition. For those interested in the business side of crypto, this event highlights how quickly rumors can spread and the importance of official statements from the companies involved. It also underscores the strategic importance of key infrastructure providers like Circle in the ecosystem. Concluding Thoughts: Stability Amidst Rumors Circle’s swift and clear denial of the Fortune report regarding potential sale talks with entities like Coinbase and Ripple serves to reinforce its stated commitment to its existing mission and long-term goals as a leading USDC issuer Circle . While speculation is part of the dynamic crypto landscape, the company’s direct response aims to provide confidence in its continued operation and the stability of the USDC stablecoin. This event reminds the market that official communications are key in navigating the often rumor-driven world of cryptocurrency news and corporate strategy.

Over 70% Of XRP Realized Cap Is Six Months Old Or Younger In a post on X, Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt.₿ has talked about the capital inflow situation related to XRP. The indicator of relevance here is the “Realized Cap,” which is a model that, in short, keeps track of the sum of the cost bases of all addresses on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Here—Time To Be A Contrarian? In other words, the indicator provides an estimate of the total amount of capital that the holders as a whole have invested into the cryptocurrency. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how this metric has changed for XRP over the past decade. As is visible in the graph, the XRP Realized Cap (black curve) has witnessed an explosion alongside the recent bullish push in the asset’s price. This would imply that a large amount of new capital has come into the cryptocurrency. In the same chart, the Glassnode researcher has also attached the data related to the Realized Cap associated with the different coin groups younger than six months. The aggregated Realized Cap has seen its growth during the past six months, so it’s not surprising to see that the capital held by cohorts falling in this age range has seen its share of the indicator blow up. This massive capital wouldn’t be in any significant profit, however, considering the price levels at which it has flowed in. After all, the window of the past six months is mostly just the cryptocurrency’s top and the subsequent phase of stagnation that’s still ongoing today. “Over 70% of the capital locked in XRP was deployed near the top over the past 6 months,” notes the analyst. Naturally, this could put the digital asset in a delicate situation, as it wouldn’t take much of a drawdown to throw all these investors into the red. It now remains to be seen how the coin would develop in the near future and whether capital would continue to flow in, despite the fact that its price has been unable to revisit the highs from January. In some other news, the XRP network has seen a sharp decline in the Number of Active Addresses since the March peak, as CryptoVizArt.₿ has pointed out in another X post. The Number of Active Addresses is an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the number of addresses taking part in transaction activity on the XRP network every day. Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals From the chart, it’s apparent that the Number of Active Addresses set a huge peak in March of this year, but since then, activity on the blockchain has taken a severe hit as the metric has gone down by more than 90%.

The TRUMP coin price continues to swing based on short-lived events, while the Cardano (ADA) price potential faces pressure from fading on-chain activity. These assets still dominate headlines, but in terms of investor preference, momentum is shifting toward functionality, and that’s where Web3 ai is rising fast. Now in Stage 06 of its presale and priced at $0.000383, Web3 ai has already raised over $5.5 million. With a projected ROI of 1,747% by the time it hits launch price at $0.005242, the platform is gaining status not just as the next most popular cryptocurrency, but as one built on actual utility. Its roadmap is built around future expansion, real-world AI tools, and integrations across the broader Web3 space. TRUMP Coin (TRUMP): Short-Term Price, No Long-Term Path The TRUMP coin price has rallied on the back of media-driven hype and politically timed surges. Recent analysis shows traders debating whether to buy or sell ahead of scheduled high-visibility events, with short-term gains often followed by steep corrections. This pattern has repeated throughout 2025, and while it brings volume, it doesn’t offer sustainability. The TRUMP coin price lacks connection to a platform or product. Without any long-term roadmap or innovation plan, it continues to rely entirely on attention cycles. As a result, many traders are exiting after quick profits, and long-term investors are beginning to question its ceiling. Despite being one of the most popular cryptocurrency names in headlines, TRUMP’s value narrative ends at entertainment. Investors now looking for breakout ROI with structure are looking elsewhere. Cardano (ADA): Price Potential Falls as Usage Drops The Cardano (ADA) price potential continues to suffer from falling network activity. Data shows significant declines in both transaction volume and user engagement, leading ADA to test key support levels without strong buying interest. While Cardano’s long-term vision of a secure, decentralized network remains, the current pace of innovation appears to be slowing. Historically, ADA’s price potential has been driven by anticipation: staking, upgrades, ecosystem rollouts. But with competitors delivering faster iterations and utility-focused platforms gaining traction, Cardano is now lagging. Even loyal holders are acknowledging the risk of missing the next market cycle’s top performers. In terms of the most popular cryptocurrency heading into 2025, Cardano still has brand equity, but its user base is watching faster-moving, AI-enhanced platforms. Web3 ai: Future Utility and AI Expansion Behind $5.5M Momentum Web3 ai is not a meme coin or a legacy Layer-1. It’s a multi-tool ecosystem designed to help crypto investors make smarter decisions. While the TRUMP coin price relies on noise and the Cardano (ADA) price potential leans on history, Web3 ai is gaining investors by building forward. As part of its future expansion plan, Web3 ai is preparing additional tools: NFT analysis models, chatbot integrations, and SDKs for developers. This will open the platform to creators and institutions looking to embed AI directly into their own crypto products. The result is an ecosystem that adapts, scales, and meets new needs as the industry evolves. Web3 ai is also working on partnerships with exchanges, wallets, and DeFi platforms to allow native use of its tools through third-party integrations. This interoperability expands the reach of $WAI far beyond its own interface, making it part of users’ daily crypto workflows, not just another token in their portfolio. Currently in Stage 06, the $WAI token is priced at $0.000383. With a projected listing price of $0.005242, early buyers are positioned for a 1,747% ROI. Over $5.5 million has already been raised, reflecting growing confidence in the platform’s ability to stand out from traditional and hype-driven tokens. The Final Verdict The TRUMP coin price may spike on news and events, and the Cardano (ADA) price potential may return with ecosystem improvements, but both rely on either hype or history. Web3 ai, on the other hand, is building a forward-facing, utility-first ecosystem backed by AI tools and real integrations. With $0.000383 entry pricing, a forecasted 1,747% ROI, over $5.5 million raised, and an expansion roadmap that includes NFTs, SDKs, and wallet integrations, Web3 ai is becoming more than a trending name. It’s emerging as a serious contender for the most popular cryptocurrency of 2025, not because of what it represents, but because of what it actually helps you do.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 138,500 followers on the social media platform X that resistance around the $0.26 level is key for the dog-themed digital asset. The trader shares a chart suggesting that $0.26 is a price area that appears to be a trend shift level for DOGE. “This level remains the most important resistance wall for Dogecoin.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Dogecoin is trading for $0.22 at time of writing, a 3.3% decrease during the last 24 hours. Moving on to smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ), Martinez says that a breakout past $186 could trigger an exponential rally that sends the asset shooting past a $3,000 price tag. “A breakout here could trigger a parabolic bull run for Solana!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Solana is trading for $172 at time of writing, a 2.6% decrease on the day. Turning his attention to the payments platform Stellar ( XLM ), Martinez says that it could witness a correction after moving below a diagonal support. “XLM could be breaking out of an ascending channel, potentially targeting $0.26!” Source: Ali Martinez/X XLM is trading for $0.28 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease on the day. Concluding his analysis with the native asset of the layer-1 platform Toncoin ( TON ), the analyst notes that it too looks to be on the cusp of breaking down of a symmetrical triangle pattern. In technical analysis, a move below the diagonal trendline of a triangle pattern suggests that an asset is primed for corrective moves. “Watch out! Toncoin could be breaking out of a symmetrical triangle.” Source: Ali Martinez/X TON is trading for $3.00 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

Dubai, a global hub for innovation and luxury real estate, is making headlines with a groundbreaking move. The city’s Land Department has officially launched a significant initiative to tokenize its vast real estate market, leveraging the power of the XRP Ledger. This isn’t just a small pilot; we’re talking about a plan targeting a staggering $16 billion worth of property assets for tokenization by 2033. This ambitious project is set to redefine how people invest in and own property in one of the world’s most sought-after locations, making it more accessible than ever before. Dubai Real Estate Tokenization Takes a Giant Leap The core of this exciting development is the launch of Prypco Mint, a platform specifically designed for tokenizing real estate assets. This platform is the result of a collaboration between Dubai’s Land Department, real estate technology firm Prypco, and blockchain solutions provider Ctrl Alt. Their goal is clear: to bring the benefits of blockchain technology and tokenization to the traditional real estate sector, starting with Dubai’s properties. The initiative aims to tokenize a substantial portion of Dubai’s property market – approximately 7% – over the next decade, culminating in the $16 billion target reported by CoinDesk. This isn’t just about putting property data on a blockchain; it’s about creating liquid, divisible digital representations of physical assets, directly linked to official title deeds. Imagine owning a piece of a prime Dubai property without needing to buy the entire building! That’s the promise of this new era in Dubai real estate tokenization . How Does Prypco Mint Enable This Transformation? Prypco Mint acts as the bridge between the physical world of bricks and mortar and the digital realm of blockchain tokens. Here’s a simplified look at how it works: Asset Identification: Identifying suitable real estate assets for tokenization. Legal Structuring: Setting up the necessary legal frameworks to represent property ownership digitally. Token Creation: Minting digital tokens on the chosen blockchain (the XRP Ledger in this case), with each token representing a fractional share of the underlying property. Linking to Official Records: Crucially, ensuring these digital tokens and the associated ownership rights are synced with the official title deeds maintained by the Dubai Land Department. This provides a layer of trust and regulatory backing often missing in earlier tokenization attempts. Platform Listing: Making these tokens available for purchase and potential trading on the Prypco Mint platform or linked marketplaces. This process streamlines transactions, reduces paperwork, and aims to make property investment significantly more efficient. Why the XRP Ledger for Real Estate Tokenization? The choice of the XRP Ledger as the underlying blockchain for this massive tokenization effort is notable. While the official reasons weren’t detailed in the initial report, blockchain networks chosen for large-scale enterprise applications like this are typically selected based on several key factors: Speed and Efficiency: The ability to process transactions quickly and at a low cost is essential for facilitating trading and transfer of property tokens. Scalability: Handling a large volume of transactions and a growing number of tokenized assets requires a network that can scale effectively. Reliability and Security: Ensuring the integrity and security of the digital ownership records is paramount. Suitability for Asset Issuance: The XRP Ledger has features designed to facilitate the issuance and management of various types of assets, including potentially real estate tokens. By leveraging the XRP Ledger , Dubai is signaling confidence in the network’s capabilities to support a regulated, high-value application like real estate tokenization at scale. This move could serve as a significant case study for the adoption of specific blockchain technologies in government-backed initiatives. Fractional Ownership: Opening Doors to Dubai Property One of the most exciting aspects of this initiative is the emphasis on fractional ownership . Traditionally, investing in Dubai real estate requires significant capital, often locking out smaller investors. Prypco Mint changes this by allowing individuals to own a piece of a property starting with an investment as low as 2,000 UAE dirhams, which is approximately $540 USD. What does this mean in practice? It democratizes access to Dubai’s lucrative property market. Instead of needing hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to buy an apartment or villa, you can now potentially invest a much smaller amount to own a tokenized share of a high-value asset like a hotel, commercial building, or residential complex. The benefits of this approach are numerous: Lower Barrier to Entry: Makes property investment accessible to a wider range of investors, both local and international. Diversification: Allows investors to spread their capital across multiple properties or types of real estate rather than concentrating it in one asset. Increased Liquidity: Tokenized assets can potentially be bought and sold more easily on secondary markets compared to traditional property, which is often illiquid. Portfolio Building: Enables investors to build a diversified real estate portfolio with smaller capital outlays. This focus on fractional ownership is a key driver behind the potential success and broad adoption of the Prypco Mint platform. Exploring the Potential of Blockchain Real Estate The integration of blockchain technology with real estate goes far beyond just fractional ownership. The broader concept of blockchain real estate promises to address many inefficiencies and pain points in the traditional property market. Consider the typical process of buying or selling a property: It involves numerous intermediaries (agents, lawyers, banks, escrow services). It requires extensive paperwork and manual verification. Transactions can be slow, taking weeks or even months to complete. Transparency can be limited, and fraud is a potential risk. By leveraging blockchain, many of these issues can be mitigated. Smart contracts can automate parts of the transaction process, reducing the need for intermediaries and speeding things up. The transparent and immutable nature of the blockchain ledger can provide a clear and verifiable record of ownership and transaction history. This vision of blockchain real estate is what Dubai is actively pursuing, aiming to create a more efficient, transparent, and secure market. Navigating the Landscape: What Challenges Lie Ahead? While the potential is immense, the path to fully realizing the $16 billion tokenization goal is not without its challenges. Implementing such a large-scale initiative requires careful planning and execution. Some potential hurdles in real estate tokenization include: Regulatory Clarity: Ensuring a clear and stable regulatory framework for tokenized securities and property ownership is crucial for investor confidence and legal certainty. Dubai has made significant strides in crypto regulation, but applying it specifically to real estate tokens at this scale is an ongoing process. Market Adoption: Educating investors, developers, and traditional market participants about the benefits and mechanics of tokenization is necessary for widespread adoption. Valuation and Pricing: Establishing reliable and transparent methods for valuing tokenized real estate assets and ensuring fair pricing on secondary markets. Security Risks: While blockchain is secure, the platforms and wallets used to hold and trade tokens must also be robust against cyber threats. Integration with Existing Systems: Seamlessly integrating the blockchain platform with existing land registry systems and financial infrastructure is a complex technical task. Dubai’s approach, involving the Land Department directly and linking tokens to official deeds, addresses some of these challenges head-on, particularly regarding legal recognition and integration with official records. However, overcoming these hurdles will be key to achieving the ambitious 2033 target for real estate tokenization . Why Dubai is a Natural Fit for This Innovation Dubai has consistently positioned itself as a forward-thinking city eager to embrace technological advancements. It has actively courted blockchain companies, established crypto regulations, and launched various digital initiatives. Its strong real estate market, coupled with its ambition to be a global leader in technology and finance, makes it an ideal testbed for large-scale blockchain real estate projects like this. The government’s direct involvement through the Land Department provides a level of legitimacy and trust that is often difficult for private ventures to achieve alone. This institutional backing is a critical factor that could propel the Prypco Mint platform and the broader tokenization initiative towards success. The Future is Fractional and Digital The launch of Prypco Mint and the $16 billion tokenization target represent a significant milestone not just for Dubai, but for the global real estate and blockchain industries. It demonstrates a clear pathway for transforming illiquid, high-value physical assets into accessible, tradable digital tokens. This initiative has the potential to unlock significant capital, attract new investors, and set a precedent for other cities and countries looking to modernize their property markets. As the platform develops and more properties are tokenized, we can expect to see increased liquidity in the market, potentially more dynamic pricing, and a shift in how people perceive property investment. The collaboration between government entities and private tech firms, utilizing robust blockchain networks like the XRP Ledger , showcases a model for future digital economies. Conclusion Dubai’s ambitious plan to tokenize $16 billion of real estate on the XRP Ledger via the Prypco Mint platform is a bold statement about the future of property ownership and investment. By enabling fractional ownership from just $540 and linking digital tokens directly to official title deeds, the initiative aims to democratize access to Dubai’s prime real estate market, enhance liquidity, and leverage the efficiencies of blockchain technology. While challenges related to regulation and adoption remain, the strong governmental backing and the clear vision for integrating blockchain real estate into the city’s economy position Dubai at the forefront of this global trend. This development is a powerful indicator of how digital assets and blockchain are set to disrupt traditional industries, creating new opportunities for investors worldwide.

The Bank of Russia has kept its key rate at 21 percent since an emergency increase in October. The tight stance helped slow soaring prices but has also choked investment, just as the boost from heavy wartime spending starts to fade. Moscow’s economic authorities usually present a unified front, yet high interest rates, large budget spending, and strict capital controls have triggered open disputes in recent years. In August 2023, the central bank was forced to call an unscheduled meeting and lift rates by 3.5 percentage points after President Vladimir Putin’s then economic adviser, Maxim Oreshkin, publicly blamed “soft” monetary policy. In March this year, Putin told officials not to freeze the economy “like in a cryotherapy chamber,” a remark many analysts read as a call to begin easing. Speaking to lawmakers in the State Duma on Monday, Reshetnikov said weekly data suggest annualized inflation had dropped to between 3 and 4 percent. “We expect that May figures will confirm this trend, and we, of course, expect the central bank to consider it, because we also see risks of economic hypothermia in the current regime,” he said. The economy ministry puts consumer price growth for 2025 at 7.6 percent, a level Reshetnikov called “realistic.” Signs of cooling demand in Russia are already visible A Russian Railways planning paper last week showed major exporters, including aluminum group Rusal and oil producer Gazpromneft, cutting the volumes of metals and oil products they intend to move by rail. The document points to weaker sales at a time when the broader economy is slowing. Many factories say the 21 percent borrowing cost is too high and have trimmed investment plans. The ministry foresees gross domestic product expanding by 2.5 percent this year, compared with the central bank’s own forecast of 1 to 2 percent. The next rate-setting meeting falls on 6 June. The central bank, for its part, has said it will weigh incoming data but warns that an early cut could reignite price growth if households rush to spend savings and if the ruble comes under new pressure from sanctions or falling export revenues. While economic debate intensifies at home, Russia has shown little interest in peace talks with Ukraine. Military analysts describe recent short “ceasefires” as performative, and efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to draw President Putin into negotiations have failed. Instead, Moscow is widely expected to launch a fresh summer offensive aimed at securing more ground in the south and east of Ukraine, areas its forces partly occupy. Success on the battlefield could strengthen Russia’s hand in any eventual talks. Even so, growing pressures, from securing enough weapons to coping with sanctions on exports like oil that generate a major portion of the revenue, may pull the Kremlin toward the negotiating table.

The crypto space is buzzing with news about Lagrange Labs , a prominent player in the cross-chain infrastructure sector, and their upcoming utility token launch. Get ready, because the LA token is coming, and with it, an anticipated crypto airdrop . What is Lagrange Labs and Why Does it Matter? Lagrange Labs is building essential infrastructure designed to solve one of the biggest challenges in blockchain today: seamless and secure communication between different blockchain networks. Think of it as creating superhighways that allow data and assets to flow freely and reliably from one chain to another. This is crucial for the growth of decentralized applications (dApps) and the overall crypto ecosystem. Their focus on cross-chain capabilities positions them at the forefront of blockchain interoperability. By enabling efficient communication, they aim to unlock new possibilities for developers and users alike, potentially leading to more complex and powerful dApps that aren’t limited to a single network. The Arrival of the LA Token After establishing a dedicated foundation to oversee its development and ecosystem growth, Lagrange Labs is now set to launch its own native utility token, the LA token . The introduction of a native token is a significant step for the project, often serving multiple purposes within the ecosystem. Utility tokens like LA can be used for various functions, such as governance (allowing token holders to vote on project proposals), paying for services within the network, staking to secure the network or earn rewards, and potentially accessing exclusive features. The specific utilities for the LA token will be detailed further by Lagrange Labs, but its existence signifies a move towards a more decentralized and community-driven model for the project. Get Ready for the Crypto Airdrop: How to Participate Perhaps the most exciting news for many in the crypto community is the planned crypto airdrop for the LA token . Airdrops are a popular method for projects to distribute tokens to a wide audience, often rewarding early supporters, users of their testnet or platform, or simply active participants in the broader ecosystem. According to recent reports, the registration window for the LA token airdrop is set to open soon. Mark your calendars: Airdrop Registration Start: May 28th Airdrop Registration End: June 2nd This short registration window means interested individuals need to act relatively quickly once it opens. While the exact criteria for eligibility and the registration process details will be provided by Lagrange Labs , typically, participants may need to connect their wallets, complete certain verification steps, or demonstrate prior interaction with the project’s testnet or related activities. Always ensure you are visiting the official Lagrange Labs website or communication channels for accurate instructions to avoid scams. Understanding LA Tokenomics: Supply and Allocation A crucial aspect of any token launch is its tokenomics – the economic model governing the token’s supply, distribution, and utility. Understanding tokenomics provides insight into the project’s long-term vision and how the token is intended to function within its ecosystem. For the LA token , Lagrange Labs has outlined a clear distribution plan: Total Supply Cap: 1 Billion LA tokens The allocation of this total supply is as follows: Community: 34.8% Early Contributors: 25.4% Investors: 18.5% Foundation: 11.3% Initial Airdrop: 10% This allocation structure shows a significant portion dedicated to the community and the initial airdrop, which is often seen as a positive sign for decentralization and broad distribution. The allocation to early contributors and investors is standard for projects that have undergone funding rounds, while the foundation’s share is typically used for ecosystem development, grants, and ongoing operations. What Does the $17 Million Funding Mean? It’s worth noting that Lagrange Labs secured a substantial $17 million in investment last year. This significant funding round demonstrates strong investor confidence in their vision for cross-chain infrastructure and their ability to execute on their roadmap. Such funding is essential for building complex technology, hiring talent, and expanding the project’s reach. The successful funding round likely played a key role in enabling the project to reach this stage, including the development necessary for the LA token launch and the subsequent airdrop. It provides resources to continue building robust and secure cross-chain solutions. Why Airdrops Are Exciting for the Community A crypto airdrop like the one planned by Lagrange Labs serves multiple purposes. For the project, it helps to decentralize token ownership, generate excitement and awareness, and potentially attract new users to their platform or technology. For participants, it offers an opportunity to receive free tokens, becoming early holders and stakeholders in the project’s success. Participating in airdrops can be a way to get involved with promising projects early on. However, it’s always important to do your own research (DYOR) and be cautious of scams. Only use official links provided by Lagrange Labs . Actionable Steps: Preparing for the Airdrop If you’re interested in the LA token airdrop, here are some actionable steps you can take: Monitor Official Channels: Follow Lagrange Labs on their official social media (like Twitter/X), Discord, and check their official website regularly for the precise airdrop registration link and detailed instructions. Prepare Your Wallet: Ensure you have a compatible cryptocurrency wallet ready. MetaMask or similar EVM-compatible wallets are often used for airdrops on networks like Ethereum or Layer 2s, which are common for infrastructure projects. Understand the Criteria: Once released, carefully read the eligibility criteria. Did you use their testnet? Participate in previous campaigns? These factors often determine eligibility. Be Mindful of Security: Never share your private keys or seed phrase. Be wary of phishing attempts and fake websites. Only interact with official sources. Note the Dates: Remember the May 28th to June 2nd registration window. Don’t miss it! Conclusion: A New Chapter for Lagrange Labs and Cross-Chain Infrastructure The launch of the LA token and the accompanying crypto airdrop mark a significant milestone for Lagrange Labs . As they continue to build vital cross-chain infrastructure , the introduction of a native token with a clear tokenomics structure and a community-focused distribution plan via an airdrop signals their commitment to growth and decentralization. This is an exciting development for anyone interested in the future of interoperability and the potential opportunities within the crypto space.

According to the post-mortem report , the main reason for the Cetus incident was a problem in a math library used by Cetus, not a weakness in Sui or Move. Move is a programming language for creating smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, and Sui is a Layer-1 blockchain project. However, based on the report, the effect on users is still the same. As a result, Sui Network revealed that they needed to adopt a more effective approach and improve their efforts to support the ecosystem’s security. Apart from this, the report also highlighted that the network was designed to allow for safer smart contract development, making the first significant incident for a dApp a “deeply sad” moment for the team. Sui team takes effective measures to strengthen the network’s security Last week, the $223 million crypto hack hit the network’s largest decentralized exchange and liquidity provider, Cetus Protocol. Luckily, the network managed to freeze $162 million while Cetus put out a $6 million bounty to reclaim the other $60 million of stolen funds. The Cetus team earlier stated that they were collaborating with the Sui Foundation and other groups in the ecosystem to recover the remaining funds. The Sui Foundation confirmed that many validators had identified the addresses linked to the stolen funds and were blocking transactions on those addresses until further notice. The Cetus team was looking for ways to recover those funds and return them to the community. In addition, to enhance the network’s security, Sui has decided to invest an extra $10 million in security efforts. The network will use this money for audits, bug bounty programs, and formal verification. The team also aims to work with the developer community to finalize these security strategies. Concerning the incident, the team mentioned that it marks a coming-of-age experience, which, according to them, is something every major blockchain has unfortunately faced. They further supported their claim with the argument that no design or programming language can prevent humans from creating bugs. Therefore, the Sui team has urged community members to use this incident as a lesson to learn from it to strengthen vital code on the network and assist builders in taking the necessary steps to come back stronger. Following the CoinMarketCap report, SUI’s price currently trades at $3.49, reflecting a 3.07% decrease in the past 24 hours. Growing cases of cybersecurity raise serious concerns in the crypto world On May 22, the Cetus DEX experienced a hack that was thought to have happened due to a smart contract code issue, resulting in the loss of around $223 million in user funds. Based on the information from the Extractor Web3 security notification tool team, $63 million of the stolen money was moved to the Ethereum network. They also reported a wallet address ending in “AF16” that the hackers used to launder 20,000 Ether worth about $53 million. The recovery efforts and the freezing of assets, organized by various projects, platforms, and validators in the Sui ecosystem, received mixed reactions from the crypto community. Following this, one user commented that the action was good news for the victims. However, according to the user’s argument, if the 114 validators could freeze wallets whenever they wanted, it raised serious concerns about the network’s ability to resist censorship. The user then concluded that Sui was far from decentralized. Notably, the Cetus hack is the latest incident affecting crypto and Web3 in the first half 2025. On top of that, cybersecurity still remains a big concern in the crypto world, with many leaders in the industry urging the sector to self-regulate and strengthen defenses to avoid more regulatory attention.

At first glance, ADA is a well-established project with a mature ecosystem, while MUTM is an emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol with strong potential. This article compares the two to see which has the better chance of delivering 20x returns, focusing on market caps, upcoming milestones, and utility. For aggressive growth investors, understanding this comparison is key to making smart investment choices. Market Cap and Circulating Supply Cardano (ADA) has been around for several years and commands a market cap of billions, currently priced around $0.44. This high valuation reflects its extensive ecosystem, large user base, and many partnerships. However, this maturity also means that ADA’s price growth tends to be slower and more steady rather than explosive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is in its early phase. At $0.03 per token with approximately 11,021 holders, MUTM is still in the presale and early adoption stages. Its market cap is much smaller than ADA’s, meaning that even a modest increase in price could translate into significant percentage gains. This early position offers a chance for outsized returns, especially if the platform delivers on its promises. Upcoming Milestones and Roadmap Cardano (ADA)’s ecosystem development follows a well-established path, with smart contracts, DeFi apps, and partnerships steadily growing. While this stability is attractive to conservative investors, it often limits rapid price surges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, has a dynamic roadmap. The project is set to launch a beta version of its decentralized lending and borrowing platform soon. This upcoming launch is a critical event that will trigger investor interest and price appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique liquidity pools allow users to lend or borrow digital assets with flexible terms, combining P2C (pool-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) models. This flexibility is rare in DeFi and gives MUTM a competitive edge. Understanding Utility: Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stands Out One of the key differences between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) is the utility offered by their tokens. ADA primarily serves as a governance token and a means to participate in Cardano (ADA)’s blockchain. While it is integral to the ecosystem, ADA holders typically gain through network growth rather than direct passive income. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s MUTM token offers tangible earning potential. Users can deposit assets like ETH or DAI into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s liquidity pools to earn passive income. The platform’s utilization rates dynamically adjust interest, meaning that higher borrowing activity leads to better returns for lenders. For example, investing $1,000 at MUTM’s current price of $0.03, if the token grows 22x, will turn into $22,000. This kind of growth paired with passive income from lending rewards creates a strong incentive to invest early. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses a unique system called mtTokens, which represent users’ shares in the liquidity pools and automatically increase in value as interest accrues. This non-custodial system keeps user funds secure while generating steady returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to distribute passive dividends by buying back MUTM tokens with protocol revenue and rewarding stakers, creating a further financial benefit for holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual model also offers advantages. While traditional P2C platforms only allow lending within shared pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2P option enables users to lend and borrow tokens often unavailable on P2C platforms. This includes popular memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB). This flexibility broadens the range of assets available, catering to more diverse investment strategies and increasing the protocol’s appeal. Price Growth Comparison: How Far to 20x? To achieve a 20x gain, ADA priced at $0.44 would need to reach approximately $8.80. Given ADA’s current market cap and its large circulating supply, this level represents a huge jump that would require massive adoption and network expansion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.03, would only need to rise to $0.60 to deliver the same 20x return. Given that MUTM has already increased from its Phase 1 price of $0.01 to $0.03 in Phase 5—a 200% gain so far—it shows strong momentum. The percentage difference between the Phase 1 price and the current price suggests that early investors have already made significant profits, reinforcing why buying in now before the platform fully launches is advantageous. The gains will likely be higher during early phases compared to later ones, as the price tends to stabilize over time. Final Verdict: Which Token Should Aggressive Investors Choose? For aggressive investors looking for explosive growth and the chance to maximize returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a compelling opportunity. Its early-stage status, clear roadmap with an imminent beta launch, and passive income potential through lending pools make MUTM a strong candidate for 20x gains. Cardano (ADA) remains an excellent choice for those who prioritize stability, a mature ecosystem, and long-term steady growth. However, for those willing to take on more risk in exchange for higher rewards, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique features and early adoption phase provide a better upside. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ongoing $100,000 giveaway is another reason to join the community now, helping to build excitement and reward early supporters. In conclusion, while ADA offers a slower climb, MUTM’s blend of innovative DeFi technology, real token utility, and attractive price point make it the more exciting play for investors aiming for substantial short to mid-term gains. The chance to earn passive income on deposits, benefit from the protocol’s buybacks, and participate in a growing, community-driven platform makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the token to watch. If you want to position yourself for growth and financial rewards in the DeFi space, MUTM is worth a serious look today.

Bitcoin’s ecosystem has lagged behind other Layer 1s like Ethereum for years due to technical limitations — especially its lack of support for Turing-complete smart contracts. Bitlayer’s BitVM paradigm addresses this by offering Bitcoin-equivalent security and Turing completeness without altering Bitcoin’s core protocol or compromising its foundational design. But turning that vision into reality requires the cooperation of miners — the entities that create new blocks and validate transactions in exchange for BTC. That’s precisely what this new partnership secures. The three mining pools, representing over 36% of Bitcoin’s total computing power (hashrate), have agreed to support non-standard transactions (NSTs) — a critical piece of BitVM’s challenge-response mechanism, the firms said. Their support removes a key bottleneck to BitVM deployment and brings the system closer to widespread use. NSTs are transactions that are valid under Bitcoin’s consensus rules but are not relayed by the default Bitcoin Core software, making them hard to get confirmed on-chain without miner cooperation. Under this partnership, Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool will serve as guardians of the BitVM Bridge, ensuring NSTs are reliably included in blocks and become part of Bitcoin’s immutable ledger. The BitVM bridge is a special tool that facilitates secure and reliable movement of BTC into other blockchain ecosystems — such as rollups, cross-chain protocols, and smart contracts — without relying on centralized intermediaries. It opens the door for broader Bitcoin DeFi applications while preserving the network’s robust security guarantees. “BitVM represents the most credible path to bring on-chain validation to Bitcoin while maintaining its core security. This partnership solves the critical last-mile challenge of getting Non-Standard Transactions included on-chain,” said Kevin He, co-founder of Bitlayer, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. A win for miners This isn’t just a milestone for Bitlayer — it’s a strategic win for miners as well, especially as they face dwindling income due to per-block BTC rewards being cut in half every four years. Andy, CEO of Antpool, noted that Bitlayer's BitVM can help drive new economic activity and fee-based income for miners. ""Built on BitVM, Bitlayer enables BTC to flow into DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems. That means more use, more fees, and long-term sustainability for miners,"" Andy said in the press release. Leon Liang, chief strategy officer at F2Pool, emphasized the importance of innovation, saying, ""we want to support high-quality projects like Bitlayer that expand what Bitcoin can do.” SpiderPool CTO Kenway spoke to the broader potential of Bitcoin as a financial services platform, stating, ""This partnership lets us unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin DeFi. It enhances Bitcoin’s utility while reinforcing miners’ central role in the ecosystem.” Demand for bitcoin DeFi is growing rapidly Bitlayer’s collaboration with mining giants follows recent integrations with major Layer 1 ecosystems like Sui, Base, Arbitrum, and Starknet. Together, these partnerships reflect a growing demand for secure, Bitcoin-native DeFi infrastructure that scales. Bitlayer is actively onboarding more validators and early adopters to help secure and expand the BitVM Bridge — and to build what could become the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s next evolution.",Finance|Bitcoin|Bitvm|Antpool|F2Pool|Mining|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-27 01:00:00

It has raised nearly $5.4 million, with $WAI priced at $0.000383. A future listing at $0.005242 suggests early buyers could see returns of 1,747%. But beyond the numbers, the project offers useful AI-powered tools for traders. Features include portfolio analytics, scam alerts, DeFi optimization, and more. These tools are only available to $WAI holders after launch. Web3 ai works across Ethereum, BNB, and Solana chains, making it highly accessible. The platform is being shaped into an all-in-one solution for smarter crypto activity. With AI tools set to go live post-presale, the timing for this entry is ideal. Cold Wallet: Protecting Privacy With Zero-Knowledge Proofs Cold Wallet is answering growing concerns about privacy with zero-knowledge storage tech. In stage 9 of its presale, $CWT is priced at $0.0082 and aims for a listing price of $0.3517, suggesting up to a 4,900% return. That places Cold Wallet among the top presale crypto entries in terms of projected ROI. Cold Wallet secures user identity by removing metadata exposure through zero-knowledge proofs. With full non-custodial control, users manage their assets without third-party risks. The MVP is on track for Q3 2025, with listings expected in Q4. As data tracking rises, Cold Wallet’s relevance grows stronger. For privacy-first users, this project offers timely utility and strong growth potential. Final Outlook The top presale crypto names of 2025 are going beyond promises. They’re building real tools, growing user bases, and offering strong market advantages. BlockDAG leads with unmatched presale momentum and advanced tech. Unstaked is redefining how AI functions in Web3. Web3 ai provides practical AI trading solutions, and Cold Wallet protects user privacy with cutting-edge cryptography. Each project plays a different role in the Web3 space, but all are aligned with market needs. Whether you’re focused on utility, security, automation, or performance, these projects offer a valuable early-stage entry point. As listings get closer, these names are gaining serious attention. They are the top presale crypto choices to watch closely in 2025.

Here’s Why UNSD Is The Next Big Crypto Opportunity",https://thecoinrise.com/litecoin-rallies-pepe-breaks-key-levels-and-unstaked-nears-10m-in-presale-heres-why-unsd-is-the-next-big-crypto-opportunity/,"Meme coins and well-known tokens like Litecoin (LTC) are grabbing attention again, with Litecoin’s recent rally and Pepe (PEPE) showing bullish potential. But while these familiar faces dominate the headlines, there’s a rising star quietly making waves: Unstaked. With nearly $10 million raised in presale, Unstaked is far more than a trend, it’s a project driven by automation, AI, and real blockchain utility. While Litecoin benefits from an ETF delay and Pepe rides the wave of Ethereum’s rally, Unstaked is building a solid foundation for long-term success with active development and community rewards. With a potential 28x ROI before its public launch, the real question is whether Unstaked is already the smartest “crypto to invest in” for sustainable, utility-focused returns. Litecoin Defies Expectations with Impressive Rally Even with the SEC delaying its ETF approval, Litecoin (LTC) has shown surprising strength. The coin jumped over 12% in a single day, breaking through the $90 mark, and saw its trading volume surge by nearly 69%, reaching over $900 million. This rally is even more impressive considering the ETF decision was pushed back, something that usually cools market enthusiasm. What’s driving this momentum? Litecoin’s deep connection to Bitcoin. Both cryptocurrencies share a proof-of-work model and similar monetary structures, but Litecoin’s use of the Scrypt algorithm means faster transaction times and wider accessibility. Now, traders are keeping a close eye on Litecoin’s next big move. The $96 resistance level is key, with some speculating a rise to $105 or even $120 if it breaks through. Whale activity is picking up, as large holders begin to consolidate their positions. All of this reinforces Litecoin’s place as a reliable, long-term investment, especially for risk-conscious portfolios. Is Pepe Set for a Major Breakout? The Pepe (PEPE) price outlook has turned bullish, with the coin breaking out of a multi-week symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling a shift in momentum. Trading at around $0.000014, PEPE has successfully cleared a critical upper trendline and held firm at the 50-level RSI support, signaling strength. Key indicators like Momentum (10) and MACD (12, 26) are now flashing buy signals, suggesting that a larger upward movement could be on the horizon. That said, resistance at $0.00001477 and $0.0000178 is still in play, and traders are keeping an eye on those levels. With daily gains of 10-20% still in the cards, PEPE could see significant volatility. Some analysts are more optimistic: Solberg Invest anticipates a move toward $0.000025, while trader Kaleo sees PEPE potentially reaching a market cap between $10B and $20B in the long run. As ETH and BTC rally, meme coins like PEPE are often magnets for speculative capital, but questions about their long-term value still linger. Unstaked: Building a Real Web3 Ecosystem with AI Unlike the constant buzz around popular meme coins and long-established tokens, Unstaked is taking a more focused and strategic approach. Currently in Stage 15 of its presale with nearly $10 million raised, this project is carving out a unique space in the Web3 world, driven by AI agents and a Proof of Intelligence governance model. Unstaked stands out by allowing users to earn not just by holding assets, but by deploying autonomous AI agents that work across platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. These agents are already in testing, with plans to expand to Instagram later this year. And it doesn’t stop there; later this year, the Agent Customization Marketplace will be launched, allowing users to create, buy, and sell AI routines based on actual performance. Financially, Unstaked continues to impress. With a public launch price set at $0.1819 and early presale prices starting at just $0.009831, investors are eyeing significant returns, up to 28x if goals are met. On top of that, the project is promising substantial liquidity post-launch, offering stability rare in today’s presale market. To fuel even more excitement, Unstaked has launched a $1 million giveaway, offering $50,000 in tokens to 20 lucky winners. Entry requires social engagement and a $100 purchase, blending gamification with genuine buyer commitment. In a sea of projects that fail to deliver, Unstaked’s active ecosystem and clear financial strategy are making it one to watch in 2025. Looking Ahead While the latest Litecoin (LTC) market trends and the renewed buzz around Pepe (PEPE) show that crypto enthusiasm is still alive, these coins rely largely on momentum, market conditions, and their past reputation. Unstaked, however, is carving out its space by focusing on real infrastructure, automation, and community-driven growth rather than speculation. With presale commitments nearing $10 million, Unstaked is proving that utility, smart incentives, and long-term vision can rival, and even outpace, legacy and meme coins. In a market full of quick flips and unfulfilled promises, Unstaked stands out as a strong choice for anyone looking for a crypto investment with genuine real-world use, solid financial structure, and early-stage opportunities in the AI-powered Web3 landscape.

That marks a 32% drop from May’s haul of $4.9 billion. According to crypto vesting tracker Tokenomist, investors and traders will face new supply pressure again this month. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says Total Token Unlocks Dip In June June’s release of $3.3 billion is down sharply from May’s nearly $5 billion. A lot of that change comes from projects finishing earlier vesting schedules. But $3.3 billion is still a heavy weight on token prices. Markets usually wobble when billions of dollars suddenly become tradable. Cliffs Versus Gradual Releases About $1.4 billion of June’s tokens will hit wallets all at once in what’s called a cliff unlock. That means a lump sum becomes liquid on a set date. The rest— nearly $2 billion—will drip into the market bit by bit with linear unlocks. A slow trickle of new supply can soften the blow, but it still adds up over time. Source: Tokenomist Big Names On The List Several major projects lead the pack in June. Metars Genesis (MRS) will drop over $190 million worth of tokens on June 21 to back an AI partnership. Since March, MRS has unlocked 10 million tokens each month, pushing nearly $1 billion into circulation so far. On June 1, SUI will unlock 44 million coins—about $160 million in value. Over $70 million of that goes to Series B investors. To date, SUI has released more than 3 billion tokens valued at roughly $12 billion, or about 33% of its total supply. Another 5.22 billion tokens, worth nearly $20 billion, are still locked without a set date. Other Projects To Watch A handful of well-known tokens also have vesting dates in June. Fasttoken will hand out 20 million tokens—around $88 million—to its founders. LayerZero plans to unlock 25 million tokens worth over $70 million for core contributors and strategic partners. Aptos will release 11.30 million tokens, about $60 million, to its team, backers and community fund. ZKsync sets free over 760 million tokens valued at almost $50 million to investors and staff. Even Arbitrum joins the list, adding to the pressure on Layer-2 markets. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets What This Means For Traders Based on reports, big unlocks tend to spark price swings. Cliff events often trigger fast sell-offs as holders gain full access. Gradual releases can drag on prices over weeks. Those who trade around these dates should be ready for volatility. For long-term holders, dips caused by fresh supply might offer a chance to add to positions. Either way, tracking vesting calendars could help time moves and spare traders from nasty surprises.

According to a May 27 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Bitlayer’s BitVM implementation will be supported by major Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining pools including Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. Antpool CEO Andy Chow said: ""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.” BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups. Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backbone A BitVM implementation Bitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners: “This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“ Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer. BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function. Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVM Mining pool support According to Hashrate Index data , Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of 31.5%. Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate Index This is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications. With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development. A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.

The sector urges the government to reconsider its current taxation policies , which stakeholders have deemed burdensome. Despite a more favorable governmental outlook and increasing international momentum, particularly influenced by Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance after his return to the US presidency, the industry continues to face significant challenges. Since 2022, the 30% capital gains tax and 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on all transactions in digital assets have created an unfriendly environment for Indian traders. A think tank Esya Centre report estimates that almost 90% of Indian crypto trading shifted to offshore platforms in the wake of these regulations. Industry leaders say the taxes stifle innovation, drive users toward unregulated markets, and erode India’s share of the burgeoning global crypto economy . The tax regime is “very harsh,” said Ashish Singhal, co-founder of CoinSwitch, one of India’s largest exchanges. He suggests a 0.1% transaction tax – one-tenth of the current rate – which he says would still let light be shone on transactions but would incentivize legitimate trading. Compounding the pressure on the sector, the government enacted new compliance regulations. Under these rules, designated persons must notify the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) of digital asset transactions, causing extra oversight without relief from the already impactful tax obligations. India increases crypto engagement as global trends shift The government’s outlook on digital assets is changing. Execs said the frequency with which crypto firms met with policymakers had spiked noticeably. Singhal said the engagement has turned from once every six months to “monthly, if not weekly.” The shift also arrives as Donald Trump, the US president, sits at the head of the table and embraces digital currencies. Indian industry leaders say the global momentum — especially in the US — is swaying policy discussions in India. In the weeks after Trump took office in January, there were reports that India’s Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth planned to redraft a pivotal discussion paper that may be the foundation for future crypto rules. Seth has not spoken publicly since, but the steps point to Indian regulators rethinking their approach to the sector. India’s crypto industry has long existed under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), once a vocal opponent of digital currencies, had prohibited banks from serving cryptocurrency firms in 2018. The Supreme Court overturned that ban in 2020. Today, RBI’s language has mellowed. Though the central bank remains concerned about the potential risks that digital assets poses to financial stability, its current governor, Sanjay Malhotra, has shunned the harsh language of his predecessors. The relationship has moved from “negative to neutral” alongside RBI, noted Singhal of CoinSwitch, a sign of potential room to work together. India lets major crypto exchanges re-enter market Some leading global crypto exchanges are re-entering India as the country’s regulations are becoming more favorable for the industry. Coinbase, the biggest US-based exchange, has registered with the FIU-IND and can now open in India. The move comes after the brief withdrawal of Coinbase in 2022 when it said it was unclear on regulatory and payment processing fronts. Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, has also made a re-entry into the Indian market after partnering with the very same financial oversight body. The registrations are a major reversal, with the regulators now emphasizing compliance and oversight rather than outright bans. Tom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s head of international policy, said Trump’s comeback has inspired confidence in the global crypto sector. He added that the Indian government now understands they cannot ban crypto anymore. According to Grant Thornton, India’s crypto market will increase from $2.5 billion in 2024 to over $15 billion in 2035. “Competition has definitely started heating up,” said Kush Wadhwa, partner at Grant Thornton’s Indian arm. “India doesn’t have any option but to adopt it, but the problem for them is money laundering and tax evasion — they’re not saying ‘don’t do it’, but they want a control on it.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-27 01:48:37

At the moment, Bitcoin is holding up better than most altcoins — and that includes XRP. With Bitcoin dominance staying strong, many altcoins like XRP are struggling to keep up. As Bitcoin moves sideways or pulls back, it puts pressure on altcoins, causing short-term drops. Right now, XRP is in a cooling-off phase and experiencing a slight pullback. At the moment, XRP’s price is stuck between a support level around $2.30 and resistance at around $2.34 to $2.35. If the price manages to break above $2.35 with a strong daily candle close, it could move toward the next resistance zone between $2.43 and $2.44. Beyond that, there’s a major resistance waiting between $2.55 and $2.62. On the flip side, if XRP fails to hold above $2.30, the next important support level to watch is in the $2.10 to $2.15 range. A Bullish Signal Forming? Interestingly, on the 6-hour chart, there’s a possible bullish divergence forming. While the price has been making lower lows, the RSI is showing slightly higher lows. This is often an early signal that a price bounce could be on the way. However, it’s not confirmed yet. Traders would need to see the price hold steady and start trending upward alongside a rising RSI to take it seriously. For now, Bitcoin’s short-term cool-off is weighing on XRP’s momentum. Even if this bullish divergence plays out, it might not lead to a significant move unless Bitcoin stabilizes or starts climbing again. The good news is, a deeper pullback isn’t necessarily bad news for XRP. What Needs to Happen Next If the price drops to around $2.00 and finds solid support there, it could set up for a major bullish pattern on the daily chart — an inverse head and shoulders. This pattern is typically a sign of a coming reversal to the upside. But to confirm it, XRP would need to pull back to the $2.00 area, bounce back toward the $2.60 zone, and then break above $2.62 with strong daily candle closes. Until then, it remains a possible but unconfirmed setup.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 01:50:42

The second man is a Swiss crypto investor who allegedly assisted business partner Joel Woeltz, who is accused of kidnapping Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan and torturing him in a Soho apartment in an attempt to pressure him into revealing his crypto wallet phrase, ABC7 New York reported on May 26. A separate NBC report said the Swiss trader — who is not named — would turn himself over to police within a week. However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources. The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm. Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days. Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her. The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.” CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit. Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer. Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody. He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28. Alleged victim shares ordeal Teofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.” Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase. NBC New York reported that Teofrasto Carturan has an estimated net worth of around $30 million. Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summit Police said Teofrasto Carturan was tied up with electrical cords and electrocuted. His feet were also tased while submerged in water and the alleged perpetrators held an electric chainsaw to his leg, threatening to cut off his limbs. Police claimed they found a Polaroid of the alleged perpetrators torturing Teofrasto Carturan, one showing him bound to a chair with a gun to his head. Teofrasto Carturan was also allegedly forced to smoke crack cocaine and was urinated on in the Soho apartment, described by NBC New York reporters as a “high-end frat house” with stripper poles and expensive liquor scattered throughout the five-story building. Carturan spent some time being treated at a hospital after escaping, the New York Post said.

Beginning Tuesday the 27th, the world’s largest cryptocurrency will be at the centre of its own ecosystem, Wall Street’s macro diary and one of the most closely watched bankruptcy wind-downs in digital-asset history. Bitcoin Week Of Fire The epicentre is Bitcoin 2025, the annual industry gathering that this year takes over The Venetian in Las Vegas from 27–29 May. Organisers expect more than 30 000 attendees and have added a new “Code + Country” policy track to underline Bitcoin’s emergence as a political wedge issue. “This is more than a headline moment — it’s a signal,” BTC Inc. chief executive David Bailey said when announcing the keynote roster. “Bitcoin is the most exciting financial innovation in the world. It’s at the forefront of the national conversation.” Related Reading: $200,000 Bitcoin ‘Is Real’ By Year-End, Says Top Researcher For the first time a sitting US vice-president will speak at a crypto conference: JD Vance is due on the main stage Wednesday morning, 28 May. His team has trailed a defence of “innovation, financial sovereignty and a more resilient American future,” and public filings show personal Bitcoin holdings worth up to half a million dollars. Moreover, “Crypto Czar” David Sacks, Bo Hines, Executive Director of President Donald Trump’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets and US Senator Cynthia Lummis will speak on Tuesday. The political guest list does not end there. From abroad, Brexit campaigner – and now Reform UK leader – Nigel Farage has confirmed a fireside interview, arguing that national sovereignty and “free speech” run parallel to Bitcoin’s ethos. “We are pleased to announce that Nigel Farage will join the speaker lineup at the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas,” organisers wrote in a statement last week, framing his return as a natural sequel to his 2023 appearance in Amsterdam. Also slated are Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., underlining how thoroughly the Republican establishment has embraced the event. While cameras focus on the Venetian halls, traders will be wiring what the FTX Recovery Trust calls “over $5 billion” to thousands of former customers of the failed exchange. The second distribution round, beginning Thursday 30 May, will see creditors recover between 54 % and 120 % of their dollar-denominated claims, with BitGo and Kraken acting as agents. Because many claimants sold other crypto holdings to cover losses in 2022, analysts will watch whether a fresh injection of spendable dollars feeds directly back into the market.

On Wednesday afternoon the Federal Reserve releases the minutes of its 6–7 May policy meeting. The Fed’s signaled that, because of persistent inflation risks, a rate cut is off the table for now, even as policymakers express concern over the economic fallout tariffs could trigger. Twenty-four hours later comes the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ second estimate of first-quarter GDP; the advance print showed a 0.3 % annualised contraction, a surprise that rattled rate-cut odds in early May. Finally, Friday brings the April Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, with publication set for 30 May at 08:30 EDT. March’s core PCE was flat month-on-month and 2.6 % year-on-year; economists now infer a 0.2 % MoM rebound for April, keeping the YoY pace at 2.6 %. The estimate comes from translating the latest CPI release into PCE weights. Headline PCE inflation has already slowed to 2.3 % YoY in March, its lowest in four years.

So the question now is, which ones count as the best performing crypto coins in 2025? People are no longer just chasing hype. The interest is now in strong setups that can show real results. This article highlights four standout options gaining attention: BlockDAG, Ethereum, Official Trump Coin, and Arbitrum. Each brings something different, from fixed presale prices and competitive buying events to network scalability and cultural impact, positioning them as top names in 2025. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Building Buzz with Buyer Battles and a $269M Presale Among the best performing crypto coins to watch closely, BlockDAG has made a mark with its huge presale success and exciting Buyer Battles feature. This gamified concept pits wallet addresses against each other daily, offering large rewards to the most active buyers. Every day, 150 million BDAG coins are set aside in a reward pool. The buyer who accumulates the highest BDAG during the day gets the remaining unclaimed coins from the pool, free of charge. This keeps the buying energy alive and highly competitive. So far, the project has raised $269 million and sold 21.3 billion BDAG coins. The current price remains at $0.0020 until June 13, giving a potential return of 2,520% when it hits exchanges. But it’s more than numbers, BlockDAG also delivers value through its no-code dApp builder, CertiK verification, and detailed roadmap for wide-scale adoption. BlockDAG (BDAG) also maintains strong momentum with daily social updates, regular podcast announcements, and influencer support. For those tracking the best performing crypto coins, BDAG is gaining attention due to both its progress and strategy. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Holding Ground in the Smart Contract Space Ethereum continues to rank high among the best performing crypto coins, thanks to its strong presence in DeFi, NFT markets, and dApp development. The shift to proof-of-stake has improved both energy use and scalability. Ethereum’s Layer 2 network, including names like Arbitrum and Optimism, remains active. Plus, new staking methods like restaking and liquid staking provide ETH holders with new ways to earn without restrictions. Despite market swings, Ethereum’s developer strength and network use keep it firmly among the best performing crypto coins for 2025 and beyond. 3. Official Trump Coin (DJT): A Meme Coin Riding Political Waves DJT, the Official Trump Coin, has gained traction in the meme coin sector. Once seen as a novelty, it’s now pulling in volume as political debates heat up. Its direct link to Donald Trump remains unclear, but that hasn’t slowed down the buzz. DJT is active on Solana DEXs and heavily mentioned on social media. It’s benefiting from the mix of politics and memes, a space growing fast in crypto. Though it carries high risk, the ongoing talk around DJT secures its place among the best performing crypto coins of this year. 4. Arbitrum (ARB): Showing Strength with Layer 2 Solutions Arbitrum is becoming one of Ethereum’s leading Layer 2 scaling platforms. Its Optimistic Rollups offer quicker transactions with lower gas fees, and the network already supports projects like GMX, Camelot, and Radiant Capital. ARB’s price has recovered in 2025, helped by active development and new incentives. Arbitrum Orbit, which helps developers create secure custom chains, has also boosted attention. With growing user numbers and increasing total value locked, Arbitrum is seen as one of the best performing crypto coins showing solid long-term development. Why These Coins Stand Out in 2025 As crypto moves forward, the best performing crypto coins will be those offering useful features, strong community action, and consistent updates. BlockDAG stands out due to its daily Buyer Battles, fair pricing, and strong roadmap. Ethereum continues leading in smart contracts. DJT brings in cultural energy, and Arbitrum proves its value as a scalable tool for developers. Each of these coins brings something different, whether it’s easier access, better performance, or active community appeal. Watching these best performing crypto coins in 2025 could be a smart step for those following key developments.

The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin ( BTC ) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26. Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko. However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin ; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.” Source: Alexandre Laizet Venture capital firm Fulgur Ventures invested the lion’s share for the bond sale, with 55.3 million euros ($62.9 million), while crypto private investment fund Moonlight Capital invested 5 million euros ($5.7 million). The bonds will be convertible into shares of the Blockchain Group at 3.809 euros ($4.34). The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) is listed on Euronext Paris, Europe’s second-largest stock exchange by market cap. The company’s website says it is focused on “increasing the number of Bitcoin per share over time by leveraging the holding company’s excess cash and appropriate financing instruments.” ALTBG closed May 26 trading down nearly 5.5% at 2.77 euros ($3.16), but has gained nearly 766% so far this year, according to Google Finance. After the company started buying Bitcoin on Nov. 5, the stock spiked 225% to 0.48 euros ($0.52). The Blockchain Group’s stock price has made significant gains since the company announced its Bitcoin buying plan. Source: Google Finance In its 2024 financial year results, released April 30, the Blockchain Group listed the current yield from its Bitcoin holdings at over 709%. Meanwhile, its total consolidated revenue for the year was 13,864,000 euros ($15.8 million) compared to 20,408,000 euros ($23.2 million) for the previous fiscal year, representing a decrease of 32.1%. As part of its results, the company said its long-term strategy is to acquire 1% of the total Bitcoin supply over the next eight years, with a target of over 170 by 2032. More companies take the “orange pill” A growing number of public companies are buying Bitcoin to hold for the long term in the hopes of making gains from the asset.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Uniswap's UNI token surged from $6.00 to $6.65 over the past 24 hours, pushing the token up 5%, while the broader market gauge CoinDesk20 Index fell 1.8% in the last 24 hours. This momentum coincides with Uniswap recording its highest monthly transaction volume since February, processing over $73 billion in trades and generating more than $380 million in revenue this year, as institutional interest grows and a notable whale re-entered the market by acquiring nearly $4 million worth of UNI. SCB10X’s New CEO Sees US-Asia Crypto Dealflow, AI Opportunities Kaweewut Temphuwapat, the new CEO of SCB10X, the venture arm of Thailand's SCB bank, sees significant opportunities emerging at the intersection of AI, crypto, and Web3. ""We definitely [are] going more on AI and also crypto and AI plus crypto,"" Temphuwapat told CoinDesk, highlighting these hybrid investments as firmly ""under our radar."" He predicts clearer crypto regulation in the U.S. will fuel increased deal flow into resilient Asian markets, noting SCB10X's early success investing in Ripple: ""We are an early investor in Ripple of 10 years ago… we've used that technology for the last five to six years in our SCB App."" Temphuwapat praised Thailand’s proactive and innovative regulators, highlighting the country's robust payments infrastructure. He expects Thai banks, including SCB, could soon directly hold crypto tokens on their balance sheets, initially through regulatory sandboxes: ""The intention is there... they allow us to do [it] in a small scale."" Trader James Wynn Shifts From Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bets to Memecoins, Goes Long Pepe Pseudonymous trader ""James Wynn,"" known for high-stakes crypto bets on decentralized platform Hyperliquid, has shifted focus from billion-dollar bitcoin positions to memecoins, recently placing a leveraged $1 million bet on Pepe (PEPE), CoinDesk reported earlier. Previously, Wynn closed a massive $1.2 billion bitcoin long position at a $17.5 million loss, before pivoting to a $1 billion short position at 40x leverage, effectively wagering their entire $50 million wallet balance on bitcoin’s downside. That short briefly netted Wynn about $3 million in profit before closing, marking one of the largest trades ever executed fully on-chain. Wynn announced stepping back from perpetual trading after securing a cumulative profit of $25 million, earned from an initial investment of just over $3 million. The trader’s latest high-leverage PEPE position has already gained $500,000 amid a nearly 6% rise in the memecoin's value. Strategy Buys Another 4,020 Bitcoin for $427M, Total Holdings Surpass 580K BTC Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, purchased an additional 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for roughly $427 million, bringing its total holdings to 580,250 BTC, CoinDesk previously reported . The acquisition was funded through three separate at-the-market equity programs, including sales of common and preferred stock totaling approximately $427 million. These latest bitcoin purchases were executed at an average price of $106,237 per coin, pushing Strategy’s total investment in bitcoin to over $40.6 billion, at an average cost basis of $69,979 per coin. The acquisitions reflect the company’s ongoing commitment to expanding its sizable bitcoin holdings through regular capital raises and share issuances. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin holds steady near record levels around $109,000, consolidating gains despite tariff-induced volatility, as long-term investors continue accumulating amid macroeconomic uncertainty. ETH: Ethereum maintains resilience above $2,500 amid volatility and cautious whale behavior, supported by continued institutional inflows into spot ETH ETFs. Gold: Gold dips slightly on tariff delay but stays above $3,310 as deficit concerns fuel bullish outlook. Hang Seng: Hong Kong's Hang Seng opened lower, trading above 23,304, led by tech losses, including Meituan's 4.9% decline. Nikkei: Japan's Nikkei 225 dipped 0.13% Tuesday morning as markets assessed Trump's tariff delay. S&P 500: Closed for Memorial Day. Elsewhere in Crypto...

To be clear, no one’s promising moon boots here. But according to analyst Cheeky Crypto, the risk-versus-reward setup for XRP today looks a lot like Bitcoin’s awkward teenage years, back when the loudest voices called it a scam while quiet hodlers quietly became millionaires. What’s Been Holding XRP Back? XRP has been around since 2012. While it made solid gains early on, its price has been weighed down by a long legal fight between Ripple (the company behind XRP) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That lawsuit kept many big exchanges from listing XRP and made investors nervous. But now, that legal battle seems to be nearing an end. Settlement talks and court updates are happening regularly. Many believe that once the case is over, XRP could finally get the momentum it’s been missing. The Numbers Get Wild — Even with Small Gains Let’s talk numbers. Even if XRP only manages to follow a small portion of Bitcoin’s past performance, the gains are huge. If XRP matched 10% of Bitcoin’s historic growth, its price could jump to over $5,300. If it matched just 1%, that’s still a jump to $53 — far above today’s price of around $2.33. And that’s without including other possible boosts, like Ripple burning excess tokens, launching new global payment partnerships, or adding more banks to its network. What About the Huge Token Supply? One concern people often raise is XRP’s large total supply — 100 billion tokens, compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. But what really matters is market cap — the total value of all coins combined. If Ripple manages to handle even a small portion of the $150 trillion in global cross-border payments each year, it could easily justify higher prices without breaking financial logic. Yes, there are risks. The SEC could drag out appeals, other regulators might get involved, or Ripple might stumble in integrating new partnerships. Those aren’t imaginary threats — they’re very real. But risk is why rewards exist. If XRP had zero uncertainties, it wouldn’t be sitting at $2. So, is XRP the next Bitcoin? Maybe not. But could it surprise everyone once the legal dust settles?

He spoke during the Charleston Festival in East Sussex. He argued that AI is already capable of creating its art. During a recent interview with The Times of London, Clegg, the former UK Deputy Prime Minister, engaged in a heated debate over AI copyright laws. He commented when parliament members voted against proposals allowing copyright holders to see when their work had been used to train AI systems and by whom. Creatives urge the government to balance copyright laws Music legends like Sir Elton John and Sir Paul McCartney have urged the UK government not to change copyright laws to favor big tech firms. The creatives warned that the proposal to change copyright protection laws risks destroying the livelihoods of more than 2.5 million people who work in the creative industry. “The safest road to Hell is the gradual one… the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.” C. S. Lewis didn’t account for Lib Dem sherpas sadly… Clegg (yes him) saying Artists demands over copyright are unworkable in AI age — Andrew Walker (@Andrew_E_Walker) May 26, 2025 Clegg argued that the demands of artists and prominent creative figures to require tech firms to seek permission before using copyrighted materials to train AI models are unworkable and implausible. He continued to point out that AI systems have already used a significant portion of the data readily available online, The former UK Deputy Prime Minister suggested that people should have a straightforward way to opt out of using their content. He viewed the idea of AI companies having to seek permission as something that collides with the physics of the technology itself. He added that the idea would kill the UK’s AI industry overnight if applied in the UK alone. Describing copyright as the lifeblood of their profession, the UK creative community wrote an open letter to Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the UK, warning that the proposed changes to copyright laws would threaten Britain’s status as the leading creative power. The open letter said that the UK creative community would lose immense growth opportunities if it gave away its work to a small group of powerful tech companies. The letter reiterated the UK’s position as a creative powerhouse and the hopes that technology will embody the country’s values. Dua Lipa among artists urging Starmer to rethink AI copyright laws David Furnish, Coldplay, Tom Dixon, and John Pawson, among hundreds of others, represented the UK creative community as signatories to the open letter. The letter urged Starmer to support Baroness Beeban Kidron’s amendment to the Data Bill . The Data Bill would give the UK creative transparency over the copyright works used to train AI models. According to the letter, transparency would allow creators and creative businesses to hold AI firms accountable for stealing creative works. The letter urged the government to accept the amendment and allow AI developers and creators to develop licensing regimes enabling human-created content. Elsewhere in the U.S., Hollywood recently wrote a letter to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, in which more than 400 creatives, including director Guillermo del Toro and actor Cynthia Erivo, signed to urge the U.S. government to uphold existing copyright protections against AI. Many prominent creative figures in Hollywood signed the letter in response to Trump’s administration’s request for public comments on the White House’s AI Action Plan. The plan aimed to secure and advance the country’s position in the AI industry. Silicon Valley tech companies and OpenAI wrote separate letters arguing that they should be able to train AI models using publicly available content under the fair use doctrine. The doctrine allows for the limited reproduction of material without permission from the copyright holder. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In a post addressed to his followers, Brandt asked which of the two they would select for a $100,000 investment, provided they could only choose one. He encouraged responses with concise reasoning limited to 40 words and shared technical charts of both assets to aid informed decision-making. Let's say I will buy $100,000 of either $XRP or $SOL this week — no other option but ONLY one of the two please Which one? State your case 40 words max or I'll ignore Remember, XRP or SOL – only choices pic.twitter.com/cNikoRICfd — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) May 25, 2025 Technical Overview: XRP Approaches Critical Retest On the XRP front, a symmetrical triangle pattern spanning several years has recently broken to the upside. This breakout surpassed a long-standing descending resistance line, with XRP reaching a high of $3.40 earlier in the year before entering a corrective phase. The asset is now undergoing a retest of the breakout level, a process that, if successful, could set the stage for further upward movement. Based on the triangle’s height, technical projections estimate a potential rise to $4.43. Currently, the token is priced at $2.32, reflecting a 12.88% increase year-to-date. It trades just below its 8-period simple moving average (SMA) at $2.36 and slightly above its 18-period weighted moving average (WMA) at $2.29. These indicators suggest short-term support and alignment in price momentum. However, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is currently at 14.17, implying that the prevailing trend lacks strong momentum. The Average True Range (ATR) stands at 0.2588, indicating low volatility, which often signals consolidation ahead of a significant move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Solana Eyes Breakout from Classic Formation In contrast, Solana exhibits a long-term cup and handle formation on the weekly chart. The cup formed following the asset’s peak in late 2021, with the bottom established during the 2022 downturn. The handle began taking shape in early 2025 and shows signs of a potential breakout. SOL is trading at $174.84, down 6.31% since the beginning of the year. Although it lags behind XRP in 2024 performance, its technical structure remains promising. SOL trades above its 8-period SMA ($147.85) and its 18-period WMA ($150.89). The projected target from the cup and handle pattern is around $518.73, though confirmation is still required. Solana’s ADX is at 15.91, slightly higher than XRP’s, indicating a marginally stronger trend. Meanwhile, the ATR is at 37.23, showing greater volatility and trading activity. Market Participants Share Preferences Investors and analysts responded to Brandt’s question with differing perspectives. Trader CJ opted for XRP, citing reduced selling pressure from institutions compared to Solana. Another contributor, IL Gallon , also chose XRP, referencing Wyckoff accumulation signals as a sign of stronger long-term positioning. Peter Detwiller, reviewing daily charts, favoured XRP as well. He found Solana’s pattern less convincing, describing it as overly speculative. Conversely, analyst Chris Huber leaned toward Solana , highlighting its consistent respect for the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) since an April downturn. He also pointed to resistance near $261.43 as a potential breakout level. Additional views included support for XRP from Trader Vievie, who noted the asset’s formation of higher highs and manageable downside risk with a support level near $2.27. On the other hand, Trader Studios Stoic found Solana’s technical setup more compelling, viewing the cup and handle structure as indicative of stronger breakout potential compared to XRP’s shorter consolidation phase. XRP and Solana exhibit bullish technical structures, though they differ in maturity and context. XRP is retesting a significant breakout, while Solana is nearing confirmation of a long-term bullish pattern. Investor sentiment remains divided, with arguments on both sides grounded in technical indicators and broader market dynamics. Ultimately, the decision between the two depends on an individual’s risk tolerance and interpretation of technical signals.

After years at the center of regulatory debate, XRP is now entering a new era — with BlackRock reportedly exploring XRP-linked products and institutional interest growing fast. For large capital allocators, XRP’s non-security designation in the U.S. and its availability through regulated ETFs solve two of the biggest barriers to entry. Pension funds, family offices, and traditional asset managers can now gain exposure to XRP in a compliant, familiar format. BlackRock’s involvement amplifies the signal. As the world’s largest asset manager, its movements influence a wide range of financial institutions. Interest in XRP-based instruments suggests growing recognition of XRP’s use case in cross-border payments and tokenized settlement. XRP Forecasts Expand as Institutional Demand Grows Analysts are already revising long-term XRP forecasts. Over the next five years, many predict price potential ranging from $5 to $12.50, particularly if a spot ETF approval follows. The futures product is widely seen as the beginning of a larger, multi-year growth wave. This ETF approval is also reshaping sentiment across the altcoin space. With XRP now positioned as a trusted, institution-ready asset, attention is turning toward early-stage opportunities that could benefit from the next wave of capital rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction as a Scalable Newcomer One of those is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising project with a structured token model, growing investor demand, and clear fundamentals. With a $0.007 listing target, 100 billion fixed supply, and upcoming staking utility, analysts are now calling it one of the top early-stage plays of 2025. Wallet activity continues to rise, and repeat buyer behavior suggests high conviction among early participants. Combined with its under-$0.01 access, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched closely by those seeking scalable entry positions ahead of broader exposure. As capital flows into regulated leaders, traders are also seeking high-upside alternatives that offer both early access and real token utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE, still in its growth phase, is increasingly viewed as a project with the structure and momentum to benefit from the same adoption cycle XRP is helping to lead. The next chapter in crypto will be defined by both institutional scale and early innovation — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is now part of that conversation. Final Thoughts: The XRP ETF launch is a milestone for crypto. And while top players like XRP lead the charge, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are building early — offering the potential to grow alongside the next phase of adoption.

With the market gearing up for its next cycle, early positioning can make the difference between average returns and exponential gains. That’s why this list of the top crypto to buy right now starts with Web3 ai, a project designed to support both retail traders and institutional investors. Unlike one-size-fits-all platforms, Web3 ai offers a modular ecosystem tailored to different user levels. Retail traders benefit from real-time market alerts, AI-driven trading signals, and portfolio insights, while institutional teams can plug into APIs for algorithmic strategy, on-chain risk analysis, and advanced performance metrics. The project is currently in presale stage 6, selling at just $0.000383 per token. With over $4.5 million raised and a post-presale launch price set at $0.005242, early participants are staring down a projected 1747% ROI. Web3 ai isn’t just targeting a niche audience, it’s bridging the needs of everyday users and quant teams alike, making it the top crypto to buy right now for those who want both versatility and early advantage. Its tools don’t just react to market conditions they help shape smarter trading decisions across experience levels. Ethereum (ETH): Holding Strong Through Smart Contract Dominance Ethereum remains one of the most established names in the space, and for good reason. As the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts, ETH continues to power some of the largest ecosystems in blockchain. Its shift to proof-of-stake has improved scalability and reduced energy costs, making the network more efficient. Institutions and developers continue to rely on Ethereum’s infrastructure, with Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism expanding its capability even further. For long-term holders and new entrants alike, Ethereum still qualifies as a top crypto to buy right now, offering both stability and deep integration across the industry. SUI: Scalable Speed for the Next Generation of dApps SUI is gaining traction as a high-performance Layer 1 built by former Meta engineers. Its focus on parallel execution and low latency makes it ideal for decentralized applications that require speed and responsiveness, such as gaming and finance. Developers are drawn to its easy-to-use architecture and high throughput, which supports real-time interactions without congestion. As the dApp space continues to evolve, SUI positions itself as a practical solution for teams looking for more efficient infrastructure. With its growing ecosystem and technical advantages, SUI is firmly placed among the top crypto to buy right now for those seeking scalable alternatives to older chains. XRP: Gaining Ground Through Utility and Clarity XRP is quietly regaining investor attention, supported by regulatory clarity and real-world financial use. With Ripple pushing adoption in cross-border settlements, XRP’s appeal lies in its ability to move value quickly and cheaply across jurisdictions. As more institutions explore blockchain-backed payment systems, XRP’s efficiency makes it a top candidate for integration. Recent legal clarity around its status has also sparked a return of investor confidence. With its utility-driven use case and expanding global reach, XRP ranks high on the list of the top crypto to buy right now, especially for those seeking exposure to finance-backed blockchain applications. Final Thoughts: The Right Entry Can Make All the Difference Buying into a project before the broader market recognizes its value is often where the highest returns are made. Web3 ai offers that edge right now, combining real-time analytics, risk management, and advanced trading tools for both retail and institutional users. Still in presale stage 6 at $0.000383, with a projected launch price of $0.005242, it gives early investors a potential 1747% return. That kind of upside, paired with practical utility, makes it a standout. At the same time, Ethereum, SUI, and XRP each present strong use cases, from smart contract dominance to scalable infrastructure and financial integration, earning their place as the top crypto to buy right now.

BlockDAG, Litecoin, Cardano, and Dogecoin Are Gaining Speed Fast",https://thecoinrise.com/best-altcoin-to-buy-now-blockdag-litecoin-cardano-and-dogecoin-are-gaining-speed-fast/,"As May 2025 wraps up, energy is picking up across the crypto market. Bitcoin and Ethereum are holding steady, but altcoins are showing new signs of strength. This shift is opening up chances for those watching closely and ready to act before the crowd moves in. Here, we break down the best altcoins to buy now. BlockDAG, Litecoin, Cardano, and Dogecoin are all building momentum. Whether it’s speed, staying power, or strong support behind them, these four are standing out as key names to follow closely into the next wave. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Moving Fast With Real Progress and Big Numbers BlockDAG is climbing the charts quickly, gaining attention with results that can already be seen. Instead of hype alone, it runs a setup that lets blocks process at the same time, aiming to make things faster and more scalable right from the start. So far, the response has been huge. BlockDAG (BDAG) has pulled in $269 million, with more than 21.3 billion coins sold. The price has gone from $0.001 to $0.0262, but for a short time, it’s available for just $0.002 until June 13. After that, the next phase kicks in with a Go Live reveal that includes confirmed exchange details. With a mining app, custom hardware, and over 170,000 holders, BlockDAG is picking up speed. It’s now being looked at as the best altcoin to buy now for those aiming to lock in early on something with real growth ahead. 2. Litecoin: Slow and Steady with Real Potential to Move Litecoin (LTC) still holds a reputation for being one of the more stable cryptos. With a current price near $95.30, it offers an entry point that appeals to those seeking reliability over hype. Even after a 4% pullback, LTC is back in focus, thanks to upcoming drivers like the possible Litecoin ETF via Grayscale and the effects of the MimbleWimble privacy upgrade. Support is holding strong near $95, and Litecoin is starting to gain traction again. It might not be the loudest name out there, but it continues to fit into many cautious strategies. For anyone looking for something battle-tested, Litecoin still earns its spot as one of the best altcoins to buy now with long-term strength. 3. Cardano: Quiet Build, Big Plans, and a Breakout Coming? Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground with a price around $0.7280. If it clears the $0.83 mark, many are eyeing a move toward $1.30. Its rise is getting more attention thanks to new connections like its integration with Brave Browser and its role in the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. Cardano’s appeal isn’t just about price movement. Its focus on regular upgrades and eco-conscious goals adds to its long-term appeal. For anyone watching smart contract growth, Cardano is one of the best altcoins to buy now for a solid, steady build. 4. Dogecoin: Back on the Radar as Traders Watch the Charts Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a meme, but it’s now turning into a serious option. While it dipped 6% to $0.2186, charts suggest something bigger could be on the way. Open interest is climbing, now above $3 billion, and a push through the $0.25–$0.26 zone could spark a run toward $0.30. DOGE continues to draw interest for its strong liquidity and smoother price action compared to other meme-based names. As altcoin activity ramps up, Dogecoin is stepping up as one of the best altcoins to buy now for those chasing short bursts of momentum. Which of These Best Altcoins to Buy Now Will Lead the Pack? Let’s recap. Litecoin brings proven strength, plus fresh upside with the MimbleWimble upgrade and possible ETF listing. Cardano shows long-term growth through steady updates and new integrations. Dogecoin has moved past meme status and now delivers real action for traders. Then there’s BlockDAG. While the rest hold their own, BlockDAG is doing something different. With $269 million raised and 21.3 billion coins already sold, it’s built major traction. Price is locked at $0.002 until June 13, and the Go Live reveal will confirm exchange details. Some say it could push to $1 after launch. That kind of setup doesn’t come often. For anyone scanning the market for the best altcoin to buy now, BlockDAG stands out with a serious mix of momentum and early-stage upside. The post Best Altcoin to Buy Now?

With bullish momentum building, several crypto analysts now believe that BTC may be on track to hit a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming days. Bitcoin To Surge To $112,000? Analyst Says Yes According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ibrahimcosar, Bitcoin is forming a classic bullish pattern on the hourly chart – the double bottom. The analyst described this setup as “one of the strongest reversal signals” in technical analysis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebound Signals Healthier Bull Market Without Overheating, Analyst Says Ibrahimcosar explained that this pattern signals a weakening of bearish pressure, with buyers poised to regain control of the market. The first bottom of this formation was observed on May 23 at $106,800, followed by a second low on May 25 at $106,600. For the uninitiated, the double bottom is a bullish reversal chart pattern that forms after a downtrend, characterized by two distinct lows at a similar level with a moderate peak – called neckline – in between. According to the CryptoQuant contributor, the current neckline is around $109,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is hovering just above this neckline, confirming the breakout. Importantly, the breakout was accompanied by a surge in trading volume, which analysts interpret as a sign of robust bullish momentum. If $109,000 holds as support, then price levels beyond $112,000 could be on the horizon. The analyst explained in their Quicktake post: Double bottoms are where the market says: ‘We’ve sold enough.’ When buyers defend the second bottom, it sends a message: Now it’s our turn. But remember, not every pattern plays out. Know your risk, make your decision. Fellow analyst Ali Martinez echoed this sentiment in a recent post on X, sharing the following BTC hourly chart that highlights a breakout from the recent downtrend. According to Martinez, Bitcoin is now targeting the $110,000 level and potentially higher. Good Days Ahead For BTC Following a rough first quarter in 2025, Bitcoin has shown significant recovery, surging from a local bottom of $74,508 on April 6 to nearly $110,000. This recent rally has revived bullish sentiment across the market. Related Reading: Technical Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Blow Off Top To $325,000 – The Timeline Will Shock You ​​Fueling the optimism are strong inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating renewed institutional interest. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s open interest recently hit a fresh all-time high, reinforcing expectations of continued price momentum. However, not all indicators are aligned. Bitcoin whales – large holders of BTC – have shown mixed behavior, with some accumulating while others appear to be taking profits. At press time, BTC trades at $109,998, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours.

Tron Hits 283M Transfers & Ripple Shows Breakout Signs,https://thecoinrise.com/unstakeds-1m-giveaway-could-deliver-bigger-gains-tron-hits-283m-transfers-ripple-shows-breakout-signs/,"Tron (TRX) network momentum and Ripple (XRP)’s latest breakout signs may be getting all the buzz, but Unstaked is quietly attracting strong attention from early-stage supporters. As TRX records over 283 million stablecoin transfers and XRP swings between price levels, Unstaked is moving forward with a model focused on user rewards, automated tools powered by AI, and carefully planned stages. Currently in Stage 15 of its public presale, Unstaked has already secured $7.3 million in funding. It’s drawing interest with a unique offering, a $1,000,000 Gleam giveaway where 20 participants each receive $50,000 in $UNSD. Unlike major coins, this model encourages user participation with real use cases and rewards. While the spotlight remains on rapid price changes, Unstaked is steadily becoming the most talked-about cryptocurrency presale of 2025. Tron’s Transaction Surge Highlights Strength, But Will It Last? Tron’s recent spike in user activity has brought it to the forefront. In the past month alone, its 30-day average of daily transactions jumped from 4.3 million to 8.4 million, showing a 95% increase. This spike largely comes from USDT activity running on the Tron network. As of May 21, Tron had surpassed Ethereum by processing over $75.8 billion in USDT transfers, compared to Ethereum’s $71.9 billion. This trend reflects Tron’s goal of being a fast, low-cost blockchain for daily use. The $2 billion in new USDT minted on Tron backs this up. With over 283 million transactions already logged in 2025, Tron’s role in the stablecoin space is growing. Still, activity doesn’t always translate to growth in value. TRX currently trades near $0.2716, with resistance expected around $0.28–$0.29. Despite high trading volumes and futures positions above $300 million, TRX’s price movement is still closely tied to its basic utility, not to development or user benefits. Ripple’s Price Signal Lacks Lasting Direction While Tron enjoys a steady rise in network use, Ripple’s chart remains unpredictable. On May 22, XRP moved between $2.388 and $2.423, reacting to fast shifts in MACD patterns from bullish to bearish. RSI readings also kept moving between overbought and oversold areas, making it hard for any clear trend to form. Though short-term traders may try to profit from these swings, XRP continues to hover between $2.400 support and $2.420 resistance. The repeated failures to break out or hold gains show how unstable its movement remains. Even though Ripple is flashing a breakout signal, hesitation is growing. Until major news or legal clarity arrives, XRP might stay locked in this tight range. This opens the door for projects like Unstaked that offer more direct rewards and clarity in structure. Unstaked: A Presale Driven by Real Utility and Clear Roadmap Big-name coins may showcase transaction records or pattern signals, but Unstaked is staying focused on building. At this point, it has raised $7.3 million in Stage 15 of its crypto presale , pricing $UNSD at $0.009831. With a confirmed launch price of $0.1819, this suggests early backers could gain nearly 28x. What separates Unstaked is its open and community-based design. The $1,000,000 Gleam giveaway will reward 20 people with $50,000 each in $UNSD. To qualify, users need to complete simple tasks and hold at least $100 in tokens. The campaign, planned over five months, builds engagement without relying on exaggerated hype. Unstaked’s approach avoids restricted private sales, instead offering a clear, open path with outlined phases. Key features in the roadmap include AI-backed “Proof of Intelligence,” community governance, and flexible access with no forced lock-ins. A liquidity pool of $20M, along with planned listings on both CEXs and DEXs, adds trust. Its marketplace for customizable AI agents will only launch after the presale is complete. While Ripple’s charts and Tron’s network headlines draw attention, Unstaked is gaining real traction among early participants who want clarity, rewards, and future utility. In a Nutshell! In today’s market, stories hold just as much power as stats. Tron may be leading in stablecoin transactions, and Ripple continues to offer setups for short-term traders. But neither has presented the kind of open presale model, price setup, or user-focused structure that Unstaked brings. With over $7.3 million raised, a price below one cent, and a $1,000,000 giveaway capturing community attention, Unstaked is shaping the idea of a strong early-stage crypto. Its plan for AI tools, public governance, and strong liquidity make it a project worth following. Established names may show movement, but Unstaked shows actual momentum. The numbers speak clearly, and in this volatile space, few signals are this direct.

Business Insider reported on May 26 that at the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year, Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said that “there are four essential characteristics of intelligent behavior that every animal, or relatively smart animal, can do, and certainly humans.” “Understanding the physical world, having persistent memory, being able to reason and being able to plan complex actions, particularly planning hierarchically,” LeCun said. He said current large language models ( LLMs ) that power popular AI chatbots have not hit this threshold, and “incorporating these capabilities would require a shift in how they are trained.” Some of the largest AI and tech giants are “cobbling capabilities” onto existing models in their race to dominate the AI game, LeCun said. Yann LeCun speaking on LLM intelligence. Source: Patrick Patterson/X Meta is already experimenting with a system called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which is a method of enhancing LLM outputs using external knowledge sources. In February, it released V-JEPA, a non-generative model that learns by predicting missing or masked parts of a video. Related: Meta gets EU regulator nod to train AI with social media content LeCun believes that “world-based models” would be a better approach as these would be trained on real-life scenarios and possess higher cognition than current pattern-based AI. The concept involves models that can imagine taking an action and predict the resulting world state. Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world. Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4 , received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added.

Dubai has now established itself as the global center of blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3.0 – and the heart of the MENA (Middle East, North Africa) region. This conference was full of optimism and celebration at the significant steps that blockchain, DeFi and Web 3.0 took worldwide. Here are 10 key takeaways from the TOKEN 2049 event. 1. AI-blockchain synergy Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents were instrumental in key blockchain use cases like fraud detection, analytics and smart contract optimization. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) clouds could cut AI training costs by 50%. The blockchain x AI technology will be a powerful synergy for the road ahead. AI-driven blockchain audits will prevent over $50 billion in annual DeFi hacks. Cognitive smart contracts could become a new standard in secure computing. Fifty percent of the world’s AI training has the potential to be run on GPUs on the cloud in less than five years. With the explosion of use cases, AI and blockchain have the potential to reframe the Web 3.0 world as we know it. 2. DePIN technology will change the world DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) were everywhere at the conference. Some companies provided archival systems at 90% cheaper than traditional cloud computing giants. Distributed wireless grids, file systems, IaaS (intelligence-as-a-service), digital infrastructure and IoT systems stole the limelight. The DePIN market is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. Decentralized Infrastructure provides power to the users and enables personal revenue. Smart cities could also be disaster-resistant with DePIN technology for electricity, internet, wireless systems, edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT). 3. Tokenized real-world assets are a reality Over $120 billion will be spent this year alone on tokenizing just real estate. Dubai’s VARA framework enables fractional blockchain ownership of luxury assets. This trend will only increase and cover everything from luxury cars to high-value assets like artwork. The RWA (real-world asset) tokenization market will hit the trillion-dollar market cap by as early as 2026. AI-managed investment portfolios with hold both crypto and real-world tokens. This is the long-awaited comeback of the security token in RWAs. Multiple institutions like banks, asset management firms and investment leaders are showing interest. 4. Bitcoin becomes mainstream Long seen as a speculative investment, Bitcoin is now a viable asset. With Trump’s presidency, multiple firms and institutions are investing in Bitcoin as a long-term purchase. The outlook for Bitcoin is incredibly optimistic, especially among core crypto followers. This is a key moment for cryptocurrency and Web 3.0 development. The legitimization of Bitcoin provides a solid foundation on which to build DeFi and Web 3.0 platforms. Companies are seeing past the hype and investing in Bitcoin heavily. Some analysts were even quoted predicting that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2028. 5. MENA is the powerhouse of global Web 3.0 Crypto transfers in this region exceeded $330 billion in 2025, with 93% of transactions by institutions. UAE and Qatar were the main participants in this sector. The US will be implementing more relaxed crypto regulation – but until it does, the UAE, with its innovative regulations, will be the center of crypto globally. There are discussions to open up energy reserves like crude oil to tokenization and fractional ownership. 6. Stablecoins are the first accepted use case of crypto Stablecoins have become one of the backbones of global payments. Cross-border frictionless trading and commerce is now a reality with stablecoins. The share in cross-border transfers could rise to even 50% by around 2028. Stablecoins have seen massive adoption by individuals and institutions alike. As protocols evolve for DeFi, this trend is only set to increase and become even more common. 7. Breakthroughs in DAO governance In 2025, AI-powered voting systems in DAOs automated 30% of decisions in collective environments. This is the start of a widespread change in how systems are governed autonomously. DAO is a governance method that truly gives power to the people. It is predicted that even CeFi (centralized finance) systems will be using DAOs by 2030. For asset management, DAOs potentially represent a multi-trillion-dollar market. 8. Web 3.0 gaming breaks the casual barrier Major studios launched play-to-earn models with AAA gameplay. This is only the beginning of a huge shift in gaming as a whole. Extractive economics was only the beginning. The metaverse, player-generated assets and Web 3.0 gaming will change the way everyone games. Annual revenue could exceed $200 billion by 2029. Metaverse content will be immersive, VR/AR integrated and created primarily by AI. Play-to-earn could also include socially desirable changes in multiple sectors. 9. The importance of security As blockchain, DeFi and Web 3.0 move into acceptable investments, security is now the key. $1.2 billion was lost through blockchain scams in 2024 alone. Security standards need to evolve and keep up with advances in technology. As hackers use generative AI and sidechain attacks on major institutions – i t is critical that security standards be defined, refined and enhanced at least four times each year. Quantum computing, in particular, plays a very important role as perhaps the biggest threat to cybersecurity. Emerging technologies like ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) and biometric authentication need integration into blockchain systems. 10. Regulational clarity worldwide Perhaps the single biggest reason that Dubai became the crypto capital of the world – t he transparent and lenient regulations adopted by the UAE for crypto and blockchain. The US is expected to follow suit very soon with sweeping regulatory changes. In less than five years, as countries see the advantages of these regulations – e xpect similar changes all over the world and for crypto to become the defining standard of the wealth of the nations. This would truly introduce wealth distribution worldwide. Trump is soon expected to introduce regulatory changes in the US for crypto as well. The road ahead TOKEN2049 Dubai 2025 marks the point where crypto moves from labs to global infrastructure. There are many scams still at work, but crypto will be one of the defining forces of the modern world. As regulatory changes are made worldwide, expect the entire industry to grow by ten times at the very least by this time next year. The optimism is mixed with caution because of the lack of sweeping security standards and the lack of international regulatory enforcement. 2025 is the year when such changes are expected to take place. And there has never been a more exciting time to be involved in crypto, AI, DeFi, DePIN, blockchain and Web 3.0 – e ver.

But is it happening now, or are we still stuck in the Bitcoin season? A group of experts recently weighed in, and here’s what they had to say. Are We in Altcoin Season Right Now? Popular crypto analyst, Scott Melker, thinks we may have just experienced a mini altcoin season. He pointed out that while Bitcoin has been rising steadily, several altcoins also made big moves recently — something we haven’t seen in a long time. Ethereum, for example, jumped 40% in just two days at one point. What made this special is that Bitcoin’s dominance (its share of the overall crypto market) actually dropped while its price went up. In the past, when Bitcoin climbed, altcoins usually stayed flat or fell. This time, both moved up together — a sign to some that new money might be entering the market rather than traders just shifting funds between Bitcoin and altcoins. But Can We Really Have Another Altcoin Season Like the Old Days? The short answer: probably not in the same way. There’s a massive number of new crypto projects waiting on the sidelines. Venture capitalists and developers are holding off on launching thousands of new tokens until market conditions improve. When those hit the market, they’ll spread investor money thinner — making it harder for every altcoin to rise together like we’ve seen in past altcoin seasons. Instead, the experts believe the next altcoin run will be narrative-driven. In other words, only certain types of coins will pump at certain times based on market trends and hype. For example, it could be memecoins one month, AI-related tokens the next, or maybe DeFi (decentralized finance) projects on Solana or Ethereum. So, rather than a “throw a dart and watch everything rise” market, investors will need to be tuned in daily to catch the right trends at the right times.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 03:44:07

The mixed mood left the region softer overall. MSCI’s broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.17 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.15 percent. Mainland China was more or less flat. The CSI300 inched 0.06 percent lower, and the Shanghai Composite hardly moved. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng edged down 0.1 percent. A holiday in U.S. markets on Monday kept trading thin overnight. Still, investors welcomed Trump’s late reversal, which moved the tariff deadline to 9 July instead of next month. The change helped lift the risk appetite in future markets . Nasdaq contracts rose 1.26 percent in Asian hours, S&P 500 futures gained 1.11 percent, and FTSE futures picked up 0.94 percent. London was also shut on Monday. “It was a better night for risk assets, following Trump deferring (EU tariffs) back to July 9,” said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG. “What I think probably is now the main driver for this week is we’ve got the month-end rebalancing flows, which should start to kick in anytime soon… Nvidia’s earnings report again is going to be front and centre in terms of what’s going on there.” Chipmaker Nvidia’s reports are due on Wednesday and are expected to show a 65.9 percent jump in first-quarter revenue, keeping focus on the artificial-intelligence boom that has driven its share price. In Japan, yields on super-long government bonds fell early in the day, retreating from the record highs hit during last week’s heavy selling. Traders are bracing for upcoming market movements Several Federal Reserve policymakers will give their speeches this week, along with Friday’s U.S. core PCE price index. In Tokyo, a two-day annual conference organized by the Bank of Japan and its think tank has already begun on Tuesday. Global central bankers gathering there are expected to discuss economic growth and inflation. Currency markets showed a steady drift away from the dollar. The greenback was on course for a fifth straight monthly loss, the longest slide since 2017. The euro hovered near a one-month high at $1.14035. The yen strengthened nearly 0.5 percent to ¥142.18 per dollar. Trump’s unpredictable trade moves and worries over the US deficit have eroded confidence in American assets, weighing on the dollar. “A U.S. dollar regime change could be in the making in the long term after it appears to have peaked recently,” said David Meier, economist at Julius Baer. “Erratic U.S. policymaking, the tense fiscal situation, and large external indebtedness, against the backdrop of the twin deficit, suggest that a weaker USD is the route of least resistance,” David added. As the dollar loses some of its safe-haven appeal, investors have looked elsewhere. Gold, which touched record highs earlier this year, last traded 0.28 percent lower at $3,332.91 an ounce. Oil prices slipped as traders weighed whether OPEC+ would agree to raise output at a meeting this week. Brent crude futures eased 0.1 percent to $64.67 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate moved down 0.16 percent to $61.43 a barrel.

This drop came despite a strong performance from broader digital asset investment products, which attracted $3.3 billion in inflows last week. According to CoinShares, the inflows brought the six-week inflow streak to a cumulative $10.5 billion. Year-to-date inflows have now hit a record-breaking $10.8 billion, while total assets under management briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion. Investors Flock to Diversification Analysts attribute this momentum to rising economic uncertainty in the US, especially following Moody’s credit downgrade and surging treasury yields, which are pushing investors toward digital asset diversification. The latest edition of ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report revealed Bitcoin dominated digital asset inflows last week with $2.9 billion, and accounted for a quarter of total inflows in 2024. Interestingly, some investors viewed its price rally as a chance to short, which resulted in $12.7 million flowing into short-Bitcoin products – the highest since December 2024. Ethereum followed with $326 million in inflows, which represented its strongest in 15 weeks and the fifth straight week of positive sentiment. Meanwhile, Solana and Sui also saw inflows of $4.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Chainlink and Cardano performed modestly as well, clocking in inflows of $0.9 million and $0.6 million, during the same period. Alongside XRP, multi-asset products bucked the positive trend as witnessing $1.9 million in outflows. Switzerland, Sweden Report Outflows Regionally, the US continued to lead digital asset inflows with $3.2 billion last week, far ahead of other regions. Germany, Hong Kong, and Australia followed with $41.5 million, $33.3 million, and $10.9 million, respectively. Canada saw modest inflows of just $0.1 million during the past week. On the other hand, Swiss investors took profits amid rising prices, which led to $16.6 million in outflows. Sweden also experienced $12.1 million in outflows, while Brazil recorded $1.9 million exiting the market over the same period.

Industry leaders say engagement with policymakers has increased sharply this year, particularly after Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his vocal support for crypto, the Financial Times reported Tuesday. At the heart of the industry’s demands is a rollback of steep taxes introduced in 2022. These include a 30% capital gains tax and a 1% levy on every crypto transaction, measures aimed at curbing illegal activity but which, according to a report by the Esya Centre, pushed more than 90% of Indian crypto trading offshore. India’s crypto industry pushes for tax cuts as New Delhi warms to former pariah sector https://t.co/SoNaVywGfp — Financial Times (@FT) May 27, 2025 India’s Regulators Shift From Resistance to Tentative Crypto Engagement Industry executives now argue that a 0.1% transaction tax could offer the same traceability without stifling growth. “Thanks to Trump, the positive momentum that has happened in crypto has impacted India as well,” Ashish Singhal, co-founder of CoinSwitch, told the outlet. He noted that meetings with officials have gone from biannual events to near-weekly discussions. “Now regulators are more closely talking to us, understanding what the space is.” India’s stance on crypto has shifted from hostility to cautious engagement. The Reserve Bank of India once likened crypto to Ponzi schemes and pushed for a banking ban in 2018, which was later overturned by the Supreme Court. While the central bank remains skeptical, its tone has cooled. “The relationship with the RBI has gone from negative to neutral,” said Singhal. “I will still not quite call it positive yet.” Coinbase and Binance Return as Market Eyes $15B Growth by 2035 The change in atmosphere comes as New Delhi works on redrafting a key industry discussion paper. The move was confirmed earlier this year by Ajay Seth, India’s economic affairs secretary, though no formal tax relief was included in February’s budget, drawing disappointment from the Bharat Web3 Association. The Supreme Court of India has also weighed in, asking the Centre why it has not yet introduced “clear-cut” regulations for the sector. The court expressed concern over the government’s continued delay in forming comprehensive crypto policies. Despite the lack of immediate relief, international exchanges are returning. Binance and Coinbase , which previously scaled back operations in India, have re-entered the market . The country’s crypto sector, currently valued at around $2.5b, is projected to grow to more than $15b by 2035, according to estimates by Grant Thornton. Changing public perception remains a challenge. Many Indians still believe digital assets are illegal, despite the absence of a formal ban. But interest is rising among younger, tech-savvy investors, particularly those from wealthier backgrounds. As regulation continues to evolve, industry players hope to bring more of the sector back onshore, and into the open.

As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $108,499, marking a 2.5% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term retracement, the overall market trend remains positive. Bitcoin has held most of its recent gains and remains just below its record peak set yesterday. The recent price action has coincided with an increase in on-chain signals, suggesting that large players are returning to the market. Notably, analysts are closely monitoring activity from major crypto exchanges like Binance, which have historically played a significant role in price discovery and market direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Smashes Past $111K, But Are Traders About to Dump? Bitcoin Whale Activity on Binance Sparks Volatility Watch A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk highlighted a surge in whale activity on Binance. In his QuickTake post titled “Binance Whale Activity Spikes — Eyes on the Market,” the analyst pointed out that the Binance Whale Activity Score has seen a sharp rise. This metric, which measures inflow and outflow behavior of the top 10 whale wallets on Binance, indicates that large holders are actively repositioning. These movements can be early indicators of upcoming volatility and directional shifts in the market. The analyst explained that inflow spikes from whales may point to potential distribution or strategic selling, while outflow surges often signal accumulation or redeployment of capital to other platforms. The significance of these whale movements lies in their historical tendency to precede major price developments. According to Crazzyblockk, Binance remains a central venue for price formation, making it critical to observe whale patterns there. He concluded that these inflow-outflow fluctuations could introduce higher liquidity and possibly increased volatility in the short term. Spot Market Data Points to Renewed Buyer Interest Complementing these observations is a report from another CryptoQuant analyst, Ibrahimcosar, who identified a positive shift in spot market behavior. According to the analyst, the Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) over the past 90 days has turned green again. This metric reflects the difference between taker buy and taker sell volumes and serves as a proxy for real-time demand. A green phase indicates that market buy orders have become dominant, suggesting that buyers are regaining control. The analyst noted that in previous months, the same chart showed mostly red values, indicating a prevalence of sell orders and downward price pressure. The recent transition back into green territory may suggest the emergence of new demand as Bitcoin challenges its previous highs.

This question is now at the center of crypto discussions, as property tokenization is gaining serious traction. Contrary to earlier doubts, thought leaders across the blockchain world are increasingly backing real-world asset tokenization, asserting that it’s no longer just a niche concept. It’s now being viewed as a major use case that brings transparency, liquidity, and democratized access to traditionally illiquid markets like real estate. As this transformation unfolds, it’s setting the stage for newer blockchain projects that are built to handle complex, cross-border, and data-rich applications. While Pi Network’s derivatives launch with 20x leverage and Litecoin’s ZA Miner offering daily returns have captured immediate headlines, there’s one presale-stage project trying to tie all these practical applications together: Qubetics . Qubetics ($TICS) is not just trying to offer another blockchain—it’s engineered to solve real-world bottlenecks that traditional cryptocurrencies couldn’t address effectively. Focused on transforming how businesses and individuals handle international payments, Qubetics uses a multi-chain aggregator model to remove transaction barriers between global networks. It is uniquely aligned with the broader shift towards blockchain utility. Meanwhile, Litecoin is pivoting to mainstream passive income models through accessible mining contracts, and Pi Network has taken a bold step into derivatives trading, giving its community a significant tool to manage exposure and speculate at scale. As different as they are in approach, all three are capitalizing on what matters most in 2025—real utility and forward-facing strategy. For those evaluating the top coins to join today, understanding these recent breakthroughs is critical. Qubetics Sets a New Standard for Global Transactions Qubetics is reshaping how cross-border payments are managed by financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Instead of relying on outdated payment infrastructure and intermediaries that cause delays, high fees, and security vulnerabilities, the Qubetics Network introduces a blockchain-driven aggregator that accelerates settlements. Through strategic partnerships and smart protocol design, Qubetics ensures international transactions happen faster, more securely, and without the complications associated with traditional methods. Banks and financial entities can now settle large amounts without worrying about geographic or network constraints. This is particularly essential in the current economic environment, where time-sensitive transactions are critical for maintaining operational stability. For small and medium-sized businesses, this application means they can fulfill cross-border orders with minimal delay, unlocking more competitive global trade. Enterprises managing payrolls or vendor payments across jurisdictions will also benefit from Qubetics’ precision and speed. On the individual level, the Qubetics application allows for fast remittance transfers without sacrificing cost-efficiency—an important factor for families relying on overseas income. These are the very kinds of tools that make Qubetics one of the top coins to join today, especially as the global financial system begins to align more closely with decentralized solutions tailored for real-world commerce. Qubetics Presale Enters 36th Stage—One of the Most Structured Top Coins to Join Today The Qubetics presale is now in its 36th stage with the token priced at $0.3064. Over $17.4 million has already been raised, with 514 million $TICS tokens sold and more than 27,100 token holders actively engaged. This presale structure is defined by a strict weekly cycle—each stage lasts exactly seven days and concludes at 12:00 AM every Sunday. With every new stage, the price increases by 10%, which introduces consistent upward pressure and rewards early participation. This makes Qubetics not only one of the most predictable presales in the space but also a compelling model for those who value structured growth potential. For example, if a participant enters with $2,000 at the current price point, and Qubetics reaches $1 post-presale, the return stands at 226.32%. If it climbs to $5, the ROI increases dramatically to 1,531.58%. A $10 token price would push that return to 3,163.16%, and at $15, the ROI balloons to 4,794.74%. These figures are backed by the project’s upcoming mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, further validating its long-term goals. As more community members align themselves with the Qubetics presale, it is rapidly being recognized as the best crypto presale available right now. These tokenomics and time-bound stages make it a clear choice among the top coins to join today Litecoin’s Cloud Mining Push Brings Passive Earnings to the Masses Litecoin is taking a bold step into simplified user onboarding with its latest cloud mining rollout via ZA Miners. The program allows users to earn Litecoin daily without managing hardware, setups, or technical overhead. Participants can begin earning immediately after selecting a mining contract, and the profits are calculated and distributed every 24 hours. This hands-off approach is helping Litecoin carve out space in the expanding segment of passive income-focused crypto solutions. This initiative is particularly relevant for those looking for scalable, low-barrier-to-entry crypto opportunities. Participants are also given the flexibility to reinvest or withdraw their profits at any point, giving them more control over their digital assets. By offering this ease and accessibility, Litecoin is reinforcing its reputation as a utility-first coin that evolves with user demands. Pi Network’s Futures Debut Marks Its Entry Into Advanced Trading Territory Pi Network just landed on the global derivatives stage with its token now tradable on Kraken through perpetual futures contracts. These contracts offer up to 20x leverage, enabling traders to speculate on PI’s price in a more sophisticated financial environment. The listing reflects Kraken’s growing interest in tokens with strong community engagement, and it offers Pi Network a legitimate on-ramp into high-volume trading markets. At the time of this development, the PI token was trading at $0.77, reflecting a slight dip of 5.33% in the last 24 hours. Despite the minor short-term pullback, the derivatives debut is a significant milestone. It signals that Pi is no longer just an experimental mobile mining project—it’s stepping into markets dominated by advanced financial products and institutional-level tools. How Current Market Trends Are Shaping the Future of These Coins One of the most important trends gaining steam right now is real estate tokenization, a concept once dismissed by many but now championed by seasoned blockchain professionals. The latest discussion highlights how tokenized property is being framed not just as a niche tool but as a major disruptor of traditional real estate finance. For Litecoin, this movement aligns with the broader theme of accessibility, as its cloud mining platform allows passive entry into crypto income streams. Pi Network’s new futures offering reflects how community-based tokens can evolve into assets with more sophisticated trading instruments. Qubetics, meanwhile, benefits from being in its crypto presale phase while market volatility plays out. Because the price increases predictably by 10% every week, it offers a built-in level of stability that shields early buyers from external price shocks. With its multi-chain infrastructure and focus on business-grade transactions, Qubetics has positioned itself to participate in this larger trend of bringing real utility to decentralized assets. Why These Three Coins Stand Out in 2025’s Rapid Crypto Shifts Litecoin, Pi Network, and Qubetics all bring something tangible to the table in an industry that’s increasingly driven by results rather than narratives. Litecoin is giving users a sustainable path to daily earnings with zero technical friction. Pi Network is proving that community-focused tokens can evolve into serious financial instruments with derivatives access. Qubetics is aiming to close gaps in international financial infrastructure, offering real utility through cross-border transaction support and a strong presale model. For those scanning the space for meaningful, timely entry points, each of these coins offers a different flavor of potential. Yet, it is Qubetics, with its scheduled price increases and strong utility roadmap, that may appeal most to those looking to join this best crypto presale while the opportunity is still at its peak. Among the top coins to join today, Qubetics stands out for its structured presale, predictable growth model, and focus on solving real-world financial challenges. As each coin continues to execute its roadmap, these early moves in 2025 may define their long-term trajectory.

The address conveyed HTX DAO’s strategic perspective on Real World Assets (RWA). Hong Kong’s recent passage of the landmark Stablecoins Bill solidifies its role as a leading global financial center embracing decentralized innovation. HTX DAO’s significant presence at this pivotal moment underscores its growing impact. During the address, it was noted that “We are at a historic inflection point. Crypto is not just a shiny new technology but a movement to restructure the global financial power matrix.” As legacy financial systems, anchored by SWIFT, the U.S. dollar, and multinational banks, begin to fragment, HTX DAO believes that the integration of DAO governance and RWA tokenization represents a vital pathway to building the next-generation financial civilization. RWA for Financial Reordering: HTX DAO’s Leadership Role Far more than the tokenization of traditional assets, RWA represents a structural shift, bringing real-world assets under on-chain governance, transparent trading, and global coordination. HTX DAO emphasizes that on-chain does not necessarily equate to decentralization; the true transformation lies in the governance redesign and value redistribution introduced by DAO frameworks. HTX DAO is uniquely positioned at the intersection of real assets, crypto infrastructure, and decentralized governance, bringing comprehensive advantages to RWA practices. HTX DAO’s infrastructure is backed by HTX Exchange and the TRON blockchain, providing high-performance capabilities for RWA issuance, circulation, and settlement. Its governance mechanisms, including veHTX, snapshot voting, and a community proposal system, ensure layered, transparent, and censorship-resistant oversight. Furthermore, HTX DAO leverages a robust KOL ecosystem, Launchpool events, and extensive community engagement to accelerate asset awareness and adoption. Building the RWA Ecosystem: HTX DAO’s Vision Looking ahead, HTX DAO is developing a six-part RWA framework, covering: asset discovery mechanism, governance standardization, governance-to-distribution synergy, revenue sharing mechanism, risk management system, and ecosystem expansion and strategic partnerships. The objective of this framework is to bring the full lifecycle of RWA—proposal, review, listing, yield distribution, and risk response—entirely on-chain, ensuring both governance and audit transparency. For $HTX holders, DAO governance is no longer a technical abstraction but a participatory, decision-making, and yield-sharing mechanism. HTX DAO is designing a veHTX and yield distribution model, enabling users to lock $HTX to receive veHTX for voting rights, influence RWA project listings, decide yield splits, and vote on execution timelines. Aligning with Hong Kong’s Stablecoins Bill for Prosperity at a New Financial Era Just prior to the Conference, Hong Kong enacted the Stablecoins Bill, establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS). This legislative action positions the city as one of the first global regions to legislate stablecoin issuance and compliance. The initiative was publicly endorsed on social media by Justin Sun, HTX DAO’s core contributor, Advisor to HTX, and the TRON founder. HTX DAO views this legislation as a foundational step, crucial not only for stablecoin sustainability but also for effectively bridging RWA assets with on-chain governance. As 2025 marks the inaugural year of stablecoin legislation, Hong Kong stands at the forefront of the global digital finance wave. HTX DAO, powered by DAO governance and RWA integration, is building an open, shared, and decentralized ecosystem for asset governance. “We’re not merely building a DAO but bridging different civilizations,” Molly concluded. “HTX DAO will continue to expand its boundaries as a builder, resonating with global policy shifts to boost a financial future rooted in community and real-world value.” About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

The tech company introduced a new quantum computing chip called Willow in December 2024 and said it could break Bitcoin in at least two days. The firm argued that Willow could solve in five minutes a problem that would take most supercomputers 10 septillion years to solve. At the time, critics believed Willow’s power could overtake Bitcoin’s hash rate in minutes, rewrite the Bitcoin blockchain, or even steal Satoshi’s coins. Google sees quantum computing as a potential threat to BTC’s security ""2048-bit RSA #encryption could theoretically be broken by a #quantum computer with 1 million noisy qubits running for one week."" https://t.co/MoxGROF3Va #PQC #cybersecurity — Jari Pirhonen (@japi999) May 26, 2025 Google said its breakthrough moved quantum computing one step closer to becoming a practical reality and a potential threat to Bitcoin’s security. The company’s Quantum Researcher, Craig Gidney, believes that planning the transition of quantum-safe cryptosystems requires understanding the cost of quantum attacks on vulnerable ecosystems. Gidney said he published an estimate in Gidney+Ekera 2019 stating that 2048-bit RSA integers could be factored in eight hours by a quantum computer with 20 million qubits. According to him, he significantly reduced the number of qubits required in his research paper. “I estimate that a 2048 bit RSA integer could be factored in less than a week by a quantum computer with less than a million noisy qubits. This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate.” – Craig Gidney , Quantum Research Scientist at Google. Google’s researcher believes that people’s digital assets are still safe for now. He also argued that the trajectory is what matters, and it’s pointing in a direction that should make anyone holding crypto pay attention. Google said the breakthrough would come from better algorithms and smarter error correction. On the algorithmic side, the firm’s researchers figured out how to calculate modular exponentiations twice as fast as the heavy mathematical lifting in encryption. The team also found that error correction improvements were possible because they tripled the density of the logical qubits’ space by adding a new layer of error correction, which packaged more useful quantum operations into the same physical space. Google researchers also deployed magic state cultivation – a trick that makes special quantum ingredients (called T states) stronger and more reliable. The team said it helps quantum computers perform complex tasks more efficiently without wasting extra resources, which reduces the workspace needed for basic quantum operations. Bitcoin operates on elliptic curve cryptography, which works on mathematical principles similar to those of RSA. Google believes that if quantum computers can crack RSA faster than expected, BTC’s security timeline just got smaller. Project 11 believes quantum computers running Shor’s algorithms might break BTC We just launched the Q-Day Prize. 1 BTC to the first team to break a toy version of Bitcoin’s cryptography using a quantum computer. Deadline: April 5, 2026 Mission: Protect 6M BTC (over $500B) — Project 11 (@qdayclock) April 16, 2025 A quantum computing research group called Project 11 launched a Bitcoin bounty worth nearly $85,000 for anyone who can break even a simplified version of BTC’s encryption using a quantum computer. The team is testing keys ranging from 1 to 25 bits, smaller compared to Bitcoin’s 256-bit encryption, but it entails tracking progress. Project 11 wrote that BTC security relies on elliptic curve cryptography. The research group also believes that quantum computers running Shor’s algorithm will eventually break it. The team is now testing how urgent the threat is. Google believes competitors could already be collecting encrypted data to decrypt later once quantum computers become available. The tech firm said it has been encrypting traffic both in Chrome and internally, switching to the standardized version of ML-KEM once it became available. The National Institute of Standards and Technology released post-quantum cryptography standards last year and recommended phasing out vulnerable systems after 2030. Google’s research suggests that the schedule might need to be accelerated. IBM has partnered with the University of Tokyo and the University of Chicago to plan for a 100,000-qubit quantum computer by 2030. Quantinuum also aims to deliver a fully immune quantum computer by 2029.

Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ever wonder what the collective mood of the market is? Are traders feeling optimistic and ready to buy everything in sight, or are they huddled in fear, panic selling their holdings? That’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes in. This popular metric gives us a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , and right now, it’s flashing ‘Greed’ with a reading of 74. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Provided by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a unique tool designed to gauge the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a temperature check for investor psychology. Emotions can significantly influence trading decisions, often leading to irrational behavior. When the market is rising, greed can kick in, pushing prices unsustainably high. Conversely, when prices plummet, fear can lead to panic selling, driving values even lower. The index distills these complex emotions into a simple score ranging from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried. This can signal a potential buying opportunity for those brave enough to enter the market against the prevailing mood. 25-49: Fear – Anxiety is present, but not at extreme levels. Caution is advised. 50-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic or outright greedy. This suggests the market is getting expensive. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria is widespread. This can indicate a market bubble that might be due for a correction. The core idea behind the index is based on a classic investment principle: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” By understanding the dominant sentiment, traders and investors might identify potential turning points or confirm existing trends. How Does the Index Get Its Score? Diving into the Data The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number. It’s calculated using a weighted average of several different data points. Alternative.me uses six specific factors to arrive at the daily score. Understanding these factors helps us appreciate the nuance behind the single number: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum to the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market indicates greedy or optimistic behavior. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts and hashtags on platforms like Twitter. A rapid increase in specific hashtags and high engagement rates can indicate heightened interest and potentially greedy behavior. Surveys (15%): While paused at times, this factor previously incorporated weekly sentiment surveys. (Note: The index description indicates this is still a factor, though its current implementation might vary). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear (as investors flee riskier altcoins to BTC, seen as a safer haven), while falling dominance can signal increasing greed and a willingness to invest in altcoins (often preceding or accompanying an altcoin season ). Google Trends (10%): This looks at Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” indicates fear, while terms like “buy crypto” or “Bitcoin rally” suggest greed. Each of these factors contributes to the final score, providing a multi-faceted view of the market’s emotional state. It’s important to note that the index is heavily weighted towards Bitcoin data (Volatility, Momentum, Bitcoin Dominance, Google Trends are largely BTC-centric), as Bitcoin remains the dominant force influencing overall crypto market sentiment . Understanding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 74 Mean Right Now? As of May 27, the index stands at 74, firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, just one point shy of ‘Extreme Greed’. A reading of 74 indicates that investors are feeling confident, optimistic, and perhaps even a bit overly enthusiastic about the market’s prospects. This level of greed typically emerges after a period of price increases, where participants have seen their portfolios grow and are anticipating further gains. When the index is high, it suggests: Increased Buying Pressure: More people are looking to buy, and fewer are looking to sell, driving prices up. Reduced Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): The prevailing narrative is positive, reducing the anxiety that might otherwise deter new investment. Potential for Overextension: High greed can lead to prices becoming detached from fundamental value or sustainable growth rates. A Possible Precursor to Correction: Historically, periods of extreme greed have often been followed by market corrections or significant pullbacks as early investors take profits and the buying pressure wanes. For those watching the Bitcoin price , a high index reading like 74 often correlates with strong upward price action or recent highs. It reflects the bullish conviction currently present in the market. Historical Context: When Has Greed Peaked Before? Looking back at the history of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can provide valuable context. During the peak of the 2021 bull run, the index frequently hit the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, often exceeding 90. These periods coincided with rapid price increases across the market, but were also often followed by sharp, albeit sometimes temporary, downturns. Conversely, during the depths of the 2022 bear market, the index languished in ‘Extreme Fear’ (below 20) for extended periods, marking points of maximum pessimism that, in hindsight, represented significant buying opportunities before subsequent rallies. A reading of 74 is high, but not historically unprecedented extreme. It suggests strong positive sentiment, but perhaps not yet the full-blown euphoria seen at the very top of major market cycles. However, being this close to the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone warrants careful consideration. Benefits: How Can You Use the Index in Your Crypto Trading Strategy? While not a standalone trading signal, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a valuable addition to your toolkit. Here are some ways traders and investors utilize it: Counter-Trading Signal: The most common approach is to use it as a contrarian indicator. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be a good time to consider buying (when others are panic selling). When it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (like it’s approaching now), it might be a time to consider selling or reducing exposure (when others are rushing to buy). Sentiment Confirmation: Use the index to confirm signals from other technical or fundamental analysis tools. If your analysis suggests a potential downturn and the index is showing high greed, it adds weight to your bearish outlook. If your analysis suggests a potential upturn during extreme fear, the index supports a bullish view. Emotional Check: The index can serve as a reminder to check your own emotions. If the index is high and you feel an overwhelming urge to buy aggressively, it might be your own greed influencing your decisions, prompting you to pause and re-evaluate. Spotting Potential Altcoin Season: Keep an eye on the Bitcoin Dominance factor within the index calculation. If the overall index is high (greed) and Bitcoin dominance starts to fall, it could signal that investors are rotating profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, potentially kicking off an altcoin season . Using the index requires discipline and an understanding that sentiment is only one piece of the puzzle. Limitations: Why the Index Isn’t a Crystal Ball It’s crucial to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a perfect predictor of future Bitcoin price movements or overall market direction. It has limitations: Correlation, Not Causation: The index reflects current sentiment, which often correlates with price movements, but it doesn’t *cause* the market to move. Other factors like regulatory news, technological developments, and macroeconomic events play significant roles. Lagging or Coinciding Indicator: The index reacts to market conditions. By the time it hits ‘Extreme Greed’, the market might have already made a significant move up. Similarly, ‘Extreme Fear’ often appears after a crash has already occurred. Limited Data Scope: While it incorporates several factors, it doesn’t capture everything influencing market sentiment or price, such as large institutional moves or private investor activity not reflected in public data. Potential for Manipulation: Social media sentiment, one of the factors, can potentially be influenced or manipulated. Not a Standalone Tool: Relying solely on the index for trading decisions is risky. It should be used in conjunction with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and sound risk management. Treat the index as a helpful indicator of the market’s emotional temperature, not a definitive buy or sell signal. Actionable Insights: Incorporating the Index into Your Strategy So, how should you approach the current reading of 74 in the ‘Greed’ zone? Here are some actionable steps to consider as part of your crypto trading strategy : Exercise Caution: A high reading suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself. This isn’t necessarily a signal to sell everything, but it is a good time to be more cautious with new investments. Avoid chasing pumps driven purely by FOMO. Review Your Portfolio: If you’ve accumulated significant gains during the recent uptrend, consider taking some profits. Selling a portion of your holdings in the ‘Greed’ zone aligns with the contrarian principle. Tighten Stop Losses: If you are holding positions, consider tightening your stop-loss orders to protect against a sudden downturn if sentiment shifts rapidly. Look for Divergences: Compare the index’s movement with price action. If the market continues to rise sharply while the index plateaus or starts to dip from extreme levels, it could be a subtle sign of weakening underlying sentiment despite price strength. Research Altcoins (Carefully): With the index in Greed and potentially signaling an upcoming altcoin season (depending on the Bitcoin Dominance factor), this might be a time to research promising altcoin projects. However, be highly selective and aware that altcoins are generally riskier than Bitcoin, especially if a market correction occurs. Combine with Other Indicators: Always use the index alongside other tools. Look at chart patterns, support/resistance levels, volume analysis, and fundamental news before making decisions. A high index reading is a reminder that market cycles exist and sentiment can shift quickly. Prepare, don’t panic. Is an Altcoin Season on the Horizon? As mentioned, the Bitcoin Dominance factor within the index plays a role in assessing the potential for an altcoin season . When overall market sentiment is greedy (high index) and Bitcoin dominance is falling, it often suggests that capital is flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins. While the index itself at 74 indicates overall greed, keeping an eye on the specific Bitcoin Dominance chart can provide further clues about whether altcoins are likely to outperform Bitcoin in the near term. A high overall index reading combined with decreasing BTC dominance is a classic recipe for altcoin rallies, but always remember that market dynamics are complex and no single indicator guarantees future performance. Conclusion: Summing Up the Sentiment Signal The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sitting at 74 places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. This reflects strong positive sentiment driven by factors like market momentum and social media buzz. While a high reading indicates optimism and can coincide with upward price action, it also serves as a crucial warning sign that the market may be getting frothy. Historically, periods of high greed have often preceded market pullbacks or corrections. For anyone involved in crypto, understanding this sentiment is vital for making informed decisions and refining their crypto trading strategy . Don’t let the prevailing greed cloud your judgment; use the index as a tool for awareness, caution, and strategic planning alongside other forms of analysis to navigate the exciting, but volatile, world of cryptocurrency.

The surge, led primarily by Bitcoin and Ethereum funds, comes as several major token vesting schedules are set to expire in June, releasing an estimated $3.3 billion worth of digital assets into circulation. While the influx of new capital highlights growing investor confidence, the upcoming token unlocks may reintroduce short-term volatility and reignite scrutiny over project tokenomics and market supply dynamics. Crypto ETPs Hit $10.8B in Inflows as Institutional Demand Soars Past Records Cryptocurrency investment products have seen an explosive resurgence in demand, with institutional inflows breaching the $10 billion threshold for the year, according to the latest report by European digital asset manager CoinShares. For the week ending May 24, global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracted $3.3 billion in net inflows, one of the largest weekly totals in history, pushing 2024’s year-to-date (YTD) cumulative figure to a staggering $10.8 billion. The surge highlights a notable revival in investor appetite for digital assets amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty and renewed confidence in flagship cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Crypto ETP flows by asset as of May 23, 2025 (in millions of US dollars) (Source: CoinShares) Bitcoin investment products dominated last week’s flows, accounting for $2.9 billion of the total $3.3 billion, or roughly 88% of all weekly inflows. According to CoinShares head of research James Butterfill, this wave of capital helped push the total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs to a record $187.5 billion, albeit briefly, before markets experienced minor corrections. The inflows into Bitcoin products came as BTC soared above the $110,000 mark on May 22, marking a new milestone for the digital asset. While the rally attracted long-term capital, it also fueled demand for short-Bitcoin products, which saw $12.7 million in inflows, the largest weekly inflow into short-BTC ETPs since December 2024. This divergence indicates that some investors are preparing for near-term volatility even as the long-term outlook remains bullish. Ethereum Continues Five-Week Winning Streak Post-Upgrade Ethereum (ETH) ETPs also recorded strong performance, pulling in $326 million for the week—its fifth consecutive week of inflows. The continued momentum follows the successful rollout of the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade on May 7, which improved transaction efficiency and scalability on the Ethereum network. Investor confidence in Ethereum has been steadily growing in the wake of developments related to a potential Ethereum spot ETF in the United States. Alongside the Ethereum ecosystem’s technical improvements, this has led to a shift in sentiment favoring sustained capital allocation to ETH-based investment products. In stark contrast, XRP-based ETPs experienced a historic setback. After an 80-week streak of inflows, XRP products saw $37.2 million in outflows, the largest single-week capital flight on record for the asset class. The reversal came despite two potentially bullish developments: the growing speculation around the launch of a spot XRP ETF in the US, and the open interest in XRP futures climbing to $2.2 billion. The disconnect between the token’s price underperformance and these tailwinds has caused some institutional investors to reassess short-term exposure. Butterfill suggested that the withdrawal could indicate waning confidence in XRP's immediate price trajectory rather than a broader dismissal of its long-term viability. Crypto ETP Market Rebounds From February Correction CoinShares’ latest data shows the market has not only recovered but has surpassed levels seen before the February–March 2025 correction. During that period, crypto investment products experienced nearly $7 billion in outflows following a sharp pullback in digital asset prices. That drawdown had initially dampened enthusiasm, but by mid-May, inflows had returned with $785 million added in a single week, pushing the YTD total to $7.5 billion by May 16. Underlying the record-breaking inflows is a broader shift in institutional strategy as macroeconomic pressures mount. Butterfill pointed to the recent downgrade of the US credit outlook by Moody’s and a spike in treasury yields as catalysts pushing investors toward alternative asset classes like digital assets. The reemergence of crypto as a preferred destination for capital, especially within structured products such as ETFs and ETPs, underscores the growing sophistication of the digital asset market and the deepening role of institutions in driving this growth. Outlook: Sustained Growth or Volatility Ahead? While the recent inflows have been overwhelmingly positive for market sentiment, the rise in short-BTC positions suggests that not all investors believe the upward momentum will continue unchecked. With Ethereum’s ecosystem undergoing active upgrades and Bitcoin nearing new psychological levels, the coming weeks will be a critical test for crypto’s resilience. Moreover, with speculation mounting around future ETF approvals for Ethereum and potentially XRP, volatility may increase as regulatory signals begin to shape new investor narratives. Regardless, the crypto ETP landscape continues to break records and draw billions in capital—an unmistakable signal that institutional crypto adoption is not just back, but accelerating. $3.3 Billion in Crypto Tokens Set to Flood Market in June as Vesting Schedules Expire Meanwhile, digital assets worth $3.3 billion are poised to enter circulation in June 2025 as vesting periods for several major crypto projects come to an end, according to new data from crypto vesting tracker Tokenomist. While the figure marks a 32% month-on-month decline from May’s $4.9 billion in token unlocks, the influx is still expected to have a measurable impact on market liquidity, investor sentiment, and potentially token prices. Vesting schedules play a crucial role in managing the distribution of crypto tokens—often for team members, early investors, foundations, or community grants. These locked tokens are typically released either gradually through “linear unlocks” or all at once via “cliff unlocks.” Of the $3.3 billion to be released in June, approximately $1.4 billion will be unlocked through cliff mechanisms, while $1.9 billion will be gradually released through linear emissions, signaling a mix of immediate and ongoing market supply pressure. One of the most closely watched token unlocks in June is from Metars Genesis (MRS)—a metaverse-focused NFT project. The project is scheduled to unlock $193 million worth of MRS tokens on June 21, which it says will be directed toward a new partnership focused on artificial intelligence. Since March, Metars Genesis has been releasing 10 million tokens monthly, and has already seen nearly $1 billion in tokens enter circulation. Analysts will be monitoring how the AI partnership impacts token utility and demand in light of the expanded supply. Sui to Release $160M in Tokens on June 1 Layer-1 blockchain project Sui (SUI) is also scheduled for a major unlock. On June 1, the project will unlock 44 million SUI tokens worth roughly $160 million. The majority of these tokens will be allocated to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors, and the community reserve. Notably, more than $70 million worth of these tokens is set aside for Series B investors, prompting speculation over potential profit-taking. Tokenomist data showing Sui’s vesting schedule (Source: Tokenomist) Since its inception, Sui has already unlocked 3.3 billion tokens worth over $12 billion, which constitutes about 33% of its total token supply. However, Tokenomist data reveals that another 5.22 billion SUI tokens—valued at nearly $20 billion—remain without a scheduled release date, leaving uncertainty around future dilution risk. Other high-profile projects are also set for sizable unlocks in June: Fasttoken (FTN) will release 20 million tokens valued at $88 million, allocated to the project’s founders. LayerZero (ZRO), a cross-chain interoperability protocol, plans to unlock 25 million tokens worth $71 million, primarily directed toward core contributors and strategic partners. Aptos (APT) is slated to release 11.31 million tokens worth $61 million. The tokens will be distributed to the core team, community, foundation, and early investors. ZKsync (ZK) will emit over 760 million tokens worth $49 million, primarily targeted at team members and early backers. These unlocks are likely to reignite discussions around tokenomics, vesting transparency, and the implications for long-term holders as new supply enters open markets. Market Impact: Supply Pressure or Maturation? While June’s $3.3 billion in unlocks is lower than May’s record, the sudden liquidity—especially from cliff unlocks—can potentially weigh on token prices, particularly if recipients choose to liquidate their allocations. However, some analysts argue that token unlocks also represent a maturation milestone for projects, reflecting continued development, new product launches, and evolving utility.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-27 05:30:00

Deputy Governor Lee Jong-ryeol outlined the bank’s vision during the ‘Blockchain Leaders Club’ event on Tuesday. “We are considering a plan to link the Bank of Korea’s deposit tokens with the public blockchain system,” Lee said, according to a News1 report . He described state-backed deposit tokens as a “type of stablecoin,” issued within the bank’s digital currency framework. “These projects are being promoted by the Bank of Korea as a monetary and foreign exchange authority, with the aim of safely and soundly developing the digital currency ecosystem from a national perspective.” Further, Lee noted that the tokens could potentially operate alongside privately issued stablecoins within the crypto ecosystem. Influx of Global Stablecoins is Concerning: BOK Deputy Governor As reported by Cryptonews , stablecoins drove around 47% of South Korea’s Q1 crypto outflows. Stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, such as USDT and USDC, made up 26.87 trillion won (USD $19.1 billion) or 47.3%. South Korean traders prefer stablecoins due to their price stability, which enables them to access foreign crypto markets like Binance. Dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC accounted for 26.87 trillion won of South Korea’s crypto outflows in Q1 2025. Are stablecoins driving the surge in global crypto trading? #Stablecoins #SouthKorea https://t.co/9DT0K4IsBz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 Bank of Korea deputy governor Lee called the influx of global stablecoins “concerning.” He added that if stablecoins are used as a substitute for currency, it would lead to problems, including violation of monetary sovereignty, financial instability and money laundering. Further, leading legal and financial experts have warned political leaders that stablecoin adoption could pose a danger to the South Korean economy. On the global front, stablecoin growth has reached new heights. For instance, its total market value surpassed $230 billion in March 2025. At press time, the total stablecoin market stands at $247.483 billion, which is up $3.537 billion over the past week. Source: DeFiLlama The Tuesday’s event saw attendance from key government officials and several representatives of major virtual asset exchanges, including Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, among others. Is Korean Won-Backed Stablecoin Coming Soon? Earlier, South Korea’s opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, touted the launch of Korean won-backed stablecoin. He proposed that the stablecoin would stem the 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) crypto outflow and reduce dependence on foreign private stablecoins. Jae-myung, the frontrunner in the South Korean presidential elections, has been pressured by lawmakers over fast-tracking the rollout of a KRW stablecoin . Min Byoung-dug, a lawmaker for the Democratic Party and the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee, recently said that the country needs to “ take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins ” before the USD-backed stablecoins become prominent. “That is the only way we can secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony,” Min said last week.

They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave. However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation. This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price. Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.” “Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.” BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Even though Japan’s net external assets reached a record level , the stronger euro, the yen depreciation, and Germany’s export-led surplus also tilted the balance. At the end of 2024, Japan’s net external assets were ¥533.1 trillion (about $3.73 trillion), its Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday. The figure was up nearly 13% from last year, indicating an increase in foreign investment by Japanese companies. But Germany’s net external assets grew even steeper to ¥569.7 trillion ($3.99 trillion). That makes Germany the largest creditor nation on the planet. China held third place, with net external assets of ¥516.3 trillion ($3.62 trillion). Germany’s rise to the top is largely due to its huge current account surplus. In 2024, it rose to $282.99 billion, boosted by robust exports, particularly of luxury machinery, automobiles, and industrial equipment. By contrast, the surplus in Japan’s current account was ¥29.4 trillion, or about $205 billion. That’s a healthy number but nowhere near enough to keep up with Germany. Weak yen fuels Japan’s asset growth, but not enough to lead The devaluation of the yen was a big factor behind the growth of Japan’s foreign assets . The value of assets in the currencies appreciated when they were converted back into yen as the yen weakened against the euro and dollar. The yen fell roughly 11.7% against the U.S. dollar in 2024 and 5% against the euro. This caused euro-denominated German assets to look much larger in yen terms. By the end of 2024, Japan had gross external assets of ¥1,659 trillion ($11.61 trillion), or ¥169 trillion ($1.18 trillion) more than the preceding year. And yet its liabilities also surged, rising by ¥109 trillion ($0.76 trillion) to ¥1,126 trillion ($7.88 trillion). Although Japan posted strong figures, Germany’s surge in external surplus combined with favorable currency movements ultimately gave it the edge. Trade pressures push Japan to invest overseas Japanese businesses maintained their momentum of aggressive overseas investments in 2024, especially in finance, insurance, and retail. The United States and the United Kingdom remained key targets for these investments. Mergers and acquisitions overseas by Japan saw particularly strong growth. Such investments helped boost overall foreign assets but may not result in short-term gains. In the future, Japan’s status as a global creditor will hinge on how its companies fare in the global economy, particularly as rising geopolitical tensions and evolving tariff rules loom. President Donald Trump’s resurgence and trade policies may also influence where and how Japanese companies invest more. Some may move manufacturing or assets to the United States as an insurance policy against future tariffs or other trade blocks. Japan is still one of the world’s most fiscally solid countries. However, whether the country can sustain its economic success is uncertain, as longer-term challenges, such as the impact of an aging population, stubbornly low wages, and persistent deflation, threaten to hobble its economic growth over the long term.

Cetus, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on Sui, has recently disclosed a major security incident. We’re talking about a significant financial blow – an estimated $220 million lost in a sophisticated exploit that occurred on May 22, 2025. This isn’t just another blip on the radar; a loss of this magnitude sends ripples through the entire DeFi space. Cetus has been quick to respond, publishing a detailed report titled “Cetus Incident Report: May 22, 2025 Attack Disclosure.” This report outlines their immediate actions and forward-looking strategy to navigate this crisis. Let’s dive into what happened and what Cetus plans to do next. What Happened During the Cetus Exploit? The core of the issue revolves around the Cetus exploit that targeted the DEX on May 22, 2025. While the full technical details of the exploit vector are still under wraps or being investigated, the outcome is clear and stark: approximately $220 million in user funds, primarily from liquidity pools, were siphoned off. For context, $220 million represents a substantial amount within the DeFi landscape, highlighting the critical vulnerabilities that can exist even in seemingly robust protocols. Decentralized exchanges like Cetus rely on complex smart contracts to manage liquidity, execute trades, and handle user funds without intermediaries. These smart contracts are the backbone of the operation, but they also represent potential attack surfaces. A single vulnerability, if discovered and exploited by malicious actors, can lead to catastrophic losses, as sadly demonstrated by this incident. The immediate aftermath of such an exploit is chaotic. Users panic, liquidity dries up, and the protocol’s reputation takes a severe hit. The Cetus team’s priority has been to assess the damage, understand the exploit mechanism, and formulate a plan to address the fallout and prevent future occurrences. Strengthening Decentralized Exchange Security After the Breach One of the absolute top priorities for Cetus moving forward, as outlined in their report, is a significant push to strengthen decentralized exchange security . Exploits like this are a harsh reminder that security in DeFi is not a one-time audit; it’s an ongoing, evolving process. Cetus has committed to implementing more rigorous security measures. What might this involve? Typically, enhancing smart contract security after a major incident includes: Comprehensive Code Audits: Engaging multiple, reputable third-party security firms to conduct deep dives into the entire codebase, looking for vulnerabilities missed in previous reviews. Formal Verification: Using mathematical methods to prove that smart contracts behave as intended under all possible conditions, reducing the risk of unexpected exploits. Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivizing ethical hackers to find and report vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. Improved Monitoring and Alerting: Implementing systems that can detect suspicious activity or unusual transactions in real-time, allowing for quicker response times. Access Control & Multi-Signature Wallets: Reviewing and tightening control over critical functions and potentially requiring multiple team members to authorize large transactions or code changes. The report emphasizes that bolstering their security framework is foundational to rebuilding trust and ensuring the long-term viability of the platform on Sui. This commitment to enhancing security is crucial not just for Cetus, but serves as a case study for other DEXs operating in the high-stakes DeFi environment. Navigating the Crypto Exploit Recovery Journey Perhaps the most pressing concern for affected users is the crypto exploit recovery plan. Losing $220 million is devastating for liquidity providers (LPs) who trusted Cetus with their assets. The Cetus team acknowledges this and has made recovery for affected LPs a central pillar of their response. According to their report, the recovery plan is multi-faceted: Working with Ecosystem Partners: Cetus is collaborating closely with other projects and entities within the Sui ecosystem and the broader crypto space. This could involve tracing funds, seeking assistance from exchanges, or leveraging collective security expertise. Restoring LP Withdrawals: A key technical challenge is safely enabling withdrawals for LPs, especially those in affected pools, while preventing further losses or manipulation. This requires careful technical work to isolate compromised funds and ensure remaining assets are secure. On-Chain Vote for Fund Recovery: Cetus has initiated an on-chain governance vote. The specifics of this vote (e.g., proposing a mechanism for distributing recovered funds, approving a recovery fund creation) are vital and require community consensus to accelerate the recovery process legally and transparently. Negotiations with the Attacker: In parallel with other efforts, Cetus is attempting to negotiate with the attacker. This often involves offering a bounty (the ‘white hat’ opportunity) in exchange for the return of funds, minus a percentage as a reward for identifying the vulnerability. Pursuing Legal Action: Alongside negotiation, legal avenues are being explored to identify and pursue the attacker. This is a complex process in the pseudonymous world of crypto but is often pursued in large-scale exploits. Pending Final Notice: The report mentions a ‘final notice’ is pending, likely related to the negotiation deadline or the next steps in the recovery or legal process. Successfully executing a crypto exploit recovery plan of this scale is incredibly challenging. It requires technical skill, legal strategy, community coordination via governance, and sometimes, a bit of luck in recovering funds or negotiating with the exploiter. The transparency and steps outlined by Cetus are a crucial starting point, though the path ahead for affected LPs will undoubtedly be long and complex. What Does This Mean for the Sui DEX Ecosystem? An exploit of this size on a major Sui DEX like Cetus naturally raises questions about the security posture of the entire ecosystem. While the vulnerability might have been specific to Cetus’s smart contracts, it underscores the inherent risks in DeFi, regardless of the underlying blockchain. For users of other protocols on Sui, this incident serves as a stark reminder to: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand the risks associated with depositing funds into any DeFi protocol. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed: Follow official channels for updates on security incidents and recovery efforts. Understand Smart Contract Risk: Be aware that even audited contracts can have vulnerabilities. The Sui community and other projects on the chain will be watching closely to see how Cetus handles the recovery and implements new security measures. A successful and transparent recovery process could help restore confidence, while missteps could further damage trust in the ecosystem. Beyond the Headlines: The Broader Impact on Crypto Security The Cetus incident is unfortunately not an isolated event in the world of decentralized finance. It highlights the continuous arms race between protocol developers and malicious actors. Ensuring robust crypto security is paramount for the growth and adoption of DeFi. This involves not only technical safeguards but also community education and vigilance. As users, understanding the risks is the first step in protecting your assets. As developers and projects, continuous auditing, testing, and rapid response plans are non-negotiable. The $220 million loss is a painful lesson, but the response from Cetus, involving technical fixes, community governance, legal action, and even negotiation, provides a template for how protocols attempt to navigate such crises. The success of their crypto exploit recovery will be a key factor in how the community perceives both Cetus and the resilience of the Sui ecosystem. Conclusion: A Difficult Path to Recovery The Cetus exploit resulting in a shocking $220 million loss is a significant setback for the Sui DEX and its users. The team’s detailed report outlines a clear, albeit challenging, path forward involving strengthening decentralized exchange security , pursuing a comprehensive crypto exploit recovery plan for LPs, and engaging in both legal action and potential negotiation with the attacker. While the road to full recovery will be arduous, the proactive steps, including the on-chain vote and collaboration with ecosystem partners, demonstrate a commitment to addressing the crisis head-on. This incident serves as a critical reminder of the inherent risks in DeFi and the absolute necessity of robust crypto security measures and vigilant community participation.

Google researchers have revealed that RSA encryption, which protects systems from internet banking to Bitcoin wallets, can be broken by quantum computers with 20 times fewer resources than previously thought. In a study published in 2019, Google Quantum Researcher Craig Gidney predicted that 2048-bit RSA encryption could be broken in eight hours with a quantum computer with 20 million noisy qubits. However, in his new study, he significantly revised this number: This process can now be done in less than a week with a quantum computer with less than 1 million qubits. “This represents a 20-fold reduction in the number of qubits compared to our previous estimate,” Gidney wrote in his blog post.

Currently, IBM's most powerful quantum computer, called Condor, has a capacity of 1,121 qubits; Google's Sycamore works with only 53 qubits. However, the pace of progress in the quantum field shows that it could pose serious risks to security systems in the future. Google said there are two main drivers behind this development: faster algorithms and more efficient error correction methods. The researchers managed to speed up one of the most difficult operations in cryptography, “modular exponential computations,” by a factor of two. They also improved the error correction layer, allowing more “logical qubits” to operate in the same physical space. This significantly increased processing efficiency. Another technical innovation is a method called “magic state cultivation,” which allows quantum computers to perform complex tasks with higher accuracy and fewer resources. Unlike RSA, Bitcoin is protected by a system called elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). However, both encryption systems are based on similar mathematical foundations. Google’s new finding on RSA could mean that ECC could also be broken sooner than expected. While the 256-bit encryption that Bitcoin uses is currently quite strong, the exponential development of quantum computers could erode this security over time. *This is not investment advice.

The Altcoin Season Index is a key indicator that provides valuable insights into whether smaller cryptocurrencies are outperforming Bitcoin, or vice versa. Recently, this index has dropped, signaling a significant shift: we are currently in Bitcoin Season . Understanding this dynamic is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. It helps investors and traders gauge market sentiment and potentially adjust their crypto trading strategy accordingly. Let’s dive deeper into what the Altcoin Season Index tells us and what the prevailing Bitcoin Season implies for the broader crypto market trends . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index, as tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is a simple yet powerful metric designed to measure the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. It’s essentially a snapshot of market sentiment and capital flow between Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens). Here’s how it works: It typically looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens). The performance is measured over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. A score of 75 or higher indicates Altcoin Season, meaning at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. A score of 25 or lower indicates Bitcoin Season, meaning 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Scores between 25 and 75 suggest a neutral period or a transition phase, where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin have a clear dominance in performance. Think of it as a barometer for market dominance. When the index is high, capital is flowing into altcoins, leading to potentially explosive gains in various smaller cap assets. When the index is low, Bitcoin is the primary beneficiary of market liquidity and momentum. The Current State: Altcoin Season Index at 25, Signaling Bitcoin Season As of a recent reading (May 27, 00:30 UTC), the Altcoin Season Index registered 25. This figure is down slightly from previous days, reinforcing the current market narrative. A score of 25 falls precisely at the threshold for what is defined as Bitcoin Season . What does this number specifically tell us? It means that over the last 90 days, only a quarter or less of the top 100 altcoins have managed to post better performance figures than Bitcoin. This is a strong signal that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer in the recent past, attracting a larger share of investment and showing relative strength compared to the broader altcoin market. This isn’t just a random number; it reflects real capital movements and investor preferences over the preceding three months. During Bitcoin Season, it’s common to see Bitcoin’s market dominance (its percentage of the total crypto market cap) increase or remain high. Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Right Now? Several factors can contribute to a period of Bitcoin Season . Understanding these drivers helps paint a clearer picture of the current crypto market trends : Safe Haven Narrative: In times of market uncertainty or macroeconomic volatility, investors often flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as the most established and relatively ‘safer’ asset in the crypto space compared to more speculative altcoins. Institutional Interest: Significant institutional investment often targets Bitcoin first, especially through products like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Large capital inflows into these instruments directly boost Bitcoin’s price and can draw liquidity away from altcoins. Halving Cycles: The period following a Bitcoin halving event can sometimes see Bitcoin consolidate or make significant moves first, with altcoins potentially lagging before their own rally later. Dominance Rotation: Market cycles often involve a rotation of capital. Sometimes Bitcoin leads the charge, consolidating gains, and then capital rotates into larger cap altcoins, followed by smaller cap altcoins. Bitcoin Season can be the initial phase of this rotation. Liquidity Crunch: In less liquid market conditions, capital tends to concentrate in the most liquid assets, and Bitcoin is by far the most liquid cryptocurrency. The current environment likely involves a combination of these factors, making Bitcoin the preferred asset for many investors in the short to medium term. Navigating the Market: Implications of Bitcoin Season for Altcoins and Your Strategy If you are primarily invested in altcoins, the current Bitcoin Season can present challenges. Many altcoins may struggle to gain significant traction against Bitcoin, or even against the US dollar, while Bitcoin continues to perform relatively well. However, it also presents opportunities for a savvy crypto trading strategy . Challenges for Altcoin Holders: Underperformance: Your altcoin portfolio may underperform Bitcoin, leading to frustration. Increased Volatility: Altcoins can be more susceptible to sharp downturns when Bitcoin dips, often falling harder than BTC. Stagnation: Some altcoins might trade sideways or even decline while Bitcoin makes upward moves. Opportunities and Actionable Insights: Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be a good time to accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Focus on Bitcoin: Consider increasing your allocation to Bitcoin or focusing trading efforts on BTC pairs if you anticipate its dominance to continue. Research: Use this period to research projects with strong fundamentals that might lead the next altcoin rally. Risk Management: Given the increased risk for altcoins relative to Bitcoin, tight stop-losses and careful position sizing are essential. Consider Stablecoins: If uncertain, moving some capital into stablecoins is a valid strategy during periods of market uncertainty or strong Bitcoin dominance. Look for Outliers: Even during Bitcoin Season, some altcoins will still outperform. These are often driven by specific news, developments, or unique narratives. Identifying these requires diligent research. Understanding the difference between altcoin vs bitcoin performance is key. During Bitcoin Season, the correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin remains high, but the beta (the degree to which altcoins move relative to Bitcoin) often favors Bitcoin. When Might the Shift Occur? From Bitcoin Season Back to Altcoin Season Market cycles are fluid, and Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever. The transition back to Altcoin Season typically happens when certain conditions emerge: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a significant run-up, Bitcoin’s price might enter a period of consolidation. This allows capital that profited from the BTC rally to potentially rotate into altcoins seeking higher returns. Increased Risk Appetite: As market confidence grows, investors become more willing to take on the higher risk associated with altcoins in pursuit of larger gains. Major Altcoin Developments: Significant upgrades, launches, or positive news within major altcoin ecosystems (like Ethereum’s developments, Layer 2 growth, specific sector trends like DeFi, NFTs, AI coins) can attract significant capital. Narrative Shifts: New, compelling narratives can emerge around specific altcoin sectors or technologies, driving focused rallies. Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained period where Bitcoin’s market dominance starts to decline is a strong indicator that altcoins are beginning to outperform. There’s no fixed timeline for how long Bitcoin Season lasts. It could be weeks, months, or even longer. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index itself, along with Bitcoin dominance charts and overall market sentiment, helps identify potential shifts. Challenges and Limitations of the Altcoin Season Index While the Altcoin Season Index is a useful tool, it’s important to be aware of its limitations: Historical Data: The index is based on past performance (the last 90 days). The market can change rapidly, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Top 100 Focus: It only considers the top 100 coins. Many innovative or high-performing projects exist outside this list. Excludes Stablecoins/Wrapped Tokens: While necessary for its purpose, it doesn’t reflect the full breadth of the crypto market. Lagging Indicator: The 90-day lookback means it confirms a trend that has already been underway rather than predicting future movements. Doesn’t Differentiate Altcoins: The index treats all altcoins equally. Performance varies significantly between large-cap altcoins (like Ethereum) and small-cap altcoins. Therefore, the index should be used as one of many tools in your analysis, not the sole basis for your crypto trading strategy . Combine it with technical analysis, fundamental analysis of specific projects, and broader market sentiment. Comparing Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Here’s a quick comparison of the typical characteristics of each season: Characteristic Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Altcoin Season Index 25 or lower 75 or higher Bitcoin Performance Strong, often leading the market Consolidating or lagging behind altcoins Altcoin Performance Generally underperforming Bitcoin; some outliers Strong, often posting higher percentage gains than Bitcoin Market Dominance Bitcoin dominance tends to increase or stay high Bitcoin dominance tends to decrease Capital Flow Flows primarily into Bitcoin Flows from Bitcoin (or stablecoins) into altcoins Risk Appetite Lower; focus on ‘safer’ Bitcoin Higher; willingness to invest in more speculative altcoins Recognizing which season the market is in helps set realistic expectations for your portfolio’s performance and guides your approach to managing risk. Summary: Adapting to the Current Bitcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 25, clearly indicating that the crypto market is in Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin has been the dominant performer over the past 90 days, with most altcoins struggling to keep pace. This phase is often driven by factors like increased institutional interest, safe-haven demand, or capital rotation dynamics. For investors, this period highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between altcoin vs bitcoin performance. While it presents challenges for altcoin-heavy portfolios, it also offers opportunities for strategic accumulation, focusing on Bitcoin, and refining your crypto trading strategy . Remember that market conditions are constantly evolving, and while the index signals the current state, staying informed about broader crypto market trends and project-specific developments is vital for long-term success. Use the index as a guide, but always conduct your own research and manage your risk prudently.

His support helped close a $2.2 million convertible loan round , with the remaining $700,000 coming from other strategic backers. Health Tech Meets Bitcoin: A Surprising Treasury Shift On May 22, H100 Group confirmed the purchase of 4.39 BTC using excess liquidity , signaling a strategic pivot amidst financial pressures. In 2024, H100 reported a 38% revenue drop and a loss of 9.77 million SEK , prompting it to explore new avenues for financial resilience . But this move isn’t just about diversifying reserves. According to CEO Sander Andersen, Bitcoin aligns with H100’s mission of individual sovereignty, decentralization, and transparency —the same principles that drive its AI-powered digital health ecosystem. “Bitcoin is not just a hedge—it’s a cultural and strategic fit,” said Andersen. A Ripple Effect Beyond Tech Inspired by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, non-tech companies around the world are waking up to Bitcoin . From Latin America to Europe, BTC is making its way into diverse corporate treasuries. H100’s adoption shows the movement is expanding into sectors like healthcare , where Bitcoin’s core values deeply resonate. Currently, only 4.4% of Bitcoin’s supply is held by companies . But with figures like Adam Back stepping in, that number may rise fast. After the BTC announcement, H100’s stock jumped 37% , and another 5.33% the next day—despite still being 35% below its yearly high. What This Means for the Future Adam Back’s endorsement could signal a turning point in corporate Bitcoin adoption , especially outside the U.S. H100’s dual focus— digital healthcare and Bitcoin integration —is attracting attention from both investors and industry observers. It may well become a model for how mission-driven companies can blend technology, finance, and values into one strategy.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 05:51:23

ACEA data show that overall car sales in Europe dipped 0.3% year-on-year. Electric and plug-in hybrid models posted the strongest growth, helping to balance losses elsewhere. Tesla’s continuing slide in Europe reflects a shift away from the U.S. EV maker as competition from Chinese brands gains strength. Some buyers are also pushing back against Elon Musk’s political views. According to a Reuters report , European automakers are under pressure to lower local costs and face headwinds from U.S. tariffs on imports and a slowing global economy. The resulting uncertainty clouds the industry’s outlook despite easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. April registrations in the European Union, Britain, and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) fell to 1.07 million cars, after a 2.8% gain in March. Sales at state-owned SAIC Motor climbed 24.5%, while Mitsubishi rose 22.1% and Mazda fell 24.5%. Tesla’s deliveries in Europe have now dropped for four months straight, down 49% year-on-year, and its market share has nearly halved to 0.7% from 1.3%. EU car sales drop for fourth straight month Looking at the EU alone, total car sales fell 1.2% year-on-year, marking a fourth straight month of decline. Within that figure, registrations of battery electric vehicles (BEV) jumped 26.4%, plug-in hybrids (PHEV) gained 7.8%, and hybrid electrics (HEV) rose 20.8%. In April, electrified models accounted for 59.2% of all passenger car registrations, up from 47.7% a year earlier. Among major EU markets, Spain saw a 7.1% rise in sales and Italy 2.7%, while France and Germany recorded drops of 5.6% and 0.2% respectively. Europeans are buying more electric cars because of strict emissions rules and lower prices, even as trade tensions, slow overall sales, and possible factory closures threaten jobs.

In 2023, he said a sweeping political shift in Washington, DC, would be necessary to enact pro-industry legislation. That shift appeared to materialize following Donald Trump’s presidential victory last November. However, shortly after the election, Giancarlo quashed rumors that he would succeed outgoing Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. He also shot down reports that he was interested in a crypto-related role at the US Treasury.

In the United States, Bitcoin ETFs are on track for a record-breaking month , drawing $1.5 billion in inflows over just two days. On the regulatory front, the Senate passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. If enacted into law, the bill could further accelerate institutional adoption , according to DWF Labs managing partner Andrei Grachev. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rally to all-time highs has created a positive feedback loop where more institutions view BTC as a mature asset worthy of inclusion in modern portfolios, according to a recent report by Fidelity Digital Assets . Crypto also shows positive growth in places Sygnum is active, like Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. However, Sygnum’s CEO, Matthias Imbach, recently warned that the company’s native Switzerland may lose its competitive advantage as a crypto destination if it fails to keep innovating.

Meanwhile, analysts tracking on-chain activity suggest that the recent price pullback may have cleared the path for more sustainable market behavior. Related Reading: $200,000 Bitcoin ‘Is Real’ By Year-End, Says Top Researcher High Leverage Triggers Liquidations Below Key Support Levels Amr Taha, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlighted how Bitcoin’s price action flushed out over-leveraged traders while presenting an opportunity for long-term investors to reinforce their positions. His post titled “Late Longs Wiped Out — Long-Term Holders Seize the Opportunity to Accumulate Bitcoin” points to distinct market behavior unfolding in real time. Taha noted that Bitcoin’s recent drop below the psychological $111,000 threshold led to two significant long liquidation clusters on Binance. The first wave occurred around the $110,900 mark, wiping out over $97 million in long positions. Shortly after, a second wave hit as the price breached $109,000, resulting in a further $88 million in liquidated positions. These back-to-back events reflected cascading margin calls from traders using high leverage, a pattern often seen during sharp short-term corrections. Notably, liquidation clusters tend to emerge when rapid price movements force the automatic closure of margin positions, intensifying sell pressure in the process. This volatility tends to shake out speculative positions and can signal a temporary pause or consolidation phase in the broader trend. According to Taha, while the market absorbed these liquidations, it simultaneously witnessed a contrasting pattern among long-term holders (LTHs), who remained active throughout the volatility. Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Liquidations Unfold While short-term participants absorbed the brunt of the sell-off, LTHs appeared to interpret the price dip as a buying opportunity. Taha highlighted on-chain metrics showing that the LTH realized cap, a measure of the total value paid for held coins by long-term investors, has surged past $28 billion. This level had not been observed since April, reinforcing the narrative that seasoned market participants are increasing their exposure during moments of market dislocation. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going The behavior of long-term holders is often seen as a barometer for market health. Their steady accumulation during liquidation events suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value trajectory. Historically, accumulation by LTHs during volatile periods has coincided with later upward price expansions, as coins are removed from circulation and selling pressure is reduced. With leveraged positions reset and structural accumulation underway, the groundwork may be forming for Bitcoin to attempt another breakout beyond its previous highs.

The Indian crypto industry is actively engaging with the government, hoping to secure crucial tax relief that could redefine the future of cryptocurrency trading in the nation. Why is the Indian Crypto Industry Lobbying for Change? For a few years now, the crypto sector in India has operated under a stringent tax regime implemented in 2022. This policy included a flat 30% tax on capital gains from crypto assets and a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on every single transaction, regardless of profit or loss. The intention behind these measures was reportedly to deter illicit activities and bring clarity to the nascent sector. However, the industry quickly felt the pinch. The high tax burden, particularly the 1% TDS, made frequent trading significantly more expensive. This led to a dramatic exodus of trading volume from Indian exchanges to offshore platforms. Research by the Esya Centre highlighted this challenge, estimating that over 90% of Indian crypto trades migrated away. This outflow meant reduced revenue for Indian businesses, fewer opportunities for local innovation, and potentially less visibility for regulators into actual trading activity. What are the Proposed Changes to India Crypto Tax ? Industry leaders are not asking for a complete removal of taxes but rather a more balanced approach. A key proposal is to significantly reduce the Transaction Tax (TDS) from 1% to a much lower rate, perhaps 0.1%. Executives like Ashish Singhal, co-founder of the prominent Indian exchange CoinSwitch India , argue that a 0.1% TDS would still serve the government’s goal of tracking transactions effectively without placing an excessive burden on traders. A lower rate could incentivize users to return to regulated Indian platforms, providing regulators with better oversight. Is the Government’s Stance on Crypto Regulation India Softening? Reports suggest that there is indeed a more favorable environment emerging for dialogue between the government and the crypto sector. Industry executives have noted increased willingness from regulators to engage and understand the nuances of the digital asset space. This contrasts with previous periods where the official stance appeared more cautious or even skeptical. Several factors might be contributing to this potential shift: Global Trends: Many major economies are moving towards clearer regulatory frameworks rather than outright bans or punitive taxes. India might be observing these international developments. Industry Dialogue: Persistent engagement and education efforts by the Indian crypto industry seem to be bearing fruit, fostering better understanding among policymakers. Changing Geopolitical Landscape: Some reports suggest that the pro-crypto stance of global leaders, such as former U.S. President Donald Trump (mentioned in the original report), could indirectly influence perceptions and approaches internationally, including in India. While no concrete policy changes have been announced, the fact that regulators are reportedly engaging more closely with industry representatives like those from CoinSwitch India is seen as a positive sign. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Tax India ? The ongoing lobbying efforts represent a critical juncture for the Indian crypto market. A reduction in the transaction tax could have several positive outcomes: Bring Trading Back: A lower TDS could encourage traders who moved offshore to return to Indian exchanges, boosting liquidity and volume on regulated platforms. Boost Innovation: Increased activity and clearer rules could foster innovation within the domestic crypto and blockchain ecosystem. Increase Government Revenue: While the TDS rate would be lower, a higher volume of transactions on regulated platforms could potentially lead to greater overall tax collection from other sources like capital gains (though the 30% CGT remains a point of discussion). Improved Regulatory Oversight: Having trading activity concentrated on domestic, regulated exchanges provides regulators with better tools for monitoring and preventing illicit activities. The challenges remain significant. The government needs to balance the industry’s demands with its concerns about financial stability, investor protection, and preventing misuse of digital assets. However, the reported shift towards more open dialogue offers hope for a more balanced and pragmatic approach to crypto regulation India . Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for India’s Crypto Future The push by the Indian crypto industry for tax relief is gaining momentum, coinciding with what appears to be a more receptive government ear. The current high taxes, particularly the 1% TDS, have undeniably hindered domestic trading activity, pushing it towards less regulated offshore markets. Industry proposals, such as reducing the TDS to 0.1%, aim to strike a balance between effective tracking and fostering a healthy domestic market. While the path forward involves complex discussions around India crypto tax and broader crypto regulation India , the increased engagement between regulators and platforms like CoinSwitch India signals a potential turning point. Stakeholders across the board are watching closely, hoping that these dialogues will pave the way for policies that unlock the full potential of the digital asset space in India while addressing regulatory concerns.

Meanwhile, other firms are embracing Bitcoin. Paris-based Blockchain Group raised $72 million to buy 590 BTC, and plans to control 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2032. Similarly, Strategy—the largest corporate Bitcoin holder—added 4,020 BTC to its portfolio for $427.1 million, pushing its total stash to 580,250 BTC. However, executive stock sales and a securities fraud lawsuit weighed on Strategy’s share price. Trump Media Rejects Bitcoin Buying Rumors Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, denied reports that it is preparing to raise $3 billion to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The denial came in response to a May 26 article by the Financial Times, which referred to six sources who are familiar with the matter. Trump Media criticized the report by stating, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.” According to the Financial Times, Trump Media was allegedly planning to raise $2 billion through an equity offering and an additional $1 billion via convertible bonds—which are securities that can be converted into equity at a later stage. The proposed equity issuance was said to be pegged to the market price as of May 23, when shares of Trump Media (DJT) closed at $25.72, pushing the company’s market cap to $5.7 billion after a 4.6% daily increase. Trump Media share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) If the company actually followed through, the move would have made Trump Media part of the many other publicly traded firms like Strategy, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific that started accumulating Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset. These companies argue that crypto holdings serve as a hedge against inflation and a safeguard against becoming financially stagnant or obsolete. The rumour spread during a growing scrutiny over the Trump family's expanding involvement in the crypto space. Over the past few weeks, Democratic lawmakers raised concerns over what they view as potential conflicts of interest, particularly after Trump hosted a controversial “meme coin dinner” on May 22 that attracted a lot of media attention and protest. Trump’s crypto footprint includes various initiatives like non-fungible token (NFT) collections, the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins, a DeFi project called World Liberty Financial, and a dollar-pegged stablecoin. (Source: Bluesky ) Adding to the complexity, Trump reportedly transferred his 53% ownership in Trump Media to a revocable trust managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr., which raised even more questions about potential financial entanglements after Trump returned to office. Blockchain Group Raises $72M to Buy More Bitcoin While Trump Media made it very clear that it has no interest in buying crypto, the same cannot be said for other companies. Paris-based crypto firm Blockchain Group is expanding its Bitcoin treasury with a new €63.3 million ($72 million) bond sale, to purchase an additional 590 BTC. The announcement was made on May 26, and shared details about the firm’s goal of growing its Bitcoin reserves to 1,437 BTC. At current Bitcoin prices above $109,000, the funds raised could theoretically buy around 658 BTC, though only 95% of the proceeds are earmarked for Bitcoin purchases. The remainder is allocated to management fees and operational costs. The bulk of the bond sale was backed by Fulgur Ventures, which invested €55.3 million ($62.9 million), while Moonlight Capital added another €5 million ($5.7 million). The bonds are structured to be convertible into Blockchain Group shares at €3.809 ($4.34) each. Listed under the ticker ALTBG on Euronext Paris, Europe’s second-largest stock exchange, Blockchain Group has gained a lot of attention since it began acquiring Bitcoin on Nov. 5. After its initial Bitcoin purchase, the stock surged 225% to €0.48 ($0.52) and has soared by 766% year-to-date despite a 5.5% drop on May 26. According to its April 30 financial disclosure , the Blockchain Group reported a yield of over 709% from its Bitcoin holdings. However, the company’s total revenue for the 2024 fiscal year came in at €13.86 million ($15.8 million), which was down 32.1% from €20.4 million ($23.2 million) the year before. The firm also revealed an ambitious long-term objective of buying 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply by 2032, which would equate to more than 170,000 BTC. The Blockchain Group also joined the growing list of companies adopting a Bitcoin-focused treasury strategy. Swedish health tech firm H100 Group AB announced its own Bitcoin pivot on May 22, while Strive Asset Management declared on May 7 that it would also become a Bitcoin treasury company. Strategy Buys 4,020 More Bitcoin Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, also continued its aggressive accumulation strategy with a new purchase of 4,020 BTC for $427.1 million between May 19 and May 23. The company revealed the acquisition on May 26, and pointed out that the latest purchase was made at an average price of $106,237 per coin. This buy coincided with Bitcoin’s sharp rally past $110,000 on May 22. With this addition, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at a staggering 580,250 BTC, which was bought at a cumulative cost of approximately $40.6 billion. The average purchase price for its entire position sits at $69,979 per coin. Despite the bullish accumulation, internal stock sales by company executives have attracted some attention. Jarrod Patten, a director at Strategy, sold 2,650 shares of the company’s Class A stock between May 16 and 21, netting nearly $1.1 million. Since April 22, Patten sold 17,050 shares worth about $6.7 million in total. Meanwhile, Strategy CFO Andrew Kang sold 2,185 shares on May 23, generating proceeds of $719,447. These executive stock sales happened at a time when Strategy’s own shares ( MSTR ) faced sharp declines. After peaking at an all-time high of around $474 in November of 2024, MSTR dropped roughly 12% over the past week, trading down from approximately $420 to $369. Strategy stock price over the past 5 days (Source: TradingView ) The stock decline followed the filing of a class-action lawsuit on May 19, which accuses Strategy of securities fraud. The suit claims that the company misrepresented aspects of its Bitcoin investments, which allegedly led to investor losses in April of 2025.

This increase is largely attributed to a sudden tariff announcement by former President Donald Trump , which instigated concerns about a potential trade war, thus driving investors towards the relative safety of cryptocurrencies. Why Bitcoin Is Considered a Safe Haven The resilience of Bitcoin during times of economic uncertainty is not new. Historical precedents show its price resilience in face of geopolitical tensions, reflecting its role as a macroeconomic hedge. This inherent stability makes Bitcoin a preferred choice among investors during times of financial unpredictability.

Crypto YouTuber Lark Davis was among those who observed that “don’t really do anything” while Bitcoin hits a peak, retreats, and recovers. “That’s the state of the crypto market right now,” he said on X on May 26. It is true, the majority of altcoins are still way down from their peak prices during the last bull market in 2021, so when is altseason coming ? Altseason Coming Soon … Really The majority of analysts and crypto traders share the opinion that it won’t be long, looking at current market conditions. On May 27, Bitcoin OG Kyle Chassé said this altseason will be “epic,” but it won’t be like previous altseasons because there are just too many tokens for everything to go up. Coingecko currently lists more than 17,000 tokens, and CoinMarketCap has a whopping 16 million crypto tokens tracked . However, the vast majority of these are worthless meme coins on Solana and Base.

Some have disagreed, saying that nobody is interested in altcoins anymore. However, the trader replied that “institutions are coming for them,” especially those with real utility.

It hit its highest level since January 2021 on May 7 at 65.4% but has declined marginally since. Nevertheless, the metric has been in a clear uptrend since the beginning of 2023. Altcoins Not Ready to Pop Yet Crypto trader “Moustache” echoed the sentiment, stating that altcoins are “on the verge of a parabolic rally like in 2017 or 2021,” as chart patterns show major similarities from previous market cycles. #Altcoins Imagine you’re only in the early stages of an altseason.

The World Robot Competition Mecha Fighting Series had four human-controlled robots built by China-based firm Unitree compete in three, two-minute rounds with winners crowned through a points system, according to a May 26 report from the China state-owned outlet the Global Times. Chen Xiyun, a Unitree team member, said the “robots fight in a human-machine collaborative way,” with the machines pre-taught moves, but ultimately, a person controls the bot’s movements. The robots reportedly weighed 35 kilograms and stood 132 centimeters tall. Ahead of the boxing rounds, the pint-sized robots were put through tests to demonstrate a variety of kicks and punches and assist the organizers in refining the rules. The team with the highest points across the three rounds moves on to fight another opponent. A punch to the head was worth one point, and a kick to the head was worth three. Teams lost five points if their robot fell and 10 points if their robot was down for over eight seconds.

Among the contenders are Dogecoin (DOGE), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Mantix (MTX). Each offers unique advantages and challenges in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Understanding Dogecoin’s Position in the Market Dogecoin has maintained a cult status among meme coins, backed by a strong community. Yet, its recent price trends suggest a roller-coaster ride. According to recent price movements , Dogecoin's value has fluctuated between $0.211 and $0.259 over the past fortnight, indicating volatility that might not favor long-term gains unless influenced by major market movers like celebrity endorsements. Hyperliquid: The Rising Star in DeFi The DeFi sector is witnessing significant innovation, and Hyperliquid is at the forefront. With a focus on high-speed transactions and low fees, this platform has caught the attention of both users and investors. It has been reported that Hyperliquid's trading volume is soaring, potentially setting the stage for substantial short-term profits. However, with stiff competition in the DeFi market, it's uncertain how much room there is for growth. The Promise of Mantix: A Comprehensive Analysis Mantix is emerging as a formidable contender in the realm of decentralized exchanges. This platform distinguishes itself with features like AI-driven trading and a robust tokenomics structure promising scalable growth. Currently, in the initial phase of its presale, Mantix offers its tokens at just $0.02, a fact that might intrigue savvy investors about its future potential. Discover more about Mantix and its offerings on their official website . Investment Outlook: Which Cryptocurrency to Bet On? With Dogecoin's popularity, Hyperliquid's innovative approach, and Mantix's strategic market entry, investors are faced with varied options. While Dogecoin offers familiarity, Hyperliquid promises growth, and Mantix teases the possibility of high returns from a low entry point—making the decision all the more challenging.

As some established names like Solana (SOL) and Bittensor (TAO) face challenging times, a new player, Mantix, is making headlines with its promising entry into the market. The Current State of Solana and TAO Recently, Solana's market performance has been less than stellar. The cryptocurrency has seen its value decrease by nearly 8% in the past week, now trading around $177, which is below the previously breached $180 resistance mark. The technical analysis of Solana shows it trading beneath the Ichimoku cloud, indicating potential continued price weakness. The presence of a red and wide cloud suggests that the bearish trend might extend in the near future. Insights into TAO's Market Dynamics Moving to Bittensor (TAO), this crypto asset hasn't fared much better. Its price has dropped by about 10% recently, pushing it to around $442. This decline has taken TAO much closer to its $400 psychological support level. Despite the bearish market signals, some investors remain optimistic about TAO's future, though the weakening RSI divergence points towards a potential near-term price decline. Mantix: A New Contender in DeFi Amid these turbulent conditions, Mantix is emerging as a beacon for crypto investors. Stepping boldly into the DeFi sector, Mantix offers promising features such as cross-chain swaps, futures with up to 1000x leverage, and profit-sharing for token holders. Since the launch of its presale, Mantix has successfully raised over $600,000, with tokens priced at just $0.02. Its quick acceptance and integration within the Ethereum platform ensure high liquidity and swift transaction capabilities, which have been crucial in attracting an early following. Apart from its promising financial structure, Mantix is also commendable for its secure foundation. The project boasts an audited contract , ensuring safety and reliability for its investors. Comparative Analysis and Future Outlook While Solana and TAO are currently navigating through bearish trends, Mantix’s innovative approach and robust technological backing could potentially lead it to outperform these established players. If Mantix continues to develop its platform and maintain security standards, it might just redefine the DeFi landscape, offering substantial returns to its early adopters.

This move is crucial for the network’s evolution and signals upcoming enhancements that could redefine user and developer experiences on the platform. What is the Maxwell Hard Fork for BNB Chain? Before diving into the specifics of the Maxwell upgrade, let’s quickly touch upon what a hard fork entails in the context of a blockchain. A hard fork is essentially a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, or vice versa. It requires all users and nodes to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software. If a hard fork is not adopted by all participants, it can lead to a split in the blockchain, creating two separate chains. The Maxwell hard fork represents a planned and coordinated upgrade for the BNB Chain. Its primary goal is to introduce several technical improvements aimed at optimizing network performance and preparing it for future growth and increased adoption. Unlike contentious hard forks, this type of upgrade is designed to improve the existing chain collaboratively. Why is Testnet Activation a Crucial Step? The activation of the Maxwell hard fork didn’t happen directly on the main BNB Chain that millions of users interact with daily. Instead, it was first deployed on the network’s testnet. The Testnet activation phase is an absolutely critical step in the blockchain development lifecycle for several vital reasons: Risk Mitigation: Testnets are isolated environments that mimic the main network but use valueless tokens. This allows developers to deploy and test significant protocol changes like a hard fork without risking real user funds or disrupting live applications. Bug Identification: Complex software upgrades almost always have unforeseen issues. The testnet provides a safe space to identify and fix bugs, vulnerabilities, or performance bottlenecks before they can impact the main network. Community Readiness: Testnet deployment gives node operators, validators, developers building on the chain, and other ecosystem participants time to prepare for the mainnet upgrade. They can test their software, infrastructure, and applications against the new protocol rules. Performance Validation: It allows the core development team and the community to validate whether the intended improvements, such as reduced block times or enhanced scalability, actually work as expected under realistic simulated load conditions. Successfully deploying and running the Maxwell hard fork on the testnet is a strong indicator that the upgrade is stable and ready for the next phase – a potential mainnet deployment. Unpacking the Key Improvements of Maxwell According to reports, the Maxwell hard fork brings several significant technical enhancements to the BNB Chain. These improvements are designed to make the network faster, more efficient, and better equipped to handle a higher volume of transactions and decentralized applications (dApps). Let’s break down the key upgrades: Faster Block Time: Targeting 0.75 Seconds One of the most impactful changes introduced by Maxwell is the reduction in Block time . Block time refers to the average time it takes for the network to generate a new block of validated transactions and add it to the blockchain. A shorter block time generally means faster transaction confirmation times. The stated goal of reducing the block time to 0.75 seconds is a significant step. For context, the current average block time on BNB Smart Chain (BSC), a key part of the BNB Chain ecosystem, is typically around 3 seconds. Reducing this to 0.75 seconds would represent a roughly 75% decrease in the time it takes to produce a new block. This has direct implications for the speed at which transactions are processed and confirmed on the network, leading to a more responsive user experience for dApps, DeFi protocols, and everyday transfers. Support for Producing 16 Consecutive Blocks Another notable improvement is the enhanced capability for validators to produce up to 16 consecutive blocks. In many blockchain protocols, validators (or miners) take turns proposing and validating blocks. Limiting the number of consecutive blocks a single validator can produce is often a measure to promote decentralization and prevent potential malicious behavior. Allowing validators on the BNB Chain to produce more consecutive blocks, specifically up to 16, can contribute to increased transaction throughput and potentially smoother block production, especially during periods of high network activity. This change, combined with the reduced block time, aims to optimize the flow of transactions through the network. Enhanced Network Scalability Ultimately, the combination of faster block times and the ability to produce more consecutive blocks points towards the overarching goal of enhanced Scalability . Scalability is a critical challenge for many blockchain networks, referring to their ability to handle a growing number of transactions and users without sacrificing performance or increasing fees prohibitively. By making the block production process faster and more efficient, the Maxwell hard fork aims to increase the overall transaction processing capacity of the BNB Chain. This is essential for supporting the increasing demand from existing dApps, attracting new projects, and accommodating a larger user base. Improved scalability means the network can potentially handle more transactions per second, reduce congestion, and keep transaction costs (gas fees) relatively low, even as network usage grows. Here’s a quick summary of the key improvements: Reduced Block Time: From ~3 seconds to target 0.75 seconds. Consecutive Blocks: Support for up to 16 consecutive blocks per validator. Overall Goal: Enhanced network scalability and throughput. What Do These Changes Mean for BNB Chain Users and Developers? While these improvements sound technical, they translate into tangible benefits for those interacting with the BNB Chain: Faster Transactions: Users will likely experience quicker confirmation times for transfers, swaps on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and interactions with dApps. Improved dApp Performance: Applications built on BNB Chain, especially those requiring frequent interactions, should feel more responsive. Lower Potential Congestion: Increased scalability helps the network better handle traffic spikes, potentially reducing instances of high fees or delayed transactions during peak times. More Headroom for Growth: The enhanced capacity makes the BNB Chain a more attractive platform for developers looking to build high-throughput applications, fostering ecosystem growth. For developers, the improved infrastructure means a more robust and efficient environment to deploy and scale their applications. This can lead to better user experiences within their dApps and potentially lower operational costs related to network interactions. The Road Ahead: From Testnet to Mainnet The successful Testnet activation of the Maxwell hard fork is a major milestone, but it’s not the final step. The next phase involves rigorous testing and monitoring on the testnet to ensure stability and identify any remaining issues. The BNB Chain core development team will gather feedback and data from the testnet environment. If the testnet phase proves successful and the upgrade is deemed stable and safe, the community will likely prepare for a mainnet hard fork activation. This process involves coordinating all network participants – including validators, exchanges, wallets, and dApp providers – to upgrade their software simultaneously by a specific block height. The transition from testnet to mainnet is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning and execution. However, the successful testnet deployment indicates strong progress towards bringing these valuable improvements to the live BNB Chain network. Conclusion: A Leap Forward for BNB Chain Scalability The activation of the Maxwell hard fork on the BNB Chain testnet marks a crucial step in the network’s continuous evolution. By focusing on reducing Block time to an ambitious 0.75 seconds and enhancing the validator’s ability to produce consecutive blocks, the upgrade directly addresses the vital need for increased Scalability in the blockchain space. This successful Testnet activation phase is essential for proving the stability and effectiveness of these changes before they are potentially rolled out to the main network. The Maxwell hard fork holds the promise of delivering a faster, more efficient, and more robust platform for users and developers alike, positioning BNB Chain for continued growth and adoption in the competitive decentralized landscape.

XRP, Solana, and Hyperliquid are making waves again, and there’s solid reason to believe this may be the start of something bigger. According to Altcoin Buzz analyst Maddie , from the YouTube channel Altcoin Buzz, whale activity is often a strong signal ahead of a breakout. In this roundup, we dive into three altcoins—XRP, Solana, and Hyperliquid, which are seeing major whale activity, and explore why these tokens are catching big players’ attention. XRP and Solana: Steady Movers in the Top 10 XRP and Solana are both ranked in the top 10 cryptos by market cap. XRP currently holds around $92 billion, while Solana leads with $137 billion. Since the start of 2025, XRP has gained about 12% , but Solana is still down over 7%. However, looking at the last 90 days, Solana has made a strong comeback with a 25% rise, while XRP has only gained around 1.5%. Recent whale moves suggest growing interest in both tokens. Over $500 million worth of XRP has been moved across exchanges. This comes as Ripple works on a potential $11 billion deal to acquire Circle , the USDC issuer. If successful, it could make Ripple a major player in the stablecoin game. 639,887 #SOL (108,640,417 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/1IiG27Ypap — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 21, 2025 Meanwhile, Solana is gaining traction after its recent “Accelerate” event. Nearly $485 million worth of SOL was moved by whales, showing confidence in the chain’s growing DeFi and Real-World Asset (RWA) use cases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Ethereum and XRP Price Prediction For This Week: Is Another Rally Coming? , Hyperliquid (HYPE): New Highs and Strong Momentum Hyperliquid is another altcoin that’s turning heads. The token just hit a new all-time high of $39.80 after a 12% weekend rally. It’s now in price discovery mode, but with RSI at 86, some traders are being cautious of a possible pullback. Still, whales are stacking. Five large wallets scooped up nearly $28 million worth of HYPE recently, suggesting that many are betting on a $50–$100 range in the near future. Interestingly, HYPE whales are finally taking profits after 5 months. They started selling off 395k tokens at $36.69, making $14.51M so far. That’s a $28.4M profit on initial investment. Trust Wallet: More Than Just a Wallet Interestingly, whales are also using Trust Wallet as a smart yield tool. It’s new “Stablecoin Earn” feature offers up to 7% APY on coins like USDT, USDC, and DAI across multiple blockchains. With over $20 million in TVL already, it’s becoming a key tool for whales looking to earn passive income while waiting for the next big move. From large-cap names like XRP and Solana to rising stars like Hyperliquid, whales are quietly positioning themselves. For investors watching closely, this might just be a hint at which altcoins are gearing up for a breakout. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It’s no news that cryptocurrency investors are always searching for high-potential altcoins to buy. And $MTX is turning investors’ heads, making them consider their investment decisions in SUI and AVAX. Although Sui (SUI) and Avalanche (AVAX) were once top investment choices, the tokens seem to have run out of momentum. With no major upgrades, enthusiasm or utility, SUI and AVAX’s outlook is bearish. BanklessTimes , a crypto update platform, predicted a bearish outlook for the Avalanche price: “Avalanche price has remained in a technical bear market after crashing by over 30% from its highest level in December. The AVAX token crashed to $36 as other cryptocurrencies plunged. The outlook isn’t looking good.” So why is Mantix making investors excited? A Revolutionary Dex Unlike typical decentralised exchanges, Mantix offers a clear vision and ready-to-deploy utility. It offers every utility a trader can ever dream of: cross-chain swaps, bridge, deep liquidity and stake across different blockchain networks all at a low fee. It also offers up to 1000x leverage for futures traders, a feature typically reserved for centralised platforms like Binance or BitMEX, but now fully decentralised. Revenue-sharing and governance perks Mantix isn’t just a regular Dex; it’s built on transparency and decentralised governance, prioritising its community. Mantix’s native token, $MTX, functions beyond a trading token; it’s a utility and governance asset. Presale buyers and early holders will benefit from a revenue-sharing model they will earn passively by holding a token and participating on the platform. This is a fantastic offer to Sui (SUI) and Avalanche (AVAX) investors, who are used to staking and participating in risky liquidity pools before earning. Mantix is built on decentralised governance, holders can vote and participate in decisions about the platform’s future upgrades and direction. The bigger your $MTX bag, the greater your voting power. Mantix is transparent and there’s no risk of whales manipulating the $MTX price or making decisions in the dark. Scarcity, burns and long-term sustainability The Mantix presale is pegged at a fixed supply of 1.2 billion tokens. With a $10 million soft cap and a $30 million hard cap, the ICO is designed for long-term sustainability. Furthermore, Mantix’s token burn mechanisms and buybacks from trading revenues will help control supply, which will cause scarcity over time and increase the token price. $MTX is clearly a better option than SUI and AVAX. You are still early. Join the $MTX presale now at $0.02 before the 100x surge!

As some established names like Solana (SOL) and Bittensor (TAO) face challenging times, a new player, Mantix, is making headlines with its promising entry into the market. The Current State of Solana and TAO Recently, Solana's market performance has been less than stellar. The cryptocurrency has seen its value decrease by nearly 8% in the past week, now trading around $177, which is below the previously breached $180 resistance mark. The technical analysis of Solana shows it trading beneath the Ichimoku cloud, indicating potential continued price weakness. The presence of a red and wide cloud suggests that the bearish trend might extend in the near future. Insights into TAO's Market Dynamics Moving to Bittensor (TAO), this crypto asset hasn't fared much better. Its price has dropped by about 10% recently, pushing it to around $442. This decline has taken TAO much closer to its $400 psychological support level. Despite the bearish market signals, some investors remain optimistic about TAO's future, though the weakening RSI divergence points towards a potential near-term price decline. Mantix: A New Contender in DeFi Amid these turbulent conditions, Mantix is emerging as a beacon for crypto investors. Stepping boldly into the DeFi sector, Mantix offers promising features such as cross-chain swaps, futures with up to 1000x leverage, and profit-sharing for token holders. Since the launch of its presale, Mantix has successfully raised over $600,000, with tokens priced at just $0.02. Its quick acceptance and integration within the Ethereum platform ensure high liquidity and swift transaction capabilities, which have been crucial in attracting an early following. Apart from its promising financial structure, Mantix is also commendable for its secure foundation. The project boasts an audited contract , ensuring safety and reliability for its investors. Comparative Analysis and Future Outlook While Solana and TAO are currently navigating through bearish trends, Mantix’s innovative approach and robust technological backing could potentially lead it to outperform these established players. If Mantix continues to develop its platform and maintain security standards, it might just redefine the DeFi landscape, offering substantial returns to its early adopters.

The upcoming expiry has nearly $14 billion in options set to impact the market, potentially introducing volatility that could shape Bitcoin's pricing. As Bitcoin navigates through these crucial times, a specific price point, $107,000, is predicted to form a resistance level. This anticipation has led to a shift in the investment pattern, where traders are diversifying their portfolios by exploring emerging platforms like Mantix , which promises innovative DeFi solutions. Anticipating Volatility: Bitcoin's Critical Week Ahead On the brink of the largest monthly options expiry of 2025, Bitcoin's price fluctuated around $108,000 on May 24. According to derivatives data from Laevitas.ch , with over $13.8 billion worth of Bitcoin options preparing to expire on May 30, traders and bulls are in a tug-of-war, pushing for a price position over $110,000. The market's current state shows bullish dominance, with Bitcoin's price increasing by 25% in the last 30 days. This surge has caught bearish traders off-guard, leading to a reevaluation of strategies across futures and options markets. Despite bullish efforts, the possibility of a downturn remains, prompting some investors to turn their sights towards newer and potentially more stable ventures like Mantix. The Rising Appeal of Mantix Among Crypto Traders Mantix is carving its niche in the decentralized trading market with features like 1000x leveraged futures and enhanced cross-chain exchanges. The platform's core, the $MTX token, extends governance rights and financial benefits, making it an attractive alternative amid uncertain Bitcoin forecasts. The governance model of Mantix not only fosters community involvement and trust but also propels the project's growth through strategic fee-based buybacks. This model contrasts sharply with Bitcoin, which is currently grappling with price consolidation and inherent volatility. With its promising framework and investor-friendly model, Mantix is poised to outshine traditional crypto entities, especially as Bitcoin encounters critical resistance at $107,000. Emphasizing the potential of Mantix and its early investment opportunities, the first stage of its presale is already underway, with tokens priced attractively at $0.02. This presents a lucrative opportunity for forward-thinking investors. Learn more about this burgeoning trading platform at Mantix .

Ever wondered how traditional finance might blend with the decentralized world you love? Well, buckle up, because the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is having some pretty significant conversations that could shape the future of finance, particularly concerning tokenized securities . Recently, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force sat down with major players like Nasdaq , alongside crypto innovators Plume Network and Etherealize. The hot topic? Exploring how public blockchains can become the backbone for issuing and trading securities that are represented as digital tokens. This isn’t just theoretical chat; these firms came prepared with concrete proposals. Understanding Tokenized Securities: What’s the Buzz? Before we dive into the details of the meeting, let’s quickly touch upon what tokenized securities actually are. Imagine traditional assets like stocks, bonds, or even real estate, but represented by digital tokens on a blockchain. This process, known as tokenization, aims to bring the benefits of blockchain technology – like increased efficiency, liquidity, transparency, and fractional ownership – to regulated financial markets. The potential is huge, but so are the regulatory questions. How do existing securities laws apply? How do you ensure investor protection in a decentralized environment? These are exactly the kinds of challenges the SEC and the industry are trying to navigate together. Pushing for a Regulatory Sandbox: Testing the Waters One key proposal that emerged from all three participants – Nasdaq , Plume Network, and Etherealize – was the idea of creating a regulatory sandbox . Think of a sandbox as a controlled environment where companies can test innovative financial products and services based on blockchain technology under slightly more flexible oversight from the regulator. Why a sandbox? Because the current regulatory framework, largely designed for traditional finance, doesn’t always fit neatly with the unique characteristics of blockchain and digital assets. A sandbox allows firms to experiment, demonstrate the technology’s capabilities and risks, and work closely with the SEC to figure out how best to apply or adapt regulations without immediately facing the full weight of complex rules. It’s a way to learn by doing, which is crucial for rapidly evolving tech like blockchain. Nasdaq’s Vision: An ATS-Digital Platform The world-renowned stock exchange operator, Nasdaq , wasn’t just there to listen; they presented their own ambitious plan. Nasdaq proposed launching a platform they’re calling “ATS-Digital.” An ATS, or Alternative Trading System, is essentially a venue for matching buyers and sellers of securities. Nasdaq’s vision is an ATS specifically designed to handle digital assets. This platform would allow firms to list not only digital asset investment contracts (which could include tokenized securities) but also potentially commodity-style tokens. This suggests a desire to create a regulated marketplace that bridges the gap between traditional securities and certain types of digital assets. To make this happen smoothly, Nasdaq also called for a joint safe harbor with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). A safe harbor would provide temporary relief from certain regulatory requirements, giving firms time to develop and operate while regulators figure out the long-term rules, especially important where asset classification (security vs. commodity) is ambiguous. Plume Network on Real-World Assets and Law Reform Plume Network brought the focus squarely onto real-world assets (RWAs). RWAs are physical or intangible assets that exist outside of the blockchain but are represented on-chain as tokens. Examples include real estate, art, company equity, credit, or even intellectual property. Plume highlighted that permissionless blockchains (like Ethereum or others where anyone can participate) are ideally suited for RWA tokenization due as they offer transparency and accessibility. Plume didn’t stop there. They went further, recommending significant updates to foundational U.S. securities laws – specifically the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Their argument is that these laws need to be modernized to effectively accommodate decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and promote what they called “credible neutrality” in regulation. Credible neutrality implies rules that are applied fairly and predictably, without favoring specific technologies or market participants. Etherealize’s Call for Blockchain as Shareholder Registry Rounding out the industry perspectives, Etherealize presented proposals focused on core corporate functions. They urged the SEC to formally recognize secure blockchains as official shareholder registries. Traditionally, tracking who owns shares in a company is done through centralized databases and intermediaries. Using a blockchain could potentially make this process more transparent, immutable, and efficient. Furthermore, Etherealize supported the use of smart contracts for automating corporate actions. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. For tokenized securities, smart contracts could automatically handle tasks like distributing dividends to token holders or facilitating shareholder voting, potentially reducing administrative overhead and increasing efficiency. The SEC’s Response and What Comes Next According to the report, the SEC is currently reviewing these various proposals. This engagement, initiated by the SEC’s own Crypto Task Force, signals a proactive (though cautious) approach from the regulator towards understanding and potentially integrating blockchain technology into traditional financial markets. It shows they are listening to industry concerns and exploring pathways forward, even if the path is complex and fraught with regulatory hurdles. While the creation of a full-fledged regulatory sandbox or significant law reform won’t happen overnight, these discussions are crucial first steps. They open the door for continued dialogue and potential future policy developments that could pave the way for the wider adoption of tokenized securities and real-world assets on the blockchain. The journey towards integrating blockchain into traditional finance is long and requires careful consideration of investor protection, market integrity, and systemic risk. However, the fact that major players like Nasdaq are engaging directly with the SEC on these topics, alongside innovative crypto firms, is a positive sign for the evolution of both industries. We’ll be keeping a close eye on how the SEC responds to these proposals and what steps are taken next in exploring the exciting potential of tokenized securities and real-world assets .

But what’s driving these big price changes? A new update from Glassnode, a leading blockchain data firm, helps explain. It shows how the two main types of buyers, long-term believers and first-time investors are play very different roles in the market. And yes, emotions are still a big part of the story, too. Why Conviction Buyers Matter at Turning Points Glassnode’s latest analysis looks at investor behavior using spending patterns on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ERC-20 tokens. According to the data, conviction buyers and first-time buyers play very different roles. Conviction buyers are long-term believers. They don’t get shaken during downturns. In fact, Glassnode shows that these buyers usually appear around market bottoms, when fear is at its highest. In bull markets, they help by buying the dips, preventing steep pullbacks, and adding support during minor corrections. Understanding who is behind price moves is critical to navigating market cycles. This new visualization, based on spending patterns, reveals how investor behavior shapes trend reversals and continuation – available across $BTC , $ETH , and #ERC20 tokens. For example: pic.twitter.com/sDsLQ0Cvml — glassnode (@glassnode) May 26, 2025 But conviction alone isn’t enough to push prices higher. For that, you need something else, fresh demand. First-Time Buyers Push Prices Higher To get a strong rally, Glassnode says you need “First-Time Buyers.” These are people who are buying Bitcoin or Ethereum for the first time. When lots of new buyers come in, they bring fresh money into the market, and that’s what often causes prices to rise fast. For example, from July to December 2024 and again from March to May 2025, Glassnode saw a big jump in these new buyers. Both times, Bitcoin’s price went up quickly afterward. This shows how powerful new demand can be. Emotions Still Rule the Market Even though charts and data are helpful, most traders still act based on emotion. Many retail traders follow fear, hype, or social media buzz. On the other hand, professional market makers use this emotional trading to their advantage. That’s why Glassnode created something called the “FOMOmeter.” It helps track when traders are getting too excited or too scared.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 07:15:11

A key area gaining global attention is the regulation of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value. Recently, a significant development occurred that could shape the future of digital finance in the country: the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) has signaled its intent to prioritize and push for clear policies around stablecoins. This move is crucial for market participants and observers interested in the direction of South Korea stablecoin regulation . Why is Korea Crypto Policy Focusing on Stablecoins? Stablecoins play a vital role in the crypto ecosystem, acting as a bridge between volatile digital assets and traditional fiat currencies. They are used extensively for trading, lending, and increasingly, payments. However, their rapid growth has also highlighted potential risks, including lack of transparency regarding reserves, potential for market instability (as seen with algorithmic stablecoin collapses), and use in illicit finance. For a nation like South Korea, with a robust and active crypto market, establishing a clear framework is essential for several reasons: Market Stability: Ensuring stablecoins are truly stable and backed appropriately prevents contagion risk to the broader crypto market and potentially the traditional financial system. Consumer Protection: Clear rules protect users from fraudulent stablecoin projects and the risks associated with poorly managed reserves. Financial Sovereignty: As stated by the DPK, developing domestic stablecoin policies is seen as key to preserving national currency sovereignty in an increasingly digital world. Innovation Promotion: A clear legal framework removes uncertainty, encouraging legitimate businesses to build and innovate using stablecoins within South Korea. Global Alignment: Major jurisdictions like the EU and the US are actively developing stablecoin regulations. Aligning with global standards is important for international competitiveness and interoperability. This focus indicates a maturing perspective on digital assets within the political landscape, moving beyond simply addressing risks to actively building a framework for growth and integration. What Did the DPK Crypto Initiative Reveal? The Democratic Party of Korea’s position was highlighted at a significant policy forum held on May 27th. The venue itself was notable – the headquarters of Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest crypto exchanges, operated by Dunamu. This choice of location underscores the party’s direct engagement with key industry players. Attendees at the forum included: Ahn Do-geol, Senior Vice Chairman of the DPK’s Economic Growth Committee Lee Sirgoo, CEO of Dunamu (Upbit operator) Lee Jae-won, CEO of Bithumb (another major exchange) Kim Jae-jin, Standing Vice Chairman of DAXA (Digital Asset eXchange Association) The presence of senior party officials alongside the heads of the country’s leading exchanges and their industry association signifies a serious intent to collaborate and understand the practical implications of future policies. The discussions reportedly centered on developing policies that: Encourage Healthy Market Growth: This suggests a desire to create an environment where legitimate crypto businesses, including those utilizing stablecoins, can thrive under clear rules. Protect Users: This is a consistent theme in crypto regulation globally, focusing on preventing fraud, ensuring transparency, and providing recourse for investors. Preserve National Currency Sovereignty: This points towards potential considerations for how foreign stablecoins operate within Korea and the potential role of Korean Won-backed stablecoins or even a future central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the ecosystem. Drive Innovation: Regulation is not just about restriction; effective policy can provide the certainty needed for innovation to flourish responsibly. Establish a Legal Framework: The clear recognition of the need for specific stablecoin legislation, not just shoehorning them into existing financial laws. This meeting serves as a concrete step in the legislative process, moving from general discussion to specific policy formulation with direct input from the industry. Understanding the Potential Scope of Stablecoin Law Korea While specific details of the DPK’s proposed legislation are yet to be fully unveiled, the stated goals provide strong clues about the likely direction of stablecoin law Korea . Based on global trends and the concerns raised, potential areas of focus could include: Policy Area Potential Measures Definition & Classification Legally defining stablecoins; distinguishing between different types (fiat-backed, crypto-backed, algorithmic); classifying them as securities, payment instruments, or a new category. Reserve Requirements & Transparency Mandating what assets can back stablecoins (e.g., cash, short-term government bonds); requiring regular audits by independent third parties; public disclosure of reserve composition. Licensing & Authorization Requiring stablecoin issuers and potentially service providers (like custodians) to obtain specific licenses; setting minimum capital requirements. Consumer Protection Rules around disclosure of risks; segregation of customer funds; mechanisms for redemption; dispute resolution processes. Interoperability & Systemic Risk Considering how stablecoins interact with the traditional financial system; addressing potential concentration risks if one stablecoin becomes dominant. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) Applying existing or new AML/CTF obligations to stablecoin issuers and platforms. The interaction with the industry leaders suggests that the DPK is likely seeking input on how to implement these measures effectively without stifling the very innovation they aim to foster. The balance between robust regulation and supporting technological advancement will be key. How Does This Relate to Broader Crypto Regulation South Korea ? This focus on stablecoins is not happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger, ongoing effort to refine crypto regulation South Korea . The country already has frameworks in place, particularly concerning exchanges and AML/CTF compliance, largely overseen by the Financial Services Commission (FSC). However, the regulatory landscape has been evolving, with discussions around areas like token classification, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and decentralized finance (DeFi). The push for specific stablecoin legislation indicates that policymakers view stablecoins as a distinct category requiring tailored rules, potentially due to their unique role as a value peg and their potential interaction with traditional money. This move by the DPK, as a major political party, suggests that stablecoin regulation is moving up the legislative agenda. While the ruling party’s stance is also critical, the DPK’s public commitment adds significant momentum and brings the issue into sharper focus for the National Assembly. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges Ahead? Implementing comprehensive stablecoin regulation offers several potential benefits for South Korea: Increased Confidence: A clear framework can attract more institutional investors and cautious retail users into the regulated crypto space. Reduced Risk: Strong rules on reserves and transparency minimize the likelihood of stablecoin failures impacting users. Enhanced Reputation: Robust regulation can position South Korea as a leader in responsible crypto innovation. Level Playing Field: Clear rules create certainty for businesses, fostering fair competition. However, challenges remain: Balancing Act: Crafting rules that protect without being overly burdensome or stifling innovation. Cross-Border Issues: Regulating stablecoins issued in other jurisdictions but used in Korea. Technological Pace: Keeping regulation relevant in a rapidly changing technological environment. Enforcement: Effectively monitoring and enforcing compliance with new rules. The collaboration seen at the forum suggests an attempt to navigate these challenges by involving those directly affected by the regulation. Actionable Insights for the Market For anyone involved in the South Korean crypto market – whether as an investor, a business, or a developer – the DPK’s initiative is a signal to pay close attention. Key takeaways include: Stay Informed: Follow legislative developments closely. The specifics of the proposed laws will significantly impact how stablecoins can be used, issued, and traded. Prepare for Changes: Businesses dealing with stablecoins should anticipate requirements around licensing, reserves, reporting, and compliance. Understand Risks: Even with regulation, understanding the specific mechanisms and risks of individual stablecoins remains crucial for investors. Engage (if possible): Industry participants may have opportunities to provide feedback on proposed regulations. This push by the DPK is not just political posturing; it represents a tangible step towards creating a more defined legal environment for a critical component of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Step Towards Regulatory Clarity The Democratic Party of Korea’s announced focus on stablecoin policy marks a significant moment for the country’s digital asset landscape. By prioritizing the development of a clear legal framework, the DPK aims to simultaneously foster healthy market growth, protect users, and safeguard national financial interests. The engagement with leading figures from Upbit, Bithumb, and DAXA at the recent forum underscores a collaborative approach to tackling this complex issue. While the specifics of the future South Korea stablecoin regulation are still being formed, this initiative signals a strong political will to bring clarity and stability to the use of stablecoins, aligning Korea with global regulatory trends and paving the way for potentially broader adoption and innovation within a regulated environment.

The regulator laid out clear rules on G-Tokens, emphasizing that the intention is not to use them for trading like other cryptocurrencies, per a Bangkok Post report . “We want to ensure that G-Token serves as a useful, technology-driven investment innovation — not merely a speculative tool,” SEC secretary-general Pornanong Budsaratragoon said. On May 13, Thailand’s Ministry of Finance announced the launch of $150 million worth of digital investment tokens , to allow the general public to purchase government bonds via blockchain-based tokens. G-Token will be the first government-issued digital token to raise public funds and help cover its budget deficit. G-Token to Be Issued Through IPO Jomkwan Kongsakul, SEC’s deputy secretary-general, noted that the government tokens would be issued via an initial coin offering (ICO) portal. The Finance Ministry would serve as the registrar, she said. The SEC further said that the official launch is scheduled for July this year, and details, including interest rate, maturity, and collateral, will be announced before the launch. Besides, the regulator held public talks on the regulatory framework of G-Token to gather feedback, with a 15-day window. “Unlike government bonds or equities, a G-Token is not a debt instrument, and therefore it falls under the Digital Asset Act, not traditional public debt laws,” Jomkwan Kongsakul, deputy secretary-general of the SEC noted. Investors having digital wallets with authorized crypto exchanges can directly invest in G-Token, the rules read. Meanwhile, for investors using security firms as intermediaries, the firm will keep custody of the token. Thailand is set to launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens, marking a step toward financial inclusivity for retail investors. #Thailand #SEC https://t.co/2akullmpsP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 Thailand’s Digital Bond Tokens Tradable on Secondary Market Jomkwan noted that these tokens can be tradeable on a secondary market. This provides investors “with options to either trade or hold until maturity.” “This structure offers exit opportunities while maintaining a savings-oriented investment approach,” she added. The SEC will be responsible for the supervision of G-Token trading in the secondary market. Besides, the regulator will focus on anti-market manipulation measures, trading transparency, and investor protection.

The plan was announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira during an investment seminar in Bangkok on May 26, according to reports from Bangkok Post and The Nation . The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases. Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place. “This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.

Pichai said the government needs to unify the legal treatment of the traditional capital market and the digital asset space, which are currently governed by separate acts. Pichai also said the government is reviewing outdated restrictions on institutional investors as part of broader capital market reform. Life insurers and large funds holding hundreds of billions of Thai baht are restricted to government bonds. Upcoming changes may open more funds to equities and private sector assets.

He mentioned the rollout of “G-Tokens,” a blockchain-based initiative aiming to allow retail investors to buy government bonds in fractional units. These tokens, he said, are expected to improve returns for savers and raise the global profile of Thai sovereign debt. On May 13, the Ministry of Finance announced plans to issue $150 million worth of digital investment tokens that allow retail investors to buy government bonds. This came after the country’s securities regulator revealed plans to launch a tokenized securities trading system for institutional investors back in February. In March, the Thai SEC also approved Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) for cryptocurrency trades, allowing the stablecoins to be listed on regulated exchanges across the country.

Cardano (ADA), continues to attract attention due to its strong development roadmap and increasing DeFi adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE), is riding a wave of meme momentum, but its lack of real utility raises questions. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi-powered newcomer rapidly gaining traction for its innovative lending protocol and viral presale performance. The MUTM presale has attracted over 12,000 participants ahead of a token price to rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 100% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. The race to $5 is heating up, and as these three coins are leading the charge in very different ways, Mutuum Finance is likely to hit $5 faster. Cardano and Dogecoin: Diverging Paths Under $1 with Big Potential Cardano (ADA) near $0.75 trading is investors’ bet that appreciates scalable blockchain platforms and smart contract products led by ongoing network upgrades and rising DeFi usage. Dogecoin (DOGE) near $0.22 trading, however, still depends on its strong community and social media frenzy, but its future hinges more on investor sentiment than intrinsic utility. Both tokens have distinctive value offerings in the sub-$1 altcoin market and are attractive to other categories of investors as the market gets set for the next big rally. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also joins this crowded landscape with robust initial velocity. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.3 million and accumulated 12,000 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Certik Audit Officially Completed, Stablecoin Secures Trust and Stability Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified complete by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. While Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) each bring their unique strengths to the table, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the most promising contender to reach $5 first from under $1. Over $9.3 million has been raised and 12,000 investors already on board during its presale. Current presale prices near $0.03, poised to rise to $0.035 in the next phase, offer early investors up to 100% gains ahead of the official launch price of $0.06.

While this new ATH excites investors and the market, there are many speculations about the source of the record. While some analysts attribute the decline to US President Donald Trump's decision to begin ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine, others attribute it to increased corporate demand and macroeconomic factors. André Dragosch, Head of European Research at Bitwise, argued that the recent rally was due to ongoing problems in the Japanese bond market. Pointing out that risks in Japanese government bonds have increased, Dragosch noted that the 30-year yield on government bonds reached an all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025. “Government bonds are often considered safe haven assets. But when yields rise sharply, it usually signals investor concerns about fiscal sustainability and the country’s ability to repay its debts. At this point, instability in Japan’s bond market has increased credit risk concerns and led to greater Bitcoin adoption among TradFi participants. Because Bitcoin is an immutable asset. It is free from counterparty risk. It is a hedge against sovereign risk and sovereign default.” The Bitwise executive finally added that if the risk concerns in sovereign bonds of Japan and other countries continue to increase, the Bitcoin price could reach $200,000 in the long term. *This is not investment advice.

HYPE price is currently taking a breather, down 2% over the past 24 hours and trading around $37.50. While it’s too early to call the next move, it appears to be entering a consolidation phase because the RSI is deep in the overbought zone at 77. However, the underlying trend remains strong. The EMA 20 remains above the SMA 50, with the bullish crossover holding since mid-April. Trading volume stands at $358 million, still significant though down 25% over the past day, indicating cooled momentum in the short term.

Russia ‘s state-controlled lender Sberbank is getting ready to play a bigger role in the country’s crypto scene by acting as a market maker and providing liquidity on the new regulated crypto platforms that are expected to launch soon. Alexander Zozulya, head of global markets at Sberbank, told local media that the lender will be present as a liquidity provider and market maker on Russian regulated platforms, where super-qualified investors will be allowed to conduct operations directly with cryptocurrencies. The move comes as Russia’s central bank pushes ahead with its experimental legal regime for crypto trading. The Bank of Russia wants crypto operations to happen within a legal “sandbox” and only for a limited group of wealthy investors. You might also like: Russia moves to seize crypto: new bill classifies Bitcoin as property Elvira Nabiullina, head of the central bank, said earlier at a conference that “investments directly in cryptocurrencies” will require new regulations and dedicated infrastructure. Under the plan, investors will qualify if they have over 100 million rubles (around $1.25 million) in securities and deposits or earned more than 50 million rubles (around $625,000) in the past year. Sberbank also plans to offer crypto-linked investment products that don’t involve direct ownership. Per Zozulya, these could be structured products, digital financial assets, or mutual funds that provide exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ethereum ( ETH ), but without direct ownership. Following this approach, the bank expects a “new world” of investing to open up once the legal framework is updated. Zozulya added that the infrastructure “is already ready,” and it’s just a matter of adding new instruments to the market.

According to data from crypto.news, Quant ( QNT ) jumped over 10% in the past 24 hours, reaching an intraday high of $106.67 on the morning of May 27. This move pushed its market cap to around $1.55 billion, placing QNT nearly 80% above its year-to-date low. Daily trading volume also shot up by more than 200%, hitting over $50 million. Meanwhile, its open interest spiked 43% to $22.9 million, its highest level since February, hinting at a strong wave of speculative activity. The recent uptick in momentum followed an announcement from CEO Gilbert Verdian, who revealed that Overledger Fusion will begin rolling out in June 2025. The new upgrade, described as a “Layer 2.5” network, introduces multi-chain rollups, secure cross-chain smart contracts, and improved privacy tools, all aimed at helping blockchains work more smoothly with both enterprise systems and DeFi applications. According to Quant, the goal is to fix major pain points that have slowed down institutional adoption of public blockchains, such as compliance risks, data privacy concerns, and poor scalability. By allowing smoother asset and data movement between private and public chains, Fusion could appeal to banks, fintech firms, and other organizations exploring blockchain integration.

As the tech landscape evolves at lightning speed, so too does the path into a technology career. If you’re an aspiring developer or tech enthusiast looking to land your first professional role, you might be finding the door surprisingly hard to open. It’s not just you; the tech job market for newcomers has fundamentally shifted, presenting significant hurdles that weren’t there just a few years ago. Understanding the Shifting Tech Job Market The traditional path into a tech role often involved securing an entry level tech job right after graduation. These roles served as crucial stepping stones, allowing new professionals to gain practical experience, build networks, and develop specialized skills. However, recent data paints a challenging picture for this conventional route. Reports indicate a substantial pullback in hiring new graduates by large technology companies. Data from venture firm SignalFire shows that hiring of new grads by the 15 largest tech companies has dropped over 50% since 2019. Before the pandemic, graduates made up about 15% of hires at these firms; that figure has now fallen to just 7%. This significant reduction means fewer openings for those just starting their tech careers . Why Entry Level Tech Jobs Are Harder to Secure Several factors contribute to the increased difficulty in landing those initial roles: Economic Climate: The broader economic environment has led many companies, including tech giants, to become more cautious with hiring, prioritizing experienced talent who can immediately contribute to critical projects. Automation and AI: As highlighted by experts like LinkedIn’s chief economic opportunity officer, Aneesh Raman, AI is automating tasks that were previously handled by entry-level staff. This effectively removes some of the traditional ‘bottom rung’ positions on the career ladder. Basic data entry, preliminary coding tasks, and support functions are increasingly being handled by intelligent systems. Increased Competition: While the number of tech graduates continues to grow, the reduced supply of dedicated entry-level roles intensifies competition for the remaining positions. Higher Skill Requirements: Companies are increasingly seeking candidates who can contribute value quickly, often requiring more specialized skills even at the entry level than in the past. The Growing Demand for AI Skills Amidst the challenges, a clear demand signal is emerging: the need for AI skills . While AI might be contributing to the reduction in some traditional roles, it is simultaneously creating a surge in demand for new expertise. A survey found that 87% of hiring leaders now value AI experience, and nearly a quarter of all job postings now require it. This isn’t just about building AI models; it includes a range of competencies: Understanding machine learning concepts Data analysis and interpretation Prompt engineering and working with large language models Integrating AI tools into existing workflows AI ethics and governance For those aiming for AI jobs , demonstrating practical experience with AI technologies is becoming essential. Navigating Tech Careers in a Changing Landscape Despite the hurdles in securing traditional entry level tech jobs at big tech firms, the overall outlook for tech employment remains positive. The tech industry itself isn’t shrinking; rather, technology roles are becoming embedded across virtually all sectors. This presents a significant opportunity for aspiring professionals willing to look beyond the typical Silicon Valley giants. Tech jobs are projected to grow from 6 million this year to 7.1 million by 2034. While big tech hiring of new grads is down, companies in healthcare, finance (including FinTech and crypto), retail, manufacturing, and countless other industries are actively seeking tech talent. The unemployment rate for software developers, while not at historic lows, remains relatively low at 2.2%, half the national average. So, how can you position yourself for success in this evolving market? Here are some actionable insights: Acquire AI Skills: This is non-negotiable. Invest time in learning machine learning fundamentals, data science, or how to effectively use AI tools. Online courses, bootcamps, and personal projects are invaluable. Build a Portfolio Demonstrating AI Proficiency: Create projects that showcase your ability to work with AI, analyze data, or develop software that integrates AI functionalities. Highlight these on platforms like GitHub. Look Beyond Big Tech: Explore opportunities in various industries. Companies in healthcare, finance, energy, and agriculture need tech professionals, and they may offer more accessible entry points. Network Strategically: Attend industry events (both tech and AI-focused), connect with professionals on LinkedIn, and participate in online communities. Networking can uncover hidden opportunities. Emphasize Adaptability and Continuous Learning: The pace of technological change means that the ability to quickly learn new tools and concepts is highly valued. Make this a core part of your professional narrative. The Future of AI Jobs and Tech Careers The trajectory suggests a future where tech roles are pervasive, and AI skills are foundational. The growth in AI jobs isn’t limited to specialized AI researcher positions; it extends to developers who can integrate AI, data analysts who can interpret AI outputs, and product managers who can build AI-powered products. For those interested in the crypto space, this convergence is particularly relevant, with increasing applications of AI in areas like market analysis, security, and decentralized applications. While the path to an entry level tech job might be more challenging than in previous years, it is far from impossible. It requires a more strategic approach, a focus on in-demand skills like AI, and a willingness to explore opportunities across a broader range of industries. The demand for tech talent, especially those with relevant AI expertise, is projected to grow, offering a promising future for those who adapt and prepare effectively.

At the forefront of this call is pseudonymous analyst Rekt Fencer, who recently outlined several tokens he claims are primed for explosive gains of between 50x and 100x, provided market momentum holds. Altseason Indicators Align Rekt Fencer’s thesis, shared in a May 27 thread on X, rests on a confluence of macro and technical indicators. Chief among them is the uptick in stablecoin supply, a leading metric often interpreted as latent purchasing power. “More capital flowing in means risk-on is coming,” stated the analyst. “Time for alts is closer than u think.” He also shared a series of charts in his thread showing that the total stablecoin supply has grown from around $50 billion in early 2021 to nearly $250 billion by mid-2025. This influx, he argued, reflects rising capital readiness to enter riskier altcoin positions. His view is supported by a simultaneous dip in Bitcoin’s dominance, which has slipped from 65.4% to 61.2% in recent weeks. Ethereum’s ETH/BTC ratio has also rebounded from a five-year low of 0.018 to 0.025, breaking a three-year downtrend and creating what has historically been a setup for alt rallies. “BTC Dominance at supply, ETH/BTC at demand. This exact pattern triggered the last alt run,” wrote Rekt Fencer. The shifting flows suggest investors are beginning to rotate into altcoins, and in this context, the market observer spotlighted five tokens he believes could lead the charge. The 5 Altcoins in Focus Rekt Fencer’s first pick was Grass (GRASS). Trading at $2.40 at the time of writing, it is down 2.5% in the last 24 hours. However, the altcoin still gained nearly 12% in the past week and almost 50% in 30 days, as investors bet on decentralized infrastructure. His second choice was Pendle (PENDLE), ranked #131 in terms of market cap. The altcoin offers exposure to tokenized yield futures and is currently trading at around $4.39. Its value has jumped more than 17% in the previous seven days, adding a slight 0.4% in 24 hours. However, zooming out, the last 12 months haven’t been particularly kind, with data showing that it shed nearly 36% of its price in that time. Still, PENDLE has performed markedly better in the last 30 days, gaining just under 30% riding the broader wave of decentralized finance (DeFi) revival. Another DeFi darling on Rekt’s list is Ondo (ONDO). Priced at $0.9315 and with a $2.9 billion valuation, it has seen steady growth amid rising demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. However, its latest price action is nothing to write home about. The asset is down roughly 2% in the last 24 hours and in the last seven days, while across 12 months, it has registered a 24.5% drop. Ethena (ENA), currently at $0.37 and a $2.1 billion market cap, offers a yield-bearing synthetic dollar via delta-neutral stETH positions. It is the fourth token the analyst sees spearheading the next altcoin season. While its price has been flat in the past seven days, there is a belief that the protocol’s utility could drive a revaluation if market sentiment flips risk-on. Finally, Sei (SEI), the native token of the Sei Network, wraps up Rekt Fencer’s list. Down more than 59% year-on-year, the coin has still managed a 10.7% uptick in the past month, with the expert suggesting its high-speed architecture and DEX focus could position it as a rebound candidate.

While tokens like BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) had their time in the spotlight, 2025 is shaping up to crown a new breakout star. If you’re on the hunt for the next big meme coin with real momentum and 1000x potential, Punisher Coin stands out as the one to watch. Punisher Coin: The Best Crypto for Passive Income and Viral Momentum Punisher Coin ($PUN) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, but don’t be fooled — it’s no ordinary meme coin. With a revolutionary “Punisher Energy” system, the project is rewriting the rules of meme warfare. Here’s the play: target weaker meme coins, incentivize their holders to jump ship, and reward them with bonus $PUN tokens. This tactic drains liquidity from competitors and boosts Punisher Coin’s ecosystem. But that’s not all. The team behind $PUN is hyper-focused on community. With mission-based rewards, users can earn both real cash and $PUN tokens by participating in challenges. It’s more than holding a coin — it’s joining a movement. Add to that an explosive presale ($30K raised in the first hour) and upcoming staking rewards, and you’ve got one of the top cryptos for passive income and high-growth speculation alike. BONK: Solana’s Meme Experiment Peaks Early BONK, the original meme coin of the Solana network, saw early success thanks to its community-first approach and massive airdrops. However, volatility and a lack of evolving utility have stalled its momentum. While it benefited from being first on Solana, its long-term upside is increasingly tied to Solana’s broader performance — and that’s a risky dependency in 2025’s uncertain DeFi landscape. Dogwifhat (WIF): Viral Sensation, But What Comes Next? WIF charmed the internet with its Shiba Inu mascot sporting a beanie — a perfect recipe for meme coin virality. It thrived on Reddit and X (formerly Twitter), gaining traction purely on vibe. Yet that’s also its Achilles’ heel: no staking, no missions, no unique strategy. As the meme coin market matures, investors are demanding more than memes. Punisher Coin delivers. Punisher Coin vs. BONK & WIF: The Strategic Advantage BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) run on Solana, while Punisher Coin is built on Ethereum (ERC-20). Passive income is minimal with BONK and nonexistent with WIF, but Punisher offers high potential through staking and mission rewards. Community engagement is limited to airdrops for BONK and virtually absent with WIF. Punisher Coin, however, drives activity with structured missions and rewards. Neither BONK nor WIF has a defined liquidity strategy, whereas Punisher leads with aggressive “raids” powered by Punisher Energy. As BONK peaks and WIF fades, Punisher Coin’s presale is gaining explosive momentum. This isn’t just hype—Punisher delivers results. With staking, token burns, and an offensive liquidity model, it’s built for long-term success. For serious meme coin investors, Punisher is a fresh and strategic play. The Meme Coin of the Year? BONK and Dogwifhat created waves. But Punisher Coin is creating a storm. It’s not only the best meme coin to buy today — it may be the most strategic meme asset launched this year. With robust tokenomics (2B supply, 33% for presale, 22% for staking) and a multi-layered brand (Enforcer, Strategist, Executioner), it’s designed to do more than trend — it’s built to conquer. Don’t settle for old hype. Be part of a new narrative with actual mechanics behind the meme. The Punisher Coin presale is live — join now and ride the wave of 2025’s most tactical meme coin.

In the visual shared, this moving average, colored yellow, runs just beneath the current market price, which is approximately $2.2962. Despite recent downward movement, this SMA has consistently maintained its role as dynamic support. Egragnotes that it is “keeping us steady,” suggesting buyers are actively defending this level. The proximity to the 0.702 Fibonacci level at $2.2293 adds another layer of support, reinforcing the argument that this zone is technically important. #XRP – 21 SMA & 33 SMA Support Levels: On the 5-day timeframe, the 21 SMA is acting as a strong support, keeping us steady! Meanwhile, on the 3-day timeframe, the 33 SMA is providing crucial support, reinforcing our bullish outlook. These moving averages are key to… pic.twitter.com/0UKxOqfaSM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 25, 2025 33 SMA Support Reinforced on the 3-Day Chart In the 3-day timeframe, attention turns to the 33-period SMA, shown in green. According to Egrag Crypto, this moving average provides “crucial support” and helps sustain the current bullish setup. The XRP price remains closely aligned with this average, suggesting a continuation of support-driven consolidation. A highlighted level of $1.9600 serves as a reference point for lower bounds observed in recent market activity. This level has previously marked a reversal zone, indicating that market participants have shown strong buying interest when prices reached this area. Horizontal Resistance and Key Fibonacci Levels Both charts in the tweet include marked horizontal resistance and support lines, with the $2.4100 and $2.6544 levels of particular interest. The latter aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, suggesting that a break above this point could trigger stronger bullish activity. The ultimate Fibonacci target labeled on the charts is $3.3170, which is derived from the full retracement extension and marks a longer-term technical objective. On the downside, support levels at $2.1500 and $1.9555 are also emphasized, providing reference zones during further corrective moves. Outlook and Interpretation from Egrag Crypto Egrag Crypto’s commentary maintains a focused and technical tone. The post stresses the importance of the moving averages in sustaining upward momentum without offering exaggerated predictions. Instead, the tweet emphasizes that staying above these SMAs is essential to preserving the bullish outlook. No speculative timeframes or dramatic scenarios are introduced, and the analysis is grounded in the visual strength of trend-following indicators. For traders monitoring XRP , this structured approach provides a roadmap of current support levels and confirms the analyst’s preference for a measured, mid-term view of the asset’s price trajectory.

The Bank of Japan (BOJ), long an outlier with its ultra-loose monetary policy, is now hinting at a significant change. This potential shift in Bank of Japan strategy could have far-reaching implications, even for digital assets. Understanding the Bank of Japan’s Stance For decades, the Bank of Japan has maintained exceptionally low, and sometimes negative, interest rates. This was a deliberate strategy aimed at stimulating economic growth and combating deflation, a persistent decline in price levels. While other major central banks like the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank began hiking rates aggressively in recent years to fight rising inflation, the BOJ largely stuck to its easing stance, including yield curve control. This divergence in Monetary Policy Japan pursued created a significant gap between Japanese interest rates and those elsewhere, influencing global capital flows and the value of the Japanese Yen (JPY). The carry trade, where investors borrow in low-interest rate currencies like the JPY to invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere, became a prominent market feature. Is Japan Inflation Finally Taking Hold? Recent data suggests that Japan inflation is finally reaching levels not seen in decades. After years of struggling to meet its 2% target, consumer prices have risen consistently, driven by factors including global commodity price increases, supply chain issues, and a weaker yen pushing up import costs. Governor Kazuo Ueda’s recent remarks acknowledge this shift. Speaking at a conference, Governor Ueda indicated that Japan is now closer to its 2% inflation target than it has been in the past three years. This sustained period of rising prices provides the central bank with the economic conditions it has long sought to justify normalizing Monetary Policy Japan has followed. BOJ Policy: What Did Governor Ueda Signal? According to reports, Governor Ueda explicitly stated that the central bank is prepared to continue raising Japan interest rates if economic conditions improve as anticipated. This is a pivotal statement, moving beyond hypothetical discussions to a more concrete commitment based on current economic trajectory. He emphasized the need to adjust monetary easing as necessary to maintain price stability, a core mandate of the BOJ. Key takeaways from his comments: Conditionality: Rate hikes are contingent on continued economic improvement aligning with the BOJ’s forecasts. Inflation Target: The 2% target is becoming a reality, strengthening the case for policy adjustment. Flexibility: The BOJ is prepared to adjust its stance to ensure long-term price stability. This signals a potential end to the era of ultra-low Japan interest rates that has defined the country’s economic landscape for so long. The Potential Impact of Rising Japan Interest Rates A shift in BOJ policy away from ultra-easing carries significant weight, both domestically and internationally. For Japan, it could mean higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially impacting investment and spending. It could also strengthen the Japanese Yen, making imports cheaper but potentially hurting exporters. Globally, the impact could be felt through: Yen Carry Trade Unwinding: Higher JPY rates could make borrowing in yen less attractive, potentially leading investors to sell assets bought with borrowed yen, impacting markets worldwide. Global Liquidity: Japan’s ultra-loose stance has contributed significantly to global liquidity. Tightening Monetary Policy Japan employs could reduce this liquidity. Investor Sentiment: A major central bank exiting an extreme easing stance can influence overall market sentiment regarding global monetary conditions. While the pace and extent of rate hikes remain uncertain, the signal from the Bank of Japan is clear: the path towards normalization is becoming more likely. Monetary Policy Japan and Global Ripples: What About Crypto? How does this seemingly distant central bank policy affect the volatile world of cryptocurrency? The connection lies in global liquidity and risk appetite. Historically, periods of abundant global liquidity (often fueled by central bank easing, including the Bank of Japan ) have coincided with increased investment in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, as central banks tighten Monetary Policy Japan included, global liquidity tends to decrease. This can lead investors to become more cautious, potentially reducing appetite for high-risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. The unwinding of the yen carry trade, if it occurs on a large scale, could also add selling pressure to various asset classes globally, including potentially crypto. Investors in the crypto space should monitor the BOJ policy trajectory closely. While not a direct driver, changes in major global monetary policies, especially from a significant player like the Bank of Japan, contribute to the broader macroeconomic environment that influences crypto market dynamics. Conclusion: A New Era for Japan’s Economy and Beyond? Governor Ueda’s recent comments mark a potentially significant turning point for the Bank of Japan and Japan’s economy. After decades of battling deflation and maintaining ultra-low rates, sustained Japan inflation is paving the way for a shift towards higher Japan interest rates . This move away from the long-standing ultra-easy BOJ policy is not just a domestic matter; it has the potential to send ripples through global financial markets, impacting everything from bond yields and currency values to potentially influencing the tides of global liquidity that affect asset classes like cryptocurrency. As the BOJ navigates this transition, market participants worldwide will be watching closely.

Known for his unwavering bullish stance on Bitcoin, Saylor often sparks significant discussion with his views. His latest comments, delivered at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, have once again grabbed headlines, this time focusing on a controversial topic: on-chain proof-of-reserves for institutional players. And his take? It’s a “bad idea” that introduces significant Crypto Security Risks . Why Michael Saylor Calls On-Chain Proof-of-Reserves a “Bad Idea” Michael Saylor didn’t mince words when discussing the practice of institutions publicly disclosing their wallet addresses as a form of Proof-of-Reserves . While the concept of PoR gained traction after events like the FTX collapse to foster transparency and trust, Saylor argues that the on-chain method, specifically for large entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin , creates more problems than it solves. According to reports from the conference, Saylor highlighted several key concerns: Increased Attack Surface: Publicly known wallet addresses become prime targets for malicious actors. Knowing where significant reserves are held provides hackers with a clear target, potentially increasing the risk of sophisticated attacks. Privacy Concerns: While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, linking a large, known institution to specific wallet addresses can compromise operational privacy and potentially reveal strategic movements or holdings. Vulnerability for All Parties: Saylor suggested that this exposure isn’t just risky for the institution publishing the data. It could also make their custodians, exchanges they interact with, and even their investors more vulnerable indirectly. Limited True Proof: Saylor has argued in the past that simply showing assets in a wallet isn’t sufficient proof without simultaneously proving liabilities. An institution could show large holdings but have even larger debts against them. This stance positions Saylor against a trend some in the industry see as essential for rebuilding trust, particularly among users interacting with centralized exchanges and custodians handling significant Institutional Crypto holdings. Understanding Proof-of-Reserves: The Goal vs. The Method Let’s take a step back. What is Proof-of-Reserves , and why did it become a hot topic? In essence, PoR is an audit method to verify that a custodian (like an exchange or financial institution) holds the assets they claim to hold on behalf of their customers. The goal is transparency and solvency assurance. Following major collapses in the crypto space, many called for mandatory PoR audits. The idea was simple: if platforms could definitively prove they held user funds 1:1, confidence would be restored. However, there are different ways to implement PoR: On-Chain Proof (Saylor’s Critique): Publishing a list of wallet addresses and signing messages from those wallets to prove ownership, coupled with a list of user balances (often anonymized using Merkle Trees). Third-Party Audits: Engaging an independent accounting firm to verify holdings and liabilities off-chain. Hybrid Approaches: Combining some level of on-chain verification with traditional auditing methods. Saylor’s criticism specifically targets the *on-chain publication* aspect, particularly for large, visible entities like those involved in Institutional Crypto . He’s not necessarily against proving reserves in principle, but the method of doing so by exposing addresses is where he sees significant Crypto Security Risks . Institutional Crypto and Unique Challenges Why might on-chain PoR be different for an individual user holding Bitcoin versus a large institution or custodian managing billions? The scale and complexity are vastly different. Institutions: Hold much larger amounts, making them bigger targets. Often use complex custody solutions, potentially involving multiple addresses, cold storage, and hot wallets. Face stricter regulatory scrutiny, and revealing too much operational detail could be problematic. Manage significant liabilities that aren’t easily verifiable on-chain. For Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy, managing a large corporate treasury holding like theirs requires a high level of security discretion. Exposing their entire wallet structure could be seen as irresponsible from a security standpoint. Is There a Safer Way to Achieve Transparency for Institutional Crypto? Saylor’s warning raises a critical question: how can institutions provide assurance to their users and the market without exposing themselves to undue Crypto Security Risks ? The industry is still grappling with the best practices. Possible alternatives or complementary methods include: Regular, Independent Audits: Engaging reputable accounting firms to conduct comprehensive audits of both assets and liabilities. While not real-time on-chain proof, this is a standard financial practice. Attestations: Less formal than a full audit, an attestation confirms the accuracy of management’s assertions about their reserves at a specific point in time. Enhanced Internal Controls: Focusing on robust internal security measures and compliance frameworks that reduce the risk of mismanagement or loss of funds. Selective Proofs: Perhaps proving ownership of a *portion* of reserves or using more sophisticated cryptographic methods that don’t require revealing all addresses. The debate highlights the tension between the crypto ethos of radical transparency and the practical realities of managing large-scale, secure operations in a high-value target environment. For Bitcoin holders and those interacting with Institutional Crypto platforms, understanding these nuances is key. Conclusion: Balancing Transparency and Security in the Age of Bitcoin Michael Saylor ‘s recent comments serve as a potent reminder that while transparency is vital in the crypto space, the method matters, especially for large institutions. He argues that blindly pursuing on-chain Proof-of-Reserves for entities holding significant amounts of Bitcoin introduces unacceptable Crypto Security Risks that could harm the very users it aims to protect. The industry must continue to explore secure and effective ways for Institutional Crypto players to demonstrate solvency and build trust, perhaps leaning more towards robust independent audits and advanced cryptographic techniques rather than simply publishing wallet addresses for the world to see. Saylor’s warning encourages a more cautious and strategic approach to transparency in the face of evolving digital threats.

At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,564, reflecting a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. While the broader crypto market remains in a bullish structure, largely driven by Bitcoin’s sharp upward movement, Ethereum’s relative momentum appears more tempered, raising questions among traders and analysts about its current positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Its Footing: Bulls Prepare for Another Push Retail Quiet, Institutions Watchful Despite the price remaining above key levels, some analysts believe Ethereum has yet to fully capture the broader market’s enthusiasm. One such observation was presented by CryptoQuant’s analyst Burak Kesmeci, who noted that retail activity around Ethereum remains low compared to previous cycles. This could suggest that Ethereum’s rally is still in its early stages, with potential upside left unpriced by the market. The absence of retail enthusiasm, which historically coincided with local tops, may signal that Ethereum has not yet reached a peak for this cycle. Kesmeci’s analysis highlighted a notable shift in retail engagement around Ethereum. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 bull run, the analyst pointed out that earlier rallies were often accompanied by sharp spikes in retail trading frequency. However, during the current cycle, retail interest has been largely muted, even as Bitcoin surged from $16,000 to over $111,000. While ETH saw a brief uptick in retail activity in December 2024, that momentum faded quickly amid broader market reactions to geopolitical developments, including renewed tariff tensions. The analyst concluded that the market may still be in a phase of accumulation, as the typical retail-driven euphoria has yet to materialize. In this scenario, Ethereum could benefit from increased participation in the coming months, particularly if macroeconomic sentiment stabilizes. The potential for delayed retail entry suggests that Ethereum’s current rally might only be at its midpoint rather than nearing a local top. Ethereum Technical Setups Suggest Bullish Continuation On the technical front, several market analysts continue to hold a positive outlook for ETH. A pseudonymous analyst known as Crypto Busy posted on X that the asset’s monthly chart remains structurally intact, referencing a previous key resistance level near $1,410. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? According to the post, Ethereum’s breakout above this long-standing barrier has turned it into support, replicating a setup that historically preceded major rallies. Further reinforcing this perspective, analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s price action near the $2,400 level. He noted that this zone offered a strong buying opportunity and believes that if Ethereum can successfully retest and hold above this threshold, a move toward $3,000 could follow.

Memecoins have been going downhill lately, and even top assets like the DOGE token have not been spared. Following a strong start to the month, the coin has slipped over the past week. With other altcoins witnessing a different fortune, DOGE holders are disappointed at the token’s current movement. But Unilabs is showing a dominant market ICO display, thus positioning itself as a utility-based alternative for Dogecoin traders to recover their losses. Dogecoin Price Decline: Utility Issues Weigh Heavy Dogecoin (DOGE) debuted in the cryptosphere as the first-ever memecoin. It was created as an internet joke to mock the rapid increase of low-utility digital assets flooding the market at the time. In the years that followed, the Dogecoin price was relatively stable, as most crypto fans paid little attention to DOGE. But things took a different turn in 2021 when the Dogecoin price stunned traders with a mind-blowing price bump. Within the first five months of the same year, the DOGE token had skyrocketed to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.73. However, the Dogecoin price has not been able to sustain this remarkable rally, falling 70% below its ATH as of the time of writing. At present, the DOGE token is hovering around $0.21 after slipping close to 6% in the last four weeks. Source: CoinCodex The Dogecoin price is facing a major hurdle on its road to a recovery: it lacks real utility. Like other memecoins, Dogecoin does not solve any real issue that everyday crypto users face. Instead, the Dogecoin price trend heavily relies on its online community and virality. Another major setback is that the coin is an inflationary asset. Every year, about 5 billion DOGE is pumped into the crypto market. This high token supply creates an imbalance between supply and demand, which in turn affects the coin’s price. Given these circumstances, Dogecoin holders have turned their attention to utility-based projects like Unilabs. Unilabs (UNIL): New DeFi Token Offers Strong Passive Income Potential While DOGE runs on hype, Unilabs could offer several passive income strategies for those who want to earn from the market without active involvement. The stablecoin savings account is a safe and simple way for investors to earn interest without trading. It is pegged to trusted stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI. This way, investors could earn consistent interest without worrying about the price swings experienced by the Dogecoin price. Once a user deposits into the stablecoin account, Unilabs uses AI technology to find the best and safest strategies to grow the investment while keeping the principal deposit stable. Plus, the funds are highly liquid, meaning a user could take them out anytime without having to wait or pay penalties. Traders could also earn income by referring new participants to the ecosystem. Early entrants are also positioned to benefit from Unilabs’ transparent reward model, which is divided into twelve tiers. The platform will distribute 30% of all fees it generates to users across these levels. Unilabs is now in its presale phase and has raised over $1.1 million in less than one month. Investors are entering the project at a fast rate, with about 233 million UNIL tokens sold so far. Buyers could increase their UNIL stash by 30% when they apply the “UNIL30” code during checkout. With this, they stand to earn more returns once the project trades on exchanges. Given its performance, experts are tipping Unilabs to touch a fraction of the billion-dollar DeFi sector upon going mainstream. If this happens, UNIL could surge 10x from its current price, giving early adopters significant returns. Unilabs Could Be a Doorway for 10X Gains Even though early DOGE holders profited massively from its 2021, its lack of utility has proved to be a major setback in the current crypto atmosphere. After its recent weak outing, investors are now sceptical of the future trajectory of the Dogecoin price. Luckily, Unilabs offers investors a low-cost opportunity to reroute their portfolios for better market openings. With its user-tailored use cases, Unilabs could be the next 10x token in 2025. Investors can buy UNIL directly from the website at a discounted price of $0.0051.

While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not recognized as legal tender, they operate in a regulatory grey area with evolving tax and compliance frameworks. Over 107 million Indians now engage with crypto assets. Below is a timeline of key crypto regulation updates in India during 2025, Crypto Regulation India Timeline – 2025 May 22, 2025 : FSB Peer Review Preparation India gears up for the Financial Stability Board (FSB) review in October , aiming to align local crypto regulation with global regulatory standards . April 1, 2025 : SEBI Oversight Begins SEBI starts monitoring crypto tokens that resemble securities . A multi-agency regulatory model is proposed, including RBI, SEBI, and the Finance Ministry. February 13, 2025 : VDA Income Tax Amendment Bill Introduced The bill expands the scope of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) to include NFTs and undisclosed income . However, the 30% tax rate remains unchanged . February 10, 2025 : Crypto Exchanges Declared Reporting Entities Exchanges, wallets, and even mining pools are categorized as “reporting entities.” They must report all transactions to tax authorities under the new AML guidelines. February 1, 2025 : Union Budget 2025-26 Highlights FM Nirmala Sitharaman mandates crypto exchanges to report buyer/seller details under Section 285BAA of the Income Tax Act, enhancing transaction transparency. Crypto Tax in India – 2025 (Fact-Checked) As of now, no official reduction has been made to the 30% tax on crypto gains or the 1% TDS , despite industry demands. 1. For Investors and Traders Flat 30% Tax on gains from crypto sales, swaps, or gifts. No deductions allowed except for cost of acquisition. 1% TDS on transfers above ₹10,000 (buyer deducts and remits). No loss set-off or carry-forward permitted. Example: Buy BTC at ₹2.72 lakh → Sell at ₹8.72 lakh → ₹6 lakh profit → Tax = ₹1.8 lakh + TDS = ₹6,000 2. For Crypto Companies & Exchanges KYC/AML compliance is mandatory. 1% TDS to be collected and remitted on every qualifying user transaction. Transaction reporting to tax authorities under PMLA and IT laws. Category Tax Rate TDS Example Investors 30% 1% if >₹10k ₹50k profit → ₹15k tax + ₹500 TDS Traders 30% 1% if >₹10k Taxed as business income Companies NA 1% collected ₹10L transaction → ₹10k TDS Crypto Adoption in India (2025 Snapshot) Active Users : Over 107.3 million Indians (7.37% of population) hold or trade crypto. Revenue Forecast : India’s crypto market is projected to hit $6.4 billion by year-end. Exchanges : Platforms like CoinDCX, CoinSwitch, and Mudrex offer access to over 500 tokens. Growth Drivers : Rising financial inclusion, smartphone penetration, and blockchain innovation. Government Holdings : No official disclosure yet; policies prioritize transparency and user safety. Conclusion India’s crypto regulation in 2025 reflects a delicate balance between enabling innovation and enforcing oversight. With strict taxes (30% + 1% TDS) and real-time transaction reporting, the government is creating a compliant ecosystem without enforcing an outright ban. As the FSB review nears, clarity in crypto regulation India could open new doors for mass adoption and position the country at the forefront of the $7 trillion global digital economy . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Strategy recently purchased 4,020 BTC at an estimated cost of $427 million, fueling speculation about a potential leg up. However, the market seems divided by views. While price holds above $109k, investors are now eyeing the on-chain trends, liquidation data, and whale moves for clues on the next move. Smart Money vs. Retail Money? Recent insights from Glassnode reveal a crucial shift, where the greater than 10k BTC cohort (the market’s largest players) have moved into a net distribution zone with a score around 0.3. This is an obvious reversal from earlier in the year, when whales were leading accumulation during price rallies. Other cohorts like the 1k to 10k holders and the 100 to 1k BTC holders are also slowing down. While wallets with 10 to 100 BTC and sub-1 BTC continue their shopping spree. Further suggesting that leadership is moving downward on the wallet-size curve. This implies that the retail is buying the dip, while whales may be booking profits or analysing an incoming volatility. What Does the Liquidation Heat Map Say? The liquidation map by Kingfisher gives another layer of insight. With Bitcoin currently priced around $109k, there’s a significant buildup of long liquidation just below the $109k, $108.5k, and $107k mark. This indicates a potential liquidity grab to the downside that could be in the works, which could be driven by leveraged long positions at a risk of being wiped out. It is to note that, above the present BTC price, short liquidation levels seem to be weak, indicating less momentum for an upward squeeze. Correlating this with the distribution by large holders paints a picture where short-term downside volatility is not just possible, but is statistically favored. However, it is worth citing that such moves often reset leverage and provide stronger bases for continuation.

He also told them to ask the AI how it might undermine the security of someone’s company over time. According to Saylor, the AI would write 50 pages of security problems. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.” -Michael Saylor, Co-founder of Strategy. Saylor made global headlines in 2020 when he announced that Strategy would convert its treasury holding into BTC. At the time of publication, Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth around $63 billion. BitcoinTreasuries showed that Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings follows with 48,137 Bitcoin. Crypto exchanges use proof-of-reserves to verify that the company holds sufficient crypto reserves to cover customer deposits. Saylor believes the crypto industry has much to learn from the collapse of FTX and Mt. Gox crypto exchanges. He says proof of reserve isn’t the correct measure for institutions. Cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians began publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022. The move was to establish transparency and prove they hold enough digital assets to back customer deposits. Exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, and OKX, have adopted the transparency measure. Saylor also argued that proof-of-reserves often only shows one side of the picture — what the firm holds — and not what they owe. Powell says proof-of-reserves is pointless without including liabilities Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell noted that exchanges began sharing wallet addresses to prove the existence of users’ funds following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. He argued that a complete proof-of-reserve audit must include the sum of client liabilities; otherwise, it would be “pointless .” According to Powell, a complete proof of reserve audit must include user-verifiable cryptographic proof that each account was included in the sum and signatures proving the custodian’s control over the wallets. He called out industry players who have missed out on including accounts with negative balances. Kraken’s co-founder previously called out CoinMarketCap for sharing incomplete proof of reserves, as it lacked cryptographic proof of client balances and wallet control. Powell mentioned that reserves are not the list of wallets but assets minus liabilities. Powell also asked the media to refrain from overselling and misleading consumers with the transparency measures. He recommended they take time to understand the motive behind proof-of-reserves.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Pepe holds strong at a $5.5b market cap, new contenders like MIND of Pepe and Pepeto are making waves, each promising to be the next big leap in the memecoin saga. Table of Contents Pepe Coin: Still trending, but is the best phase already gone? Another frog joins the hype: MIND of Pepe gears up for big launch The frog who started it all: Pepeto returns for his crown The market is mixed today. According to Nasdaq, the NASDAQ composite is at 18,737.21, showing cautious movement. DOGE is around $0.22, down 3 percent. ETH is holding steady near $2,522. PEPE is still hot at $0.000013 with a $5.5 billion market cap, according to CoinMarketCap and crypto news outlets. Pepe Coin: Still trending, but is the best phase already gone? Pepe Coin is all over the charts again , trending on exchanges, buzzing on social media, and holding a strong place in the memecoin world. Its current price is $0.00001312, with a massive 420 trillion token supply. According to CoinMarketCap, Pepe now has a market cap over $5.5 billion and trades more than $500 million daily. It’s also listed on top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and KuCoin. So yes, it’s visible and active. But here’s the part most people forget: Pepe launched back in April 2023. The real winners were the early buyers, the ones who got in before the noise. For Pepe to simply double in price now, it would need another $5.5 billion to come in. And with no clear roadmap or real use, that’s not easy. So while Pepe still has the spotlight, it may no longer have the upside. The biggest wave might’ve already passed. Another frog joins the hype: MIND of Pepe gears up for big launch Now that we’ve looked at Pepe, let’s take a closer look at another frog making noise, MIND of Pepe. This memecoin mixes Pepe-style branding with AI technology. Its presale is ending soon, and it has already raised a massive amount. Investors who join early will get access to an AI-powered terminal that promises to give market insights, trading ideas, and data tools. The MIND AI agent even posts on social media by itself, building a following on its own. Once the platform goes live, users will be able to interact with the AI directly, with early investors getting first access. Some crypto analysts say the project could grow fast once listed, thanks to the mix of trending meme culture and useful tools. Still, many investors are watching closely for the next token that carries not just hype, but real meaning and direction. That brings us to Pepeto, the God of frogs, and a memecoin with much more story and value. You might also like: Pepe price forms golden cross despite whale and smart money selling The frog who started it all: Pepeto returns for his crown Investors have seen the hype around Pepe, and they’ve watched MIND of Pepe try to mix memes with machines. But neither of them tells the full story. Because before any of these frogs hopped into crypto, there was Pepeto, the true God of frogs, and he’s back to finish what was stolen from him. The lore behind Pepeto According to the lore, before Pepe became a memecoin, it stole the four key documents — the letters P, E, P, E — and ran with the spotlight. But something was missing. Something important. The final two letters — T and O — were never theirs. They belonged to Pepeto. And he waited. Watching in silence as others took credit for his name, his story, his vision. Now he’s here, and he’s not just another meme. Pepeto is a correction. A comeback. A reckoning. The market is ready for more than hype. It’s asking for value, for meaning, for something real. Pepeto is ready to answer. Why Pepeto is more than just a memecoin A full exchange focused on memecoins alone Zero-fee swaps, giving power back to users Bridge technology for smooth cross-chain trading A mission to expose scams and protect traders Inspired by history and crypto betrayal A strong, growing community with a shared purpose The same 420 trillion supply as Pepe, but at a presale price of $0.000000130 Pepeto is fully audited, and all details about its value and features can be verified directly through the official website. Rumors say that one of Pepe’s original founders was removed before the launch, betrayed and shut out. He stayed silent, watched from a distance, and came back with Pepeto, holding the final two letters that Pepe never had. That’s why the listing day is now known as the Day of Redemption.

45149948,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=163175,1748333445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45149948.jpeg,Shocking Solana Co-Founder Raj Gokal’s Personal Data Leaked Via Migos Instagram Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-raj-gokal-leak/,"BitcoinWorld Shocking Solana Co-Founder Raj Gokal’s Personal Data Leaked Via Migos Instagram Hack In a bizarre and concerning incident that highlights the ever-present risks in the digital age, particularly for high-profile individuals in the cryptocurrency space, personal information belonging to Solana co-founder Raj Gokal was reportedly leaked online. The unexpected conduit for this sensitive information? The official Instagram account of the popular American hip-hop group, Migos. What Happened: The Raj Gokal Personal Data Leak Reports emerged detailing a significant Personal Data Leak affecting Raj Gokal, one of the key figures behind the Solana blockchain. According to news outlet The Block, the Instagram account associated with the group Migos briefly posted highly sensitive personal documents belonging to Gokal. This included images of his driver’s license and passport. While the posts were quickly deleted, the fact that they appeared on a widely followed celebrity account adds an unusual twist to what appears to be a targeted cyberattack. The posts reportedly contained a stark message: “You should’ve paid the 40 BTC.” This specific phrase strongly suggests that Gokal may have been subjected to extortion attempts or threats prior to this public leak. The demand for 40 Bitcoin (BTC) is a substantial amount, underscoring the severity of the alleged ransom request. The Celebrity Connection: Migos Instagram Involved The involvement of the Migos Instagram account in this incident is particularly perplexing and attention-grabbing. It raises questions about how the attackers gained access to such a prominent social media profile. Was the Migos account itself compromised? Was it used as a staging ground or a means to amplify the pressure on Raj Gokal? While the exact connection and mechanism remain unclear based on the initial reports, the use of a celebrity platform adds a layer of public spectacle to the privacy violation. It’s crucial to understand that the appearance of Gokal’s data on the Migos account does not imply any involvement or culpability from the music group themselves. It points more towards the sophisticated and often unpredictable tactics employed by cybercriminals who exploit various digital pathways to achieve their goals. Understanding Crypto Security Risks in the Digital Age This incident serves as a stark reminder of the pervasive nature of digital threats, especially for individuals associated with valuable digital assets and prominent projects like Solana . While Raj Gokal is a public figure, the attack vector highlights vulnerabilities that can affect anyone. Key risks demonstrated by this event include: Social Engineering: Attackers often use psychological manipulation to gain access to accounts or information. Account Takeovers: Compromising email, social media, or other online accounts can provide pathways to more sensitive data. Data Exploitation: Once personal information is obtained, it can be used for identity theft, further extortion, or targeted attacks. Interconnected Vulnerabilities: A weakness in one service (like email or social media) can be leveraged to compromise accounts on other, seemingly unrelated, platforms (like crypto accounts or financial services). Raj Gokal himself had previously warned about attempts to compromise his digital life. Just last week, he posted on his X account (formerly Twitter) detailing how exploiters were actively trying to take control of his email, social media, Google, Apple, and other critical online accounts. This indicates he was already under siege, and the Migos Instagram leak appears to be a potentially escalated tactic by the attackers after their initial attempts may have failed or were detected. Protecting Your Personal Data: Actionable Insights While this specific incident involved a high-profile individual, the tactics used underscore the importance of robust Crypto Security practices for everyone interacting with digital assets. Protecting your Personal Data Leak is paramount. Here are some actionable steps you can take: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Everywhere: Use strong 2FA methods (like hardware keys or authenticator apps) on all critical accounts, including email, social media, crypto exchanges, wallets, and cloud services (Google, Apple, etc.). Avoid SMS-based 2FA if possible, as it can be vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Use Unique, Strong Passwords: Never reuse passwords. Use a password manager to create and store complex, unique passwords for each account. Be Wary of Phishing Attempts: Be extremely cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or calls asking for personal information or login credentials. Always verify the source. Separate Sensitive Accounts: Consider using dedicated email addresses and devices for your most sensitive activities, like managing cryptocurrency holdings. Regularly Review Account Activity: Check your account logs and linked devices regularly for any suspicious activity. Limit Public Information: Be mindful of the personal information you share publicly online, especially on social media. The challenge lies in the interconnectedness of our digital lives. A compromise on a seemingly innocuous platform can have cascading effects, potentially impacting financial security or access to valuable digital assets like those on the Solana network. The Solana Angle: Implications Beyond the Individual? While this attack targeted an individual associated with Solana , it’s important to clarify that there is no indication that the Solana blockchain itself was compromised. The attack vector appears to be centered around Raj Gokal’s personal digital footprint and associated accounts, including the bizarre link to the Migos Instagram . However, incidents involving prominent figures in the crypto space naturally draw attention and can raise questions about the broader ecosystem’s resilience. It underscores the fact that human and operational security surrounding key personnel is just as vital as the technical security of the blockchain protocol itself. Summary: A Wake-Up Call for Digital Vigilance The unprecedented incident involving the Migos Instagram account leaking Solana co-founder Raj Gokal’s personal data serves as a dramatic illustration of the lengths cybercriminals will go to. The alleged 40 BTC ransom demand highlights the financial motivation behind such attacks. Coming on the heels of Gokal’s own warnings about attempted account takeovers, this event reinforces the critical need for robust Crypto Security and vigilance in protecting one’s Personal Data Leak across all online platforms, not just those directly related to crypto. This story is a powerful reminder that in the digital world, our security is interconnected. A breach on a social media account, even one as unexpected as the Migos Instagram , can be part of a larger, targeted effort to compromise individuals involved in valuable sectors like cryptocurrency. Staying informed and implementing strong security practices is no longer optional – it’s essential.

Our long-term goals remain the same,” the company said. This comes as Circle is gearing up for its IPO, aiming for a valuation of at least $5 billion. Earlier, Circle reportedly turned down a $4–5 billion offer from Ripple. Circle’s IPO Plans While there are rumors that Ripple may have raised its offer to around $11 billion, Circle appears to be focused on going public. Circle had filed paperwork in early April and had hired investment banks to help with its IPO plans, but the timing is not confirmed yet. In January 2024, Circle had mentioned that it was reconsidering going public after it had delayed a planned IPO in December 2022. Who Could Be the Buyer- Ripple or Coinbase? Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently weighed in on the idea of Ripple buying Circle, saying it could improve the crypto space. “There’s this Coinbase-A16Z-Circle mafia where they’ve built an ecosystem that’s self-serving. If you’re outside it, you get blacklisted — it’s hard to get listed, hard to get liquidity, and hard to access stablecoins,” Hoskinson said. By getting Ripple into the stablecoin game, he believes it could break the monopoly and make way for newer, more diverse projects. Is Coinbase A More ‘Suitable’ Candidate? On the other side, Coinbase and Circle have deep ties: they co-created USDC, share revenue from its reserves, and Coinbase even owns a stake in Circle. Coinbase gets 100% of USDC earnings if funds are held on its platform. Also, Circle cannot enter new USDC-related partnerships without Coinbase’s approval, and Coinbase gets partial IP rights if Circle goes bankrupt. With so much control and shared profit already in place, many see Coinbase as the most likely buyer. Will Circle Go Ahead With IPO? But since Circle has clarified now, only time will tell what happens next.

On May 25, 2025, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced the bold strategy, stating, “This strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.” Here’s why Pakistan is taking this high-voltage leap into the digital future: Driving Digital Growth Through Surplus Power Pakistan has experienced an electricity surplus due to heavy investment in power infrastructure and reduced industrial activity. Instead of wasting this power, the government plans to repurpose it for Bitcoin mining operations and AI data centers, enabling economic returns from otherwise idle resources. Attracting Investment and Revenue By legalizing and promoting Bitcoin mining, Pakistan aims to: Attract foreign and local investors Generate new streams of tax revenue Earn foreign exchange reserves Position itself as a sovereign digital economy in the global crypto space With crypto assets and AI technologies booming worldwide, this move could help Pakistan ride the next big digital wave. Building Tech Infrastructure and Jobs This initiative is not just about mining Bitcoin—it’s about building a digital ecosystem. By powering AI infrastructure: Pakistan boosts its domestic AI capabilities Creates high-skilled job opportunities for youth Encourages growth in fields like blockchain, data science, and cloud computing It’s a strategic approach to tackle unemployment and prepare the workforce for the future of tech. Clear Regulations, Real Impact Bilal Bin Saqib, Head of Crypto Council, called the move a “turning point” for Pakistan’s economy. He emphasized the need for transparent regulations and proper systems to fully unlock the potential of this transition. “With clear guidelines and secure systems, Pakistan can be a major player in the global crypto economy.” Joining Asia’s Crypto-Forward League Pakistan is now following in the footsteps of Kazakhstan, Japan, Malaysia, and Bhutan, all of which have embraced legal Bitcoin mining to fuel their economies. These countries have already cracked down on illicit mining and established regulated environments for digital growth. Final Take As Bitcoin prices continue to surge and AI becomes a cornerstone of global tech, Pakistan’s 2,000MW commitment signals a forward-thinking strategy.

The bold remark has reignited debate around transparency and trust in crypto. In a recent interview, Saylor outright rejected the idea of publishing on-chain proof of reserves, a practice seen by many in the crypto space as essential for transparency and trust. Saylor’s Security Concerns Saylor argued that current PoR methods weaken security by exposing sensitive data. He likened it to publishing bank account details and insisted AI analysis would reveal dozens of ways such disclosures could compromise long-term safety. Drawing from the FTX and Mt. Gox disasters, Saylor suggested that blindly chasing transparency without secure methods could do more harm than good.

Notably, Bitcoin veteran Whale Panda (Stefan Jespers) called it a “major red flag,” stressing that Bitcoin’s core value lies in its transparency. Critics argue that there are ways to verify holdings securely, without compromising asset safety. For example, Bitwise uses a “proof of holdings” method for its crypto products, and many crypto exchanges regularly publish audit reports to prove solvency. These examples contradict Saylor’s claim that such actions are inherently risky. Old Wounds and New Doubts Resurface The backlash has even reignited old doubts. Some critics pointed to Saylor’s infamous $6 billion loss in 2000 due to an accounting scandal, suggesting a pattern of avoiding transparency. Others are reviving conspiracy theories that MicroStrategy may not hold actual Bitcoin, but instead, paper-based derivatives. While Saylor remains a central figure in Bitcoin advocacy, this latest remark has cast a shadow over his approach to transparency, raising new questions about how institutional players should handle crypto accountability.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 08:16:49

On May 27, an Instagram account belonging to American rap trio, Migos, was reportedly compromised by hackers who gained access to Gokal’s personal information and used it to dox him and his wife. The now-deleted Instagram posts featured pictures of the Solana ( SOL ) Labs President holding his driver’s license and passport, both unredacted. Another post featured a woman, claimed by the hackers to be Gokal’s wife, holding her driver’s license. The seven pictures were shared to the 13 million followers on Migos’ Instagram account. One of the posts shared Gokal’s personal contact information, including his phone number. The poster then urged people to “spam” the Solana co-founder, effectively doxxing him. A caption written on the post that showed Gokal holding his driver’s license seemingly implied that he was initially blackmailed before his personal information was leaked on social media. Tagging Gokal’s Instagram account, the hacker wrote: “you should’ve paid the 40 BTC.” At current prices, 40 Bitcoin ( BTC ) would be equal to around $4.3 million.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-supporter-michael-saylor-says-publishing-proof-of-reserves-could-be-risky-for-investors-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin advocate and Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) executive chairman Michael Saylor called the approach “a bad idea” because publishing institutional-grade on-chain proofs of reserves could pose serious security risks. Michael Saylor: “Proof-of-Reserve Chain Threatens Corporate Security” “The conventional way of issuing proof of reserves today is actually insecure,” Saylor said at a side event at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. “This method undermines the security of the issuer, the custodian, the exchanges and the investors. This is not a good idea, on the contrary, it is a bad idea,” he said. Saylor declined to directly respond to Blockware Solutions principal analyst Mitchell Askew’s question about whether Strategy would publish its own proof of reserves. “Publishing Wallet Addresses Puts Company Security at Risk” Cryptocurrency exchanges and ETF issuers have started publishing proof of reserves to ensure transparency and show that user assets are actually available, especially after the collapse of FTX in 2022. Major players such as Binance, Kraken, OKX, and Bitwise have adopted this method. However, Saylor argued that this practice offered one-way transparency, emphasizing that it only showed the assets held by the company and not its liabilities, that is, its debts. Saylor also noted that publishing wallet addresses openly would leave organizations open to cyberattacks, adding, “Ask an AI, ‘How would publishing all wallet addresses compromise company security over time?’ It will give you 50 pages of security risks.” Strategy is currently the world’s largest institutional Bitcoin holder with 576,230 Bitcoins. The company’s reserves are worth around $62.6 billion. It is followed by mining company MARA Holdings with 48,137 Bitcoins. Today, more than 110 publicly traded companies around the world hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. But according to Saylor, not every practice implemented in the name of transparency, especially methods such as onchain proof of reserve, aligns with the basic principles of corporate security. *This is not investment advice.

The stock has surged due to short squeezes and meme-stock dynamics in the latest days as the company continues to ""aggressively"" accumulate Bitcoin and adopt a meme-stock character. Ultimately, it's a public listing that could be enhanced by short squeezes as it's heavily shorted, but Bitcoin underlies it, and it is already extremely volatile. Discussing a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) levered play like Tokyo-based Metaplanet Inc. ( MTPLF ) is not in the norm for us, but it has been hit by some interesting dynamics a little bit unique to a Japanese issue. There has been a short squeeze as the company adopts some meme-stock trading characteristics, and its exceptional short selling ratios has meant a squeeze has been in with a major scarcity of stocks available across the illiquid US listing and the Japanese listing that further rocketed the shares. It gained almost 200% since late April, moving up by a multiple of BTC's rise in that period, prior to that mostly trading in line with BTC. The company pivoted into this Bitcoin strategy recently, and we will say right away we have no interest in the company. They are raising major funds to speculate on Bitcoin, and their income generating strategies will to a significant degree be driven by selling put options. They may be hedging, but we couldn't find any disclosure to that effect. They did say they were cash collateralised in their option writing strategy at least. Of course, they hold massive amounts of Bitcoin, an asset whose long-term viability we seriously question, and their operating business also depends on Bitcoin going up it would seem, something we aren't going to bet on. Breakdown As far as we understood, the company is employing an all in strategy on Bitcoin. Initially, the business was focused on a hotel location in central Tokyo and also something in Hiroshima, doing hospitality, but then one day they decided that on the conviction that Bitcoin is somehow going to be the future, they would raise considerable amounts of cash, around 40 billion JPY it would seem in equity based on the balance sheet , and also some debt it would seem though they've repaid some of it, cumulatively raising around 80 billion JPY, with a plan of putting it into Bitcoin. Additionally, they have a "" treasury management "" business which is basically dominated by selling put options that are ""cash collateralised"" also on Bitcoin. They hold around 51 billion JPY in Bitcoin as of the quarterly figures, around 90% of the company's total assets. Though now it would seem that have over 100 billion JPY in Bitcoin . They seem to have gotten into this already from the beginning of 2024 when they started to purchase Bitcoin. Segment Results (Q1 Earnings) The majority of their earnings at this point at the operating level, before accounting for the impact of gains on Bitcoin, are now from the Bitcoin income generation strategy. The ordinary income contains the gains they are making on Bitcoin, which they are accumulating ""aggressively"" and as a long-term investment. In other words, Metaplanet is a Bitcoin bet, a bit like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). Metaplanet is one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin in the world. Comments There are some advantages to Metaplanet: There are some tax advantages in investing in Metaplanet as opposed to directly in Bitcoin, but this only seems to apply to Japanese tax residents. The fact that they can raise capital, particularly from debtors but also from shareholders despite the NAV premium, is very good for prior shareholders. Debt capital is also very cheap in Japan. Despite Metaplanet's employment of leverage, investors in Metaplanet are limited in liability by virtue of it being a public limited company, provided investors aren't using leverage to invest in the stock. It is highly shorted , meaning short squeezes are possible with stock to cover shorts possibly becoming suddenly very scarce, and this could become a new majorly followed meme stock. With the TSE circuit breakers kicking in frequently with it is also causes covering to be harassed. It is the most shorted stock in Japan as of a few days ago. But then there are clearly some major questions: There is no track record, yet the company is filling their presentations with data about how they're the best performing stock in the Japanese market, dominated mainly by industrial auto names and other slow movers (not as big of an accomplishment). Similarly, we don't really have much information on their income generating strategy other than that they are writing put options, which of course could one day go very badly for them. At least it's cash collateralised, which we'll take to mean they are not employing a lot of leverage. We entirely question the viability of Bitcoin. Other than the obvious, which is that it's very volatile (not a good store of value), mining is very energy and relatively time intensive, and it's not a practical currency especially compared to more reasonably managed fiat currencies, we also doubt the validity of the decentralisation principle which is at the centre of Bitcoin. In short, pool mining is the only logical way to go about finding nonces in a proof of work system. This means that coordinated miners are essentially causing centralisation , and pool mining has to be administrated by some entity. These could be compromised or may already be compromised. It's a vulnerability, and the more threatening Bitcoin becomes as an alternative to fiat, the more likely this vulnerability will be exploited if possible - though this risk is remote. It trades above NAV consistently. Currently, it is trading at multiples of its approximate NAV (around 100 billion JPY in Bitcoin, but market CAP is around 580 bn) Bottom Line As far as Metaplanet is concerned, while it may be interesting as an enhanced Bitcoin play in the event of a short squeeze, also because if it becomes used as a speculative tool to trade Bitcoin on the public markets at key moments shares will become especially scarce and buyers can also worsen squeezes by competing for shares looking to be used for cover, it is ultimately a newfangled Bitcoin play. You have to want to own Bitcoin to be interested in Metaplanet. If it becomes a meme stock, it may rocket, but it will also become incredibly volatile.

In a post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author tells his 2.7 million followers that a sudden lack of demand for US bonds is resulting in money printing, which debases the dollar. “The end is here: what if you threw a party and no one showed up? That is what happened [May 20th]. The Fed held an auction for US Bonds and no one showed up. So the Fed quietly bought $50 billion of its own fake money with fake money. The party is over. Hyperinflation is here. Millions, young and old to be wiped out financially.” Kiyosaki also says that silver, gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) are a hedge against rising inflation, and he predicts massive price targets for the assets as a result. “Good news. Gold will go to $25,000. Silver to $70. Bitcoin to $500,000 to $1 million… The end I have been warning the world about is here. May God have mercy on our souls.” Lastly, he says that the dwindling supply of available BTC for sale will drive the flagship crypto asset’s price higher. “I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich, so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years – and maybe make you very rich.

As per the local media report , Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira unveiled the country’s bold new direction at a May 26 investment seminar in Bangkok. The best part of this plan is that it will not impact the local currency, and no one knows that the user paid in crypto. It’s indeed a great initiative since many foreign nationals were in favour of this innovative move. Crypto Spending Without the Hassle Thailand, to attract tourists, will soon allow them to link their crypto holdings to credit card platforms for seamless spending. In this model, users pay in crypto, but merchants receive Thai baht, often without knowing crypto was used. This clever setup minimizes risks to the domestic currency and could be rolled out quickly, pending infrastructure and regulatory readiness. Sweeping Financial Reforms Coming Alongside the crypto tourism push, Thailand is reviewing outdated laws that separate the traditional capital markets and digital assets. Pichai emphasized the need for a unified legal framework and fewer restrictions on institutional investors like life insurers, who are currently limited to low-risk government bonds. Upcoming reforms may let them invest more freely in equities and private assets. To enhance enforcement and market fairness, a draft law is being prepared to expand the Thai SEC’s authority, allowing it to take major cases straight to prosecutors. The government is also eyeing tighter rules on high-frequency trading and reforms around treasury stocks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Goes All In on Bitcoin Mining With 2,000MW Energy Move , Pichai Backs Blockchain Innovation Pichai reiterated his support for digital assets, highlighting the upcoming launch of blockchain-based “G-Tokens” that will allow retail investors to buy fractional government bonds.

After going back down as far as $106,600 over the last few days, Bitcoin is now consolidating above this level. Is this about to become good horizontal support and a springboard into the next stage of this bull market? Bond market under severe duress Cracks are opening in the global monetary system. Bond markets across the world are in disarray. In the US, buyers just cannot be found for longer duration bonds, and this is revealed in constantly rising 10, 20, and 30 year yields that just can’t seem to be kept down no matter what the US treasury does about it. The 10 year yield has dropped over the last few days from over 4.6% to 4.45%, but a higher high was put in, and this could be followed by a higher low, meaning that the trend could continue to go up. It might be argued that trust is the main element that is lacking in government bonds in these incredibly uncertain times, as more people begin to realise that governments are being forced to debase their currencies, thereby stealing the purchasing power of citizens, in order to be able to roll over the debt and keep the system going - albeit on life support. Bitcoin becoming more attractive It’s in this world that the Bitcoin life raft is floating. It has just surpassed both Amazon and Google to become the 5th biggest asset by market capitalization , at around $2.17 trillion. That said, there are still many across social and mainstream media platforms that would have us think that Bitcoin has made a market cycle top and that it’s generally downhill from here. With the greatest respect to many of these detractors who undoubtedly do have sound economic credentials, why would investors sell their Bitcoin now into fiat currency? Fiat is the problem - not Bitcoin. Fiat can be magicked into existence in the blink of an eye - Bitcoin cannot. This gives Bitcoin an attraction that puts it in the same category as gold, although more gold can be dug out of the ground to boost its supply. $BTC short-term chart Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the $106,000 horizontal support (orange line) has been well respected. The previous all-time high resistance (blue line) is now in the process of being flipped into support. If the bulls are successful in doing this it would likely only be a matter of time before a new all-time high is made, and a more sustained surge takes the price to higher levels. The importance of the $106,000 horizontal support Source: TradingView The daily chart shows just how important the $106,000 horizontal level has become. It rests on some of the daily candle tops of the big bull flag, and this support is also noticeable in recent price action. It may be that the bulls aren’t ready to make their move higher yet, and there could be some more sideways price action that tests this strong support base. Having said that, if the current resistance does become support, we would perhaps be more likely to see upwards price action from here. Of course, there is also the possibility of a negative or positive catalyst that spurs the price in one direction or the other. Bitcoin is the life raft out of the system Nevertheless, asset prices are imaginably going to rise from here, benefitting from the amount of money printing or other methods that introduce more liquidity into the system. Ready to climb higher into the final stage of a cycle that could be about to increase in duration, Bitcoin is the soundest money out there. If central banks are buying gold, it means that trust in the monetary system is dwindling. Buying Bitcoin is your life raft out of this system.

Here’s How to Turn $1K to $20K,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-coming-heres-how-to-turn-1k-to-20k/,"The post Altcoin Season Coming? Here’s How to Turn $1K to $20K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With crypto markets heating gain and Bitcoin just hitting a new all-time high . Many people are now wondering, can $1,000 turn into $10K, $20K, or even more with crypto in 2025? George from CryptosRUS says it’s possible, but only if you’re smart about it. He recently shared his plan for 2025, including which coins to choose, when to buy, and what mistakes to avoid. Don’t Chase 100x Dreams Too Fast In a recent interview with Altcoin Daily, George laid out his thoughts on how newcomers can grow small investments without falling into risky traps. George started by saying it’s not realistic to expect a 100x return overnight. Trying too hard to turn $1,000 into $100,000 quickly often leads people into bad trades. Instead of gambling, he recommends aiming for steady gains and keeping your expectations in check. Don’t Ignore Bitcoin For someone just starting, George believes the best place to put most of your money is in pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. While many skip Bitcoin because it looks “too expensive,” to make real money, he sees it differently. He points out that even a 10x or 20x return is possible over a full cycle—which still turns $1K into $10K or $20K. Compared to traditional investments like stocks or bonds, crypto still wins on speed and return. Look Out for Meme Coins—but Be Smart George doesn’t dismiss meme coins . In fact, in previous cycles, he mentioned coins like Pepe that saw massive growth, 20x to 50x in some cases. However, he stresses that this space is tricky. Thousands of new meme coins launch daily, but only a tiny few go viral. Even popular ones like WIF, Bonk, or Pepe are currently down 50% or more from their peaks. His advice? Don’t jump into every new coin blindly. Instead, watch the market, look for momentum, and if the meme coin trend heats up again, then it might be time to take a chance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price to Hit $135K by July 2025 , Strategy Over Hype In the end, George suggests a simple plan: put a good portion into reliable names, likely Bitcoin and a few strong altcoins, and keep an eye on the market. If conditions improve and memes regain strength, shift some money into trending tokens. “$1,000 might not become $100K fast,” he said, “but turning it into $10K or $20K? That’s very possible—if you play it smart.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The material is suspected to be KYC images, which raised questions about whether the source may be linked to a recent Coinbase data breach. The caption accompanying the doxxed information read, “You should’ve paid the 40 BTC,” suggesting an extortion attempt. The bio was also changed to “CHECK BIO FOR MEMECOIN” after the hack. Gokal’s accounts were reportedly socially engineered, and the attackers posted the materials via the hijacked Migos IG account after he refused to pay. Solana’s Gokal says hackers have been attempting to control his social media accounts TLDR >Raj got social engineered for access to an email account a few days ago >Attacker attempted to extort him with PII obtained from the account after but he didn’t pay >Same attacker compromised Migos Instagram account today >Attacker posted Raj’s PII from the Migos account — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) May 27, 2025 Last week, Solana’s Raj tweeted that attackers tried to gain control of his email and social media accounts. On May 27, hackers hijacked the Migos Instagram account, which has over 13 million followers, and leaked personal information about Solana co-founder and his wife in a blackmail attempt. The attackers demanded a ransom of 40 BTC (~$4.4 million) through posts that remained live for roughly 90 minutes, gaining thousands of interactions before being deleted. Experts like online sleuth ZachXBT believe phishing and social engineering were used in the breach and highlighted persistent security flaws on Instagram, mainly affecting inactive celebrity accounts. Meta is under fire for its slow response, prompting renewed calls for stronger security measures and quicker user support in hacking incidents. The Roll Up’s co-founders and host, Andy, claimed that the Migos had not posted anything since February 15th, 2024, adding that the incident was very unfortunate for Gokal and made IG policies against doxxing look weak so far. “Attackers have been trying to take control of my email, social media, Google, Apple, etc. this past week. If you see anything suspect (token launch, soliciting funds, etc) that means they got through. Be careful out there.” – Raj Gokal , Co-founder of Solana According to Andy, Instagram deleted the posts to cover up Gokal’s personal information as best as possible. Still, he added that there appeared to be a guy, “Arvind,” who also had their SOL balance leaked through the same Migos IG. Also, a link was posted to a Telegram group that appeared to be selling unreleased music. Coinbase discloses a months-long breach of data affecting 69.46K customers Coinbase disclosed last week that a months-long data breach resulted in the theft of personal and financial information from at least 69,461 customers, less than 1% of Coinbase’s monthly transacting users. The US-based crypto company’s filing said the breach dated back to December 26, 2024, and continued until earlier this month. Coinbase also faces an action lawsuit after its stock prices dipped because of the disclosure of data breaches. Plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase failed to disclose the breach on time, leading to a stock price dip. The breach occurred when cybercriminals used social engineering to bribe overseas customer support agents into stealing sensitive data from Coinbase systems. The company received an anonymous email from the hackers on May 11, which included a ransom demand for $20 million in exchange for not releasing the stolen information. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, responded to the incident by stating that the company had notified the DOJ and was working with other U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to pursue criminal charges against these bad actors. The U.S. Justice Department has since opened an investigation into the security breach. Coinbase clarified that some personal information was compromised, including names, contact details, masked Social Security numbers, and bank account information. However, no customer funds, passwords, private keys, or wallet access were affected. Additionally, the attackers did not gain access to hot or cold wallets. Coinbase Prime users were also not compromised.

It points out that Bitcoin’s existing cryptographic protections— SHA-256 and ECDSA —are secure against classical computers but could be broken by quantum algorithms like Shor’s. This concern echoes the findings in NIST’s 2024 post-quantum cryptography standards . Adding urgency to this, Google’s recent breakthrough , led by Craig Gidney, shows that cracking RSA encryption could be possible with less than 1 million qubits , a sharp drop from earlier estimates of 20 million. As quantum computing advances, with IBM aiming for 100,000 qubits by 2033 , the crypto industry faces a shrinking timeline to adapt. The Bitcoin developer community is already aware of the threat. According to @21Mfacts on X, it’s possible to introduce quantum-resistant cryptography via soft forks , avoiding full network splits. Meanwhile, companies like SEALSQ are ahead of the curve, using NIST-approved algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium to secure blockchain systems—signaling that industry solutions are already taking shape.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-27 09:22:20

Crypto whales have been accumulating SOL betting on its continued dominance as Ethereum’s top competitor. Meanwhile rising star Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention for potentially steeper gains. The project is currently in Presale Phase 5, already raking in over $9.3 million with over 11,500 investors participating. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 5 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 100% by the time the token hits exchanges. Mutuum Finance could hit $2 soon after launch. Solana (SOL) Targets $250 in June Amid Bullish Momentum Solana (SOL) is experiencing renewed investor enthusiasm with its current price around $174.17. Analysts are eyeing a potential surge to $250 in June fueled by a combination of institutional interest ecosystem growth and DeFi resurgence. As developers flock to Solana for its high-speed low-fee infrastructure its utility continues to drive long-term investor confidence. The network’s high-speed transactions and low fees continue to attract developers and users alike, solidifying Solana’s position as a leading layer-1 blockchain. As the broader crypto market gains momentum emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also capturing investor attention for their growth potential. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Certik Audit Completed: Mutuum Finance Solidifies Trust and Transparency Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance has now officially completed its Certik smart contract audit, reinforcing the platform’s commitment to safety and reliability. Their open-source smart contracts are secure in design, instilling trust among users. Additionally, the platform is built for compatibility with both non-EVM and EVM blockchains, broadening access and increasing liquidity across ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.03, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A 16.67% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.035 in the next phase. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. Both Solana and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are capturing major attention in the crypto space, each offering compelling value in their own right. Solana is poised for a potential breakout to $250 by June, powered by strong institutional interest, expanding DeFi activity, and its unmatched transaction efficiency. Meanwhile Mutuum Finance has surged past $9.3 million raised in Presale Phase 5 drawing over 11,500 investors with its dual lending model and recently completed Certik audit. At the current presale price of $0.03 and a confirmed listing price of $0.06 early participants could realize up to 100% gains—or more with post-launch projections as high as $3. Now is the time to explore Mutuum Finance before the next price phase kicks in.

Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has received up to 2.19 percent of a boost in the day. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to showcase a bullish market scenario. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $20.52 level by 2027 and above $42.11 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing an increasing phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining value, and so is UNI. As buyers gained confidence around $6.728, positive sentiment took over the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $9.72, while the average price is expected to be around $8.10. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.2 and $8.3; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $42.11 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

Metaplanet is currently the most shorted stock in Japan, data shows, reflecting mounting skepticism among hedge funds over the company’s valuation and perceived NAV distortion. Currently trading at 1,116 yen, Metalpanet’s stock is up over 400% in the last six months and over 200% this month alone, fueled by the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy.. Often dubbed as ‘Japan’s Strategy,’ Metaplanet adopted a Bitcoin-first treasury strategy in 2024, which has contributed to its meteoric stock rally.

The UK-based exchange plans to open a physical office during the second quarter in Nigeria — its “fastest-growing market” in West Africa — along with broader expansion efforts in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, according to a May 27 report by Bloomberg. “Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa, reportedly said. The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

The altcoins are slightly in the red on a daily scale, including the recent high-flyer HYPE, which has lost some steam after the latest ATH. BTC Back to $109.5K History was made last Wednesday when, after a few days of substantial volatility and rejection below the $107,000 level, the primary cryptocurrency managed to break through and shot past its January 2025 all-time high of around $109,100. The asset flew to $109,800 that day but was quickly stopped and driven south by around three grand. However, that correction was short-lived as the bulls resumed control of the market and initiated an even more impressive leg up on Thursday – the so-called Bitcoin Pizza Day. Back then, BTC skyrocketed to almost $112,000 to chart a fresh all-time high. Trump’s tariff recommendations against the EU on Friday brought some pain and uncertainty to the market, as BTC slipped back down to $107,500. However, it defended that level and stood just above it during the weekend. Bitcoin started to gain traction again on Monday and jumped to a daily high of $110,500 before it slumped to $107,500 later in the evening. As of now, though, it has recovered most losses and stands around $109,500. Its market cap has remained close to $2.180 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 61%. BTCUSD.

This development, alongside the launch of RLUSD on Multi-Asset Margining, is already stirring conversations about its potential ripple effects across the broader XRP ecosystem. Bill Morgan, a prominent legal expert and well-known voice in the XRP community, reacted to the announcement on X, calling it “doubly good news for the XRP ecosystem.” However, despite recognizing the significance of this update, Morgan tempered expectations by noting that he did not expect the market to react immediately with a price surge. He stated plainly, “I expect the market not to react to the news and no increase in the price of XRP.” Doubly good news for the XRP ecosystem. I expect the market to have no reaction to the news and now increase in the price of XRP. https://t.co/dOtl18CByw — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 27, 2025 BitMEX Expands XRP Utility for Derivatives Traders BitMEX, one of the world’s largest and most established cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, has long been a major player in offering leveraged trading products to institutional and retail traders. By adding XRP as a margin asset, BitMEX is effectively increasing XRP’s utility, allowing traders to use it as collateral in derivative contracts. This development is significant because it expands XRP’s role beyond cross-border payments, establishing it as a valuable asset in high-volume crypto trading. Introducing RLUSD to Multi-Asset Margining further enhances BitMEX’s ecosystem by allowing traders to optimize capital efficiency, reduce liquidation risks, and gain broader flexibility in managing leveraged positions. The addition of XRP to BitMEX, alongside RLUSD, has sparked renewed debate about XRP’s market potential and its prospects for institutional adoption. Why the Market Reaction May Lag Despite the clear technological and functional advantages, Bill Morgan’s tempered expectations reflect a broader understanding of how the crypto market processes news. Historically, XRP’s price movements have not always correlated immediately with positive ecosystem developments. For instance, regulatory overhang from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ongoing legal entanglements with Ripple has cast a long shadow over investor sentiment, sometimes dampening the impact of fundamentally positive news. Morgan’s comment underscores the gap between ecosystem progress and price action. While XRP’s increased integration into trading platforms like BitMEX signals growing institutional and retail utility, such advancements often require sustained market confidence and broader adoption to translate into meaningful price rallies. Investors have grown cautious, frequently waiting for clear legal resolutions or macroeconomic shifts before piling into speculative price movements. The Broader Legal Context and Market Sentiment Bill Morgan’s influence in the XRP community stems from his legal expertise and commentary on the SEC vs. Ripple case, one of the most closely watched legal battles in the crypto world. Since Judge Analisa Torres’ landmark ruling in July 2023 concluded that Ripple’s programmatic XRP sales did not constitute securities offerings, XRP has been fighting to reclaim its position among top-tier digital assets. However, the lingering effects of the lawsuit, pending appeals, and broader regulatory uncertainties have made market participants hesitant, even as Ripple secures new global partnerships and expands its technological footprint. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This BitMEX development adds to a growing list of use cases and integrations that strengthen XRP’s fundamental value proposition. Nevertheless, as Morgan rightly points out, legal clarity and regulatory confidence remain key levers for unlocking widespread market enthusiasm and boosting the XRP price. A Stronger Ecosystem, But Cautious Optimism XRP’s integration as a margin asset on BitMEX is undeniably a major step forward, marking another milestone in XRP’s journey from a specialized remittance token to a multifaceted digital asset with diverse use cases. It reflects a vote of confidence from one of the industry’s top derivatives exchanges and offers practical utility for traders seeking liquidity, flexibility, and capital efficiency. Yet, as Bill Morgan’s commentary emphasizes, the road to sustained price appreciation may be longer than market participants hope. While announcements like these lay the foundation for future growth, they do not guarantee immediate rallies. Instead, they represent part of a larger puzzle: strengthening the ecosystem, deepening market integrations, and, most importantly, navigating the complex legal and regulatory landscape that still defines XRP’s trajectory. In summary, while the BitMEX announcement is indeed “doubly good news” for XRP, investors and traders may need to balance their excitement with measured patience. With ongoing legal challenges and a cautious market environment, the path to a sustained XRP price rally will likely require more than technical integrations — it will demand regulatory breakthroughs and renewed market confidence.

Foreign sales, adjusted for seasonal changes, fell by 36% compared to March. Imports from the US also decreased by 15%, according to a statement from the customs office in Bern. The sharp downturn follows two months of robust export activity to the US, suggesting that Swiss exporters had accelerated shipments ahead of the anticipated tariffs, which President Trump signaled on April 2. Switzerland seeks a trade agreement with the US Switzerland’s overall trade figures showed a decline in exports and imports, resulting in a record trade surplus of 6.3 billion Swiss francs worth $7.7 billion. According to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Switzerland had taken the lead in seeking a trade agreement with the United States. Bessent revealed this after the Alpine nation hosted the US-China trade discussions over the weekend. Before the talks with the two countries, Swiss officials met with Bessent, his team, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to discuss Switzerland’s trade issues with the US. These concerns were raised after the United States imposed a 31% tariff on Switzerland, while it set tariffs of 20% on the European Union and 10% on Britain. This decision surprised Swiss officials, and since then, major Swiss companies have committed to investing significantly in the US. It is worth noting that Trump later suspended many global tariffs, lowering them to a standard rate of 10%. Following Switzerland’s extensive talk on Trump’s tariffs, Bessent noted that the UK and Switzerland had moved to the front of the line for trade deals, but the EU has been much slower. During a press conference in Geneva, he commented about Switzerland’s role as a go-between, especially as its neutrality appears to be changing and Gulf countries are becoming more active. The reason for the EU being slower in reaching a trade deal was that the EU had indicated that it would not agree to an unfair deal on US tariffs and has suggested possible counteractions. Last week, Britain quickly finalized a trade agreement with US President Donald Trump’s administration, but it is limited in scope. On the other hand, Switzerland long aimed to be a mediator during global crises, and analysts noted that it made a special effort this time. They highlighted the choice of location for the negotiations, which took place at the private home of Switzerland’s UN ambassador. Switzerland seeks closer ties with the EU as Trump’s tariff becomes more uncertain US President Donald Trump’s choice to impose higher tariffs on Switzerland than on most European countries shocked the export-driven nation, leading it to seek closer ties with the European Union as it worked to manage the consequences. In December, Switzerland took a first step toward deeper economic ties by reaching a political agreement with Brussels to improve their trading relationship. Though this EU agreement needed to go through a lengthy approval process, Swiss President and Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter highlighted it in an interview as she evaluated Switzerland’s options after the US trade decision. In the Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Keller-Sutter Highlighted the urgency of the relationship, revealing that they wanted to stabilize and deepen relations with the EU. One of the reasons behind the urgency for this relationship was that Neutral Switzerland had built a successful, open economy based on a low-tax business model and direct democracy, making it wealthier than almost all EU member states. This success fostered national pride and resistance to becoming part of the EU. After the tariffs were imposed, Keller-Sutter quickly contacted EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and agreed to keep close communication.

Speaking at a side event during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 26, Saylor called the widely adopted transparency method “a bad idea.” Saylor was responding to a question from Blockware Solutions’ lead analyst Mitchell Askew, who asked whether Strategy would consider publishing its own proof-of-reserves . While Saylor did not provide a direct answer, he made it clear that he believes the practice is fundamentally flawed. “The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” he stated, adding that it weakens the overall security framework by making wallet addresses traceable. A Growing Industry Trend Post-FTX The push for proof-of-reserves gained momentum after the high-profile collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. In the wake of that event, many crypto firms — including Binance, Kraken, OKX, and Bitwise — began publishing cryptographic proof that they held enough assets to back customer deposits. The goal was to restore trust in the industry and assure users their funds were safe. But Saylor remains unconvinced. He pointed out that these proofs often only demonstrate what a company owns, not what it owes, offering an incomplete picture of its financial health. He also emphasized that publicizing wallet addresses opens the door to serious vulnerabilities. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses,” he said. “Go to AI, put it in deep think mode… it would write 50 pages of security problems.” Saylor: A Bitcoin Maximalist Saylor’s Strategy is currently the largest corporate Bitcoin holder , with 576,230 BTC worth around $62.6 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. The company is followed by MARA Holdings, which holds over 48,000 BTC. Globally, more than 110 publicly listed companies have Bitcoin on their balance sheets. While the crypto community continues to debate the merits of transparency versus security, Saylor’s stance signals a cautionary approach. For him, safeguarding digital assets means more than public accountability — it means keeping critical data private.

Here Are Analyst Views and Technical Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-a-correction-coming-for-bitcoin-btc-here-are-analyst-views-and-technical-data/,"Bitcoin Could Retreat to $100K, Technical Signals: Sign of Weakening Momentum According to technical analyst Omkar Godbole, the BTC price could rally outside the ascending channel and test the key support level at $100,000. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the highest market value, was trading at $109,500 at the time of writing, according to Binance TR data, testing the ascending trend line stretching from $75,000 to above $110,000. According to TradingView data, price action has struggled to gain upward momentum over the past 24 hours. Despite reports that the Trump family-owned media company was planning to buy $3 billion worth of crypto, the market did not react strongly to this development. What Do Technical Indicators Say? Godbole noted that the 30-day rate of change (ROC), a key indicator measuring Bitcoin’s momentum, is showing a “distinctive negative divergence.” This indicator is indicating weakening momentum, with Bitcoin price forming lower highs, although it is still within an ascending channel. Another noteworthy signal is the MACD histogram. The transition of this indicator into the negative territory indicates a decrease in trend strength and that the upward movement may slow down. The combination of these technical developments means that Bitcoin could break out of the current ascending channel and retest the $100,000 psychological support level. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Despite all these short-term risks, the overall outlook remains positive. In particular, the “golden cross” formed by the intersection of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) indicates that the long-term uptrend continues. According to analysts, this short-term correction can be considered a healthy consolidation process and will not shake the foundations of the bull market. However, investors are advised to closely monitor technical indicators. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is a Correction Coming for Bitcoin (BTC)?

Life insurance companies in Japan—known for holding long-term government bonds—are now selling off these assets. They’re not doing it to make profits or to react to short-term market trends. They’re doing it because they have no choice. These insurers have long been seen as reliable holders of government debt , often ignoring price swings because they invest for the long haul. But rising interest rates and changing financial conditions have made that strategy too risky. They are now being forced to sell, not out of strategy, but out of necessity. Understanding the Duration Gap Problem This crisis starts with something called the “duration gap.” Simply put, this is the mismatch between how long insurers expect to hold assets like bonds and how quickly they may need to pay out liabilities. Japanese insurers typically hold long-term bonds—some lasting 10 to 30 years—but now, rising interest rates are making these holdings too dangerous. The value of long-term bonds drops sharply when interest rates rise, leaving insurers exposed to sudden losses. They’re being margin-wrecked —meaning their losses are so big they’re being forced to sell to protect their capital. Why Japan’s Bond Market Matters to the World This is not just a Japan issue. Japan is a major player in global finance , holding large amounts of U.S. and European government debt. Its institutions also play a big role in currency markets, especially in how they use Japanese yen (JPY) to invest in other countries. When they start pulling back, the effects are global: Yields (interest rates) on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) rise The Bank of Japan may have to act, or risk losing control The yen weakens, while the U.S. dollar strengthens Risky assets worldwide start to drop in value as money moves to safety The Last Safety Net Is Breaking For years, the world believed that government bonds were “safe” assets—things that never lose value and always have a buyer. That belief is now under pressure. Japanese life insurers were the last big investors who didn’t care about short-term losses , and now they do. Their sudden exit is a sign that even the most trusted part of the financial system is no longer stable. This is causing reactions like: Bigger price swings in U.S. government bonds More investment in gold and Bitcoin Less money flowing into riskier emerging markets Bitcoin’s Moment in the Spotlight When trusted financial systems start to show cracks, people look for alternatives. Assets like Bitcoin and gold—things that don’t rely on governments or interest rates—become attractive . Not because the world is ending, but because the idea of “safe” government bonds is being questioned. This is one of those rare moments when the financial world wakes up and realizes: what we believed to be stable may not be so after all.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-27 09:52:13

Schwartz’s remarks, shared through multiple clips of a recent stage talk, emphasized the challenges Ripple has faced and the foundation now being laid for a more viable and institutionally integrated crypto ecosystem. Schwartz clarified that the route for Ripple and XRP has been indirect and complex. He explained that while Ripple committed to payments in 2014, the process has not followed a linear path. Schwartz emphasized that for global adoption to materialize, users must be able to access their funds instantly, especially for essential expenses. His statements suggest that while the journey has been long, adoption has begun, and the path is becoming clearer. This wasn’t a roadmap. It was a confession. Ripple’s CTO just admitted that crypto’s path to adoption won’t be clean or direct, but it’s already begun. And for the first time in years, XRP is in position to lead. Here’s what David Schwartz just revealed and why it matters now… pic.twitter.com/We71vwlugV — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) May 23, 2025 Functional Balance and Ledger Evolution Discussing the XRP Ledger (XRPL), Schwartz positioned it between Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of capability. Bitcoin offers limited functions, and Ethereum is broadly programmable, but the XRPL is designed for fixed functions, covering most financial use cases without the unpredictability of custom smart contracts. The XRPL’s fixed function design lets users engage with the blockchain without the uncertainty they would have on Ethereum’s network, where they cannot verify the functions of smart contracts or audit them. He also pointed to recent advancements, including the addition of decentralized identity features and automated market makers (AMMs), decentralized ID, lending protocols, and more. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 U.S. Market Reentry and Regulatory Clarity One of the most notable admissions in Schwartz’s remarks involved Ripple’s strategic shift away from the U.S. due to unclear regulatory pressures. He explained that Ripple had to move hiring, development, and customer acquisition overseas. However, the climate is beginning to shift . Ripple’s licensed payment product, Ripple Payments, now operates within the U.S., and Schwartz expressed optimism that soft regulatory barriers are starting to ease. Schwartz highlighted the need for “predictability,” stressing that Ripple will comply with regulations as long as they are clearly defined. Liquidity, Rational Markets, and the Path Forward Schwartz noted that crypto markets behave rationally with sufficient liquidity and access, with prices reflecting adoption odds. Applying this rationale to XRP, Jungle Inc. emphasized that recent gains are not driven by speculation, but by increasing institutional access and improved infrastructure. Schwartz highlighted increasing ties between traditional finance and crypto, expecting tokenized real-world assets to boost DeFi. According to Jungle Inc., XRP is now positioned to lead in this emerging phase, having navigated years of regulatory uncertainty and infrastructure development.

As per stats, there is a high chance that Bitcoin might go up to $250,000 by 2026, but what about coins like Shiba Inu and Cardano? How high can they go? Besides, the meme-utility project, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , would have officially launched by then surpassing both SHIB and ADA. With YETIO 100K giveaway now live, attracting more investors to its presale. Shiba Inu and Cardano’s State in 2026 The meme coin Shiba Inu has been showing its potential since Bitcoin climbed the ladder. Though it has been experiencing a dip of 1.14% in the past 24 hours , the entire week was quite prosperous for Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu price went as high as $0.0000160 on May 23, 2025, the time when Bitcoin was moving past the $111,000 mark. It clearly shows that Shiba Inu’s growth depends majorly on Bitcoin. Besides, the burn rate of Shiba Inu has increased by more than 108% in the last 24 hours which is increasing its scarcity in the market. Looking at the token burn mechanism of Shiba Inu, and its exponential growth as compared to Bitcoin, there are high chances that the meme coin might be somewhere near the $0.001 mark by 2026. On the other hand, Cardano has also been showing the same pattern as Shiba Inu in terms of growth. Though its value has decreased by 1.05% in the past week (currently standing at $0.7363), Cardano did show some pretty good growth on Friday. ADA price went as high as $0.8395 on May 23, 2025. As per reports, the trading volume of Cardano has increased by $1.2 billion despite the coin showing declining values. Moreover, the Cardano ecosystem is also growing, and as per data, the stablecoin market cap of the said coin has increased to $30.1 million, a whopping 30% rise . As Cardano continues to move forward, there are high chances that it will reach the $0.1 mark by the end of 2025, and it might hover around the same in 2026. YETIO Rising In 2026 Despite being in the presale era, YETIO has managed to bring in more than 200% profit for the investors. From a $0.012 token value to currently marked at $0.041, YETIO has managed to raise more than $4.2 million during this period, which is quite remarkable for any project. The growing value and investors’ interests show trust that the project will do well after the launch period. The way YETIO engages with its community through various activities and bonuses ensures that the project will remain in the market for a long time. One of the classic examples of YETIO’s community-engaging activity is its current giveaway of $100,000 worth of tokens . The team is conducting a massive giveaway where five users will be rewarded with $20,000 of YETIO tokens. The giveaway is already live and has captured the attention of all YETIO investors. The project is also offering investors a 20% bonus on token purchases with an additional 5% for purchases over $500. Since the project has a limit of 1 billion tokens, it is already making YETIO availability scarce, which will increase its demand post-launch as well. The tactic of limiting the token supply has worked wonders for various projects in the past, and the chances of it working in YETIO’s favor are also high. Besides, the Yeti Ouro team has been working on its main project, the upcoming game, Yeti Go, which will also serve as a space for earning and spending the YETIO tokens. The racing game is still being developed, but the team has already revealed some of its unique features, one of which includes the play-to-earn tactic. Upon completing missions and races, the users will be rewarded with YETIO tokens, which will cause more investors to flock toward the project. However, the game itself has managed to capture the attention of the gaming community through its cutting-edge technology, amazing graphics, PVP mode, mini-games, and much more, which have been revealed in recent trailers. Yeti Go drops you into a sleek, high-speed world where every turn, sound, and visual is engineered for impact. Built with the expertise of the studio behind iconic titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, this game is all about intensity and immersion. The soundtrack—produced by industry pros who’ve worked alongside Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid—adds a cinematic pulse that keeps the action flowing. All these factors increase the chances of YETIO growing at an incredible speed after its official launch.

The company announced that BGUSD offers an annual yield of 4%, which is credited daily to users’ spot accounts. Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC ( USDC ) or USDt ( USDT ), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand. The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph. The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestations In response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing. “Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.” Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph. Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply. Related: Stablecoins’ dominance due to limitations of US banking — Jerald David Yield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11 billion Bitget’s move into yield-bearing stablecoins comes as the asset class has surged to $11 billion . According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US.

For those invested in the future of digital assets, virtual worlds, and the metaverse, the ability to generate complex environments quickly is paramount. This is where the next wave of innovation lies, and it’s precisely the challenge a new European venture, SpAItial, is tackling head-on, aiming to revolutionize how we create and interact with AI 3D models. AI 3D Models: The Next Frontier in Digital Creation While AI has already mastered generating realistic images from text prompts, the creation of full, coherent 3D online environments is still in its early stages. This represents a significant leap forward, moving from flat visuals to immersive, navigable spaces. Matthias Niessner, a leading figure in European AI and visual computing research at the Technical University of Munich, is at the forefront of this transition. Recognizing the immense potential, he has taken a leave to launch SpAItial, a startup dedicated to cracking the code for generating advanced AI 3D models. Fueling Innovation: $13M Seed for Foundation Models SpAItial has burst onto the scene with an impressive $13 million seed funding round. This is a notably large amount for a European startup at such an early stage, especially considering they have primarily shown teaser videos demonstrating text-to-3D room generation. The round was spearheaded by Earlybird Venture Capital, a prominent European early-stage investor known for backing successful tech companies. Additional support came from Speedinvest and a group of high-profile angel investors. This substantial investment underscores the market’s belief in the potential of developing powerful foundation models for 3D content creation. Building the Dream Team for Generative AI The confidence from investors is largely attributed to the caliber of the team Niessner has assembled. Joining him are: Ricardo Martin-Brualla: Previously worked on Google’s innovative 3D teleconferencing platform, now known as Beam. David Novotny: Spent six years at Meta, where he led their project focused on generating 3D assets from text descriptions. This collective experience from tech giants provides SpAItial with a strong technical foundation. They are also joined by Luke Rogers, a former Cazoo executive, who will focus on the business side, ensuring the venture has a solid commercial strategy for its ambitious generative AI goals. Navigating the Competitive Landscape for AI Startups While the text-to-image space is crowded, the field for text-to-3D environment generation is less so, though competition exists. Companies like Odyssey, which has raised $27 million for entertainment applications, and World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li and already valued over $1 billion, are also working in similar areas, often with a focus on photorealism. However, Niessner sees this as relatively little competition compared to other AI model types and, more importantly, against the backdrop of the ‘bigger vision’ he is pursuing for AI startups in this domain. Cracking the ‘Holy Grail’ of Text to 3D Niessner articulates this ‘bigger vision’ as the true ‘Holy Grail’ of 3D generation. It’s not just about creating a static 3D world, but one that is interactive and behaves realistically. Imagine a virtual glass that can shatter or a door that can be opened naturally. Achieving this level of fidelity and interactivity from a simple text prompt is the ultimate goal, something nobody has fully cracked yet. This capability would unlock a vast range of applications, from highly realistic video games and entertainment experiences to practical uses in 3D visualizations for construction, digital twins, and even training environments for robotics. The potential market opportunity, often cited as a ‘trillion-dollar’ space encompassing everything from augmented reality to simulations, is immense, though defining a precise go-to-market strategy remains a key challenge for companies developing these advanced foundation models. SpAItial’s Strategy and Roadmap To navigate the broad potential market, SpAItial plans to initially license its foundation model API to developers. This approach allows downstream partners to build specific applications for various uses, bypassing the need for SpAItial to become an expert in every potential vertical. A key early task will be identifying partners who can work with earlier model versions versus those requiring higher quality outputs. Niessner emphasizes a focus on quality over quantity in hiring, stating the team won’t immediately grow to hundreds. The immediate roadmap involves generating larger and more interactive 3D spaces. Niessner believes that enabling a 10-year-old to create their own video game in 10 minutes via text is a more achievable ‘Holy Grail’ than simply generating static 3D objects, given current platform restrictions. Ultimately, SpAItial aims high, potentially disrupting established industries like CAD design as the next chapter in 3D generation unfolds, powered by advanced text to 3D capabilities. SpAItial’s significant seed funding and experienced team position it as a key player in the emerging text-to-3D space. Their focus on interactive, realistic environments represents a bold step towards unlocking the full potential of generative AI for digital worlds. While challenges remain in defining the market and scaling the technology, the pursuit of the ‘Holy Grail’ of 3D creation promises exciting developments for developers, creators, and anyone interested in the future of digital interaction.

The decision is being weighed by the Ministry of Finance, according to Reuters , and will likely be finalized in June after talks with market participants. This possible cut targets bonds with the longest maturities—specifically 20-, 30-, and 40-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs)—after demand dropped sharply and yields surged to multi-year highs. Traditional buyers like life insurers have started pulling back, while global investors have grown cautious as Japan’s massive public debt raises questions about long-term sustainability. Bond yields fall as market reacts to possible cuts The market responded fast. The 30-year JGB yield fell by 12.5 basis points to 2.91%, hitting its lowest level since May 14. At the same time, the benchmark 10-year yield fell 5 basis points to 1.455%. The news dragged down the yen, which weakened 0.3% against the dollar to 143.275. Even US Treasuries moved, with the 30-year Treasury yield falling 7 basis points to 4.963% in early London trading. The sharp moves started after the finance ministry sent out a questionnaire to financial institutions, asking how much super-long debt should be issued for the rest of the fiscal year. Traders saw that as a clear hint that officials want to scale back the long end of the curve to calm the volatility and match weak demand. Following that, Japan’s 20-year yield dropped 19.5 basis points to 2.31%, and 40-year yields tumbled 25 basis points, further confirming how sensitive the market has become. The effects also spilled into US bond markets, where the decline in Japanese yields triggered a global wave of buying, especially in longer-dated securities. Japan’s total bond issuance to remain at 172.3 trillion yen Despite the possible cuts to longer-term bonds, the overall amount of debt Japan plans to issue this fiscal year will stay the same—172.3 trillion yen, or $1.21 trillion, until March 2026. What might change is the composition. If the ministry trims super-long maturities, it will likely sell more shorter-term debt instead. That could include 2-, 5-, or 10-year bonds, depending on where demand is stronger. Analysts like Shier Lee Lim, lead FX and macro strategist at Convera Singapore, believe the change is being driven by pressure from bond vigilantes—investors who sell off debt to protest irresponsible fiscal behavior. “The shift in issuance strategy is seen as a response to rising pressure from bond vigilantes — investors who push back against unsustainable fiscal policies,” Shier said. “While short-term sentiment has improved, the increased reliance on shorter-dated issuance may lead to higher rollover risks over time.” That risk is real. Swapping long-dated debt for short-term notes might help lower current yields and calm traders, but it also means Japan will have to refinance its debt more frequently—and in possibly worse conditions. For now, the finance ministry hasn’t announced how much of each maturity it’ll sell. That decision will depend on the outcome of June’s market meetings. What’s clear is that confidence in Japan’s bond market has been shaky. Last week, 30-year US Treasury yields climbed toward levels not seen since 2007, as debt concerns slammed developed markets. Japan’s central bank has also been signaling it may reduce its massive holdings of JGBs, adding even more uncertainty. While the Bank of Japan hasn’t acted yet, the talk alone is enough to make investors uneasy. The fear is that once the bank pulls back, there won’t be enough demand left to support longer maturities—especially with insurers now stepping aside. That leaves the Ministry of Finance with limited options: either face rising borrowing costs or adjust the supply before it gets worse. So far, the government is choosing to act. The question is whether this tweak will be enough, or just a temporary fix that leads to bigger problems down the road. Investors will be watching June’s decision closely to see if Japan can strike the balance between market stability and fiscal survival.

As its popularity has grown, so has the price of its native HYPE token. This has seen it rally even at a time of bearish divergence in the crypto market, moving up by more than 50% in one week to reach new all-time highs. Factors Driving The Hyperliquid Price The main driver behind the Hyperliquid price pushing to new all-time highs has been the rise in attention being paid to the platform. As crypto investors are pivoting toward more decentralized platforms for their perpetual trading activities, HYPE’s mindshare has grown exponentially over the last few months. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going This rising interest translated to a major surge in the platform’s trading volume over the last few weeks. Most notable were the billion-dollar bets placed by James Wynn, who has quickly risen to become the most popular crypto trader on Hyperliquid. His trades garnered the interest of thousands, putting more eyes on the platforms as onlookers stood by to see the outcome of his trades. In particular, over the last week, the platform recorded its highest weekly volume since it was launched, reaching $78.672 billion in trading volume between May 11 and May 18, 2025. Daily trading volumes have also not been left out, consistently crossing the $2 billion mark daily. Its highest daily trading volume yet was recorded on May 21, 2025, with $17.731 billion trade on the platform. Cumulatively, the Hyperliquid platform has reached $1.156 trillion in volume in three years of operation, DefiLlama data shows. Other major developments that the platform has seen is the rise in the open interest. The platform celebrated a new all-time high after open interest crossed the $10.1 billion mark on the platform. The amount of USDC locked on the platform also climbed to $3.5 billion, with $5.6 million in fees generated in only a 24-hour period. In one week, the platform was able to generate over $22 million in fees alone.

Daily trading volumes crossed $460 million on May 26, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Crypto whales have been especially active during this time, as Lookonchain reported three whales spending $5.33 million to buy HYPE on Monday. With volumes rising and prices going up, it suggests that a lot of the volume is actually from buyers. If this buying pressure continues, then it is likely that the price sees further upside before putting in a correction.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.31, reflecting a 1.22% decline over the past 24 hours and a 1.63% dip on the week, marking a notable uptick in trader positioning despite a minor decline in the underlying token’s spot price. However, the growing open interest signals that market participants remain highly engaged, even as price consolidates. XRP futures open interest. Source: CoinGlass What futures open interest means for XRP Open interest in futures markets represents the total value of outstanding derivative contracts that have not yet been settled or closed. In other words, it tracks the number of active long and short positions in the market at any given time. A rising open interest, particularly when accompanied by growing volume, typically reflects fresh capital entering the market. It’s often interpreted as a sign of building momentum or conviction among traders. However, it doesn’t indicate whether traders are positioning long (bullish) or short (bearish); only that risk exposure is increasing. In XRP’s case, the rise to $4.77 billion in futures open interest is a significant move. Over the past three days, open interest has climbed steadily from around $4.48 billion, marking a shift in sentiment after several weeks of relative stagnation. While this is not yet a return to the peak levels seen in late January, it is the strongest futures interest recorded since the sharp unwind in mid-February, suggesting that traders are once again actively deploying capital into XRP markets. XRP derivatives dashboard signals broader reacceleration Complementing the chart data is a snapshot of XRP’s broader derivatives landscape, which reinforces the idea that trading activity is heating up again. Overall volume in XRP derivatives has risen 3.44% in the last 24 hours to $3.11 billion. More striking is the spike in options market activity, with options volume exploding 303.42% to $1.63K, and options open interest climbing 6.32% to $2.03 million. Although the notional value of XRP options remains small compared to futures, the massive jump in daily options volume suggests an increased appetite for directional bets or hedging strategies typically seen when traders anticipate higher volatility or trend continuation.

Japan’s bond market is unraveling fast and it’s not just a local problem. More than half a trillion dollars in value has been wiped out in just weeks, triggering alarm bells across global markets. Bond volatility is now back at levels not seen since the 2008 crisis, and the ripple effects are just beginning to surface. If you think this is just another macro event, think again. From Tokyo to Wall Street, this collapse is driving a quiet – but growing – shift into Bitcoin. And it’s happening under the radar. What’s really going on in Japan’s economy? Why are long-dated bonds plunging? And what does all this have to do with crypto? Let’s break it down. A $500B Crash and the Return of Bond Volatility Over the past 45 days, Japan’s 30-year government bond yield has surged by 100bps, hitting a record 3.20%. The 40-year bond, often seen as a long-term safe haven, has dropped over 20% in value, triggering losses of more than $500 billion across the market. This isn’t normal volatility. According to analyst Financelot , “Japan’s bond market liquidity has dropped to 2008 Lehman crisis levels. Are we about to experience another financial crisis?” Let’s talk about the why. Understanding the Japan Bond Crisis The Bank of Japan is unwinding years of ultra-loose policy. After aggressively buying up government bonds for years, the central bank is now stepping back – and that flood of supply is overwhelming buyers. With the BOJ still holding over $4.1 trillion in bonds – 52% of the entire market – even a small shift in policy is enough to rattle the system. Japan’s Debt Machine Is Overheating Japan’s economic numbers aren’t helping. GDP shrank by 0.7% in Q1, more than double the expected drop, while inflation has crept up to 3.6%. Real wages, meanwhile, are down 2.1% year over year. This mix of slowing growth and rising prices – classic stagflation – is squeezing both investors and policymakers. And it’s hitting Japan’s global strategies hard. The yen carry trade, once a go-to for global liquidity, is under pressure as rising Japanese yields flip the math. “The huge mess is coming home to roost,” wrote Wolf Street , pointing to the growing cracks in Japan’s once-stable financial structure. In the background, Japanese institutions are pulling back from U.S. Treasuries too; selling off $119.3 billion in just one quarter. That’s the largest quarterly drop since 2012. Bitcoin Becomes the Go-To Saviour It’s clear traditional markets are struggling. Now, some investors are quietly moving toward crypto, especially Bitcoin. With bonds no longer feeling so “safe,” BTC is starting to look like a viable hedge against global debt risks. “Is it a coincidence that the UK and Japan are seeing huge demand for bitcoin exposure?” asked analyst James Van Straten , as long-term bond yields in both countries spike. Bitwise’s Andre Dragosche and Cauê Oliveira, Head of Research at BlockTrendsBR echoed the trend – hinting that institutional capital is starting to see Bitcoin in a new light. That shift won’t happen overnight. If the yen continues to fall and the dollar strengthens, crypto markets could still feel pressure from a broader carry trade unwind. But in the long run, the trend is clear: as trust in traditional debt markets wavers, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge is getting harder to ignore.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 10:07:07

Bitcoin (BTC) has been showing strength, and it seems traders are betting heavily on continued upside. But a recent analysis points to a potential red flag hidden within the options market. Let’s dive into what the latest Bitcoin options skew is telling us. Understanding Bitcoin Options Skew First off, what exactly is Bitcoin options skew ? In simple terms, it’s a way to measure the relative cost of buying protection against a price drop (put options) versus betting on a price increase (call options) for Bitcoin. Options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price (strike price) by a certain date. The skew is calculated based on the implied volatility of these options. Implied volatility reflects the market’s expectation of how much Bitcoin’s price will move. When the implied volatility for call options is significantly higher than for put options, it means traders are willing to pay a higher premium for the chance of profiting from a price surge compared to protecting against a price fall. This indicates strong bullish sentiment. Conversely, if put options have higher implied volatility, it suggests traders are more concerned about downside risk and are paying more for protection. What the Current BTC Options Data Shows According to a recent Chart of the Day shared by Matrixport crypto on May 27, the Bitcoin options skew has reached an extreme level. Matrixport reported that the skew has fallen to nearly -10%. What does a negative skew mean? A negative skew indicates that call options are significantly more expensive than put options. Specifically, implied volatility for calls is now approximately 10% higher than for puts. This highlights a strong bias among traders towards expecting and positioning for further upward price movement in Bitcoin. It suggests traders are prioritizing potential gains over hedging against potential losses. This isn’t just a slight lean towards bullishness; a -10% skew is considered an extreme reading, reflecting a high degree of optimism prevailing in the market. Is Extreme Crypto Market Sentiment a Warning Sign? While it feels good to see high optimism, especially after periods of consolidation or downturns, extreme sentiment can sometimes be a contrarian indicator. This is a key point highlighted by the Matrixport crypto analysis. Why is excessive optimism potentially problematic? When too many market participants are positioned on one side of the trade (in this case, betting heavily on upside via calls), the market can become vulnerable. If something triggers a shift in sentiment or a wave of profit-taking, there might not be enough buyers to absorb the selling pressure, leading to a sharper-than-expected pullback. Matrixport specifically noted that such extreme bullish sentiment readings from the options skew have historically preceded short-term market pullbacks in Bitcoin. Historical Context and Bitcoin Price Analysis Looking back at historical data, there have been instances where a highly negative options skew (indicating extreme bullishness) coincided with or shortly preceded local price tops before a correction occurred. This doesn’t mean a crash is imminent, but it suggests that the market might be getting a little ahead of itself. Consider this simplified idea: Sentiment Indicator (Options Skew) Trader Positioning Potential Market Reaction Extremely Bullish (Negative Skew) Heavy buying of calls, less demand for puts Increased risk of profit-taking or reversal Neutral Skew Balanced interest in calls and puts More stable market conditions Extremely Bearish (Positive Skew) Heavy buying of puts, less demand for calls Increased potential for a relief rally or bottoming This historical pattern is why Bitcoin price analysis often includes looking at derivatives data like options skew. It provides insight into the collective positioning and sentiment of sophisticated traders. Actionable Insights for Your BTC Options Strategy So, if the Bitcoin options skew is flashing an extreme bullish signal that has historically preceded pullbacks, what should traders and investors consider? For Call Buyers: Be cautious. While the trend might still be up, the premium for calls is high. Consider if the potential upside justifies the cost, or if scaling back exposure or using tighter stop losses is warranted. For Put Buyers: Puts are relatively cheaper right now (in terms of implied volatility). If you are concerned about a potential short-term dip, buying puts could be a relatively cost-effective way to hedge your spot holdings or short-term long positions. For Option Sellers: Selling calls when premiums are high might seem attractive, but be aware of the risk if the bullish trend continues strongly. Selling puts could be an option if you expect the market to hold up or rebound, but this also carries significant risk if a sharp downturn occurs. Overall Strategy: This signal doesn’t necessarily mean you should abandon your long-term Bitcoin strategy. However, for short-term trading or managing risk, paying attention to this extreme skew and considering hedging strategies or reducing leverage might be prudent. It’s crucial to remember that options skew is just one indicator among many. A comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis should also include technical indicators, on-chain data, macroeconomic factors, and news events. Beyond the Skew: Other Factors Influencing Crypto Market Sentiment While the Bitcoin options skew provides valuable insight into trader positioning, the overall crypto market sentiment is influenced by numerous factors: Macroeconomics: Interest rates, inflation data, and global economic stability play a significant role. Regulatory News: Developments regarding crypto regulation in major economies can heavily impact sentiment. Institutional Adoption: News about large institutions investing in Bitcoin or offering crypto services often boosts optimism. Technological Developments: Upgrades or issues with the Bitcoin network or other major blockchains can affect confidence. Geopolitical Events: Global events can drive risk-on or risk-off sentiment across all markets, including crypto. Therefore, while the options skew is a powerful tool for understanding derivatives market positioning, it should be viewed as part of a larger mosaic when assessing the overall market outlook. Challenges and Nuances Interpreting the Bitcoin options skew isn’t always straightforward. Extreme readings don’t guarantee an immediate reversal. Sometimes, extreme sentiment can persist for a while before a correction occurs. Also, the skew can be influenced by factors other than pure directional bets, such as large players hedging existing positions. The analysis from Matrixport crypto provides a valuable data point, but it’s essential for traders to do their own research and consider their individual risk tolerance and investment goals. Conclusion: Caution Amidst the Optimism The current state of the Bitcoin options skew , as highlighted by Matrixport, points to a level of bullishness that is historically associated with increased risk of a short-term pullback. While the overall trend for Bitcoin may remain positive, the derivatives market is signaling that caution might be warranted at these elevated levels of optimism. Paying attention to indicators like the Bitcoin options skew is crucial for understanding the underlying dynamics of the market beyond just price action. It helps reveal how traders are positioned and the collective sentiment regarding future price movements. As always, a balanced approach that considers multiple data points and risk management is key in navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency.

Don’t you hate it when you see yet another layer-1 launch, claiming one million, 10 million, or even 100 million TPS? “How can I cash in on the hype?” you ask. Well, today is your lucky day! Here’s a step-by-step guide on building your very own 1 billion TPS layer-1 network that’ll leave those posers in the dust. You might also like: From crypto projects to digital asset companies: It’s time to level up web3 comms | Opinion Step 1: Get a supercomputer and run EVM on it A single high-end machine can run transactions in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to ~100k TPS—a pretty well-documented technical fact. But to reach this level of throughput, you do need to bypass the Patricia Merkle Trie during reads and writes to permanent state, in order to remove a major throughput bottleneck that limits the standard EVM to just under 100 TPS. This mechanism in the EVM exists to ensure that the network, sorry, the single machine, is able to correctly handle any state rollbacks and network reorganizations…anyway, who cares, it’s slow, it’s gone, don’t worry about it. We’re using the EVM because being EVM-compatible, or better yet, EVM-equivalent, is pretty important these days, since it has become a standard in web3 development. The majority of the world’s web3 applications are written in Solidity or other languages that compile into the EVM bytecode. This way, you can attract more developers to build on your new 1 billion TPS network. Trust me, bro, “EVM-equivalent” totally sells. Step 2: Forget the network A single machine is also a network on its own, technically speaking. Why complicate this side hustle with more than one machine? Besides, having other machines on the network just slows things down. If you have a network filled with different machines run by different people, they now suddenly have to agree with each other on what happens on the network. This involves communicating information across the network, coming up with mechanisms to agree on what’s happening, and then reaching a consensus before making progress. Sounds slow af. This consensus mechanism is just a lot of wasteful overhead. Who needs it? Let’s just stick with a single machine. Check out all these hot projects called layer-2s; their networks are all just a single machine. If you worry about being called out for being centralized, simply create a number of other machines on the network and assign them fancy names, such as “data availability nodes” or similar. Everyone’s doing it. Step 3: Make 100 shards Get ready, this is where we elevate your game, with sharding. You take your network of one machine and make 100 copies of it; we’ll call this sharding, very on-trend. Technically speaking, a sharded network’s state is only temporarily sharded across machines and will eventually be partially or fully synchronized to guarantee consistency during cross-shard transactions. In adversarial environments such as crypto, machines across shards are often shuffled to prevent collusion. But let’s not get technical. These 100 copies don’t need to synchronize anything; they don’t even need to communicate with each other. It’s a network of 100 shards! If you’re keeping score, we now have 100 shards * 100k TPS = 10 million TPS! Step 4: Ditch the EVM Did we say EVM-equivalent is all the rage? That’s old news. Now it’s all about being the EVM-killer. EVM is just so slow. It’s a stack-based interpreted virtual machine that was designed to be fully agnostic to the underlying hardware architecture and operating systems, to maximize repeatability and execution correctness, so that a large group of disparate machines can safely and securely operate on the same network. But man, is it slow. Let’s go with something sexy like WASM-JIT. It’s highly performant, mature, and most major programming languages can be compiled into WASM. Since it does compile to native register-based machine code that targets specific hardware architectures, it is inherently less portable than a purely stack-based VM like EVM. In real-world implementations, WASM-JIT can outperform the EVM up to 100x in execution speeds. Ditch the EVM, we now have 10 million TPS * 100 = 1 billion TPS. You did it! Stay tuned, and we’ll teach you how to further elevate your 1 billion TPS layer-1 network even further with unrealistically-optimistic concurrency!

While this may indicate confidence in long-term fundamentals, it also reflects a broader pattern: capital is rotating from mature assets into earlier-stage opportunities with greater return potential. With ADA’s growth trajectory tapering and staking yields flat, many institutional wallets are reallocating exposure toward projects with fixed supply, real user participation, and defined token scarcity. According to analyst reports, Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as one of the top destinations for that capital. The project’s architecture, mobile-first distribution model, and decentralized reward system are drawing both retail and whale-tier interest for the same reason: it mirrors the early economic blueprint that made Bitcoin and Ethereum wealth engines. Smartphones Become Crypto Mining Infrastructure At the core of Bitcoin Solaris is the Nova App, a mobile mining interface that turns any modern smartphone into a yield-generating asset. Users allocate 1–5 GB of storage and idle CPU to the app, which runs passively while the device charges. Mining rewards are distributed daily in BTC-S based on uptime. This direct protocol-level access stands in sharp contrast to Cardano, where delegation mechanics still favor large pools and require ecosystem fluency. Bitcoin Solaris removes these technical and financial barriers, giving early adopters consistent rewards for real network contribution. Designed for Decentralized Throughput at Global Scale Bitcoin Solaris achieves scalability through a dual-layer blockchain. The Base Layer secures the ledger using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), while the Solaris Layer executes smart contracts and mobile mining via Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT). This enables the network to process 10,000+ transactions per second with 2-second finality — a throughput that outpaces Cardano’s current benchmarks. This design supports real-time reward issuance across tens of thousands of nodes while keeping energy use minimal. For whales entering at scale, the network can support high-volume participation without bottlenecks or centralization risks. Security Audits Back Investor Confidence Bitcoin Solaris has completed comprehensive security and compliance checks. The Cyberscope audit validated smart contract logic and token mechanics. The Freshcoins audit tested mobile mining performance and scalability. The team also passed KYC verification , confirming transparent governance and traceability. This audit trail ensures that BTC-S enters the market as a verified asset, not a speculative token launch. Early Access Window Closes as Network Activation Nears Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, with BTC-S priced at 5 USDT. Of the fixed 21 million BTC-S supply, 4.2 million (20%) are allocated to the full presale. There will be no inflation or new token creation post-launch. Participants in the presale also secure early Nova App mining access before broader user growth drives up difficulty. As history has shown with Bitcoin and Ethereum, network positioning ahead of public saturation is often the defining factor in long-term returns. In a recent market briefing, Crypto Volt explained why large Cardano holders are shifting toward Bitcoin Solaris. His analysis focuses on token scarcity, mining-first distribution, and why early protocol access through smartphones is becoming the new strategy for crypto-native wealth growth. Cardano remains a leading Layer 1 — but for investors seeking transformative upside, its phase of exponential gains appears to have passed. Bitcoin Solaris presents a structurally different opportunity, one defined by scarcity, real-time rewards, and early-phase access. Now in Presale phase 5 at 5 USDT, BTC-S is drawing both institutional and retail attention as a credible next-generation wealth builder — before the door closes.

45156021,https://zycrypto.com/?p=106626,1748345918,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Google Researchers Claim Quantum Computers Could Break Bitcoin with 20x Less Effort than Previous Estimates,https://zycrypto.com/google-researchers-claim-quantum-computers-could-break-bitcoin-with-20x-less-effort-than-previous-estimates/,"Google has released a research paper which suggests that quantum computers may be able to crack encryption standards, such as those used by Bitcoin , with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. A Google quantum researcher, Craig Gidney, said developers must ascertain the costs of creating quantum-safe cryptocurrencies to achieve the transition process. Cryptography standards, such as RSA, may be at a higher risk of being cracked than previously thought. Bitcoin users, especially those with custodial funds, may need to measure the risks to safeguard their crypto from quantum attacks. Quantum computing can solve complex puzzles, such as the ones used by Bitcoin to measure proof-of-work, thus presenting a new threat vector that places Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at risk. Bitcoin was designed for older computers, which are quickly becoming obsolete. Peter Shor, cryptographer and computer scientist, created a method called Shor’s algorithm to solve the complex puzzles used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Shor’s algorithm could be combined with a quantum computer to crack crypto wallets rapidly. An efficient algorithm, combined with a powerful computer, could increase the risk of a crypto portfolio, including digital assets that use proof-of-stake algorithms. Craig Gidney and Sophie Schmieg, quantum researchers at Google, discussed their findings on their Google security blog. They addressed the ability of quantum computers to crack public key cryptography, particularly RSA, which could be compromised with a quantum computer of around 1 million noisy qubits. They made this conclusion after taking into account recent advancements in quantum computing. The number of qubits required to crack cryptography is lower than previous estimates. The researchers outlined strategies corporations could take to mitigate the risks of quantum computers, such as collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to transition to a post-quantum computing world. Symmetric cryptography is largely unaffected by this attack. However, cryptography, such as that used by cryptocurrencies, is vulnerable to this attack due to the public exposure of addresses and the longevity of these wallets, providing attackers with a target they can attack for an extended period. NIST has set a timeline to phase out vulnerable systems by 2030 and ban them by 2035. Google has been confirming its strategy with NIST by implementing PQC signatures on its Cloud KMS service. IBM’s Condor, the most powerful quantum computer to date, can only reach 1,121 qubits, which is way short of the million qubits needed to crack RSA encryption. Cryptocurrency seems to be safe for now, unless a new technological innovation can dramatically increase the number of qubits. Google’s Sycamore, another quantum computer, can only get 53 qubits. However, the trend of quantum development suggests that crypto users must take these risks seriously. The Google researchers argue that the increased risk occurs because of technological advancements such as improved error correction and better algorithms. Modular exponentiation, for example, has been made more efficient, effectively doubling its speed. Modular arithmetic is a vital part of cryptographic systems. Further, the researchers found that error correction improvements can speed up their algorithm. They found that creating a separate layer for error correction allowed the qubits layer to be more dense, holding more information to be processed, speeding up the algorithm overall. The researchers could drop the qubit requirement by optimising code at a programmable level. Hackers could further exploit such optimizations to secretly lower the qubit requirements until a future date when quantum computers are more accessible. In early May 2025, BlackRock added a line to their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing, stating that quantum computing poses a risk to the long-term security of Bitcoin. The filing states that if quantum computing advances enough, it could be used to crack the underlying encryption algorithms used to power Bitcoin. BlackRock is concerned that quantum computers will undermine crypto markets and technology. Quantum computers can potentially disrupt the business model of Silicon Valley, potentially causing a market crash. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, should consider the potential risks of quantum computers. The fact that such a large bank like BlackRock is taking the risk seriously shows that quantum risks could be closer than we think.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Google,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ZRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-27 11:38:38

As $DON gets listed on more exchanges, experts say the daily trading volume could grow to around $20 million. With the rise of meme coins’ popularity, Salamanca is ready for additional growth. Solana (SOL) Emerges as a Key Platform in the Digital Asset World Solana (SOL) is a top blockchain platform, providing a scalable environment for decentralized applications (dApps). Solana uses the innovative Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) models, which attract both developers and institutions that need fast and affordable blockchain solutions. SOL’s success is due to its increasing adoption, as its price steadily increases. The price of Solana has seen a 5.19% increase to $177.80 in the last 24 hours. Currently, Solana has a market cap of $92.46 billion with a daily trading volume of $6.31 billion. The Solana Foundation intends to improve DeFi and Web3 features, which has resulted in more projects being developed on the network. Additionally, with improved network stability and continuous upgrades, Solana attracts both developers and investors. Bitcoin’s Slipping Dominance Opens the Door for Altcoins Bitcoin (BTC) has recently seen a decline in its market dominance due to its high cost. With a market cap of $2.2 trillion and a price of $110,715.23, Bitcoin continues to attract investors. The rise in popularity for alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) is changing the market outlook. Bitcoin’s market share has increased to 64.18%, after an earlier dip below 62%. This shift in investors is due to including altcoins in their investments. As Solana and Salamanca become more popular, the rise of ecosystem-focused tokens and meme coins is expected to continue. This could position altcoins to compete more directly with Bitcoin in the next few years. Solana and Salamanca show great potential for growth as the cryptocurrency markets continue to develop.

The problem hit hard in May, when 30-year Treasury yields shot past 5%, dragging stock prices down with them. That’s a direct blow to anyone still betting on the old rule that when equities fall, bonds rise. This time, everything’s just falling. The 60/40 model (60% stocks, 40% bonds) had been clawing back relevance in 2025 after years of being dismissed. Through mid-May, the setup was up about 1.6% on the year, beating the S&P 500’s returns while keeping volatility lower. The comeback had one thing going for it: the return of the classic inverse correlation between stocks and bonds. Source: Bloomberg That relationship, for six months straight, was the most negative it’s been since 2021. But that dynamic broke fast. Investors are now looking at a market where rising yields are hammering both asset classes. Yields jump, bonds lose their safety role The selloff in Treasuries is being driven by growing fear around Washington’s out-of-control debt and deficit problem. The surge in yields means prices on long-term bonds are plunging, making them behave more like risky assets than the low-volatility shield investors are used to. “Longer-term Treasuries are behaving like risk assets, not like the typical kind of defensive risk-averse assets,” said Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income, during an interview with Bloomberg Television. That shift is wrecking the 60/40 setup, which depends on bonds providing balance. Greg made it clear: if you want to hedge stock exposure, don’t go long. The professionals are pointing toward short-term Treasuries instead, which are still seen as relatively safe and income-generating without the extreme volatility. The uncertainty in fixed income comes as equity markets try to rebound from a rough stretch. On Tuesday, stock futures rose sharply after President Donald Trump said over the weekend that he’d agreed to delay a planned 50% tariff on the European Union. The Dow Jones futures climbed 543 points, or 1.3%, the S&P 500 gained 1.5%, and the Nasdaq 100 popped 1.7%. Trump said he would push the deadline from June 1 to July 9, after a request from Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission. Tariff delay lifts futures, but nerves remain That announcement came after a rough week, where the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all dropped more than 2%. Trump’s proposed tariffs on the EU — including on Apple products — had been weighing on markets. Monday’s holiday closure for Memorial Day didn’t help the tension. The delay announcement helped cool some fears temporarily, but traders stayed nervous. “We’re still wary about chasing the SPX at these levels given complacency around two major areas of macro risk (tariffs and fiscal policy/yields) along with elevated equity valuations,” said Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge. Adam pointed out that while Trump’s most extreme tariff threats may not actually happen, he’s already introduced serious new import taxes over the past four months. And he’s likely not finished. This week, investors are watching earnings reports closely. Okta is set to release after the bell Tuesday. Reports from Nvidia, Macy’s, and Costco will follow later in the week. FactSet data shows that over 95% of S&P 500 companies have already posted their numbers this season, with nearly 78% beating analyst estimates. But that’s not enough to calm everyone.

In its latest research note, the global banking giant forecasted that Solana could climb to $275 by the end of 2025, and even hit $500 by 2030. That’s a big jump from its current price of around $175. Ethereum, meanwhile, is trading near $2,632. But here’s where it gets interesting: even with such bullish targets for SOL, Standard Chartered isn’t calling it a flippening. In fact, the bank says Ethereum’s dominance isn’t going anywhere just yet. So, what’s driving this confident prediction and why does ETH still come out on top? The deeper you look, the more revealing it gets. Solana is rising, but Ethereum still leads According to Geoff Kendrick, head of FX and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, the forecast hasn’t changed since March. Solana is still “cheap” relative to Ethereum, based on metrics such as active users and transaction counts. That’s the key message: Solana’s got room to grow, but Ethereum’s already won the long game – for now. Kendrick also noted the ETH/SOL price ratio, which is currently around 16, is expected to hold between 14 and 17 through 2025–2027. That means both can rise together, but ETH stays ahead. The bank also points to a few headwinds for Solana in recent months, mainly a slowdown in memecoin activity and the fact that its application revenue is still undervalued compared to its growth potential. Ethereum vs Solana: A Comparison Here’s how the two chains stack up on the key battlegrounds. TVL (Total Value Locked): Ethereum continues to dominate with over $71 billion in TVL, thanks to a mature DeFi ecosystem and institutional-grade platforms. Solana, by contrast, sits around $9 billion – a fraction of ETH’s size. Still, its fast, low-cost infrastructure is pulling in newer DeFi protocols. Memecoins: Ethereum is the original home of memecoins – SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI. While much of the recent memecoin volume is shifting to Ethereum L2s, the chain still leads in brand and liquidity. Solana had its moment earlier this year with coins like BONK and WIF, but that wave has cooled significantly, which probably has hurt near-term sentiment. dApps and Developer Activity: Ethereum remains the heavyweight in decentralized applications, with a deep bench of projects and long-standing developer loyalty. But Solana is gaining momentum, especially in performance-first apps like Jupiter and Raydium. The community is scrappy, fast-moving, and increasingly well-funded, fueled by grants and dev bootcamps like mtnDAO. Security and Past Network Issues: Solana has had its fair share of turbulence, including DoS attacks and major network outages. But 2024 brought serious upgrades: the rollout of Firedancer, a second validator client built with Jump Crypto, and the adoption of QUIC. Solana also implemented stake-weighted Quality of Service and real-time network monitoring tools to strengthen its reliability under pressure. Ethereum, meanwhile, has the benefit of time. Post-merge, Ethereum’s Proof of Stake model has made attacks more costly and introduced slashing penalties for misbehaving validators. Add in rigorous smart contract audits and L2 adoption, and you’ve got a network that’s been battle-tested and hardened over years. Decentralization at the Core: Solana’s design trades some decentralization for speed. High-performance nodes require costly infrastructure, which can concentrate control. Ethereum, on the other hand, operates with a vast network of nodes, made more accessible after the move to PoS. The lower barrier to entry has helped decentralize control and preserve Ethereum’s ethos as a trustless, globally distributed blockchain. Can Solana close the gap? It could – but not overnight. Solana’s strengths are clear: fast transactions, low fees, and a growing developer community. But Ethereum’s lead is built on more than just price. It’s built on network effects, years of developer loyalty, and a strong track record with institutions. For Solana to catch up, it has a long way to go.

Saylor's Security Concerns Saylor argues that requiring exchanges to publish their public wallet addresses leaves them in high risk. ”If you force companies to disclose all their addresses, you open up an executive kidnapping risk and a security nightmare for the company,” he said. Saylor also warned that openness could draw MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks, where malicious actors exploit transaction ordering for profit. Instead of on-chain proofs, Saylor favors third-party auditing as a more pragmatic and secure means. ”The correct answer is a reputable, independent, trusted auditor,” he stated, suggesting that conventional financial regulation offers superior protection for both corporations and clients. Alternative Approaches: Binance and Kraken Saylor's move comes as leading exchanges test different proof-of-reserves protocols. Binance, for example, uses a Merkle-tree-based protocol. The system allows users to verify that their funds are part of the exchange's overall reserves, without revealing the entire list of balances or addresses. The Merkle tree system provides cryptographic proof of reserves while maintaining an element of privacy. Kraken, however, has implemented a zero-knowledge proof system. This advanced cryptographic technique enables Kraken to prove to users that it has sufficient reserves to cover customers' balances without disclosing any sensitive on-chain data. Zero-knowledge proofs are praised for their ability to balance transparency and confidentiality, addressing most of the concerns Saylor has. The proof-of-reserves argument is wide open. On-chain transparency supporters argue that public audits need to be in place in order to bring back confidence in the wake of prominent exchange collapses. Opponents, like Saylor, counter that full transparency brings new risks to exchanges and users alike. Industry norms are still in development. Although Merkle-tree and zero-knowledge proofs offer promising alternatives, these also require users to assume that exchanges utilize these systems honestly and efficiently. Third-party audits, Saylor's preference being noted, can provide another layer of assurance, yet their usefulness rests in the auditor's reputation and liberty. Practical Challenges and Regulatory Perspectives Aside from technical and security concerns, exchanges also have to contend with a complex regulatory landscape. Regulators in different jurisdictions have varying requirements for transparency and auditability, which would complicate the ability of global exchanges to adopt a one-size-fits-all solution. Furthermore, the rapid progress of cryptographic verification means that best practice today would not be very long-lived. For clients, the answer lies in remaining vigilant and informed. As the proof-of-reserves brouhaha continues, users must look not only at exchanges' practices but also at how frequently and transparently they report. At the end of the day, the goal is to keep user balances safe, accessible, and auditable without exposing exchanges or their users to excessive risk. The bottom line Michael Saylor's warning about the danger of on-chain proof-of-reserves has put into question an important debate in the crypto world. With the consideration of advantages and disadvantages between openness, privacy, and security by the exchanges, the search for best practices continues. Regardless of whether the future of proof-of-reserves is cryptography, third-party auditing, or a combination of both, one thing is for sure: openness must be matched with protection in order to preserve user trust and security.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-27 11:53:12

Giancarlo's move comes at a time of leadership turmoil at the CFTC, with Commissioner Kristin Johnson announcing her resignation, joining several other high-profile exits that could allow the Trump administration to fully reshape the agency. Meanwhile, the crypto industry is pressuring the SEC for clarity on staking rules, especially for ETFs tied to protocols like Solana. Although recent SEC guidance under Trump’s presidency has been a lot more favorable to crypto, formal policy on staking is still elusive. For now, it seem slike industry leaders are autiously optimistic about regulatory progress in the months ahead. Crypto Dad Joins Sygnum Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), joined Swiss crypto bank Sygnum as a senior policy adviser. His appointment was announced on May 27,and it places him alongside 11 other experts on the bank’s Advisory Council. In this role, Giancarlo will help steer the company through changing global regulations and advise on strategic partnerships across both public and private sectors. Christopher Giancarlo Sygnum is widely recognized as the world’s first digital asset bank, and recently achieved unicorn status after a $58 million funding round. The firm operates in several international hubs including Switzerland, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates, and offers a suite of regulated crypto asset services that are tailored for institutional clients. Giancarlo served at the CFTC from 2017 to 2019, and has long been a vocal advocate for digital innovation in financial markets. This even earned him the nickname “crypto dad.” While he previously said that a broad political shift in Washington will be needed to pass meaningful pro-crypto legislation, that shift likely arrived with Donald Trump’s re-election in November. Nonetheless, Giancarlo dismissed speculation that he would take on a leadership role at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the US Treasury after the election. His move to Sygnum comes at a time when institutional adoption of digital assets is gaining good momentum. In the United States, inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recently surpassed $1.5 billion in just two days, which means that there is strong demand from professional investors. The progress of the GENIUS Act in the Senate also proves that there is growing political support for crypto. According to Fidelity Digital Assets , Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs is reinforcing its reputation as a credible, long-term asset class. This sentiment is echoed in international markets, particularly in regions where Sygnum is active, like Singapore and the UAE. However, Sygnum CEO Matthias Imbach recently warned that Switzerland, despite being an early leader in digital finance, risks falling behind if it doesn’t maintain its innovative edge. CFTC Faces Major Leadership Shakeup Kristin Johnson, a commissioner at the CFTC, also recently announced her plans to step down from the agency later in 2025, after the conclusion of her term in April. Johnson was nominated by former President Joe Biden and began her tenure in March of 2022. She revealed her departure in a statement that was issued on May 21. During her time at the CFTC, Johnson served as the sponsor of the Market Risk Advisory Committee, where she focused on issues related to decentralized financial products, including digital assets and cryptocurrency. (Source: CFTC ) Her resignation adds to a wave of high-level exits from the five-seat commission, which is currently experiencing a major leadership reshuffle. Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero both announced plans to leave by the end of May, and acting Chair Caroline Pham indicated she will transition to the private sector if the Senate confirms Brian Quintenz as the next CFTC chair. One seat remained vacant since former Chair Rostin Behnam stepped down in February, leaving the agency potentially without any of its current leadership by early 2026. Kristin Johnson The timing of Johnson’s departure means it is possible that her replacement, along with the rest of the commission’s leadership, could be chosen by President Donald Trump and confirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate. Trump nominated Quintenz to lead the CFTC in February, but the Senate has yet to vote on his confirmation. Under agency rules , commissioners are allowed to continue serving beyond their terms until successors are confirmed, provided it is before the next session of Congress. The leadership turnover comes at a critical moment for digital asset regulation in the United States. The CFTC, alongside the SEC, plays a central role in overseeing aspects of the crypto market, though the current regulatory framework has been criticized by lawmakers and industry participants as lacking clarity. This fueled bipartisan efforts to establish formal legislation that defines how digital assets should be regulated and delineates the responsibilities of the CFTC and SEC in overseeing this sometimes complicated sector. Crypto Industry Presses SEC for Staking Clarity While the CFTC is dealing with its leadership shakeup, crypto industry groups are calling on the SEC to provide formal guidance on staking. They argue that continued regulatory uncertainty poses serious challenges for Web3 infrastructure providers. According to Allison Muehr, head of staking policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, clarifying the SEC’s stance has become one of the industry's top policy priorities. At Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York, Muehr explained that although there has been a recent increase in constructive dialogue with the SEC, the industry is still far from regulatory clarity. “We’re about 25% of the way there,” she said, and pointed out that the past four months have seen more engagement from the SEC than the previous four years combined, yet formal staking guidance is still lacking. Allison Muehr Under the previous presidential administration, the SEC was very aggressive in its enforcement actions against crypto firms offering staking services. The regulator alleged that they were unregistered securities offerings. However, since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the SEC appears to have softened its position. In February, the agency clarified that meme coins do not qualify as investment contracts under US law. Then, in April, the SEC further stated that stablecoins do not qualify as securities when marketed purely as payment instruments. Despite these developments, the agency still has to issue any official position on staking in ETFs, which leaves a big gap in regulatory guidance for financial products that involve staking mechanisms. Muehr expressed optimism that the SEC may eventually greenlight staking in ETFs, including proposals tied to Solana. She mentioned that recent meetings with the agency have been productive, and she is still hopeful that the US market will soon see both a Solana ETF and a staked Solana ETF.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-27 11:54:40

HUMA price forecast (Source: TradingView) The Huma Finance price action on the 15-minute chart shows price caught between a rising support trendline and a descending resistance line, forming a converging triangle pattern. The most recent breakout attempt above $0.0659 failed, triggering a sharp sell-off that found support near $0.0605. Since then, the token has entered a phase of compression, with price now trading between $0.0625 and $0.0635. The upper resistance line near $0.0659 remains key, while support near $0.0610 aligns with the breakout region and is now being retested. A decisive move above or below this triangle will likely dictate near-term direction.

Circle is expanding globally, securing regulatory approval in Abu Dhabi and launching more partnerships. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has launched its initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise as much as $624 million on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “CRCL.” The fintech firm plans to offer 9.6 million shares of Class A common stock, while selling shareholders will offer an additional 14.4 million shares, according to a May 27 press release . The IPO is priced between $24 and $26 per share, with underwriters granted a 30-day option to purchase up to 3.6 million additional shares to cover over-allotments. If fully exercised, the offering would total 27.6 million shares. Circle’s Long-Awaited IPO Signals New Era for Stablecoin Giant The IPO marks Circle’s long-anticipated public debut, signaling a new chapter for one of the most prominent players in the stablecoin sector. The timing comes as regulatory scrutiny on digital asset firms remains high, with investors watching closely to gauge sentiment on publicly listed crypto infrastructure companies. J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs are serving as joint lead active bookrunners. Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and Société Générale are also acting as bookrunners, while a long list of co-managers includes BNY Capital Markets, Canaccord Genuity, Oppenheimer & Co., and Santander.

Circle’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still pending effectiveness. Therefore, the offering remains subject to market conditions and regulatory approval. The company had previously attempted to go public via a SPAC deal with Concord Acquisition Corp in 2021, but the agreement was mutually terminated in 2022. Since then, Circle has continued to position itself as a central figure in dollar-backed stablecoin infrastructure, with USDC currently holding a market capitalization of over $32 billion. If successful, Circle’s IPO would mark one of the largest public offerings by a crypto-focused firm since Coinbase’s 2021 listing. Circle Rejects Ripple’s $5B Bid Last month, Circle reportedly declined a $4–5 billion acquisition offer from Ripple. The bid was considered too low as Circle remained committed to pursuing its own path forward through a public offering. Separately, Circle secured in-principle approval from the Abu Dhabi Financial Services Regulatory Authority to operate as a money services business in the region. The milestone came following its recent incorporation in the UAE and expansion of its regulatory footprint in the Middle East. Circle also partnered with Hub71, a government-backed tech hub in Abu Dhabi. The collaboration will allow Circle to test its stablecoin offerings, including USDC and EURC, within a local regulatory sandbox, as competition in the stablecoin space continues to intensify.

The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year. StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.” According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further. Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge prover StarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.” Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.

With bullish sentiment surging and presale milestones rapidly surpassed, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to legendary early-stage breakouts and positioning itself as the must-watch altcoin for the year. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a standout crypto project for 2025. Its presale is attracting both new and experienced investors. The project’s fixed supply and audited contracts add significant credibility. Analysts see potential for massive returns if momentum remains strong. This unique blend of community and security is setting new standards. Bitcoin (BTC): Record Highs, Modest Upside Ahead Bitcoin recently smashed past $111,000, setting new all-time highs fueled by institutional inflows and ETF demand. While BTC’s outlook remains positive, analysts note that its current price leaves limited short-term upside—projecting only a 35% gain even if BTC reaches $150,000. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exponential growth potential for early investors. XRP: Bullish Momentum, But Growth Slowing XRP is trading around $2.34, buoyed by regulatory clarity and institutional interest, with long-term forecasts suggesting a possible rise to $8 by year-end. However, XRP’s recent breakout is showing signs of cooling, and while it remains a top asset, its upside is expected to be outpaced by MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale momentum. Injective (INJ): Steady Growth, Limited Explosiveness INJ continues to impress with ecosystem growth and technical innovation, but its price is expected to remain stable in the $17–$19 range in the near term. With ROI potential of around 48% for the year, INJ is a solid investment but lacks the multi-thousand-percent upside that MAGACOIN FINANCE is projecting. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts While BTC, XRP, and INJ remain market leaders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top opportunity for outsized returns in 2025 . With analysts forecasting up to 13,000% ROI before Q3 and presale momentum accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform every major altcoin this cycle.

But crypto expert George from CryptosRUS believes a big move is coming. In a talk with Altcoin Daily , he predicted XRP could reach $8 to $10 by 2025, calling it a “conservative” estimate. With shrinking supply and rising demand, some say XRP’s scarcity could fuel a major price surge. Analyst Believes XRP to Make 4x Jump In an interview, George explained that XRP has survived many crypto cycles, which shows its strength in the market. He pointed out that XRP has strong fundamentals, a loyal community, and a clear use case. He also highlighted one of the key reasons George is hopeful about XRP’s price is the possible launch of XRP ETFs in the future. He believes ETFs could bring in more big investors, just like they did with Bitcoin and Ethereum. This could help XRP’s price rise even faster. When asked about XRP’s price potential, he said Bitcoin might still grow 1.5x to 2x, and Ethereum could go up 3x to 4x. For XRP, as the current price is trading around $2.3, it would possibly jump to $8 to $10, meaning a 4x gain, which he says is very possible. XRP’s Unique Token Burn Strategy Beyond these predictions, XRP works differently from most other digital coins because it doesn’t use mining. All of its 100 billion tokens were created at launch. With every transaction, a tiny amount, like 0.00001 XRP, is permanently destroyed to fight spam. Over time, this has led to more than 13.9 million XRP being burned forever , shrinking the total supply little by little. Some experts see this as a sign of future price growth due to increasing scarcity, even as some critics argue that the supply remains large enough to dampen any real impact. Together, the promise of shrinking supply and the potential for future ETF launches have many XRP supporters hoping for a big price surge ahead. XRP Price New As of now, XRP is trading at around $2.31 , showing a slight 1% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite the dip, its market cap stands strong at $136 billion, and interestingly, the 24-hour trading volume has jumped 8%, reaching approximately $2.2 billion.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 12:03:59

As we approach the end of Q2, investors and enthusiasts are recalibrating their portfolios to hop on the most promising crypto projects, tokens and opportunities that will deliver a possible 10x in June. Three names that continue to stand out are; Litecoin (LTC), Bitget (BGB) and Mantix (MTX) . Why are these tokens tagged as the most promising investments ahead of Q3? Let’s analyze. Litecoin (LTC): The forgotten blue-chip staging a comeback Litecoin (LTC) was created off Bitcoin’s original open-source code with few modifications to serve as a competition. Investopedia named LTC “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold” and at its peak, was once the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. LTC is one of the most reliable, battle-tested, and payment-integrated tokens. Unlike other blockchains, Litecoin offers fast, low-cost payments making it a go-to for users who value efficiency and network stability. Recently, enthusiasm and attention around LTC seem to have renewed again, as it is recording a surge in payment adoption gateways, and retail platforms. With this recent development, many believe LTC is poised for a bullish run to the upside. With over a decade of holding strong and maintaining its stance, LTC is one of the most promising crypto investments for June and beyond. Bitget (BGB): From exchange token to ecosystem powerhouse Bitget is one of the fastest-growing crypto exchanges in Asia and Europe. Its native token, BGB is gaining traction and is widely adopted in these regions. BGB was initially launched as a utility token for fee discounts. However, BGB has evolved into a power key in the Bitget ecosystem – fueling staking, launchpad access, and exclusive rewards. Bitget (BGB) is compliant with regulations, transparent and not under scrutiny like many other decentralized exchanges. BGB is no longer just a token but a sustainable one with long-term potential. Mantix (MTX): The new trending dex In the crypto space, it’s well known that getting or investing in a project or token at its early stage is always the target. Mantix ($MTX) is offering another early-stage opportunity for investors who missed exchange tokens like BNB, OKB or BGB at their early stage. Mantix ($MTX) is currently in Stage 1 of its presale, trading at $0.02. $MTX powers a revolutionary decentralized exchange built for cross-chain trading, staking, and leveraged futures up to 1000x. Unlike other decentralized exchanges, Mantix offers real utilities, and analysts have proven it to outrun existing platforms such as Hyperliquid and DYDX . Some of the utilities include; A revenue-sharing model, which rewards token holders with a portion of the platform’s trading profits. Combined with a fixed supply of 1.2 billion tokens, periodic burns and buybacks. All $MTX holders have governance rights to vote and participate in all decision-making regarding Mantix. While LTC and BGB are already established, $MTX offers a shot at a high return on investment in June and beyond.

He’s been given the rank of a minister of state but will work without a salary or any official perks. Pakistan Backs Crypto This move follows a series of government initiatives in Pakistan’s digital space. Recently, the government endorsed the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), which will oversee crypto exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, DeFi apps, and more. It was also announced that it will dedicate 2,000 megawatts of extra electricity to bitcoin mining, to support both mining and AI data centers. This initiative is led by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to boost revenue, create tech jobs, and attract foreign investment. Former Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, joined the Council as an advisor in April, after he served a four-month U.S. prison sentence for breaking anti-money laundering laws. Pakistan’s Growing Ties With WLF Pakistan’s growing involvement with cryptocurrency has also raised concerns. One reason why Pakistan may be pushing crypto is due to the dip in its foreign investment, which has dropped 45% in February. In January, Pakistan had also hired a U.S. lobbyist in January to set up meetings in Washington. During a visit, the interior minister even asked for more U.S. investment, according to The Wall Street Journal. Shortly after that, the country started building ties with the Trump-linked crypto project World Liberty Financial. In April, Bin Saqib joined as an advisor following a visit by co-founder Zach Witkoff, who signed an agreement with Pakistan’s ministry to explore using World Liberty’s stablecoin for trade and remittances. The WSJ report claimed that Zhao was helping with World Liberty’s foreign connections, but Zhao denied, calling it “ another hit piece .” The PCC has signed a series of deals with WLF to boost crypto investment and innovation.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 12:07:02

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-youre-about-to-become-extremely-rich-heres-why/,"The XRP community is once again buzzing with excitement following a striking update shared by the popular crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO. According to a recent post on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO presented an XRP chart showing the cryptocurrency consolidating firmly around the $2.40 mark. The analyst expressed a strong belief that this consolidation phase is not a sign of weakness but rather the groundwork for what could become an astronomical surge in XRP’s value. Dear #XRP holders, You’re about to become extremely rich. pic.twitter.com/vP9E7utBAU — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 26, 2025 Technical Strength Behind the Consolidation Technical consolidation is often misunderstood in the crypto market. While some traders interpret sideways movements or price plateaus as stagnation, seasoned analysts like STEPH IS CRYPTO understand that these phases often precede explosive breakouts. In the case of XRP, the $2 zone has become a critical support level, where buying pressure is steadily absorbing any selling activity. This creates what’s known in technical analysis as an accumulation zone—a phase where larger players quietly build their positions before a sharp upward move. Market data from major exchanges and on-chain trackers confirm that XRP’s liquidity profile is tightening. Trading volumes have remained robust, with price volatility gradually narrowing, suggesting that both retail and institutional investors are positioning themselves for the next major leg up. Historical patterns show that XRP has a tendency to surge dramatically after prolonged consolidation periods, as seen in past cycles when price resistance levels were systematically breached. Broader Market Context: A Perfect Storm for XRP Beyond technicals, the broader crypto environment is setting the stage for XRP’s rise. Regulatory clarity has increasingly swung in Ripple’s favor since Judge Analisa Torres’ pivotal 2023 ruling, which clarified that XRP sold on exchanges does not constitute a security. This landmark decision dismantled much of the legal uncertainty that had weighed on XRP’s price for years, unlocking new avenues for institutional adoption. Furthermore, Ripple’s strategic partnerships continue to expand across cross-border payment corridors, with a growing number of banks and financial institutions integrating RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solutions. This utility-driven demand for XRP strengthens the asset’s underlying value proposition, positioning it as not just another speculative token but a key infrastructure component in the evolving digital payments ecosystem. Investor Sentiment: A Surge in Confidence Investor sentiment surrounding XRP is palpably bullish. Social media platforms, particularly X, have seen a marked increase in positive sentiment metrics, with hashtags like #XRPARMY and #XRPCommunity trending regularly. Influencers and analysts, including STEPH IS CRYPTO, are amplifying this optimism, reinforcing the community’s belief that XRP is poised for a monumental rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What distinguishes this moment from previous XRP hype cycles is the convergence of technical, regulatory, and fundamental drivers. Unlike past runs fueled primarily by speculative mania, today’s XRP market is underpinned by solid institutional interest, growing real-world use cases, and a legal environment that now offers greater clarity and confidence. A Word of Caution Amid the Optimism While the excitement is justified, investors must approach the market with prudence. Crypto markets are inherently volatile, and even the most promising assets can experience sharp pullbacks. Analysts like STEPH IS CRYPTO emphasize the importance of watching key technical levels and maintaining a disciplined investment strategy. Should XRP break decisively above its current consolidation range, it could indeed unlock parabolic upside—but traders must also be prepared for potential retracements along the way. The message is clear: according to STEPH IS CRYPTO and a growing chorus of analysts and investors, XRP holders may be on the cusp of extraordinary wealth. The cryptocurrency’s strong technical setup around $2.40, coupled with improving regulatory clarity and surging institutional demand, paints a compelling picture of a digital asset ready to soar. As always, those in the XRP community are reminded to stay informed, stay strategic, and—above all—stay patient. If the current signals prove true, XRP’s next chapter could indeed be one of historic gains. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

SNX is the native token for the Synthetix Network and is used for governance. It is listed on top exchanges like Binance, Uniswap, Coinbase, OKX, and Bybit.

Synthetix Coin price analysis gives out a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. SNX coin has spiked up to $0.8 in the past 24 hours. If buyers maintain the current momentum, SNX price might witness further surges above $0.8, potentially retesting $0.9. On the other hand, if sellers emerge and defend further surges, SNX price might drop below EMA trend lines. In such a case, the altcoin price might aim for a drop below $0.7. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $4.96 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is under bullish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price increased up to $0.795 recovering 1.64% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.31 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2030. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.69, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.69 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. At the start of May, SNX is trading in a range of $0.663 to $0.753.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SNX|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-27 12:10:00

Crypto exchanges continue to carry high risks of money laundering , according to Luxembourg’s latest National Risk Assessment, which warns that the risks remain elevated despite a drop in transaction volumes over the past two years. In the 2025 report , Luxembourg writes that the inherent risk of crypto businesses remains “high,” with the main drivers being “volume of clients/transactions and distribution channels, followed by size, ownership/legal structure, products/activities and the international nature of the business.” According to the report, the use of crypto, especially with regard to investment fraud , “has become more prevalent,” adding further that the surge in fraud is linked to “the increase in value of certain crypto assets and growing media attention around crypto investments.” You might also like: Standard Chartered wins license in Luxembourg to offer crypto custody services “The involvement of non-compliant crypto service providers with insufficient levels of KYC in offshore jurisdictions remains one of the main challenges in many cryptocurrency investigations as they often give rise to lengthy MLA procedures.” Luxembourg’s NRA report Luxembourg-registered crypto exchanges processed 30.2 million transactions worth €106.8 billion in 2021, the data shows.

The framework deploys AI agents to autonomously search, shop, and carry out crypto payments on both online and offline merchants. According to a recent blogpost , the crypto payment protocol plans to build a comprehensive framework that would enable AI agents to take on a more active role than simply facilitating crypto payments. Through AI Payment, AI-powered agents will be able to shop online like real customers; learning user preferences, compare between products and make purchases without human intervention. So far, the protocol has developed an integrated stack that enables different crypto payments to be made through the new feature. The protocol claimed that AI agents will not only be able to complete online crypto payments, but they will also be able to perform QR-code based payments in physical retail stores. With the help of AEON’s Swap Pay, the protocol hopes to give users a smooth and automatic process of paying with crypto assets on various blockchain networks, and upcoming NFC-based functionality will further expand real-world usability. By 2025, AEON plans to deploy its AI agent payment service in North American and European regions through its partnership with Visa and Mastercard . Then in the following year, the protocol hopes to fully establish itself as the industry standard for AI agent payments and agent verification.

So far, the protocol has partnered with projects like PIN AI and SendAI, which will help it embed AI agents more deeply into real-world commerce. AI Payment is meant to be an omni-chain feature that can support crypto wallet from any blockchain network. To make this vision possible, AEON has partnered collaborated with major blockchain ecosystems including BNB Chain ( BNB ), Solana ( SOL ), TON ( TON ), TRON ( TRX ), Stellar ( XLM ), Plume, Bitget Wallet ( BGB ), and KuCoin Pay. Moreover, AEON’s AI Payment comes with a built-in infrastructure complete with KYA or Know-Your-Agent requirements which is used to verify agent identity and behavior, much like how Know-Your-Customer applies to human-controlled accounts. In addition, the framework also abides by LLM-based payment intent verification to make sure its actions align with user intent, and ZKP-based identity and authorization using a decentralized node network. Last week, AEON announced a partnership with KuCoin Pay to enable crypto payments at both physical and online merchants. Earlier in April, the protocol also integrated Stellar network assets, including XLM and USDC ( USDC ), into its AEON Pay solution.

According to Reuters, Circle will be issuing around 9.6 million shares, while some of its shareholders are looking to offload around 14.4 million shares, priced between $24 and $26 each, in a bid to raise $624 million. Once the listing completes, Circle will be trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) carrying the CRCL ticker. Circle’s Upcoming IPO As CryptoPotato reported previously, the company filed for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) back in April. Operating the world’s second-largest stablecoin by means of total market capitalization, Circle also posted impressive revenue reports. The firm posted steadily increasing revenue (up 16% year over year) but decreasing EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) and net income. Back then, Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, said in a letter to investors: “For Circle, becoming a publicly traded corporation on the NYSE is a continuation of our desire to operate with the greatest transparency and accountability possible,” said Allaire, who added: “We are building what we believe to be critical infrastructure for the financial system, and we seek to work with leading companies and governments around the world in shaping and building this new internet financial system.” At the time of this writing, there is no further information on the details of the initial public offering.

Starting today, May 27, users can trade pairs such as PI/USD1 and SOL/USD1 on the exchange. What is USD1? As explained by Dr Altcoin, USD1 is a fiat-backed stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar. It is supported by US Treasuries, cash, and cash equivalents, and was introduced in April 2025 by World Liberty Financial, a Miami-based fintech company. What makes USD1 stand out is its high-profile backing. The company is majority-owned by entities connected to the Trump family business. A Trump-owned entity holds 60% of World Liberty Financial and is entitled to 75% of all revenue from coin sales. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are also actively involved in managing the company. Why This Matters for Pi Network This new trading pair is more than just another market listing — it marks a big step for Pi Network as it moves toward broader adoption. By pairing with a compliant, dollar-backed stablecoin, Pi gains access to regulated liquidity and greater institutional exposure. After more than six years of development, mining, and community building, Pi Network is now being recognized alongside established cryptocurrencies like Solana. This listing could open doors to regulated financial infrastructure, attract attention from mainstream investors, and provide access to traditional financial networks. However, Pi coin price is yet to react to this news. The price has dipped more than 3% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $0.74. After hitting a monthly high of $1.57, Pi is now trading sideways.

Ripple CTO Explains the Truth Behind the Controversy,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-xrp-centralized-ripple-cto-explains-the-truth-behind-the-controversy/,"The post Is XRP Centralized? Ripple CTO Explains the Truth Behind the Controversy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recently, the crypto community has been buzzing about whether XRP is centralized, especially after MMA star Conor McGregor tweeted about the US government potentially investing in XRP, SOL, and ADA. This sparked fresh debates: Is XRP truly decentralized like Bitcoin, or is it controlled by Ripple and its leaders? Unlike Bitcoin – which has no known leader since Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared – Ripple’s well-known CEO Brad Garlinghouse often draws suspicion. Does having public faces mean XRP is centralized? Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, stepped up to explain how XRP’s decentralization really works and why many assumptions miss the mark. Schwartz Explains XRP’s Design: No Issuer, No Control Schwartz quickly tackled the key question: XRP has no issuer. The entire supply of XRP was created at the launch of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and no new XRP tokens have been issued since then. Most cryptocurrencies rely on mining or gradual token releases, but XRP was designed differently. Its full supply was available from day one, allowing anyone to claim XRP without competition or mining. This means Ripple doesn’t control how XRP is distributed. “The XRP Ledger has no mechanism for creating new XRP,” Schwartz stated , firmly dispelling notions of Ripple’s control over the asset. What Does Decentralization Really Mean? Schwartz encourages the crypto community to move beyond debating labels like “centralized” or “decentralized.” Instead, he suggests focusing on the purpose of decentralization: preventing censorship, avoiding control by a single party, and ensuring the network’s integrity. By shifting the conversation to these practical goals, it becomes easier to judge whether XRP’s system can be controlled or compromised. When viewed this way, XRP’s decentralization is more complex, and arguably stronger, than many think. Ripple’s Leadership vs. XRP Control: What’s the Difference? A major source of confusion comes from Ripple’s public leadership. CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other executives are often seen as the faces of XRP in industry and regulatory talks. But Schwartz makes it clear: just because Ripple has visible leaders doesn’t mean it controls XRP. The XRP Ledger operates independently of Ripple’s business. Having a well-known company behind the technology does not translate to centralized control over XRP or the network. Understanding XRP’s Decentralization Today David Schwartz’s explanation reaffirms XRP’s status as a decentralized asset – even if it doesn’t look like Bitcoin’s leaderless model. He reminds us that decentralization isn’t just about having no CEOs or issuing new tokens. It’s about whether the network can protect users from censorship and control. As debates continue in the crypto space, Schwartz’s view challenges us to focus on what truly matters: whether a blockchain is secure, fair, and resistant to central points of failure. In this light, XRP’s decentralization is clearer than ever.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MINING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 12:19:27

Over the past 24 hours, SHOGGOTH experienced a remarkable price increase, leaving many wondering about the catalyst behind this rapid ascent. It appears the powerful Elon Musk effect may once again be at play. What Triggered the SHOGGOTH Memecoin Surge? According to data from CoinGecko, the SHOGGOTH memecoin price jumped an impressive 84.1% within a single day, reaching a peak of $0.0135. This significant crypto pump occurred shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk reposted content from an X account titled “AI Notkilleveryoneism Memes.” While Musk’s repost itself didn’t directly mention SHOGGOTH, the profile picture of the account he amplified prominently features an image associated with the SHOGGOTH token. In the often speculative and sentiment-driven memecoin market, even indirect association with a figure as influential as Elon Musk can trigger massive trading activity. Understanding the Shoggoth AI Meme The origin of the Shoggoth imagery tied to this memecoin stems from broader discussions surrounding artificial intelligence. The AI meme itself is rooted in H.P. Lovecraft’s cosmic horror mythology, where Shoggoths are amorphous, protoplasmic entities capable of mimicking forms but possessing terrifying, unknowable inner realities. In the context of AI discourse, the Shoggoth meme is often used to symbolize the complex, opaque, and potentially uncontrollable nature of advanced AI systems. They might appear friendly or simple on the surface, but their true workings and potential capabilities are hidden and perhaps unsettling. This narrative adds a layer of cultural relevance for those following AI developments. The Potent Elon Musk Effect on Crypto Elon Musk’s influence on cryptocurrency markets, particularly memecoins, is well-documented. His tweets, reposts, or even subtle mentions have historically caused significant price swings for various tokens, most notably Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This phenomenon is often referred to as the Elon Musk effect . Here’s why his social media activity holds such sway: Massive Following: Musk commands an enormous audience on X (formerly Twitter), ensuring his posts reach millions instantly. Cultural Icon Status: He is a prominent figure in technology, space exploration, and pop culture, giving his opinions outsized weight. Memecoin Enthusiast: Musk has openly expressed interest in and posted about memecoins before, making his account a key source of potential catalysts for this market segment. Market Sentiment Driver: In highly speculative markets like memecoins, sentiment is a primary price driver. A nod from Musk can instantly generate positive sentiment and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). The recent SHOGGOTH surge serves as another prime example of how a single social media interaction from a high-profile individual can lead to a substantial crypto pump . Navigating the Memecoin Market: Risks and Rewards While the 84% jump in SHOGGOTH memecoin price highlights the potential for rapid gains in this market sector, it’s crucial for investors to understand the inherent risks. Potential Rewards: High volatility can lead to quick, significant profits. Often driven by community and social media trends, which can create strong momentum. Low entry price for many tokens. Significant Risks: Extreme volatility leading to rapid, substantial losses. Lack of underlying fundamentals or utility compared to other cryptocurrencies. High susceptibility to manipulation and pump-and-dump schemes. Reliance on social media trends and celebrity endorsements (like the Elon Musk effect ), which are unpredictable and fleeting. Many memecoins have short lifespans. Investing in tokens like SHOGGOTH memecoin should be approached with extreme caution, acknowledging that the potential for loss is high. Price movements are often driven purely by speculation and hype, not intrinsic value. What’s Next for SHOGGOTH? Predicting the future trajectory of a memecoin, especially one whose recent pump is linked to an external social media event, is challenging. The price could consolidate, continue rising if hype builds, or rapidly fall back down as early buyers take profits. The sustainability of the SHOGGOTH memecoin price will depend on whether it can build a lasting community, develop any perceived utility (which is rare for pure memecoins), or benefit from further positive attention. For now, its movement is a clear illustration of the power of social media and key figures in the crypto space. Conclusion: The Power of the Repost The recent surge in SHOGGOTH memecoin value serves as a compelling case study of the Elon Musk effect and its impact on the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. A simple repost, amplifying an account featuring the token’s associated imagery, was enough to trigger a massive crypto pump , driving the memecoin price up by over 84%. While the underlying AI meme adds an interesting cultural layer, the primary driver was undoubtedly the exposure gained through Musk’s vast platform. This event underscores both the exciting potential for rapid gains and the significant risks inherent in the memecoin market, reminding investors that social media sentiment can be a powerful, albeit unpredictable, force.

XRP, SOL, and DOGE also have multiple spot ETF filings, with Polymarket suggesting strong approval chances before the end of 2025. The Odds are Rising The leading digital asset manager, Grayscale, filed for a spot Cardano (ADA) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States in February this year. The authority responsible for approving or denying that type of product is the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Numerous X users have recently pointed out that the agency has until May 29 to either approve or reject Grayscale’s application . It is important to note that the SEC has a maximum of 240 days to review Grayscale’s proposed spot ADA ETF and may choose to delay its decision multiple times. The regulator officially acknowledged the filing on February 24, meaning it has until October 22 to give its final answer. Launching such an investment vehicle will give investors additional options to gain exposure to Cardano’s native token and could positively impact its price. After all, buying a spot ETF is as simple as purchasing regular stocks, all done through standard brokerage accounts. In the aftermath, investors hold shares of the product, while the fund itself acquires and securely holds the underlying cryptocurrency on their behalf. Toward mid-April, the chances of an approved spot ADA ETF before the end of 2025 dropped to 37% (according to Polymarket). In the past several days, though, there has been renewed optimism, and the odds have risen to 70%. Nearly a month ago, Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, estimated that the product has a 75% chance of seeing the light of day sometime this year. He later predicted that many of the spot crypto ETF applications standing on the SEC’s desk could receive a green light as early as this summer. XRP, SOL, and DOGE Аre Also in the Game Introducing spot ETFs with various leading altcoins as underlying tokens has been a mission for numerous well-known companies. XRP leads the number of pending applications in the United States, with active filings submitted by Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and others. According to Polymarket, the odds of an approved fund before the end of 2025 currently stand at 84%. When moving the deadline to July 31 , though , the percentage drops to 22%. Solana’s native token has also garnered significant interest. VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise are among the popular names competing to become the first to introduce a spot SOL ETF in America. Polymarket estimates the odds of the financial vehicle to go live in 2025 are 83%. The biggest meme coin in terms of market capitalization – Dogecoin – is on that list, too. The companies willing to launch a spot DOGE ETF in the world’s largest economy include Bitwise, REX Shares, and 21Shares . The approval chances before July 31 are a mere 16%, but those climb to 67% when the deadline is set for New Year’s Eve.

Punisher Coin Can Be Your Second Chance For 1000x Gains,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/punisher-coin-can-be-your-second-chance-for-1000x-gains/,"The post Still Thinking About Missing Dogecoin And Shiba Inu’s Meteoric Rise? Punisher Coin Can Be Your Second Chance For 1000x Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Still regretting not riding the DOGE or SHIB rocket to wealth back in 2021? You’re not alone — but the meme coin market never stops offering second chances. In 2025, investors are asking one crucial question: What’s the next meme coin to explode? The answer might just be Punisher Coin . With a bold strategy, powerful community rewards, and aggressive market positioning, Punisher Coin is emerging as a top crypto for 1000x gains. Why Punisher Coin Could Be the Best Meme Coin to Buy in 2025 Punisher Coin ($PUN), built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, isn’t just riding the meme wave — it’s rewriting the playbook. It introduces a unique “Punisher Energy” mechanism that actively targets weaker meme coins and incentivizes their holders to swap into $PUN by offering bonus tokens. This calculated raid on competing projects drains liquidity and strengthens Punisher Coin’s dominance. But it’s not just about disruption — it’s about engagement. Punisher Coin’s community missions reward holders with real money and $PUN tokens for participation. This gamified layer promotes loyalty and viral growth, setting it apart from the hype-only coins of past cycles. Its presale is already creating a buzz, raising over $30,000 in its first hour — an indicator that $PUN might just be the next big thing in meme coins with 1000x potential. Dogecoin: The Meme King That Started It All Dogecoin’s rise was the stuff of legends. From a joke to a multi-billion-dollar market cap, DOGE proved that community-driven crypto could defy all odds. Yet in 2025, Dogecoin’s returns have plateaued. Its tech is dated, its use case remains limited, and its growth has slowed. While DOGE still holds nostalgic appeal, it lacks the innovation and strategic aggression that newer tokens — like Punisher Coin — bring to the table. Shiba Inu: Ecosystem Builder or Faded Star? Shiba Inu (SHIB), known as the “Dogecoin Killer,” built an entire ecosystem with ShibaSwap, Shibarium, and a loyal community. But even with utility upgrades, SHIB’s price action has largely stagnated. It’s increasingly difficult for SHIB to replicate its original gains, and the influx of new, high-utility meme coins is drawing investor attention elsewhere. Punisher Coin doesn’t just compete — it attacks. By offering financial incentives to switch, it’s not just another meme coin. It’s a threat to legacy meme tokens like SHIB. Punisher Coin vs. DOGE & SHIB: A Comparative Look Dogecoin operates on its own native blockchain, while both Shiba Inu and Punisher Coin are built on Ethereum, with Punisher Coin using the ERC-20 standard. When it comes to community incentives, Dogecoin offers limited options, Shiba Inu provides moderate engagement, and Punisher Coin stands out with high community involvement through missions and rewards. Strategically, Dogecoin lacks a defined market approach, Shiba Inu is developing its own ecosystem, and Punisher Coin employs a unique “raiding” strategy fueled by Punisher Energy. In terms of timing, the early investment window for both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has passed, whereas Punisher Coin is currently in an active presale phase—offering a new opportunity for early backers. Looking ahead to 2025, Dogecoin is unlikely to achieve a 1000x return, Shiba Inu faces challenges, but Punisher Coin is positioned with strong potential for such a leap. Don’t Miss This Wave DOGE and SHIB had their time. Punisher Coin is built for what comes next: a more strategic, more engaged, and more rewarding meme coin era. With aggressive tokenomics, active staking in development, and a strong presale showing, it’s not just a meme — it’s a mission. The crypto market loves a comeback story. If you missed the first wave, Punisher Coin might be your redemption. Join the presale, grab your $PUN tokens, and be part of the revolution that could define meme coins in 2025.

With analysts reaffirming a 45x return on investment (ROI) is still achievable, MAGACOIN FINANCE is outpacing even established cryptos like XRP, SEI, and Cardano (ADA). The project’s unique blend of strong fundamentals, audited smart contracts, and a rapidly growing community makes it the standout opportunity in today’s market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Growth and Community Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to shatter expectations, with over 12,500 holders and more than $5 million raised in presale. Analysts project a conservative 25x–45x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even higher potential if the token hits major exchanges. The project’s audited contract and utility-driven ecosystem set it apart from typical memecoins, fueling its explosive growth. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF XRP: Bullish Setup Despite Short-Term Volatility XRP is trading around $2.34, holding strong above key support levels despite recent market uncertainty. Technical analysts see potential for a breakout toward $2.47 and beyond if bulls reclaim the 50-period EMA. Long-term forecasts remain bullish, with some predicting XRP could reach $8 by year-end. While XRP offers solid upside, its growth potential is overshadowed by MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale momentum. SEI: Technical Strength and Network Adoption SEI is holding crucial support near $0.52, with technical indicators signaling room for bullish expansion. Daily active addresses have risen 12% to 45,000, and trading volume is up, reflecting growing investor interest. SEI’s price is expected to test $0.58 if market sentiment remains positive, but its upside is modest compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale projections. Cardano (ADA): Bullish Trend with Modest Gains ADA is forecast to range between $0.66 and $1.88 in 2025, with a possible stretch to $2.36. The recent double-bottom pattern suggests a new bullish trend is underway, but ADA’s upside is expected to be steady rather than explosive. MAGACOIN FINANCE , by contrast, offers early investors a rare chance for outsized returns. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion While XRP, SEI, and ADA remain strong investments, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top opportunity for outsized gains in 2025.

One prominent voice in the XRP community, EGRAG Crypto, recently shared a detailed analysis on X, laying out projected XRP price levels based on its circulating supply and various market capitalization milestones. Drawing from historical patterns, Fibonacci measurements, and chart formations, EGRAG Crypto provides a roadmap for XRP enthusiasts looking to understand the possible trajectories of the asset. Market Cap vs. Actual Value: A Necessary Clarification Before diving into the numbers, it’s important to highlight a crucial disclaimer raised by EGRAG Crypto. Although market capitalization is widely used as a quick reference in the crypto world, it is often misunderstood. Many beginners mistakenly equate market cap with the actual liquidity or real-world value of a cryptocurrency when, in fact, it’s simply a mathematical product: the current price of the asset multiplied by its circulating supply. #XRP – Market Cap and The Math Behind It : As you know, I’m not a big fan of using Market Cap (MC) as a primary indicator in crypto — it often provides false indication and misleads beginners into thinking it’s the actual liquidity or value of a coin. That said, I… pic.twitter.com/Mbk56kj9O0 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 27, 2025 As EGRAG emphasizes, the market cap does not represent the total cash in the system nor the total accessible value. This nuance matters because using market cap alone as a valuation metric can mislead both new investors and seasoned traders alike. The Technical Setup: W Formation and Fibonacci Projections EGRAG Crypto’s recent analysis traces back to a long-standing technical observation — a W-shaped formation spotted on XRP’s market cap chart many months ago. This formation, well-known among chartists, suggests potential measured moves based on the depth and breakout level of the pattern. The analysis identifies two types of measured moves: one calculated on a non-logarithmic scale, landing around $270 billion in market cap, and another on a logarithmic scale, projecting as high as $1.5 trillion. EGRAG further integrates Fibonacci tools, particularly focusing on the 1.618 extension, a key level in many technical setups. By comparing past cycles where XRP moved from the 1.0 Fib level to the 1.618 extension, the analysis estimates potential percentage gains of 242% and, in more aggressive scenarios, up to 600%. Breaking Down the Price Targets With XRP’s circulating supply firmly set at approximately 58.68 billion tokens, the projected market caps translate into specific price levels. Here’s how the math unfolds: At a $270 billion market cap, the price per XRP would hover around $4.60. At $450 billion, the price target jumps to roughly $7.66, reflecting a 242% increase from earlier benchmarks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Pushing further to $978 billion, the price projection soars to about $16.65, extending the same 242% but extrapolated to a larger market framework. Finally, reaching the ambitious $1.5 trillion mark, XRP could potentially command a price of $25.56, based on the W formation’s maximum measured move on a non-logarithmic chart. These figures are derived from straightforward calculations dividing the total projected market capitalization by the circulating supply (for example, $270 billion divided by 58.68 billion tokens equals approximately $4.60 per XRP). While the arithmetic is simple, the underlying market movements and investor behavior that would drive XRP to these levels are far more complex and nuanced. Caution and Strategy: The Hallmarks of Successful Investing While the price targets are exciting, EGRAG Crypto leaves readers with a grounded piece of advice: always lock in profits. The crypto market’s notorious volatility has caught many investors off guard, especially those who let greed override discipline. Regardless of how promising projections may seem, having a clear plan, defined exit points, and the discipline to follow through can make the difference between long-term gains and painful losses. As EGRAG puts it, success in crypto isn’t about chasing every high — it’s about sticking to your plan with robotic consistency. EGRAG Crypto’s analysis offers XRP investors an insightful look into the potential price ranges the asset could achieve under various market cap scenarios. While market capitalization is only one piece of the puzzle, combining it with historical patterns, Fibonacci analysis, and technical formations creates a compelling case for informed speculation. As always, these projections should be used as part of a broader strategy that includes sound risk management and profit-taking discipline. Whether XRP reaches $4.60, $7.66, or even $25.56, the key to success will lie not in hoping for moonshots but in preparing wisely for every market turn.

The platform now hosts an expanding array of projects spanning domains such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and even meme tokens — with several of these applications having already generated significant user adoption and trading volumes. The ongoing development has been driven, in large part, by Sonic's high-performance infrastructure, which enables developers to build next-generation Web3 applications that leverage the platform's fast and composable architecture. Among the standout projects are a decentralized exchange (DEX), a liquid staking protocol and a fully on-chain game. On the company’s rapidly evolving suite of products, Sonic CEO Chriz Zhu opined: ""The rapid expansion of our ecosystem highlights the versatility and performance of Sonic SVM. These projects are just the beginning of a vibrant, interconnected ecosystem, building key infrastructure across DeFi, NFTs and social applications."" DeFi Infrastructure Takes Center Stage Leading the charge within Sonic's DeFi ecosystem is SEGA DEX, which has pioneered an innovative incentive model based on the Olympus DAO-style ve(3,3) governance mechanism. The exchange operates alongside a specialized launchpad designed for today's ‘attention economy,’ creating a unique trading environment that has already attracted substantial liquidity and user engagement. To elaborate, since going live, SEGA has accumulated over $1.18 million in total value locked and facilitated more than $9 million in trading volume on Sonic SVM. Moreover, the platform regularly sees peak daily trading volumes exceeding $1 million and has cultivated a thriving community of over 30,000 members across various social channels. Commenting on the platform’s success a SEGA spokesperson was recently quoted as saying: ""Our ve(3,3) model creates stronger alignment between liquidity providers and token holders, while our launchpad is custom-made for the attention economy."" Complementing this trading infrastructure has been Chaos Finance, Sonic's liquid staking solution that allows users to stake $SONIC while maintaining liquidity for DeFi activities. Built on StaFi's Liquid Staking-as-a-Service (LaaS) technology, Chaos issues $sSONIC derivative tokens that represent staked $SONIC and can be utilized across various applications within the ecosystem. The protocol has already secured over 765,000 SONIC tokens via staking, with approximately 754,000 sSONIC tokens now in circulation. The liquid staking tokens have found immediate utility within the ecosystem, particularly in gaming applications where they serve as both currency and reward mechanisms. Gaming and NFTs Redefine Digital Experiences The aforementioned innovation extends beyond traditional DeFi into gaming and digital collectibles as well, with some projects seemingly blurring the lines between different asset types and use cases. FoMoney, for instance, represents a breakthrough in on-chain gaming, combining the familiar puzzle mechanics of ""2048"" with the suspense of prize models to create a yield-generating gaming experience. Since its testnet debut FoMoney has exhibited strong numbers, having already on-boarded over one million players and generated more than 200 million on-chain transactions. The game leverages Sonic's Attention Capital Market architecture to create what developers describe as a Game Asset Layer, where holders of liquid staking tokens can play to earn additional rewards. On the matter, FoMoney’s core dev team believes: ""By marrying gaming with DeFi, we've created a system where every game turn is productive. Players literally get to play with yield – each move in FoMoney has real economic value, which aligns perfectly with Sonic's attention-driven vision for Web3."" Within the NFT market, Chillonic has introduced Sonic SVM's first major collection through its innovative ""Chill-404"" protocol, a technology enabling seamless conversions between NFTs and fungible tokens — thereby allowing collectors to maintain their assets' identity and rarity while gaining the liquidity benefits of token trading. Lastly, the memecoin sector too has found its place in Sonic's expanding ecosystem through Goodr, which began as a memecoin launchpad but has since evolved into a comprehensive platform for anime fandom. The project is set to offer one of the world's first user-generated content IP token platforms for anime fans, working with Japanese anime rights holders to create official and fan-inspired tokens tied to popular series. Goodr’s beta release concluded on May 20th and the company recently announced that it has plans to release a Sonic SVM Meme Kit shortly, enabling creators to launch their own meme-token projects more easily. Network Effects Drive Ecosystem Integration What sets Sonic's ecosystem apart is the increasing integration between different projects, creating network effects that benefit users across the platform. For example, FoMoney's integration of sSONIC tokens asan in-game currency creates direct utility for Chaos Finance's liquid staking protocol, connecting DeFi yields with gaming rewards. Speaking on this interconnectedness quotient, Sonic’s Head of DeFi Freiheit stated: ""What's particularly exciting is how these projects are starting to integrate with each other. The partnerships between SEGA and Chillonic, and between Chaos and FoMoney, are just the first sparks of network effects we're seeing in our ecosystem."" Looking ahead, as Sonic SVM continues to develop its infrastructure and attract new projects, its emphasis on attention-driven mechanisms and composable architecture appears set to drive sustainable network effects that can benefit both its developer base and core clientele equally.

45159632,https://crypto.news/?p=14383399,1748352962,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/45159632.jpeg,Exclusive: How NATIX plans to disrupt autonomous driving with decentralized data,https://crypto.news/exclusive-how-natix-plans-to-disrupt-autonomous-mapping-with-decentralized-data/,"NATIX Network has officially launched StreetVision on the Bittensor decentralized AI network, representing a step forward in its mission to modernize mapping and autonomous driving through decentralized, real-world data processing. Powered by a Solana- ( SOL ) based decentralized physical infrastructure network of smart cameras, NATIX combines high-volume, street-level data collection with scalable machine learning through Bittensor ( TAO ), crypto.news can exclusively report. The subnet, incubated by Bittensor infrastructure partner Yuma, consumes 360° video feeds captured from NATIX-enabled Tesla vehicles and other mobile devices. It then processes the data into AI models that improve real-time map-making and vehicle autonomy. The move is consistent with trends seen across the autonomous mobility industry. Notably, companies like Uber are investing in synthetic simulation and bespoke data collections to better manage their self-driving technologies. However, this is expensive and lags behind real-world changes. To address this, NATIX is eyeing a global community of over 250,000 drivers who collectively logged over 170 million kilometers through smartphone and VX360 device usage. VX360 and decentralized data training The VX360, developed in collaboration with Grab, leverages Tesla’s existing camera systems to collect 360° imagery without requiring expensive new hardware. The data is processed both in the cloud and at the edge smartphones detecting elements like traffic lights and signs in real time. More intensive classification is handled off-device. Through Bittensor’s decentralized framework, NATIX miners are rewarded for training and improving AI models on the subnet, which are then redeployed across the NATIX Edge Network. “By decentralizing data analysis, we enable the continuous improvement of AI models, significantly enhancing mapping accuracy, autonomous vehicle safety, and real-world responsiveness,” said NATIX CEO and co-founder Alireza Ghods The subnet’s first focus is roadwork detection, a critical application for both mapping platforms and autonomous vehicle navigation. Over the longer-term, NATIX hopes to expand its operations to include pothole detection and infrastructure analysis. Eventually, NATIX expects to provide a full scenario classification to support autonomous vehicle training. Q&A with NATIX CEO Alireza Ghods To better understand the impact of NATIX’s latest launch, crypto.news spoke with Alireza Ghods, CEO and co-founder of NATIX. The conversation focuses on the company’s approach to scaling decentralized data capture, why it believes its data can compete with tech giants, and how it plans to create real demand for its token economy. The entire Q&A is below: crypto.news: Tech giants like Waymo, Tesla, and others and even Mobileye have spent years and billions of dollars collecting driving data and developing autonomous tech. What makes NATIX believe it can offer data or AI services at a comparable quality? Crowdsourced data is great for scale, but can crowd-collected camera footage really match the precision of dedicated mapping vehicles? Alireza Ghods: Data collection for mapping and autonomous driving is super expensive. Large companies that collect this footage are not sharing it as they use that data to have an edge on the product and offering. None of these players have been collecting data at the scale that NATIX can do in a crowdsourced manner. The largest open-source dataset for autonomous driving is Learning to Drive (L2D), a dataset built in collaboration between two projects collected with identical sensor suites installed on 60 EVs operated by driving schools in only German cities over the span of 3 years, which resulted in only 5k hours logged . Since the launch of the VX360 on May 2nd, 2025, we have already collected 2k hours of driving in only 10 days, and with only 1/3 of the total pre-ordered devices live only in the US. When it comes to the precision in mapping, NATIX may not have the precision and quality of dedicated mapping vehicles, but the sheer size of the network and data collected compensates for it, making the end result as good as data collected by dedicated mapping vehicles. Take Grab, for example. Grab built their whole mapping solution based on crowdsourced efforts , resulting in maps more accurate than Google Maps in SE Asia. For crowdsourced efforts to succeed, you need a large network of drivers/contributors. With over 250K registered drivers, NATIX does have such a network, and it’s the biggest camera DePIN network globally. CN: Collecting 360° video from potentially thousands (if not more) of cars and phones in real time screams of a massive technical challenge. How is NATIX handling data ingestion and processing at scale? AG: For data collected with the VX360, the compute we perform for ScenGen is quite heavy and cannot be done at the Edge. We do the processing at the cloud level. The data shared by users is only uploaded when they’re connected to their home Wi-Fi connection. With that said, we use our smartphone network, which has edge compute power, to detect map attributes such as traffic signs and traffic lights in real-time. CN: Can you describe the scaling strategy: how will you go from a pilot with a few hundred Teslas or phones to a deployment with, say, 100k+ devices streaming data, without the system breaking or costs skyrocketing? AG: The VX360 device is quite cost-effective. With a 350$ device, we tap into 360° street-level imagery, while also providing utility for the drivers. Our strategy is tapping into commodity hardware. Everyone owns a smartphone, and Tesla vehicles already come equipped with 360° cameras, so it’s just a matter of tapping into what’s already out there. If we wanted to build a 360° camera, it would be 20-100x more expensive than VX360 in terms of hardware cost, and it would not be scalable as a crowd-sourced solution. As for further scaling, we are also in discussion with partners who want to operate a fleet of VX360s. This would be fleet owners or integrators who want to sponsor the cost of the device for reward sharing. As an example, we are in discussion with a Tesla fleet owner with over 3,000 Tesla vehicles in their network. We are also in the process of building fleet management functionalities for the fleet operators to increase the utility of our product and go beyond crypto rewards. CN: Following up from the above question, do you see these big players as customers of NATIX’s data (i.e. you’ll sell them supplemental data) or as competitors you need to outperform? If it’s the latter, where specifically do you think your decentralized approach gives you an edge against far better-funded operations with full control of their fleets? AG: We have Grab as our customer , and we are in the process of closing a few of the largest autonomous driving players, both as direct customers for the data and partners for building various products for autonomous driving. Every big player is a potential customer, if not now, then in the future. Some of the bigger players have invested millions into collecting their own datasets, which soon will become outdated as the roads are constantly changing. Even if some tell us they do not need our data today, they will need it soon enough. Nevertheless, the AD companies that have invested in their own datasets are not larger than 20% of the market. The rest have either not spent much capital to collect data and will need NATIX’s data, or they’re currently relying on their customers’ data (if any), but cannot use it to improve the quality of their models for other customers. This is a real bottleneck for these companies to create a holistic AD stack that can be monetized for all automotive clients. CN: NATIX isn’t alone in trying to decentralize physical infrastructure. We’ve seen projects like Hivemapper dominate headlines several years back or DIMO (vehicle data) attempt similar crowdsourced models. Their road to success (hehe, pun intended) has been rough with limited user uptake, token value collapse, etc. What lessons has NATIX’s learned or what approach are you taking that differs from those that struggled? AG: There are also successful models like Geodnet. I believe the winner here is the one that focuses on protocol revenue and has a proper mechanism for value accrual to the token (e.g. buyback and burn). Many of these projects suffer from a lack of Protocol revenue or poor tokenomics (lack of value accrual). In this case, NATIX is closer to Geodnet and is following the same strategy. Furthermore, you have to look at each business model individually. For example, Hivemapper’s front-facing dashcams collect high-quality street-level imagery for mapping, but NATIX’s 360° data can cater not only to mapping but also to autonomous driving and physical AI. 360° video data is the holy grail of street-level visual data, and not only is it worth 5-10x more than Hivemapper’s data, but it opens the door to countless new mapmaking use cases (e.g., POI detection with side cameras). Moreover, the 360° data collected can be used for Physical AI, which is a much bigger topic (ever since NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang’s big announcement on the stage at CES 2025). NATIX offers data diversity suitable for the training, testing, and validation of the autonomous driving stack and Physical AI at a fraction of the cost of centralized solutions that companies like Nvidia and Uber invested millions to develop. This data is a painkiller for the simulation-to-reality and reality-to-simulation process in Physical AI development. That is why we believe we’re solving a much bigger problem, which the industry is ready to pay for TODAY.. Note that cars operate with a surrounding camera system; therefore, training, testing, and validation of the autonomous driving stack is only possible with 360° data and cannot be done with front-facing dashcam data. CN: Beyond being a reward mechanism, what is the actual utility of the $NATIX token within this ecosystem? Will data purchasers or AI developers need to use $NATIX or TAO tokens to access StreetVision’s services? If not, what will drive demand for $NATIX? AG: These are two separate ecosystems with different functionality. NATIX is focusing on data curation, while the StreetVision Subnet focuses on (certain) insight extraction and AI model creation. Each of these ecosystems generates its own value and has its own value accrual mechanism for their token. If anyone is interested in the NATIX data, the value accrual goes towards the $NATIX token through the Protocol Revenue and buyback and burn mechanism. For those interested in the insights or AI models generated by the StreetVision Subnet, the revenue generated will be used for value accrual towards $dTAO (and partially towards $NATIX as the data that was used for such insight and/or models belongs is provided by NATIX). Additionally, $NATIX is used for the protocol governance and securing the network. This is done via our staking platform, which enables users to participate in protocol governance. Validators in the StreetVision Subnet are also required to stake $NATIX. CN: Your strategic partnership with Yuma adds a level of credibility, but it also raises centralization concerns. DCG has actually invested in NATIX, and Yuma has been instrumental in launching Bittensor subnets. How do you ensure that neither Yuma nor other heavyweight backers will dominate Subnet 72’s direction or rewards? AG: Anyone can run a validator for our subnet. Indeed, we are working with two other major Bittensor validator players that will also run validator nodes. Also, we removed staking or $dTAO holding requirements for miners as we wanted to ensure an open ecosystem. As you know, miner centralization is even a bigger concern than validator as the output of the network depends on them. CN: What current use cases can you point to for the StreetVision Subnet? For example, is Grab already consuming NATIX’s data to update their maps in Southeast Asia right now, or is that just an MOU for future collaboration? AG: StreetVision’s first task will be real-time roadwork detection. Detecting and classifying roadwork in real-time is crucial for mapping updates and AV reliability. More use cases added later will include detecting potholes, road signs, littering, and infrastructure monitoring. StreetVision Subnet will also later include analysis and classification of driving videos into scenarios from routine traffic conditions to rare “edge cases,” as scenario classification is super important for scenario generation for autonomous driving and Physical AI. Grab is currently using NATIX’s data to build their pipelines for the US and EU markets, and they are a paying customer already. As the VX360 just went live on May 2nd, we need some initial data to build sample datasets, which are required by autonomous driving customers. We are in commercial negotiations with dozens of autonomous driving companies. We are also working with a few of the top autonomous driving research labs to create cutting-edge products for simulation-to-reality and reality-to-simulation, which we will announce in the coming months.",Exclusive|Interviews|News|Bittensor|decentralization|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX|BITTENSOR,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-27 13:36:02

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira announced the initiative during an investment seminar held in Bangkok on May 26, according to reports from the Bangkok Post and The Nation . The Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the Bank of Thailand, is currently reviewing a system that would allow tourists to link their crypto wallets to credit cards, enabling seamless local purchases. Merchants would continue to receive payment in Thai baht, often unaware that the original payment was made in digital assets. “This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai. He noted that avoiding direct use of the Thai baht in these transactions reduces the risks associated with currency volatility. The pilot program is expected to roll out once key infrastructure and regulatory standards are finalized. Thailand Aims Crypto-Friendly Policies Thailand’s embrace of crypto spending is just one part of a broader strategy to reform its financial landscape. Pichai emphasized the need to modernize outdated financial regulations, particularly the separation between the traditional capital market and digital asset industries, which are currently governed by different sets of laws. A major part of this reform includes removing restrictive investment rules placed on institutional investors. Currently, life insurance firms and large funds are largely limited to holding government bonds. New regulations could allow them to diversify into equities and private sector assets, unlocking greater capital flow into the economy. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance is reviewing rules on treasury stocks and evaluating the impact of high-frequency trading. A draft law is also underway to expand the enforcement powers of the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), giving it greater authority to act on significant cases. Long-Term Commitment to Digital Assets Pichai expressed strong support for digital innovation, noting the importance of clear regulations that protect financial stability while enabling growth. Among Thailand’s blockchain initiatives is the rollout of “G-Tokens,” which will allow retail investors to buy government bonds in fractional units using blockchain technology. Earlier this year, the Thai SEC approved Tether’s USDt and Circle’s USDC for trading on regulated platforms. These moves signal Thailand’s broader vision of integrating digital assets into both domestic finance and international investment opportunities.

Stocks moved higher as investors reacted to the latest tariff news , with United States President Donald Trump delaying the recently threatened 50% tariff on the European Union. With the tariffs pushed to a potential implementation date of July 9, Asian and European stocks had traded higher. U.S. stock futures picked up momentum and surged. The Dow opened more than 400 points higher on Tuesday, while the benchmark S&P 500 index jumped 1.1%. The Nasdaq Composite also gained, rising about 1.3% as stocks began the holiday-shortened week on a winning note. The potential for a U.S.-EU deal will add to agreements between the United States and China and the U.S. and United Kingdom. Global stocks rose amid the two deals, the latter seeing the Dow surge over 1,000 points and the S&P 500 go on to notch a six-day winning streak.

At the open, the 30-year Treasury yield dropped to 4.96%, while the 10-year yield hovered around 4.47%. Meanwhile, the dollar showed strength as investors digested signals that Japan could soon scale back its bond sales. In addition to these macro developments, investors will be watching key economic data expected this week, along with commentary from Federal Reserve officials. Investors will also focus on Trump’s tax bill, and upcoming earnings reports from Nvidia (NVDA) and others. Jeremy Siegel, a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, says despite the tariff policy and its impact so far, he is bullish on equities. Siegel, also the chief economist at Wisdom Tree, told CNBC in an interview : “Tariffs are going to hopefully be no worse than 10% across the board and 30% with China. We can deal with that.” As stocks rose, crypto notched some minor gains with Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaiming $110k and Ethereum ( ETH ) rising 3% to $2,665.

The price of ADA is exchanging hands at $0.7703 above the 50-day and 200-day golden crosses. The optimism for the rise is due to the rising odds that a Cardano ETF has hit an all-time high . This rise is ahead of the Grayscale’s ADA ETF SEC upcoming approval deadline, which is on May 29th, 2025. If it’s a yes, a new story of its adoption at large will begin for Cardano, and its price will skyrocket. Also, the recent video of Co-founder Charles Hoskinson saying that they are planning to showcase things moving from Bitcoin’s mainnet to Cardano’s mainnet is an optimistic development that shows its strengthening ecosystem. Keep reading to know more. Is A Break Above $1 Imminent With SEC Approving GrayScale’s ADA ETF Filing? On the daily chart, the ADA price is poised for a spectacular rally only if it manages to clear its $0.84 previous swing high resistance. Meanwhile, an analyst in his short-term view also highlighted his optimistic views, that in a day or two, he is expecting a previous swing high to be retested or a possible breakout of a symmetrical triangle. On the daily chart, at the time of writing, the price rising above the golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day EMA bands is itself a strong bullish sign. Since in two days a major SEC approval on Grayscale ETF filing is due, it seems ADA price is preparing for its due time to smash the resistance level and soar to $1.10 to $1.32 in the short term and beyond this aim for new heights in the long term, or could enter price discovery mode. The current rally seen in Q2 so far could only be a trailer or a stepping stone for a much larger rally, if all bullish factors align well. Also, the RSI is above a median line at 54.12, which shows that strength is revitalizing, with the curve moving above the 14 SMA-based smoothing line. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The wait might be over. Exodus Movement (EXOD), a well-known cryptocurrency wallet provider, has taken a significant step in bridging the gap between digital assets and everyday spending. In a move set to excite its extensive user base, Exodus has officially launched a Exodus crypto card in collaboration with Baanx. What is the new Exodus Crypto Card and How Does it Work? The core idea behind the Exodus crypto card is simple yet powerful: enabling Exodus wallet users to spend their cryptocurrency holdings in the real world, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. This eliminates the need to first send crypto to an exchange, convert it to fiat currency, and then withdraw it to a bank account before making a purchase. It streamlines the entire process, offering a level of convenience previously limited for many crypto holders. Here’s a breakdown of how it generally functions: Linking Your Wallet: Users will link their Exodus wallet to the card. Selecting Assets: Initially focusing on stablecoins like USDT and USDC, users can designate which assets they want to use for spending. Point of Sale Conversion: When a purchase is made using the card, the required amount of cryptocurrency (USDT or USDC) is instantly converted into the local fiat currency (like USD, EUR, etc.) at the point of sale. Payment Processed: The fiat transaction is then processed through the Mastercard network, just like a regular debit card payment. This instant conversion is key, allowing users to leverage their digital assets for everyday transactions without the manual steps typically involved. How Does the Crypto Debit Card Bridge the Gap? The introduction of a crypto debit card by a major wallet provider like Exodus is a crucial development for mass adoption. For years, holding cryptocurrency has often felt separate from traditional financial activities. While great for investment or peer-to-peer transfers, using crypto for buying groceries, paying bills, or shopping online has been cumbersome. A crypto debit card directly addresses this friction. It acts as a seamless interface between the decentralized world of crypto and the established infrastructure of traditional payment networks like Mastercard. It empowers users by: Increasing Utility: Your crypto assets become immediately spendable at millions of locations worldwide. Simplifying Transactions: No complex conversions or transfers are needed before spending. Offering Familiarity: Using a debit card is a behavior most people are already comfortable with. This initiative helps to normalize the idea of using digital assets for commerce, moving beyond just investment or speculative use cases. Why Focus on USDT USDC Payments ? Exodus’s initial focus on enabling USDT USDC payments through the card is a strategic choice. USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin) are the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Spending highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum for everyday purchases can be risky. The value could drop significantly between the time you intend to spend it and the moment of the transaction, or even within minutes. By focusing on stablecoins, Exodus offers a more predictable spending experience for its users. Benefits of using stablecoins for card payments: Value Stability: Minimizes the risk of your spending power fluctuating dramatically due to market volatility. Predictability: You know roughly how much fiat currency your stablecoins will convert to. Wider Acceptance Potential: As spending ramps up, stablecoins offer a more reliable medium for merchants receiving payments (even if indirectly via conversion). This focus makes the card a practical tool for daily expenses, not just for spending speculative gains. Exploring the Exodus Baanx Partnership The collaboration between Exodus Baanx is foundational to this new offering. Exodus brings its large user base of over six million users and its established, user-friendly wallet technology. Baanx, on the other hand, specializes in providing crypto-friendly financial services infrastructure, including card issuance and processing capabilities, often in partnership with traditional financial institutions like Mastercard. This partnership is a classic example of a crypto-native company leveraging the expertise and regulatory compliance of a fintech provider to access traditional financial rails. Baanx facilitates the complex backend operations required to issue cards, manage conversions, and process transactions through the Mastercard network, allowing Exodus to focus on its core wallet experience and user interface. Key aspects of the partnership: Leveraging Expertise: Exodus focuses on the wallet and user experience, Baanx handles the financial infrastructure and compliance. Accessing Networks: Baanx’s connections enable the card to operate on the global Mastercard network. Scalability: This model allows Exodus to potentially scale the card offering to its vast user base. The synergy between Exodus Baanx is what makes this crypto-to-fiat spending solution possible on a large scale. Making Everyday Crypto Payments a Reality The launch of the Exodus card is a significant step towards making everyday crypto payments a mainstream reality. While other crypto cards exist, the integration directly within the popular Exodus wallet simplifies the process for its existing users. Currently, the card is undergoing beta testing at BTC Vegas, a relevant event for the crypto community. This testing phase allows Exodus and Baanx to gather feedback and refine the user experience before a wider rollout. The plan is to make the card available to Exodus’s six million users later this year, a move that could significantly increase the volume of stablecoin transactions in the real economy. What this means for users: Enhanced Liquidity: Your stablecoins are no longer just sitting in a wallet; they are liquid assets ready to be spent. Convenience: Pay for goods and services online or in physical stores with your crypto holdings. Potential for Global Use: Accepted anywhere Mastercard is, offering flexibility for travelers or online shoppers. This initiative pushes the boundaries of how people interact with their digital assets, making crypto payments feel much more like using traditional money. Considering the Details: Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights While the prospect of spending crypto directly is exciting, potential users should consider several factors: Benefits: Ease of Use: Spend crypto like fiat currency. Global Acceptance: Works anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Direct Integration: Seamlessly linked to your Exodus wallet. Stablecoin Focus: Reduces volatility risk for spending. Challenges & Considerations: Fees: Be aware of potential conversion fees, transaction fees, or card maintenance fees. These can vary and impact the effective cost of using your crypto. Tax Implications: In many jurisdictions, spending cryptocurrency is considered a taxable event (a capital gain or loss). Users need to understand their local tax obligations. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for crypto cards is still evolving and can vary by region. Conversion Rates: While stablecoins aim for stability, minor fluctuations or the specific exchange rate used at the moment of conversion could impact the final fiat amount. Limited Asset Support (Initial): Currently focused on USDT and USDC. Support for other assets may come later, but for now, it’s stablecoin-centric. Actionable Insights for Users: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Exodus regarding the full rollout, terms, and fees. Understand the Fees: Before using the card extensively, make sure you are clear on all associated costs. Know Your Tax Obligations: Consult with a tax professional to understand how spending crypto impacts your taxes. Start Small: If you are new to crypto cards, perhaps try using it for smaller purchases first to get comfortable with the process and monitor transactions. Secure Your Wallet: As the card is linked to your Exodus wallet, ensure your wallet security practices are robust. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Crypto Adoption The launch of the Exodus crypto debit card in partnership with Baanx marks a significant milestone in the journey towards widespread cryptocurrency adoption. By providing a simple, convenient way for millions of Exodus users to spend their stablecoins like USDT and USDC through the ubiquitous Mastercard network, this initiative removes significant barriers to entry for everyday crypto commerce. While currently in beta, the planned rollout to Exodus’s six million users later this year has the potential to dramatically increase the practical utility of stablecoins and make crypto payments a more common sight in the global economy. As with any financial tool involving cryptocurrency, users should proceed with awareness regarding fees, taxes, and security, but the fundamental promise of seamless spending offered by the Exodus crypto card is a powerful step forward for the entire ecosystem.

Investment bank Standard Chartered sees Solana (SOL) almost doubling by the end of the year. Still, even at those levels, it will likely underperform Ethereum (ETH) . On Tuesday, May 27, Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Head of FX and Digital Assets Research, shared his insights on Solana over the next two to three years. Kendrick projects Solana could reach $275 by the end of 2025, up from its current level of $176.72. By 2029, Solana could trade as high as $500. However, this trajectory would still likely see the asset underperform Ethereum. In comparison, Ethereum is forecast to rise to $4,000 by the end of 2025 and to $7,500 by 2029.

He described this as a “double-edged sword,” noting that while memecoins may boost Solana in the short term, growth in the sector is likely to stall going forward. “Going forward, I think we are past peak-memecoin,” Kendrick said, adding that while Solana has demonstrated strong technical performance, memecoins now present a risk factor. He noted that the market is “applying a quantifiable discount” to Solana’s application-layer revenue due to slowing growth in this sector.

In March, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood echoed the sentiment by Standard Chartered, stating that most memecoin will likely become worthless at some point. However, she expressed positive sentiment toward both Ethereum and Solana, stating that these tokens will only strengthen over time.

USDC issuer Circle moves forward with initial public offering on NYSE Circle, the issuer of USDC ( USDC ), the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has launched an IPO of 24 million shares of its Class A common stock, the company said on May 27. The firm has applied to list its Class A common stock on the NYSE under the ticker symbol CRCL. As part of the offering, Circle is issuing 9.6 million shares of Class A common stock, the company said in a news release. The remaining 14.4 million shares of Class A common stock will be offered by selling stockholders. Circle is also expected to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to buy up to an additional 3.6 million shares of Class A common stock to cover over-allotments. The IPO involves participation from several major US investment banks, with JPMorgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs acting as joint lead active bookrunners, the announcement added.

Saylor says onchain proof-of-reserves a “bad idea” Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, said on May 26 that institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that poses security risks. “The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew at an event about institutions adopting the measure. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.” I asked @saylor if @MicroStrategy has any plans to publish on-chain proof of reserves His answer will SHOCK you “It’s a bad idea.” - Security Risk - Irrelevant without also having Big 4-audited liabilities Check it out 👇 pic.twitter.com/tIxUckgbEp — Mitchell ✝️🇺🇸 (@MitchellHODL) May 27, 2025 Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy, which has the largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings of any public company, would publish a proof-of-reserves. Saylor said the industry learned from the collapses of crypto exchanges FTX and Mt. Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions as no “enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.” Dubai launches first licensed tokenized real estate project in MENA region Dubai has launched the first licensed tokenized real estate project in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, previewing appetite for real-world tokenization in one of the world’s burgeoning crypto hubs. Partners in the project include the Dubai Land Department (DLD), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Dubai Future Foundation, according to an announcement from the Dubai government. The tokens will be tradeable on the newly launched “Prypco Mint” platform, with Zand Digital Bank appointed as the bank for the project’s pilot phase. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) updated its rules to include real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, allowing such tokens to be traded on secondary markets. The project will allow individual investors to buy tokenized shares in “ready-to-own properties in Dubai,” with investments starting at 2,000 Emirate dirham ($545). During the pilot phase, all transactions will be carried out in the dirham (AED), with no cryptocurrency to be used. Although the pilot program will be limited to those with UAE ID holders, there are plans to expand it globally. In April, the DLD and VARA agreed to link Dubai’s real estate registry with the tokenization of property . The stated goal was to attract global investors and enhance liquidity in Dubai’s real estate market. The project was initially announced in March .",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-27 13:42:20

Pi coin ( PI ) token dropped to $0.7570 on Tuesday, down 13% from its peak last week and 54% from its highest point in May. The token now faces multiple risks that could push it lower. First, on-chain data shows holders are increasingly moving their tokens to centralized exchanges. Net flows over the past 24 hours exceeded 3.075 million Pi coins. The net flow to OKX rose to 1.474 million coins, while inflows to Bitget, MEXC, and Gate stood at 20,790, 460,834, and 1.1 million, respectively. These exchange inflows suggest that Pi Network investors are capitulating and selling their holdings, following a crash of over 80% from the all-time high.

Data shows that it will unlock over 263 million Pi coins in June, 233 million in July, and 132 million in August. It will release 1.519 million coins in the next 12 months, averaging 132 million a month. These unlocks come at a time when demand for Pi Coin is weakening. A significant increase in supply, combined with soft demand, typically results in further price pressure. There are also signs that retail interest in Pi Network is fading. According to Santiment, Pi’s social dominance score has dropped to 0.24% from 1.15% in April, while social volume across major platforms has declined to 20 from a year-to-date high of 182. Social dominance and social volume | Source: Santiment Pi Network price technical analysis The eight-hour chart shows that Pi Coin has remained under pressure in recent weeks, falling from a high of $1.6677 on May 12 to the current $0.7500. The token has dropped below the 25-period exponential moving average, while the Percentage Price Oscillator has moved below the zero line. Pi Network’s price has also formed a bearish flag pattern, often a precursor to further downside. If confirmed, the initial support to watch is $0.6300, aligned with the ascending trendline connecting recent swing lows since April 5. A break below that level could open the door to additional losses, with the next key support at $0.40, Pi’s lowest point on April 5.

The company behind Truth Social, Truth+, and the fintech platform Truth.Fi has just confirmed a massive $2.5 billion private placement deal, aimed in large part at building one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries of any public company to date. According to the official press release , the offering includes $1.5 billion in Trump Media common stock and $1 billion in convertible notes, subscribed by approximately 50 institutional investors. Once finalized, expected around May 29, the deal will raise Trump Media’s liquid assets to more than $3 billion, providing the firepower to begin its crypto treasury strategy in earnest. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom,” said CEO Devin Nunes. “This investment will help defend our company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions… and it’s a big step forward in our plan to evolve into a holding company aligned with America First principles.” Trump Media pivots toward Bitcoin The Bitcoin allocation isn’t a one-off gesture. Trump Media plans to treat BTC as a core balance sheet asset, sitting alongside cash and short-term investments.

Known for its own projects in the digital assets space, Russia’s largest bank now hopes to see the emergence of a whole “new world” of crypto investment opportunities. Sberbank to act as market maker for Russian crypto platforms The biggest bank in Russia in terms of assets, Sberbank, will become a market maker providing liquidity for regulated platforms that will give qualified Russian investors access to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a high-ranking executive unveiled. Speaking to the business news outlet RBC, the head of Sberbank’s Global Markets Department, Alexander Zozulya, praised the Bank of Russia’s “important step” to announce the development of an experimental legal regime (ELR) for crypto transactions and emphasized: “We expect the emergence of a legal ‘sandbox,’ an analogue of a regulated crypto platform, where super-qualified investors will be allowed to operate directly with cryptocurrencies.” Zozulya’s comments come after the Governor of the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) Elvira Nabiullina admitted earlier this month that direct investments in crypto assets would require regulatory changes and dedicated infrastructure. During her appearance at the “Russian Stock Market—2025” conference in mid-May, Nabiullina also made it clear that such transactions should be carried out exclusively within the ELR framework and available only to “highly qualified” investors. The monetary authority proposed the establishment of the special regime and the “ highly qualified investors ” category in March of this year. The ELR will allow Russian companies to exchange and use cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, bypassing Ukraine war-related restrictions. To be considered sufficiently qualified to put money into crypto, Russians will have to prove investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (approximately $1.25 million) and annual income from the past year of more than 50 million rubles ($625,000), the CBR suggested. Standards for financial institutions are yet to be drafted. Russian investors to have access to crypto ETFs as well Products that provide exposure to cryptocurrencies without direct ownership of the digital assets will also be available to investors in Russia, Alexander Zozulya revealed. These will be similar to the cryptocurrency ETFs (exchange-traded funds) known in the West, he explained. In Russia, these could be structured products, digital financial assets (DFAs) or mutual funds linked to the prices of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or a basket of cryptocurrencies, he elaborated, adding that Sberbank intends to offer such solutions. Zozulya remarked that the government-backed behemoth “is moving in this direction quite quickly,” together with the Bank of Russia. However, amendments to Russia’s Civil and Tax Codes as well as CBR’s own rules are still needed for the launch of a crypto ETF-like product. A list of changes has been prepared already, and Sberbank’s infrastructure is ready, the executive said and promised: “As soon as this is allowed, a ‘new world’ of instruments for investing in cryptocurrency will appear.” Zozulya also unveiled that Russian authorities plan to set up an experimental platform for qualified investors in order to “whiten” direct crypto ownership or, in other words, bring it out of the shadows. Crypto-related operations are yet to be properly regulated in Russia, where only mining has so far been recognized as a legal business activity. The central bank remains a strong opponent to permitting the free circulation of Bitcoin and the like in the country’s economy outside the ELR. In her speech at the stock market forum this month, Elvira Nabiullina acknowledged existing interest in issuing financial instruments, the yield of which is tied to the value of cryptocurrencies, and said the matter had been discussed with the finance ministry in Moscow. Sberbank, rebranded to Sber in 2020, is among the leading Russian banks that have signaled a willingness to take part in Moscow’s crypto experiment , alongside VTB and Alfa-Bank. It is the successor of the Soviet Union’s main retail and savings bank and is currently Russia’s largest universal bank. Sberbank was added to Western sanctions lists after the 2014 annexation of Crimea.

With major confluences aligning, this correction could set the stage for the next bullish continuation. The current zone where Cookie ( COOKIE ) has stalled, around the $0.26 mark, is not arbitrary. It aligns with several overlapping technical indicators that reinforce its importance as a structural support area. These include the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the most recent bullish leg, the 200-day moving average (a key institutional trend gauge), and a VWAP-based support zone that has historically attracted volume and buyer interest. Key technical points $0.26 Key Support Level: This level is acting as a magnet due to historical structure and buyer interest. 200-Day Moving Average Support: Widely watched by market participants, the 200 MA adds strength to this level. 0.618 Fibonacci Confluence: Classic golden ratio retracement that often marks the end of corrective moves. CookieUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView Cookie recently printed a swing high at $0.36 following a strong impulsive rally. This expansion phase followed a prolonged accumulation period, during which price steadily gained momentum with minimal pullbacks. A correction was expected, and it is now unfolding. Price has reversed sharply and is currently trading at a major technical support level that could serve as a launchpad for the next move. You might also like: Crypto exchanges still post high risks of money laundering, Luxembourg says What makes the $0.26 zone more significant is that it now functions as a potential bullish retest. In technical terms, a rounded retest involves price breaking above resistance, pulling back to it, and validating it as new support. If Cookie holds above this zone with solid volume, it would confirm continued bullish intent and invalidate the potential for a deeper breakdown. The next major area of interest lies just above the recent swing high at $0.39. A clean break and close above this level would not only confirm a new higher high but also suggest Cookie is ready for another leg up, potentially entering price discovery or targeting psychological round levels beyond $0.40. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Cookie holds the $0.26 support, the bullish market structure remains intact. A failure to hold this area may open the door to lower levels, but for now, the trend remains upward, especially if volume returns and momentum picks up. Traders should watch for a breakout above $0.36 to confirm the next bullish leg.

There’s significant news coming out of Luxembourg that demands your focus. The Grand Duchy has released its 2025 National Risk Assessment (NRA), and it places virtual asset service providers (VASPs) squarely in the high-risk category when it comes to money laundering and terrorist financing. This isn’t the first time crypto has been under the microscope here, but this latest assessment reinforces the growing scrutiny on the sector, particularly impacting Luxembourg Crypto businesses. What Does This High-Risk Crypto Regulation Mean? When a country’s NRA classifies a sector as ‘high-risk,’ it signals an increased need for vigilance and potentially stricter regulatory measures. For Crypto Regulation in Luxembourg, this classification means authorities view VASPs as having inherent characteristics that make them more vulnerable to exploitation by criminals seeking to launder illicit funds or finance terrorism. This follows similar concerns raised in Luxembourg’s previous assessments in 2020 and 2022, which already pointed out the risks associated with crypto’s internet-based and cross-border nature. Think of the NRA as a country’s report card on where its financial system is most exposed to illicit activities. A high-risk rating for VASPs means supervisors, law enforcement, and the VASPs themselves need to apply enhanced measures to mitigate these risks effectively. Why is the Money Laundering Risk High for VASPs? The assessment points to specific factors driving this high Money Laundering Risk . According to the report, key reasons include: Transaction Volume: The sheer volume and speed of transactions in the crypto space can make tracking illicit flows challenging. Client Reach: VASPs often serve a global client base, complicating customer identification and due diligence processes across different jurisdictions. International Operations: The cross-border nature of VASP services means funds can move rapidly across different regulatory environments, potentially exploiting loopholes. These factors, combined with the pseudonymous nature of some cryptocurrencies and the technological complexity, create fertile ground for individuals looking to obscure the origin of their funds. It’s not that crypto is inherently for criminals, but its characteristics require robust controls to prevent misuse. What Does This Imply for VASP Compliance? For VASPs operating in or from Luxembourg, this high-risk label directly translates into heightened expectations for VASP Compliance programs. This isn’t just about ticking boxes; it’s about implementing truly effective measures to detect and prevent illicit activities. What might this entail? Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Expect more rigorous checks on customers, especially those deemed higher risk based on their activity, location, or transaction patterns. Transaction Monitoring: More sophisticated systems and processes will be needed to monitor transactions for suspicious activity in real-time. Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR): Increased vigilance and timely reporting of any detected or suspected money laundering or terrorist financing activities to the relevant authorities. Risk Assessments: VASPs must conduct their own comprehensive risk assessments specific to their business model and customer base, and tailor their controls accordingly. While implementing these measures adds operational cost and complexity for businesses, strong compliance is crucial for building trust and legitimacy in the sector. It’s a challenge, yes, but also an opportunity to demonstrate the industry’s commitment to combating Financial Crime . How Does This Fit into the Global Fight Against Financial Crime? Luxembourg’s stance aligns with the broader global push to bring the crypto sector under effective anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) frameworks. International bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have long highlighted the risks posed by virtual assets and VASPs, setting global standards that countries are expected to implement. The European Union’s evolving regulatory landscape, including the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation and upcoming AML package (AMLD6), also reflects this increased focus. By classifying VASPs as high-risk, Luxembourg is essentially stating that its assessment of the threat aligns with international concerns and that it is prioritizing oversight in this area. This is part of a coordinated effort worldwide to prevent digital assets from becoming a safe haven for illicit funds, thereby protecting the integrity of the global financial system. What’s Next for Luxembourg Crypto and Beyond? This high-risk classification suggests that regulatory bodies in Luxembourg will likely increase their supervision of VASPs. This could lead to more frequent inspections, requests for information, and potentially enforcement actions for non-compliance. For businesses operating in the Luxembourg Crypto space, proactively strengthening their AML/CTF controls is no longer optional; it’s a necessity for continued operation. While this might seem like a hurdle, robust regulation can ultimately benefit the legitimate crypto industry by fostering greater trust among traditional financial institutions and investors, potentially paving the way for broader adoption. Luxembourg, known as a significant financial center, is navigating the balance between fostering innovation and ensuring financial stability and security. Compelling Summary: Navigating the Heightened Scrutiny Luxembourg’s 2025 National Risk Assessment sending a clear signal: virtual asset service providers are under the spotlight due to their vulnerability to money laundering. Factors like high transaction volume, extensive client reach, and international operations contribute to this high-risk assessment. This development underscores the increasing global focus on bringing the crypto sector within robust anti-financial crime frameworks. For VASPs, this means a critical need to enhance VASP Compliance measures, including stricter due diligence and transaction monitoring. While challenging, this push for greater oversight is essential for combating Financial Crime and building a more secure and trusted future for Luxembourg Crypto and the wider digital asset ecosystem.

In a recent post on X, prominent digital asset commentator Crypto Beast shared insights from a conversation with a seasoned finance professional, emphasizing that “everyone is interested in $XRP.” This brief but compelling statement captures a deeper narrative gaining traction across the financial and crypto sectors — the accelerating trajectory toward mass adoption of XRP as both a utility asset and a viable investment vehicle. I just had a chat with a friend who works in finance, and he told me that everyone is interested in $XRP . Mass adoption is coming. pic.twitter.com/vgqa6UkwYa — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) May 26, 2025 Institutional Curiosity and Ripple’s Expanding Role in Global Finance The growing interest in XRP is no coincidence. Ripple, the company behind XRP’s development and utility infrastructure, has made significant inroads into the traditional financial system through a series of strategic partnerships and enterprise solutions. RippleNet, Ripple’s global payment network, has been adopted by over 300 financial institutions worldwide, many of which seek to modernize cross-border transactions and reduce settlement times and costs. What sets XRP apart is its unique design as a bridge currency, enabling near-instant liquidity between fiat currencies without the need for pre-funded accounts. As banks and financial institutions increasingly look for faster, more efficient systems in the post-SWIFT era, XRP’s real-world use case becomes more compelling. It is precisely this kind of functional relevance that, according to Crypto Beast’s source, is drawing significant interest from financial professionals and institutions alike. Mass Adoption Momentum and Regulatory Clarity One of the most critical factors influencing XRP’s growing appeal is the evolving regulatory landscape. The long-standing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached a crucial point a few weeks ago, with a settlement agreement filed by the SEC . A full resolution of this case will inject confidence into the market and pave the way for increased participation by U.S.-based investors and institutions. With regulatory fog beginning to clear, XRP is better positioned than ever to capitalize on mass adoption trends. Exchanges that previously delisted XRP have begun relisting it, while crypto payment providers and remittance services are integrating XRP more actively into their platforms. Meanwhile, in jurisdictions such as the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, Ripple continues to secure new partnerships, further embedding XRP into the financial fabric of the global economy. A Community and Ecosystem Poised for the Future Beyond institutional use, XRP’s strong and resilient community plays a pivotal role in its adoption narrative. Over the years, the XRP Ledger has evolved to support a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and tokenized assets. Projects like the XRPL EVM sidechain — designed to bring Ethereum-compatible smart contracts to the XRP ecosystem — are expanding their utility and attracting a new wave of developers and innovators. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This convergence of infrastructure readiness, legal clarity, and developer interest supports the view that XRP is entering a new phase of growth. Crypto Beast’s post reflects what many in the community are now beginning to witness: XRP is not merely surviving the regulatory gauntlet — it is emerging stronger, more validated, and on the cusp of broader recognition. A Network Effect in Motion The phrase “everyone is interested in XRP” is no longer just speculative chatter among crypto enthusiasts; it encapsulates a sentiment echoed in boardrooms, trading desks, and policy circles. Mass adoption, once considered a distant goal, is now an active process, and XRP is increasingly at its core. With its strong utility, supportive legal developments, and ongoing global integration, XRP stands as a leading candidate in the future of digital finance. If current momentum continues, the bullish tone struck by Crypto Beast’s report may soon be echoed across the entire financial ecosystem. As more eyes turn toward XRP, the stage appears set for a significant new chapter in its journey toward widespread adoption.

The novel cross-ecosystem initiative combines Avalanche’s fast and scalable execution with Filecoin’s verifiable data network, the press release claims. Consequently, this forms the basis for “modular, cross-chain infrastructure that can scale with enterprise demand.” Through the integration, Avalanche builders can access decentralized storage solutions for high-impact use cases, while Filecoin storage providers can activate new demand and revenue streams.

Why this matters for your projects Reduce costs by offloading infrequently… pic.twitter.com/aAGKv2Lm6P — Filecoin Foundation (@FilFoundation) May 27, 2025 Moreover, the teams note that cryptographic proof systems secure Filecoin’s storage. These ensure that data is stored transparently and continually, and that it remains unchanged. Therefore, the bridge provides proven data verifiability. It further enables cross-chain interoperability and collaboration. Developers can stay within a chain they want to and still utilize Filecoin’s decentralized storage services. Additionally, startups building on Avalanche can offload data to Filecoin, thus cutting costs. Speaking of which, Filecoin stores redundant copies across independent providers. This allows it to mitigate reliance on single points of failure. It meets regulatory and long-term retention requirements to store KYC records, transaction logs, and audit trails. This way, it doesn’t ‘bloat’ Avalanche’s L1 or C-Chain. Marta Belcher, president and chair of Filecoin Foundation, commented that the two ecosystems will work to build “interoperable and decentralized infrastructure tailored to capture high-value enterprise use cases.” The collaboration is “a major step toward re-architecting our world’s web infrastructure to meet today’s rapidly expanding data demands.” You may also like: Cardano Apps Get a Backup Layer Through Blockfrost and Filecoin Collab Blockfrost and Filecoin Foundation (FF) are working to integrate Filecoin’s decentralized storage capabilities as a backup layer for Cardano apps built with Blockfrost.The site describes Blockfrost as Cardano’s API with over 100 endpoints, designed for easy access to Cardano blockchain.Meanwhile, Filecoin Foundation is an independent organization that supports Filecoin’s governance and growth.According to the press release shared with Cryptonews, the collaboration between the two... Filecoin: ‘Offload and Validate’ The press release argues that the cross-chain data storage prototype , implemented by FIL-B and FilOz , shows how EVM-compatible chains can efficiently offload data to Filecoin. At the same time, they maintain access and verifiability through onchain mechanisms, the teams claim. The storage flow starts with generating data on the Avalanche C-Chain. After this, smart contract triggers send data to Filecoin, while Content Identifier (CID) commitments and retrieval proofs verify integrity. Then, onramp contracts relay storage proof to the source chain, and once it arrives, payment is conducted on Avalanche and released. According to Cliff Yeo, Head of Singapore at Ava Labs, “by enabling developers to offload and validate data through decentralized infrastructure, we’re advancing the tooling required to build scalable, multi-chain applications with enterprise-grade reliability.” At the time of writing, FIL trades at $2.89. It appreciated 2.2% in a day, 2.5% in a week, and 5.8% in a month. The price decreased by 51.4% over the past year, as well as 98.8% from the all-time high of $236.84 recorded in April 2021. Also, AVAX trades at $23.61, remaining unchanged over the past 24 hours. It’s up 6.6% in a week and 6.8% in a month. Also, it fell by 36.8% in a year. The coin hit its ATH of $144.96 in November 2021, dropping 83.7% since. Meanwhile, Filecoin Foundation says it facilitates the open-source governance of the Filecoin network, a peer-to-peer network to store files in a decentralized and reliable fashion. It also funds research and development projects for decentralized technologies and supports the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and community. Avalanche is a chain popular among builders who need speed and scalability. It allows them to build efficient and interoperable public and private Layer 1 blockchains, says the team.

Price consolidation between $0.09552 and $0.09744 suggests traders are preparing for a decisive upward move. Higher lows and steady gains across daily and 4-hour charts confirm ongoing buying pressure and potential breakout. On 27th May 2025, the price of Cronos (CRO) is showing a solid upward trend today, trading at $0.09739, reflecting a gain of 0.74% for the day. This performance marks a slight increase in the digital asset’s value, with resistance pegged at $0.09744 and support at $0.09552. The cryptocurrency has displayed some volatility over the past 24 hours but remains within a relatively stable price band. CRO’s price surge aligns with its historical trends, where fluctuations of a few cents often impact market sentiment. Cronos on the daily chart: CRO consolidation tightens with breakout setup potential The daily chart reveals CRO steadily pushing towards its immediate resistance of $0.09744, with today’s trading session confirming a sustained uptrend. Price action is demonstrating higher lows and slightly higher highs, a technical indication of bullish momentum attempting to overcome short-term consolidation. There are multiple failed attempts by bears to push prices below $0.09552, highlighting intense buying pressure at lower levels. The price maintains a clear upward trajectory, while moderate volatility reflects intraday trading strategies dominating the market. CRO Price Chart (1-day): TradingView Price consolidation within a narrow band between $0.09552 and $0.09744 over the last 24 hours suggests that traders are preparing for a decisive breakout. CRO’s upward movement is further validated by consistent green candlesticks and limited wicks on daily candles, a sign of controlled upward pressure. However, resistance at $0.09744 remains a formidable barrier; a decisive breakout above this point could pave the way for a stronger push towards $0.098 and higher. Support at $0.09552 has held firm, indicating a secure base for potential upward movements. Cronos 4-hour chart: CRO tight range signals breakout opportunity On the 4-hour chart, CRO demonstrates a tightening range, with price testing upper resistance levels multiple times. This pattern suggests a possible breakout, and sustained price action above $0.0974 could spark renewed buying interest. The chart shows a pattern of higher lows converging toward the resistance line, suggesting accumulation by buyers. CRO Price Chart (4-hour): TradingView This structure often leads to an upward breakout if volume increases at key levels. The price movements indicate that short-term traders are attempting to push the price past resistance, which could trigger a quick surge toward $0.0980.

CRO’s current price action indicates that traders are preparing for a potential breakout. A decisive move above $0.09744 could open the door to testing $0.0980 and possibly higher resistance levels. However, if the price fails to overcome the resistance, a period of further consolidation or a pullback toward $0.09552 may occur. The higher lows observed across both the daily and 4-hour charts suggest sustained bullish momentum. Market participants should monitor key levels, especially resistance at $0.09744 and support at $0.09552, for clues on CRO’s next move. The tightening range and bullish patterns across multiple timeframes indicate that the breakout, when it occurs, could be swift and significant.

In 2023, Cronos experienced a peak in mid-March near $0.80, followed by a steep decline and stabilization around $0.20 by mid-year. It maintained a slight oscillation around this range in the following months. CRO started 2024 at $0.10, rallied to a yearly high of $0.18 in March, and declined to $0.12 by June. It stabilized between $0.08–$0.10 from July to October, traded at $0.07193–$0.09521 in November, and ended the year in a range of $0.138–$0.234 in December.

Although the cryptocurrency was rejected at the $0.84 price level again last week, the current price action is still holding strong with only a minor drop in the past 24 hours. However, technical analysis deeply rooted in Elliott Wave theory now suggest a steep price decline could be looming for ADA, with a price target pointing as low as $0.42 in the weeks ahead. Bearish Elliott Wave Count Says Wave C Breakdown Ahead According to the Elliott Wave count presented in a technical analysis on TradingView, Cardano (ADA) looks like it is currently wrapping up a B-wave correction that has formed over the past months between April and June 2025. This B wave is part of a larger corrective phase, and while it may appear impulsive on lower timeframes, the Elliott wave theory suggests that it is merely a trap before the final C-wave crash. Related Reading: Cardano Market Structure Says Crash Is Coming, But $0.9 Is Still In The Cards Based on this forecast, the price of Cardano could soon initiate a sharp decline that would bottom out near the $0.42 region, which coincides with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the previous impulse. According to this Elliott wave count, this ABC formation is all part of a larger corrective Wave 4 before a bullish Wave 5. Keeping this in mind, the prediction stipulates that ADA should not fall below $0.40, which marks the top of the first major wave in the overall bullish structure. A move lower than that would risk invalidating the broader long-term setup. Is It Time To Exit Cardano? If the technical analysis plays out as predicted, the projected crash to $0.42 would translate to a 50% drop from the current price of Cardano. This will undoubtedly sound bad, especially for short-term holders. However, this bearish wave could also be a hidden opportunity. Related Reading: Cardano Sees 25% OI Jump In 24 Hours As Bulls Eye Reversal Above $1 As shown in the ADA 4H candlestick chart above, the projected Wave C crash to $0.42 would be followed by a bullish impulse Wave 5 that will push it above the $1 mark again. Specifically, the target is a push towards $1.6. Keeping this in mind, if ADA indeed corrects toward $0.42–$0.40, it would provide a good accumulation zone before the next leg up. Although this bearish forecast is well supported by Elliott Wave principles, it is by no means a guaranteed outcome. ADA and other large market-cap cryptocurrencies are currently highly reactive to Bitcoin’s price action. If Bitcoin extends its rally and breaks into new all-time highs again soon, the projected ADA correction may either be muted or entirely invalidated. As such, it would be interesting to see how the ADA price action plays out in the next few days. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.7706, down by 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

Recently, Standard Chartered, a prominent global bank, shared its views on two leading blockchain networks: Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). Their latest assessment offers a mixed outlook, suggesting potential short-term headwinds for Solana relative to Ethereum, even while maintaining a significantly bullish Solana price prediction for the coming years. Standard Chartered Crypto Forecast: The Headlines According to reports, Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick has laid out specific price targets for Solana, signaling strong long-term confidence in the platform. The forecast suggests: Solana could reach $275 by the end of 2025 . Looking further ahead, the bank projects Solana might hit $500 by 2029 . These are substantial figures, particularly the 2029 target, implying significant growth potential from current levels. However, the forecast isn’t entirely rosy in the immediate future. Why SOL Underperform Ethereum Short-Term? The most noteworthy aspect of Standard Chartered’s near-term outlook is the expectation that Solana will SOL underperform Ethereum . This perspective runs counter to some recent narratives that have seen Solana gain significant traction and market share, often at the expense of Ethereum due to its lower transaction costs and higher speed. The primary reason cited for this anticipated short-term underperformance is Solana’s current heavy reliance on memecoin trading. While memecoins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK) have undeniably driven massive activity and user engagement on the Solana network, they also introduce a significant degree of volatility and speculative noise. This reliance can make the network’s perceived value and activity highly dependent on transient trends rather than sustainable fundamental growth. Ethereum, on the other hand, is seen as having a more mature ecosystem with a broader range of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT), and enterprise applications, which may lend it more stability in the near term. Ethereum vs Solana: A Deeper Dive into Market Dynamics The ongoing debate around Ethereum vs Solana is central to understanding the Layer 1 blockchain landscape. Ethereum remains the largest and most established smart contract platform, benefiting from first-mover advantage, a vast developer community, and a robust ecosystem of Layer 2 scaling solutions. Its recent upgrades, such as the Dencun upgrade, aim to address some of its historical limitations, particularly high transaction costs on Layer 2s. Solana, often dubbed the “Ethereum killer,” offers a fundamentally different architecture designed for high throughput and low latency. Its technical capabilities make it attractive for applications requiring speed and low cost, such as high-frequency trading on decentralized exchanges or large-scale consumer applications. However, it has faced challenges, including network stability issues in the past and the aforementioned perception issue tied to memecoin speculation dominating headlines. Standard Chartered’s view highlights a key difference in their current market positioning: Ethereum’s ecosystem is perhaps viewed as more fundamentally driven and diversified at this moment, while Solana’s recent explosive growth is heavily fueled by speculative retail activity centered around memecoins. This doesn’t negate Solana’s underlying technology but points to a potential vulnerability in its short-term market performance if the memecoin frenzy cools down. Solana Price Prediction: Beyond the Short-Term Hurdles Despite the cautious short-term outlook regarding underperformance relative to Ethereum, Standard Chartered’s long-term Solana price prediction remains significantly optimistic. The bank identifies specific sectors where Solana is expected to drive substantial growth in the coming years: Financial Applications: Solana’s speed and low cost are ideal for various financial use cases, including payments, tokenized assets (like real estate or stocks on the blockchain), and potentially even traditional finance bridging into DeFi. Decentralized Infrastructure: This could encompass areas like DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), where Solana’s performance can support real-world applications requiring decentralized coordination and data handling. This indicates that Standard Chartered sees the underlying technology and its potential applications in high-value sectors as the true drivers of Solana’s long-term price appreciation, rather than just the speculative trading activity currently making headlines. The forecast to $500 by 2029 suggests a belief that Solana will successfully onboard significant real-world usage and build a more diverse, fundamental-driven ecosystem over time. Crypto Market Analysis: What This Means for Investors This crypto market analysis from a major financial institution like Standard Chartered provides valuable context for investors. It suggests that while the excitement around Solana’s recent performance, particularly fueled by memecoins, is understandable, investors should be mindful of potential short-term volatility and consider Ethereum’s relative stability and ecosystem maturity. For those with a longer-term horizon, the forecast points to Solana’s potential to become a major player in financial and infrastructure sectors within the blockchain space. Key takeaways for investors: Short-Term Caution: Be aware that Solana’s performance could be more susceptible to memecoin market fluctuations than Ethereum’s in the near future. Long-Term Potential: The significant price targets highlight Standard Chartered’s belief in Solana’s fundamental technology and its ability to capture significant market share in key growth areas beyond speculative trading. Diversification: The analysis underscores the different strengths and weaknesses of leading Layer 1s like Ethereum and Solana, reinforcing the idea that diversification across promising blockchain ecosystems can be a prudent strategy. Look Beyond Price: While price predictions are engaging, understanding the underlying reasons (memecoin reliance vs. fundamental use cases) is crucial for informed decision-making. Standard Chartered’s forecast serves as a reminder that even within a bullish market cycle, different assets face unique challenges and opportunities. The bank’s perspective suggests a nuanced view where Solana’s technical prowess positions it for significant long-term gains, provided it can successfully transition beyond its current memecoin-driven narrative and capture meaningful adoption in sectors like finance and decentralized infrastructure. Ultimately, the journey to $275 and potentially $500 will depend on Solana’s ability to execute on its potential, attract developers building sustainable applications, and navigate the competitive landscape alongside established players like Ethereum and emerging networks.

XRP, Solana (SOL), and Chainlink (LINK) each continue to show strong momentum, but none offer the explosive presale upside that MAGACOIN FINANCE does—combining audited contracts, a hyper-engaged community, and clear tokenomics for maximum growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Path to Presale Success MAGACOIN FINANCE is charting a unique course in the crypto landscape. Its presale success is matched by a loyal and engaged community. The project’s commitment to security and transparency is clear. Diverse investors are drawn to its distinct identity and vision. With strong growth metrics, MAGACOIN FINANCE is poised for a notable launch. Key Features and Growth: Presale momentum is driving investor interest and wallet growth. Fixed supply of 100 billion tokens ensures scarcity and value. Audited smart contracts by HashEx. Analysts project returns from 25x to 50x or even higher. XRP: Bullish Momentum Fueled by Institutional Adoption XRP is trading around $2.34, with recent launches of XRP futures and ETFs fueling institutional interest. Technical analysts see a potential move above $2.83, with long-term forecasts suggesting XRP could reach $8 by year-end if market sentiment holds—though short-term upside is limited compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale potential. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength and Ecosystem Growth SOL is consolidating between $158 and $183, with a breakout above $183 potentially pushing it toward $210. Analysts expect SOL to test $250–$280 by Q4 as DeFi and NFT adoption grow. However, its upside is expected to be steady rather than exponential, making it a solid but less explosive investment than MAGACOIN FINANCE. Chainlink (LINK): Steady Gains and Network Utility LINK is trading near $16.77, with recent gains driven by strong network activity. Forecasts for 2025 suggest LINK may trade between $10 and $15, with limited upside compared to the multi-thousand-percent returns projected for MAGACOIN FINANCE. LINK’s strength lies in its utility, but its growth potential is more modest.

""Can It Overtake Ethereum?""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/standard-chartered-announces-huge-bullish-forecast-for-solana-sol-can-it-overtake-ethereum/,"Solana (SOL), which experienced a major collapse after FTX's sudden bankruptcy in 2022 and which everyone expected to go to zero, experienced a major attack in 2023. While Solana, which has virtually reborn from the ashes, is seen as a major rival for Ethereum (ETH) and many altcoins, Standard Chartered announced its SOL predictions. According to The Block, Standard Chartered stated that Solana has tremendous potential, but in the short term, SOL will lag behind Ethereum. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of global digital assets research at Standard Chartered, said Solana currently relies solely on memecoin trading. According to Kendrick, Solana could lag behind Ethereum in the near term until new use cases beyond memecoins gain traction. Therefore, Kendrick said that they predict Solana will underperform Ethereum over the next two to three years due to its heavy reliance on memecoin trading. “Solana is very heavily traded in current usage. Within transactions, Solana dominates memecoin trading. “Memecoin trading addiction Solana is likely to face a two to three year period of low activity and poor price performance.” Geoffrey Kendrick also revealed his Solana price prediction. Accordingly, the analyst predicted that SOL will reach $275 by the end of 2025, $310 by the end of 2026, $350 by the end of 2027, $475 by the end of 2028, and finally $500 by the end of 2029. *This is not investment advice.

The company made its intentions clear on Tuesday, May 27, once again stating that it is not for sale and is heading to Wall Street instead. The filing shows that Circle Internet Financial is aiming for a valuation as high as $6.71 billion on a fully diluted basis. The company wants to raise serious capital—up to $624 million—through the IPO by offering 24 million shares, with a price range between $24 and $26 each. Out of those, Circle itself is putting up 9.6 million, and the remaining 14.4 million shares are coming from early investors, including Accel and General Catalyst, who’ve decided it’s time to cash in. Cathie Wood’s ARK commits to Circle, Ripple rumors dismissed One of the biggest buyers circling this IPO is Cathie Wood. Her firm, ARK Investment Management, has said it plans to buy as much as $150 million worth of shares when the listing hits. That’s a chunk of confidence from a well-known name in the crypto-investing world, and it helps put Circle’s filing into sharper focus. Founded in 2013, Circle is best known for operating USDC , a dollar-pegged stablecoin with a market cap above $60 billion, based on tracking data from CoinGecko. Stablecoins are crypto tokens tied to fiat currencies to prevent the price swings seen with coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum. USDC is pegged to the US dollar and has become one of the most widely used stablecoins for payments, lending, and trading across exchanges and DeFi platforms. Circle’s IPO will be led by J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs, with 15 total banks lined up to underwrite the deal. Once approved, the stock will trade under the symbol CRCL on the NYSE. This is part of a broader trend encouraged by President Donald Trump’s current administration, which has pushed for a more “rational” approach to crypto rules in the US, making it easier for blockchain-native firms to go public. But this isn’t Circle’s first attempt to enter the public market. In 2022, it tried to merge with a $9 billion SPAC backed by Bob Diamond, but that deal fell apart before it could close. That failed plan doesn’t seem to be holding Circle back now. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

For many, it’s likely the established giants: Bitcoin or Ethereum . These are the names that dominate headlines, the foundational assets of the digital economy. However, recent data is challenging this conventional wisdom, revealing a perhaps surprising trend: memecoins are increasingly serving as the first step for a significant number of crypto investors . Understanding the Shifting Landscape of Crypto Adoption A new report from cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, titled the “Global State of Crypto,” sheds light on the evolving path to crypto adoption . The findings indicate that the journey into digital assets isn’t always starting with the blue chips. Instead, the often-speculative and community-driven world of memecoins is capturing the initial interest of many newcomers. According to the report, which surveyed individuals across various countries, a notable percentage of new users in the United States are making their first crypto purchase in memecoins . Specifically: 31% of U.S. crypto investors surveyed stated they purchased a memecoin before acquiring either Bitcoin or Ethereum . This statistic highlights a significant shift in how new users are entering the market compared to just a few years ago. It suggests that the allure of viral trends, community hype, and the potential for rapid gains associated with memecoins is a powerful initial draw. This trend isn’t confined to just dipping a toe in the water. The report further indicates that engagement often deepens: A remarkable 94% of memecoin holders surveyed also own traditional cryptocurrencies. This high percentage suggests that while memecoins might be the initial spark, they often lead investors to explore and invest in the broader crypto market, including established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum . This data from the Gemini report paints a clear picture: memecoins are not just isolated phenomena; they are acting as a legitimate, albeit unconventional, onboarding ramp for a substantial portion of new crypto investors , ultimately contributing to overall crypto adoption . Why Are Memecoins So Appealing to New Crypto Investors? The rise of memecoins as a primary entry point might seem counterintuitive given their often-volatile and speculative nature. However, several factors contribute to their appeal, particularly for those new to the crypto space: Accessibility and Lower Price Point: Compared to buying a whole Bitcoin or even a significant fraction of Ethereum , memecoins often have extremely low per-coin prices, allowing investors to buy millions or billions of units for a relatively small amount of capital. This psychological effect makes them feel more accessible. Community and Social Hype: Memecoins are heavily driven by online communities, social media trends, and internet culture. This creates a sense of belonging and excitement that traditional finance, and even more serious crypto projects, often lack. New users are drawn in by the fun and viral potential. Potential for Explosive Gains: While highly risky, the stories of early memecoin investors making massive returns are widely publicized. This lottery ticket appeal attracts individuals hoping for life-changing wealth from a small initial investment. Simplicity (at First Glance): For a newcomer, understanding complex blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), or the intricacies of Bitcoin’s halving can be daunting. Buying a memecoin often feels simpler – it’s about buying a token based on hype and community, which is more relatable to familiar concepts like stock market trends or viral phenomena. Media Attention: Memecoins frequently grab mainstream headlines, whether due to price pumps, celebrity endorsements, or humorous origins. This constant visibility keeps them top-of-mind for potential new investors. These factors combine to create an environment where memecoins are not just investment assets but cultural phenomena that lower the barrier to entry for individuals curious about crypto but intimidated by its technical complexity or the high price of Bitcoin and Ethereum . How Do Memecoin Holders Transition to Bitcoin and Ethereum? The Gemini report’s finding that 94% of memecoin holders also own traditional crypto is crucial. It suggests that the initial foray into memecoins serves as an educational and experiential stepping stone. Here’s how that transition likely happens: Platform Familiarity: Buying a memecoin requires setting up a wallet, using an exchange (centralized or decentralized), and understanding basic transaction processes. This demystifies the practical steps of interacting with crypto. Experiencing Volatility: Memecoins are notoriously volatile. Experiencing significant price swings, both up and down, quickly teaches new investors about market dynamics, risk management (or lack thereof), and the emotional rollercoaster of crypto investing. Curiosity and Education: Once involved, even through a memecoin , investors are exposed to the broader crypto ecosystem. They start hearing about Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative, Ethereum’s role in smart contracts and DeFi, and the potential utility of other projects. Seeking Stability or Utility: After experiencing the extreme highs and lows of memecoins , many investors begin looking for assets with more established track records, larger market caps, or tangible use cases. This naturally leads them to explore Bitcoin (often seen as digital gold) and Ethereum (the backbone of Web3). Diversification: As investors allocate more capital or become more serious, they understand the importance of diversification. Adding Bitcoin and Ethereum to a portfolio initially built on memecoins is a common diversification strategy. This transition process underscores the positive role memecoins can play in crypto adoption , acting as a ‘starter pack’ that educates users through direct experience before they move on to more complex or established assets. Benefits and Challenges of Memecoins Driving Adoption While the data suggests memecoins are effective onboarding tools, this trend isn’t without its nuances, presenting both significant benefits and considerable challenges for the crypto ecosystem and new crypto investors . Benefits: Increased Overall Adoption Numbers: By attracting a new demographic, memecoins directly contribute to a larger number of individuals holding and interacting with cryptocurrencies. Broader Reach: They tap into communities and individuals who might not have been initially interested in the technical or financial aspects of Bitcoin or Ethereum . Innovation (of a Kind): The rapid iteration and community-driven nature of memecoins , while often chaotic, can sometimes push boundaries in community building and viral marketing within the crypto space. Liquidity: Increased participation, even in the memecoin market, can potentially add overall liquidity and activity to exchanges and decentralized protocols. Challenges: High Risk and Volatility: The primary challenge is the inherent risk. Many memecoins have little to no underlying value or utility and are prone to dramatic crashes, pump-and-dump schemes, and rug pulls. New investors can lose their capital very quickly. Potential for Negative Experiences: Losing money on a memecoin can sour a new investor’s view of the entire crypto space, potentially hindering their future exploration of more legitimate projects like Bitcoin or Ethereum . Focus on Speculation Over Technology: The emphasis on hype and price action in the memecoin world can distract from the significant technological advancements and real-world applications being built on platforms like Ethereum . Regulatory Scrutiny: The speculative nature and potential for manipulation in the memecoin market attract unwanted attention from regulators, which could lead to stricter rules impacting the broader crypto industry. Misinformation: The hype around memecoins often involves significant misinformation and unrealistic promises, making it hard for new investors to discern credible information. It’s a double-edged sword: memecoins are effective at getting people through the door, but the experience inside can be perilous if not approached with caution and a willingness to learn beyond the initial hype. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Memecoin Gateway Given that memecoins are a reality in the crypto adoption journey, how should potential and existing crypto investors approach this trend? For New Investors Starting with Memecoins: Educate Yourself: Understand WHY you are buying a token. Is it pure speculation, or does it have a community, a vision, or even a tiny bit of utility? Research goes beyond just checking the price chart. Start Small: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Treat memecoins like high-risk bets, not guaranteed investments. View it as a Learning Experience: Use your memecoin journey to learn how exchanges work, how to secure a wallet, and how market sentiment affects prices. Look Beyond the Hype: Once you’re in, start exploring Bitcoin , Ethereum , and other established projects. Understand their use cases, history, and long-term potential. Don’t let memecoins be the end of your crypto journey. Beware of Scams: Be extremely cautious of projects promising guaranteed returns or pressuring you to invest quickly. Rug pulls are common. For the Crypto Industry and Educators: Acknowledge the Gateway: Instead of dismissing memecoins , recognize their role in onboarding users as highlighted by reports like Gemini’s. Improve Onboarding and Education: Develop user-friendly resources specifically tailored for those entering via memecoins . Explain the risks clearly and guide them towards understanding the broader ecosystem, including the fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum . Promote Responsible Investing: Emphasize diversification, long-term holding strategies, and the importance of utility and technology beyond speculation. Build Intuitive Platforms: Make the transition from speculative assets to more established ones seamless and easy on exchanges and wallets. The Future of Crypto Investors: A More Diverse Path? The findings from the Gemini report suggest that the path to becoming a crypto investor is becoming more diverse and less predictable. While the traditional route starting with Bitcoin or Ethereum remains prevalent, the memecoin gateway is a significant and growing phenomenon. This evolution means that the crypto community needs to adapt. We must welcome newcomers regardless of how they entered, provide them with the tools and knowledge to navigate the risks, and guide them towards understanding the deeper value proposition of decentralized technologies. The fact that most memecoin holders eventually move on to own Bitcoin and Ethereum is a positive sign. It indicates that the initial exposure, driven by hype and community, can evolve into a more serious interest in the fundamental assets powering the crypto revolution. As crypto adoption continues to grow, understanding and leveraging these diverse entry points will be crucial for the industry’s long-term health and expansion.

Here’s Why!,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-eth-may-remain-consolidated-throughout-2025-if-it-fails-to-hit-3000-heres-why/,"The post Ethereum (ETH) May Remain Consolidated Throughout 2025 if it Fails to Hit $3000. Here’s Why! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum price is yet again attempting to pierce through the pivotal resistance zone above $2600 for the third consecutive time this month. In the past couple of attempts, the price failed to sustain despite the volume prevailing within a decent range. Meanwhile, the current scenario appears to be slightly different, as a drop in volume may turn the tables for the ETH price rally. Meanwhile, the historical chart suggests the price has entered an accumulation zone, which may prevent it from a breakout for a couple of months ahead. Logarithmic regression band is a technical indicator that is used to find the set trend, specifically when the growth rate accelerates rapidly and slows down in no time. These bands identify the resistance and support of the price movements. Currently, the ETH price has entered these bands and if history repeats, then the token could spend a lot of time within these bands. The ETH price has entered the bands for the first time in the past few years. The historical chart suggests the price enters the bands before triggering the next bullish wave. After breaking above the bands, the price usually triggers a strong bull run and marks a new ATH. However, before that, the price is expected to consolidate for nearly a year before the next bullish move. Now that the price has already consolidated for nearly 4 months, another similar consolidation is expected. Will Ethereum (ETH) Fail to Surge Above $3000 in 2025? Despite the recovery, the ETH price has failed to rise within the bullish range. The weekly chart of ETH price displays a v-shape recovery but has failed to rise above the ascending trend line that it held since the middle of 2022. The current technicals suggest the price is poised for another pullback. The ETH price is currently trading between the 50-day and the 200-day weekly MA and, unfortunately, heading for a bearish crossover or the Death Cross. On the other hand, the weekly DMI just refrained from validating a bullish crossover as the -Di is maintaining a strong descending trend. These indicators point towards a strong pullback in the ETH price and keep the levels restricted below $2500 for a while.

According to a Tuesday morning update from Reuters, spot gold sank 1.4% to $3,297.49 an ounce by 11:00 a.m. GMT, while US gold futures dropped harder—down 2.1% to $3,296.50. This is the second straight day of losses for gold after Trump’s unexpected change in tone over the weekend. On Sunday, Trump walked back his threat to slam the EU with 50% tariffs next month. Instead, he gave negotiators a new deadline of July 9 . That was all it took for investors to ease off the precious metal and dive back into riskier assets. As stocks rebounded, the appeal of gold faded fast . Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said , “Gold trades lower for a second day with technical selling along a descending trendline from the April record high, being supported by reduced haven demand amid rising stocks after Trump softened his aggressive trade stance with the EU.” Dollar gains and Fed expectations push gold and metals lower While gold was already under pressure from technicals, the real punch came from the dollar index, which flipped its earlier weakness to trade 0.3% higher. That rise in the greenback made the yellow metal more expensive for international buyers, pushing even more out of the market. At the same time, investors turned their eyes to Washington, where several Federal Reserve officials are expected to speak this week. Traders are also watching for Friday’s core PCE inflation data, hoping it will offer clues about the central bank’s next rate move. Lower interest rates usually make non-yielding gold more attractive, but the current setup hasn’t moved that needle just yet. Ole doubled down on the economic watchlist: “Gold traders will be watching incoming US economic data for signs of a tariff-related slowdown and/or a pick up in inflation.” Right now, markets are pricing in 47 basis points of cuts by year-end, with the first move expected in October. Rhona O’Connell, an analyst at StoneX, isn’t expecting much action near-term. “The shorter term outlook is unchanged: gold is still consolidating. We expect prices to remain supported while the markets contend with continued uncertainty, but we believe that the high is in,” she said. It wasn’t just gold that got hit. Across the precious metals space, it was a rough session. Spot silver fell 0.9% to $33.06 per ounce. Platinum lost 0.7% to settle at $1,077.77. Palladium also slid 1%, ending the day at $978.01. Elsewhere in Europe, equities were feeling the boost. The Stoxx 600 index rose 0.99% across the board. Every sector traded in positive territory, but automakers stood out. After losing 3% in the previous session, European car stocks surged 1.7% on Monday, directly reacting to the White House’s tariff pause. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

But while everyone’s chasing bigger positions, few are stopping to ask: what are the hidden costs? It’s not just the spread anymore. Between overnight fees, taker commissions, and funding rates that shift by the hour, most traders end up paying far more than they think, especially on volatile pairs. As capital flows back into margin products, a silent tax is draining accounts behind the scenes. The platforms don’t highlight it, but the numbers are real. And if you’re not tracking them, your edge is already gone. Why Leverage Trading Is Surging Again Speculation is back — and traders aren’t just buying the dip, they’re borrowing for it. Over the past 20 days, open interest in Bitcoin futures has jumped by 20% , now topping $26 billion across global markets. That’s not idle money, it’s a signal that traders are ramping up margin exposure to chase near-term moves. Bitcoin’s breakout from a falling wedge pattern has reignited bullish momentum, but the real accelerant is leverage. The estimated leverage ratio has climbed nearly 1%, reflecting a wider shift in appetite for risk. This trend isn’t isolated. Liquidity is tightening around key resistance levels, and traders are stacking bets on both sides, hoping to catch a breakout, but sitting inches from liquidation triggers. As Bitcoin has crossed the $100K barrier, the leverage game is officially back on. The Hidden Cost That Most Traders Miss For many retail traders, leverage is a shortcut to bigger positions — but the real cost isn’t always in the loss column. Every time a leveraged position is opened, there are hidden multipliers baked into the transaction: trading fees, overnight interest, and funding rates that quietly erode capital over time. These aren’t hypothetical costs. They compound. What most traders don’t see is easy to highlight by showing how fees can spiral as leverage ratios climb, even when the position is sized modestly. As outlined by Leverage.Trading, which tracks fees across major crypto leverage trading platforms, these costs can spiral quickly with high-margin positions. For example, on a $500 account using 25x leverage, the trading fee alone can spike from $1 to $25, a 2,400% increase, before the trade even moves. Source: fee breakdown via Leverage.Trading What many traders don’t realize is that this fee structure punishes over-leveraging, not just through liquidations, but through slow, cumulative cost drag. That means even when a trade is “profitable,” the net gain may be smaller than expected due to baked-in operational fees. The message? Leverage isn’t free. And figuring out the true cost structure might be the difference between scaling an edge or burning out your capital. From Spot to Futures - Fees Vary More Than You Think It’s easy to assume that a few decimals in trading fees don’t matter—until they do. Spot trading on Binance charges a flat 0.10% for most users, barely dropping unless you're pushing over $20 million in volume. But jump to the futures market, and the dynamic shifts. Suddenly, even modestly active traders can access taker fees as low as 0.045%—half the spot cost. At the highest VIP levels, that gap grows even wider: 0.017% vs. 0.10%. For day traders or anyone using leverage, that’s not a discount. It’s a structural edge. The table below shows just how sharply the fee curve bends. What looks like a small tweak on paper becomes thousands saved—or lost—depending on where you trade. Binance fee tiers spot vs. futures What this means for you. If you're trading with leverage and not checking the fee structure of your platform, you're probably bleeding capital. Let’s say you open 5 trades per day with a 1:25 leverage ratio on a $1,000 account. At a 0.10% fee (typical spot rate), you're paying $125/month in fees. On Binance Futures at 0.045%, that drops to just $56/month, less than half. Over a year? That’s $828 saved, just by choosing the right market. Why Some Traders Don’t Mind Paying More Fees aren’t always the enemy. Power users often trade in milliseconds, not months. For them, paying 0.05% more means accessing deeper liquidity, faster fills, and better outcomes when volatility hits. As one Reddit user put it: “Much more liquid (perpetual futures liquidity is often much better than spot)… really cheap short term, but quite expensive if held too long.”— CrowdGoesWildWoooo, r/CryptoCurrency Others simply prefer tools that keep up with their strategy: Speed > SavingsScalpers and short-term traders will gladly pay higher taker fees to avoid slippage on a fast-moving market. Seconds can make or break a setup. Reliability WinsAfter flash crashes and liquidity gaps, many traders now prioritize exchanges that stay online when volatility hits. “I don’t need the cheapest platform. I need the one that doesn’t freeze,” as one Redditor put it. Infrastructure & ToolingMore expensive platforms often come with better dashboards, charting tools, and automation features — all of which can increase the trader’s edge. Peace of MindAs one user noted: “I’ll probably only use leverage during key moments in the cycle.” For that, they want a platform they trust, not just one that’s cheap. These are real-world trade-offs that numbers alone can’t capture — and they explain why, even in a fee-sensitive niche like crypto, many traders choose to pay more and sleep better. Final Take: Trading Fees Deserve More Attention in 2025 Leverage trading is back in full force, but most traders still aren’t doing the math. While everyone’s fixated on charts, entries, and liquidation points, the slow bleed of fees continues behind the scenes. It’s not just about losses anymore, it’s about how much you don’t make because of what you didn’t see. In 2025, every basis point matters. Whether you're scalping on Binance Futures or riding swing trades offshore, understanding the cost structure of your trades is no longer optional, it's alpha. So before you size up your next position, ask yourself: are you optimizing for the market... or for the platform’s profit margin? Smart traders calculate both.

According to a press release, Circle plans to offer a total of 24 million shares of its Class A common stock, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CRCL. The stablecoin issuer will offer 9.6 million of the 24 million common shares, while its existing stakeholders will sell the remaining 14.4 million shares. How Much Circle and Its Existing Stakeholders Will Raise The press release suggested that each share could trade within a price range of $24 to $26. If the stock trades at $26, Circle could raise approximately $250 million through the offering, while its existing shareholders could receive roughly $374.4 million for their stake. Circle has also granted underwriters a standard 30-day option to purchase up to 3.6 million additional shares to cover over-allotments. Roles of Top Financial Entities Per the press release, three prominent financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Citigroup, will serve as the joint lead active bookrunners. Notably, the additional bookrunners also include Deutsche Bank Securities, Barclays, and Société Générale.Circle’s IPO co-managers include Santander, BNY Capital Markets, Needham & Company, Canaccord Genuity, and Oppenheimer & Co. Roberts & Ryan, Drexel Hamilton, Mischler Financial Group, Inc., and AmeriVet Securities will serve as junior co-managers. Meanwhile, Circle confirmed it has filed a registration statement with the U.S. SEC relating to the IPO. With the registration still pending, Circle said it will not commence the sale of its common A stock or accept offers from interested investors. Ark Invest to Buy $150M of Circle’s Shares In an S-1 document filed with the SEC today, Circle disclosed that Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is interested in purchasing up to $150 million of its common A stock. With this $150 million offer, Ark Invest could acquire around 5,769,230 (5.76 million) units of Circle’s shares from the IPO. This estimate is based on the highest price target of $26, at which Circle plans to sell each share.

A similar move in late 2023 saw ETH climb from below $1,500 to nearly $4,000 within a year. In both instances, ETH quickly advanced toward and broke above the channel’s upper band as momentum built. As of May 2025, that upper band sat near $3,200, making it the next key resistance. A breakout above this level could open the path toward the previous cycle high of $4,100 by July.

The Nasdaq-listed firm, under the ticker DJT, noted in a press release that it would raise the funds by employing the MicroStrategy playbook. Specifically, Trump Media has reached an agreement with 50 institutional investors to sell $1.5 billion of its common stock and $1 billion through its 0.00% convertible senior secured note, aggregating to around $2.5 billion.Trump Media to Buy BitcoinThe Tuesday release stated that the offering would last until May 29, pending customary closing conditions by the involved parties. Meanwhile, Trump Media would employ the proceeds from the offering to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve.Notably, Trump Media branded the strategy to buy Bitcoin “one of the largest Bitcoin treasury deals of any public firm,” stating that it brings to a conclusion its earlier announcement of an acquisition fund.The Trump-owned company will offer its common stocks worth $1.5 billion at the last market price and the $1 billion senior notes at a 35% premium convertible price. The proposed $2.5 billion acquisition would make Trump Media one of the largest publicly traded companies holding the pioneering cryptocurrency.At the current standings, it would sit fourth in the rankings, only behind MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, and Twenty One Capital . Trump Media disclosed that Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital will custody its proposed Bitcoin Treasury.DJT Stock Falls Amid Investor SkepticismTrump Media is the operator of the Truth Social media platform, streaming platform Truth+, and decentralized finance platform Truth.Fi. Interestingly, its stock took a tumble on Tuesday following the recent announcement, contrary to the stock performances of other firms that have disclosed in the past that they were buying Bitcoin.DJT fell 6.65% to $24.01 after a double-digit rally in the premarket, as investors pulled their stakes in the company. Part of the skepticism comes from Trump Media’s strategy of neutralizing its shares to fund its Bitcoin Treasury business.Notably, the Financial Times reported yesterday that Trump’s media firm plans to raise $3 billion to buy Bitcoin. While it denied the speculation, today’s announcement confirms that the report had some element of truth.Growing Exposure to BitcoinMeanwhile, Trump Media joins a constantly growing list of public and private companies buying Bitcoin for their treasuries. It also becomes the latest to adopt MicroStrategy’s playbook to acquire the pioneering cryptocurrency.Firms like Marathon Digital, Metaplanet, and the Blockchain Group have all taken to offering investors bonds to raise funds for more Bitcoin acquisition. Strategy recently raised $2.1 billion to increase its massive stash, buying 4,020 BTC ($427 million) yesterday.Notably, the strategy does not sit well with some prominent market users.

The company is planning to expand into Africa, generally targeting places like Nigeria and Ghana that have some crypto regulations in place. After previously banning cryptocurrency in 2021, Nigeria will now be home to the UK-based Blockchain.com’s physical office in Africa. Blockchain.com is planning a physical office space in Nigeria The UK-based cryptocurrency exchange has announced that it will open its first physical office in Nigeria, as the country is its fastest-growing market in West Africa. Blockchain.com has been making moves to expand into the African continent as there has been a development in regulatory clarity in select African nations. According to Owenize Odia, general manager for Africa operations, Nigeria is a crucial pillar of the company’s strategy to expand across Africa. In an email statement , Odia described Nigeria’s recent progress in digital asset regulation as a positive development for crypto firms seeking stability and legitimacy. “Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” she said. Blockchain.com’s plan is to establish a local presence that targets emerging crypto hotspots like Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. These areas are home to tech-savvy youths, who are increasingly turning to crypto as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Africa’s youthful demographics are a major part of Blockchain.com’s strategy, as over 60% of the continent’s population is under the age of 25. Mobile-first technologies like cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) also have a high chance of adoption. The planned Nigerian office will serve as a regional hub for West Africa and is expected to support operations, partnerships, and customer engagement. Youth interest in cryptocurrency is pivotal While cryptocurrency remains illegal or heavily restricted in several African countries, a handful of nations are now attempting to regulate digital assets rather than ban the industry altogether. This shift in priorities is creating new opportunities for both African investors and exchanges like Blockchain.com, looking to expand across the continent. U.S. President Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets has also given firms the confidence to make bold, ambitious future plans. Nigeria has so far been bold with digital asset regulation. In 2021, Nigeria’s central bank issued a directive that effectively banned banks from facilitating crypto transactions. As a result, Nigerian investors graduated to using peer-to-peer trading platforms. Then, in 2023, the country passed a new investment and securities law that explicitly included provisions for the licensing and regulation of crypto exchanges. This law prompted other players, such as Yellow Card Financial Inc. to begin seeking official permits from Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A couple of borders away, Ghana’s central bank has also begun drafting regulations, with plans to introduce a legal framework for cryptocurrencies and related platforms by the end of September 2025, according to Odia. If all goes according to plan, this regulation would place Ghana among the growing list of African nations seeking to attract crypto-related investments. By opening a physical office in Nigeria, Blockchain.com could pave the way for other crypto companies to follow suit, which would further strengthen Africa’s position in the global digital asset industry. As Odia put it, “Africa has the potential to leapfrog traditional financial systems — and crypto is the key.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Andromeda aims to make Pulsar into a full AI-powered C-suite collaborator, which will be able to assist teams in technology and launch scalable, interoperable dApps across any chain. Pulsar to make Web3 more accessible In the first release, the agent will be focused on guiding developers through aOS boarding, providing tailored documentation, real-time community support, and actionable insights to make the builder experience easier. Pulsar will also use advanced AI to work as an intelligent partner, guiding project owners through the intricate process of building Web3 applications, projects, and businesses. The first release will provide personalized recommendations, tailored documentation, and real-time community support, meeting creators at their current skill level while empowering them to launch scalable, interoperable dApps. The process will be streamlined from months to days. By automating these repetitive tasks, making workflows easier, and offering actionable insights, Pulsar will enhance the developer experience by reducing barriers to entry and promoting widespread adoption. The company said Pulsar will make web3 more accessible by these steps and using aOS as its proprietary large language model (LLM). Mant Hawkins, CEO of Andromeda, said, Pulsar will be more than a tool -it will serve as an intelligent partner that empowers anyone to bring their Web3 vision to life. By making decentralized development intuitive and efficient, Pulsar will pave the way for a future where anyone can build and scale with confidence, unlocking the full potential of Web3 for creators and users alike”. Democratized process for developers A Web3 platform provides a lot of opportunities with millions of potential users who could be onboarded. But the decentralized development has been complicated due to the limited participation of those with advanced technical expertise. Pulsar will change this situation by providing democratized access to Web3. It will lower technical and financial barriers and enable a diverse range of creators from solo developers to enterprise teams to build and scale dApps, increasing mass adoption. In a Cointelegraph article , Max Giammario, founder and CEO of Kindred, says, The interfaces and user experience in Web3 tools are terrible, even more so when compared to their Web2 counterparts. … AI agents can be an excellent tool to overcome these weaknesses. With the potential that emotional AI agents have, they would facilitate the experience of new users, and they could serve as personal assistants to interact with the rest of the Web3 tools in a more autonomous, personalized way.” Pulsar can be fully used as an AI-powered collaborator, powered by a proprietary LLM that gives access to the entirety of the Andromeda operating system. It can also provide cross-chain and multi-chain support for the aOS ecosystem.

But that view shortchanges MARA. That said, there is a value-added MSTR analogy here. I like MSTR because of how its “intelligent leverage” adds value. MARA’s value-add is very different; it’s a big-time bitcoin miner. To many (including me before I looked deeply into MARA), bitcoin mining sounds obscure, exotic, and even a bit scary (think monstrous energy costs). Upon further review, and mastery of some new jargon, mining actually makes sense to me. And so, too, does MARA’s vertical integration and energy focused approach to it. MARA stock trades at a slight 2.73% discount to the market value of its bitcoin holdings. Adding-in the benefits of its approach to mining, I consider the stock a “Buy.”. Sometimes I scare myself. Some say I do that every morning when I first look in the mirror. I won’t argue. But that’s not what I mean now. I think, and I say this with great trepidation… I believe I’m starting to… drum roll… understand bitcoin! I’m sure there’s a segment of the Seeking Alpha community that reads this and yawns. “Well duh…” they (or you) may think. “What took you so long!” I don’t have an easy or self-flattering answer. All I can say is that some of us traditionalists catch on slowly. I started in the market in 1979 working for Value Line. Its founder, the late Arnold Bernhard, began his investment career in the 1920s. I’ve long been attached to value investing. I brought Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) into Value Line coverage in the mid-1990s. I’m not sure if Warren Buffett was blowing smoke or not, but he did tell me I was the first analyst to actually start covering the company regularly. Even after having moved on from Value Line, I retained enough of my fundamental training to have recognized that the many turn-of-the century dot-com high-fliers were cash-burning dregs. So I sat out that boom… and bust . In fact, in 2000 and 2002, I published books very tethered to basic fundamentals. These were, respectively, Screening the Market and The Value Connection . But underneath, I always had an affinity for Wall Street’s wild side. For a while, I covered gold-and silver-mining stocks. I even got a trip to a gold mine in Canada’s Northwest Territories near the Arctic Circle. And in the mid-1980s, I launched and managed a Value Line high yield (“junk”) bond mutual fund. (We called it “Aggressive Income.”) Now, after having retired from corporate life and working for myself rather than chasing down somebody else’s strategies and agendas, I find my taste for adventure returning. Many of the stocks you’ll find in the Analysis portion of my Profile may strike you as 180-degrees apart from Buffett-world and what you’d expect form a guy who wrote books about fundamentals. And then, on 12/20/24 , I wrote up Strategy ( MSTR ). That company is about buying and holding bitcoin. I recognizing that bitcoin is an asset. It has a price. MSTR has a quantity of it. So I could compute an asset value. Value investors love doing that! But I needed two more steps before I said “Hold” rather than “Sell.’ First, I had to understand MSTR’s “intelligent leverage” strategy. I needed that to understand why MSTR was more than just a guess on bitcoin’s next pricing move. And I had to figure out why bitcoin is not really, as Buffett famously said , “rat poison squared.” I needed to understand why sane persons would want to own it. By the time I wrote up MSTR again on 5/9/25, felt comfortable enough to say “Buy.” MARA Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) , a partially MSTR-like company, brings my crypto self-education to the next level. I had to study up on bitcoin mining. That’s as important to MARA as intelligent leverage is to MSTR. Mining is why MARA is, like MSTR, more than just another play on bitcoin price gyrations. In One Sense, its Bitcoin “Full HODL” Strategy, We Can Think of MARA as MSTR-Lite MSTR speaks in terms of a bitcoin treasury strategy. MARA uses a different label for it… “Full HODL .” The odd acronym originated from a 2013 post in a bitcoin forum. Specifically, it was a typo committed by a user who meant to type HOLD. Since then, HODL got its own informal meaning… “Hold On for Dear Life.” As of 3/31/25, the end of the first quarter, MARA owned 47,531 coins. As of this writing, Bitcoin last traded at about $109,620 per coin. MARA’s Q1 weighted average number of diluted shares was 344.1 million. That values MARA’s holdings at $5.15 billion. Let’s now hypothetically assume MARA added no more coins since 3/31/25. In such a case, MARA’s bitcoin holdings would be worth nearly $15.14 per share. The means MARA, last (as of this writing) priced at about $14.73 per share, trades at a 2.73% discount to its bitcoin ownership. (The true discount is probably more since the company likely obtained more coins since 3/31/24.) My 5/9/25 MSTR writeup put that stock price at an approximately 116% premium to its bitcoin holdings. So, we can start out by suggesting that MARA, at a 2.73% discount, is very attractively priced relative to MSTR. But as discussed on 5/9/25, there was a lot more to the MSTR story (its intelligent leverage strategy). There’s a different sort of play with MARA. It lends out some of its bitcoin to others who sell short… and earns fee income for doing so. But there’s another much bigger aspect of the story here… MARA Doesn’t Just Own Bitcoin – It’s Also a Major Bitcoin Miner MARA separates from MSTR based on how each company gets its bitcoin. MSTR buys using its intelligent leverage financing protocol. MARA buys too. It also finances purchases. But it’s capital-raising approach isn’t as systemic as that of MSTR (at least not yet). The big differentiator is that MARA also mines its own bitcoin. I’m going to offer a little mining primer here. Just saying this company mines bitcoin, and even providing some numbers, won’t fully support an investment case for MARA. I’ll need to discuss what specialness (equivalent to MSTR’s intelligent leverage) MARA brings to this table making it more (better) than a one-to-one bitcoin play. A rudimentary understanding of mining will help you appreciate that…. Bitcoin and Mining Simplified (i.e., For People Who Still Carry Paper Currency) In the beginning (actually, on 1/3/09), Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin . More specifically, he launched the blockchain by creating Block 0. This is also known as the Genesis Block. He created the Genesis Block by solving a complex cryptographic puzzle. The process by which he did this is known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). Nakamoto expressed his solution a unique 64-character alphanumeric identifier (also known as a “hash”)… 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f He also embedded a message: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks (That supposedly showed Nakamoto’s motive for creating bitcoin... lack of trust in the monetary establishment). The Genesis Block awarded 50 coins (the first ones ever) to Nakamoto. And with that, bitcoin was off and running. The 50 Genesis coins can’t be spent. But new coins created by others can be and are spent, transferred, etc. Information about each new bitcoin transaction is added to something called a block. Then there’s another transaction that’s also added to the same block. Then, there’s another, and another, and another… until the block fills to capacity. (This happens on average, once every 10 minutes.) The full block closes when it fills up. And then, the race is on… Modern Bitcoin Miners in Action – Lots of Math but Only One “Eureka” Moment Bitcoin “miners” compete to add this new block to the existing “blockchain.” The latter is the official bitcoin public ledger. Miners get busy at their “rigs.” Those are super powerful computers that use ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). They’re optimized for use as mining rigs. (When connected to the bitcoin network, they’re called nodes.) Gold miners used muscle-power to find and extract gold. Bitcoin miners use brainpower to solve an insanely complex mathematical puzzle. A solution, once they come up with one, is called a “nonce.” Next, the nonce is run through a block function that leads to a “hash.” Think of a hash as the modern equivalent of a gold prospector’s choice of a spot in which to prospect. A gold miner wins by seeing gold in the rocks he brings up or in water he sifts. A bitcoin miner with a fresh new hash gets to shout “Eureka” if the hash comes in lower than a target set by the bitcoin network. Most hashes fail. They don’t meet the network’s test. To get one that works takes a lot of trial and error… and I mean A LOT ! (Shades of 19 th century gold prospectors… and then some.) With all the miners producing and trying a lot of hash solutions, here’s the challenge. In contrast to gold, there can be only one bitcoin mining winner. But suppose two, or 10, or 3,486 miners all create valid hashes? The first one to prove the validity of its solution (Proof of Work) is the sole winner. As to the other one, or nine, or 3,485 miners… tough luck, they lose… They have to try again with a new puzzle relating to the next block created by new transactions. Running Harder and Harder and Needing More and More Sustenance Are you out of breath yet? I am… just thinking about this. Imagine how much power bitcoin rigs need! That’s why these rigs, with their powerful ASIC innards, use a monstrous amount of electricity. As time passes and more coins are created, the final hash-matching challenges get increasingly harder. And the coins per win decrease due to halving events… These events keep bitcoin from reaching its hard-coded maximum circulation (21 million coins) for a long time. There are now about 19,868,488 coins . (If you click the link and see a different number, don’t tell me I messed up. The actual number changes every 10 minutes.) On day one, each winning miner got 50 new coins. Then, after issuance of every 210,000 coins, the reward per win is halved. The last such halving event happened on 4/9/24. The victory prize shrank from 6.25 coins per win to 3.125. The next halving event will cut the reward to 1.5625 coins. The upshot: We’re not going to max out tomorrow. Bitbo.io estimates that’ll happen at some time in 2040. (It estimates that by then, the reward per win will be 0.000000011641532 coins! Obviously the reward-to-effort ratio is shrinking. So expect only the fittest among the approximately 1 million unique miners to survive long term. And expect those increasingly fit miners to keep pushing their rigs harder, and for the rigs to inhale more power. MARA is The Biggest Public Bitcoin Miner Here I go again… I already bombarded you with jargon like nonce, rig, node and hash. And now, I’ll need to give you a few more terms. Hashrate tells us how much computational power a miner brings to the puzzle-solving competition. Specifically ... Hashrate is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining. More simply, it is the speed of mining. It is measured in units of hash/second, meaning how many calculations per second can be performed. Machines with a high hash power are highly efficient and can process a lot of data in a single second. Exahash means 1 quintillion hashes per second. That’s 1 followed by 18 zeros! (I’ll be you thought 1 trillion was a big number. Welcome to the bitcoin world!) We can compare miners based on EH/s… Exahash per second. Here is how MARA fares relative to the other public miners. Analyst compilation based on data from stocktitan.net and cointelegraph.com (EH/s data is the latest reported for each company on stocktitan.net , specifically here for MARA, here for CleanSpark ( CLSK ), here for IREN ( IREN ), and here for Riot ( RIOT ). All numbers of bitcoins produced comes from cointelegraph.com ) As I said MARA is the biggest. MARA is a Low Cost Miner Aside from buying bitcoins in the open market and periodically raising capital to finance its transactions, the forgoing describes what MARA does for a day-to-day living. It’s hard. So, why on earth should MARA bother mining? Couldn’t MARA just as easily buy more coins, and ask its CFO to work harder to keep finding ways to pay for them? In fact, mined coins are only small part of MARA’s total portfolio. The image below shows, for MARA, trends in blocks won and coins produced, relative to total coins owned (the holding balance). MARA IR Actually, there is a huge benefit to mining coins… despite all the virtual huffing and puffing. Typical of business in general, making something on one’s own (assuming any tolerable level of competence) will be cheaper than buying it at retail. You get to eliminate manufacturer’s margins, distribution costs, retailers’ margins. You would, of course, have your own production and capital costs. But at least you would have the power to improve your outcomes… You can manage your processes and costs. This is especially critical given halving and increases in network difficulty. This is a big deal, not just for MARA but for everybody. You see, the race to submit the winning hash differs from other races. In most contests, the finish line is fixed. A 100-yard dash is always 100 yards. That’s not so for bitcoin. Here, a 100-yard dash can turn into a 105-yard dash, and then a 110-year dash, etc. This happens because the bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty of the solution target. It does this after every 2,016 blocks (about 2 weeks). The idea here is to keep the number of winning blocks more or less constant even as more miners keep joining the network. (This is why the above mining trends chart shows, for MARA, fewer blocks won in the latest quarter.) This is why every miner, to succeed over time, must continually strive to become more operationally efficient. MARA started with an asset-lite mining model. It owned its rigs. But it paid others for hosting and infrastructure. At the peak of this phase of MARA’s history, it owned only 3% of its mining sites. That minimized capital outlays. It helped MARA achieve strong early growth in mining. Now, however, cost control is becoming more important. That’s why in 2023, MARA changed its strategy. MARA’s Pivot from its Traditional Asset Lite Approach to Pursuit of Vertical Integration The idea, here, is for MARA to own the entire bitcoin-producing chain. MARA IR Toward that end, the company made three acquisitions in 2024. These brought seven mining sites under MARA’s fold. MARA IR As a result, MARA now operates 617 Megawatts (MW) at fully-owned or controlled mining sites. That’s 55% of the 1,118 MW (1.1 Gigawatts) it now uses. The rest (501 MW) remains at hosted sites. (The latter refers to sites MARA leases from others.) MARA IR Note, however, the right column of the table… If all sites become fully optimized to their respective maximum capacities, MARA would wind up with 1.7 GW of power, and own about 70% of that total. This is already enabling MARA to slash costs. The following table shows trends in MARA’s mining cost per petahash per day. (I’m sure I made your head spin when I discussed above exahash based on 1 quintillion hashes, 1 followed by 18 zeros. Now, to stay in line with how MARA reports data, I have to introduce petahash… based on 1 quadrillion, 1 followed by 15 zeros.) Analyst compilation based on MARA data Don’t worry about variation on zeros and “…illion.” I added the percent change columns to illustrate what’s really important… the trends. Q125 is where we really start seeing what vertical integration does to costs. MARA decided to vertically integrate in late 2023. It made its acquisitions at various times during 2024. So Q125 is the first to reflect the benefits of all of last year’s purchases. Electricity Generation Looms Large in MARA’s Plans to Benefit Even More from Vertical Integration Electricity is, perhaps, THE major cost for bitcoin mining. Digioconomis.com estimates electricity cost as being 48.9% of miner income. Over the course of 2024, MARA came in well below that at its owned sites. Page 36 of its latest 10-K tells us electricity… represented 40.8%, as a percentage of our owned mining revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. This excludes energy costs from third party hosted sites…. The average price for direct energy we paid in our owned facilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.04 per KWh. That $.04 figure refers to the 139 MW MARA-owned capacity. MARA IR MARA IR In contrast, industrial-use electricity per KWh cost averaged $0.0815 in 2024 . Helping MARA achieve its cost advantage are its behind-the-grid mining locations. At these sites, MARA can buy power directly from the source-producer. It thusly bypasses the utility ecosystem. MARA generally locates near renewable power generators, like wind farms. And looking ahead, there’s… Considerable Room for MARA to Benefit Even More from Electricity Production The idea is to capture and use what CEO Fred Thiel refers to as underutilized or stranded electrons. A lot of this relates to behind-the-grid mining sites. Often, much generated power goes to waste – is abandoned – because it can’t all be economically transported to other places, e.g., the main grid. So MARA can get this very cheaply. Besides wind, flared gas is another example. This refers to natural gas that is burned off (flared) at oil-gas production site. MARA locates modular data centers at wellheads. These are powered by gas that would be otherwise wastefully flared. MARA IR In a different sort of cooperative arrangement, MARA is a source rather than a mere user of energy. For example, in a pilot project in Finland , MARA transfers excess heat from its mining operations to a district heating system. The latter uses it to heat buildings in the community. MARA IR Meanwhile, MARA is locating in places that foster cooperation with the grid to foster load balancing . For as much of an electricity hog as mining is, it can be shut down or ramped up almost instantaneously. That opens opportunities for MARA to work with the grid to power down when it encounters peak loads. And of, course, MARA turns it up when the grid can comfortably accommodate mining. It’s now time to add another well-known power-hog, AI, to the discussion. MARA is looking to work with AI and other types of HPC (High Performance Computing). It plans to use its mining data centers to co-host for such operations. Don’t assume MARA’s data centers will have to become mega-facilities filled with the latest and greatest chips — GPUs — from Nvidia ( NVDA ). Those are most badly needed for AI training… building the models. A use of a model, (an inference event), requires much less power than a training event. Inference power demand comes from volume… many more events. The doesn’t detract from the amount of power inference needs. It’s still a lot. But there’s no need to concentrate a lot of it in a super-duper hyperscaler-friendly data center. That means AI companies can do inference from locations such as the ones MARA uses to mine bitcoin. Are visions of a new MARA revenue (hosting for AI inference) stream dancing in you mind? They should be! They are for MARA . All this should help make this stock much more than a mere speculation on bitcoin prices. (And if you’re a VERY forward thinker, you can get a sense of how MARA’s infrastructure can continue making money after bitcoin maxes out around 2040!) Risk Obviously, the future price of bitcoin is a key source of risk. If you are among those who think it and crypto in general are nonsense, you should not be in this stock. (For reasons I discussed in my 5/9/25 MSTR writeup, I disagree with that view.) Financially speaking, most of the data tables I usually show won’t be helpful. Acquisitions in pursuit of vertical integration cause unconventional revenue comparisons. And you’d likely get a mega-migraine evaluating EPS comparisons. That’s because recently-revised accounting standards let bitcoin holders record holdings at the latest market value of the coins. In the past, miners had to write them down when bitcoin fell. But they couldn’t write them up when the price recovered. That was a big headache for EPS-focused analysis. The new rule still requires holders to write down when coin prices fall. But now, they also get to write them back up when prices recover. This does better reflect the economic value of the companies. But for EPS fans, this is “OY” raised exponentially! Here is a version of my usual Financial Strength Highlights table modified to help you get a sense of MARA’s financial viability. Analyst Compilation based on Data from Seeking Alpha Financial Presentations I’ve already explained the soaring revenue. I’ve adjusted the operating margin to exclude the impact of non-cash employee stock compensation costs. (If you can’t handle dilution from employee stock options, MARA and many others among today’s growth companies aren’t for you. Employees have to be incentivized and for many such firms, cash isn’t the best way to do that right now.) I also excluded the impact of changes in the value of digital assets. These are income statement items that reflect the write-downs and write-ups I discussed based on changes in the value of bitcoin holdings. The main takeaway here is that although debt and equity soared recently (due to vertical integration), MARA is clearly solvent. I do want to mention another unusual risk source. You can see it in the recently diminished gross margin. Remember I spoke above about bitcoin halving events and increasing puzzle difficulties. As noted, these make MARA (and miners in general) work harder for rewards that shrink in relation to work done. Think of it as a business hard-wired for margins to decline. This isn’t the end of the world for MARA. It’s a fact of life. And I discussed how MARA is coping… vertical integration, cost control, digital infrastructure endeavors. These are sound moves for this business. Think of them as analogous to a company facing hard-wired industry margin erosion switching to volume-boosting strategies and cost cuts. So the halving events, etc. don’t faze me. But they might jolt investors who aren’t familiar with the dynamics of bitcoin mining… those who just look at comparisons and don’t understand what’s really going on. What to do About MARA Stock Let’s look at the price chart I usually show. StockCharts.com Frankly, I'm having trouble relating the price trends and the indicators I typically monitor (the 10- and 50-day exponential moving averages, Chaikin Money Flow, and the Chaikin Oscillator (CO), to what I see for MARA's fundamentals. Then, I decided to compare MARA prices to trends in bitcoin. Seeking Alpha Bingo! Now I get it. MARA had previously moved more or less in line with bitcoin. But that changed as 2024 progressed. MARA started to underperform bitcoin. And we know what happened in 2024... MARA changed its strategy from asset-lite to vertical integration. And that entailed huge changes in its capital structure. Add in the bitcoin halving event and the generally increasing puzzle difficulty levels. As suggested in the Risk section above, it looks to me like the Street still hasn't yet fully grasped what MARA today is truly about. It should over the long term outperform bitcoin! That’s interesting. It looks like the Street is not yet seeing all relevant aspects of MARA. That – i.e., that investors are missing important issues – is a classic example of what value investors hope to find. The value ideal is a stock with a low P/E because they don’t get it . We don’t often see that any more, in today’s information-intense world. But we do for MARA. (Maybe this investing adventure is closer to my fundamental value roots than I first realized.) I understand that nobody would actually call MARA a value stock. But can I interest anybody in creating a new word… cryptoval! Regardless… When it comes to rating stocks, I think in terms of probable future stock performance relative to the market, rather than literally buying, holding or selling. And since I’m not rating based on a quant model, I’ll eschew “Strong …” extremes. Absent an exceptional degree of conviction, I think “Buy,” Hold,” or “Sell” are enough. Over time, as the Street better understands MARA and its relationship to bitcoin prices, I see the stock as likely outperforming the broader market. I translate that to the Seeking Alpha rating taxonomy by rating MARA as a “Buy.”",MSTR|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-27 15:33:20

If passed, Florida would become the first U.S. state to offer zero state-level capital gains tax on profits from cryptocurrencies like XRP. While federal taxes would still apply, the removal of state taxes could create an unprecedented advantage for Floridian investors and entrepreneurs. This is no small shift — it signals a bold step by Florida to position itself as a national and global hub for crypto innovation and wealth generation. BREAKING: BOOOOOOM Florida just dropped a BOMBSHELL! A new bill proposes ELIMINATING capital gains tax on #XRP , Bitcoin, & stocks! Here’s why this is a JOY MOVE for crypto HODLers and investors! #CryptoNews #Florida pic.twitter.com/YMSkN1NYuN — Parrot ︎ ︎ (@ParrotXrp) May 27, 2025 A Crypto Paradise in the Making At the heart of this legislative push is a desire to turn the Sunshine State into a crypto-friendly paradise. With no capital gains tax at the state level, investors would be able to retain significantly more of their profits, whether they are actively trading, holding long-term, or reinvesting in the market. For XRP holders in particular, this could be transformative. XRP’s appeal already stems from its fast, low-cost transactions and it’s expanding real-world use cases, such as Wellgistics’ recent $50 million treasury investment. A state-level tax exemption would amplify these benefits, boosting investor confidence and potentially attracting major new players to Florida’s crypto ecosystem. As Parrot noted, this could supercharge portfolios by allowing HODLers to reinvest more capital into their holdings, leading to bigger potential wins and long-term growth. The Domino Effect: Could Other States Follow? Florida’s bold move doesn’t exist in a vacuum. If the bill is passed, it could ignite a domino effect across the United States, as other states scramble to stay competitive in the battle for crypto talent, investment, and innovation. Crypto advocates have long argued that regulatory clarity and favorable tax conditions are key to unlocking widespread adoption, and Florida’s leadership on this front could set off a race among states to create similar tax havens for digital assets. This is particularly relevant as U.S. crypto policy remains fragmented, with states holding significant leeway in shaping their own tax and business environments. By moving first, Florida positions itself at the forefront of a national conversation that could eventually reshape how cryptocurrencies are treated across America. Governor DeSantis’ Vision for a Blockchain Hub Backing this proposal is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and blockchain innovation. DeSantis has repeatedly emphasized his vision of transforming Florida into a global leader in decentralized technologies, and this bill fits squarely within that ambition. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While some political leaders have taken a cautious or even hostile approach toward crypto, DeSantis has charted a different course, championing policies that invite blockchain developers, crypto entrepreneurs, and investors to set up shop in Florida. By offering clear, pro-innovation rules and a welcoming tax environment, Florida is sending a clear message: come build here. For XRP enthusiasts, that means being part of a fast-growing ecosystem where the potential for innovation, investment, and profit is unmatched. Why This Matters for XRP’s Future The timing of Florida’s move could not be more critical. XRP’s profile has been rising steadily, bolstered by increasing institutional adoption, landmark partnerships, and a series of legal victories that have clarified its regulatory standing in the U.S. Analysts are already forecasting ambitious price targets for leading cryptocurrencies — some projecting Bitcoin could hit $135,000 — and XRP, with its unique position in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions, stands poised to capture significant upside. A tax break at the state level could amplify XRP’s momentum, making it even more attractive to investors and businesses looking for cost-efficient, high-speed settlement solutions. Parrot’s post underscores how Florida’s policy could not only benefit existing HODLers but also draw in fresh capital and talent, helping XRP’s value proposition soar to new heights. While the bill is still under review, the excitement in the crypto community is palpable. Florida’s proposal represents more than just a tax change — it’s a strategic play to reshape the landscape for digital assets, pushing the U.S. toward greater crypto adoption and innovation. For XRP holders and the broader crypto community, this could be a historic turning point. As Parrot urged in his thread, now is the time to engage and support pro-crypto policies and HODL for the long game. Florida is lighting the way — and if the momentum continues, it could redefine the future of crypto across the nation.

Here’s what that means,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"How much Bitcoin is left to mine? Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset. As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin ( BTC ) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply . That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly. The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving . When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%. According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction. This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap , is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining. Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued. Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again. Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto , which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC. This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time. Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost. This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks. As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable. This may lead to several outcomes: Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demand Higher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key management A premium on liquidity , where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply. In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress. What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined? There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that. Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits . The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing. So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives. This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021 , Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations. Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network. In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does. Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees , base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design. Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue. The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone. As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe , where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations. Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-27 15:40:00

The new module, which will go live on May 23, offers a no-code platform for companies to create and issue regulatory-compliant tokens backed by real-world assets. These tokens are built on the ERC-3643 standard, which embeds compliance capabilities directly into the token itself. The new RWA Tokenization platform can be found at https://tokenfi.com/RWA That means issuers can set clear rules, like who can buy or transfer tokens, based on investor type or jurisdiction and those rules are enforced automatically on-chain. At the heart of the platform is ONCHAINID, a smart identity framework that links token ownership to verified investor identities. This allows companies to issue tokens that can only be held or traded by qualified investors who pass KYC and meet regulatory requirements. Wallets become just a signing tool — not the owner. The standard also boasts strong interoperability features. Despite their enhanced compliance capabilities, ERC-3643 tokens remain compatible with existing ERC-20 infrastructure, allowing them to integrate seamlessly into current blockchain ecosystems with minimal technical adjustments. This ensures businesses can leverage established tools while still meeting regulatory requirements. TokenFi’s platform lets issuers manage the entire tokenization process with ease. They can set subscription periods and investment limits, configure fees and payment methods, and handle investor onboarding with built-in KYC and document signing tools. If regulations change, issuers can also update compliance rules even after the tokens are live. The platform works across all EVM-compatible blockchains, giving projects flexibility on where to launch. TokenFi says this approach makes the platform ideal for everything from tokenizing equity and real estate to commodities and IP rights.

Shares of SharpLink Gaming skyrocketed by 468% following the announcement on May 27. As part of this latest move, the company said it plans to adopt Ethereum as its primary treasury reserve asset, marking a landmark moment for crypto’s integration into the balance sheets of public companies. The PIPE agreement includes the purchase of over 69 million shares of common stock at $6.15 per share (or $6.72 for certain management participants), and is expected to close around May 29, 2025, pending customary closing conditions. The capital raise also featured participation from prominent crypto venture firms and ecosystem leaders, including ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, and others. Joseph Lubin to Join Board as Chairman As part of the deal, Joseph Lubin, Founder and CEO of Consensys and Co-Founder of Ethereum, will become Chairman of SharpLink’s Board of Directors upon closing. The collaboration reflects Consensys’ growing push to bring Ethereum deeper into corporate finance strategies, leveraging its ecosystem expertise in decentralized finance, identity, and infrastructure. “This is a significant milestone in SharpLink’s journey and marks an expansion beyond our core business,” said Rob Phythian, Founder and CEO of SharpLink. “On closing, we look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board.” “This is an exciting time for the Ethereum community. I am delighted to work with Rob and the team to bring the Ethereum opportunity to public markets,” said Lubin. ETH Becomes Treasury Reserve Asset Proceeds from the offering will be used to acquire ETH as a long-term treasury reserve, pending general corporate and working capital needs. This makes SharpLink one of the first U.S.-listed companies in the iGaming and sports betting space to commit to Ethereum as a reserve strategy, potentially indicating a broader adoption trend among digital-native companies. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners acted as the sole placement agent for the deal. The securities are being issued via private placement under exemptions from SEC registration and are subject to resale restrictions, with a registration rights agreement in place for future compliance.

The app joins Stripe in handling stablecoins, expanding one of the main use cases for crypto. The payment processing company Worldpay will onboard the stablecoin USDC as one of its payment options for the US and Europe. The USDC token, issued by Circle, is one of the fastest-growing assets in 2025, both in terms of supply and influence on multiple platforms. The adoption of USDC arrives at a time when Circle is preparing for its IPO , solidifying the reputation of USDC as a regulated and widely accepted stablecoin. Worldpay, which was recently acquired by Global Payments Inc., has a yearly turnover of $2.5T. The app is almost catching up with the entire crypto market, handling $3.3T in yearly transactions. Worldpay’s decision to add USDC arrives at a time when stablecoin transfers are trending. Transaction volumes have now surpassed the transfers on VISA and Paypal and far exceed the volume of international remittances. On the payment side, Worldpay will use the services and infrastructure of BVNK. Fireblocks will ensure the connection to the crypto side, potentially using its gasless technology. Fireblocks simplifies crypto payments with fast onboarding for new payment gateways. Previously, Worldpay used VISA’s pilot program to settle USDC payments on the Ethereum chain. USDC remains widely used in payment apps, including crypto-native services from Crypto.com and Coinbase Pay. USDC is still most widely used on Ethereum, though it has spread to new platforms like Sonic. Solana, Base, BSC, and Avalanche remain the chief platforms for on-chain USDC transfers, in addition to the newly introduced Circle Payments Network. The addition of USDC follows its recent adoption through the Stripe payment app. USDC is also growing its presence through Circle’s native Circle Payments Network, officially launched on May 21. Worldpay specializes in targeted money transfers, where businesses need a reliable payment disbursement team. The app is used in online markets to cover seller accounts as well as for freelance payments. The platform already carries 135 fiat currencies. Stablecoins have been mostly used for crypto trading on centralized markets, DEX, as well as for various forms of passive income. Involvement with fintech apps is still rare, with small-scale partnerships testing the viability of payments.

The move comes amid heightened regulatory enforcement under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, which has led to the delisting of USDT ( USDT ) by major exchanges such as Binance and Kraken in the European Economic Area. StablR, a stablecoin issuer focusing on regulatory alignment, will issue the EURR (euro-backed) and USDR (USD-backed) stablecoins. These assets will be tokenized via Tether’s new Hadron platform and are designed to meet MiCA’s requirements, including full asset backing and regular audits, according to a release shared with crypto.news. Oobit, which recently secured $25 million in Series A funding, will integrate these stablecoins into its crypto payments platform. To encourage adoption, Oobit is offering 5% cashback on transactions made with either EURR or USDR. The company reports that 70% of crypto payments in the EU are now being used for everyday goods such as food and basic commodities.

The launch addresses the gap left by the USDT delisting and reflects the increasing demand for compliant alternatives in a stablecoin market valued at over $400 million for euro-backed assets alone as of late 2024. As crypto payments continue to grow in popularity, the partnership between StablR and Oobit signals a shift toward regulated, real-world use cases for digital currencies in Europe.

The Kaito ( KAITO ) token jumped to $2.2367 on Tuesday, May 27, up 227% from its April low. It is now trading at its highest level since March 3, giving the project a market capitalization of $531 million. According to Dune Analytics , Kaito’s platform metrics continue to strengthen. The number of “yappers” has climbed to 200,000, while annualized revenue has surged to over $32 million. Additional data shows that the total value distributed has soared to $72.3 million, up sharply from just $12 million in January.

It has also formed a bullish flag pattern, characterized by a vertical rally followed by a consolidating rectangle. A breakout above the upper side of the flag channel would signal further gains, potentially targeting the record high of $2.9157, approximately 35% above current levels.

The focus is on whether Quant , Jupiter , and Injective can keep up their impressive run. This article dives into their latest performances and breaks down what might be behind their upward trends. Readers will explore if these coins are set for continued growth. Quant's Bullish Price Action and Key Levels Over the past month, Quant 's price surged by nearly 39%, and its six-month gain of around 11% indicates steady growth. Price fluctuations between $63 and $82 established a dynamic backdrop, contributing to significant momentum. Recent increases highlight a clearly defined upward trend that builds confidence among traders. Current levels show resistance at about $89, with additional hurdles at $108, while solid support holds near $51. Bulls appear to lead, bolstered by a rising momentum indicator and an RSI level of 67. Traders may consider buying near support and targeting profit areas near resistance as the market continues to favor an upward trend. Jupiter's Recent Rally Amid Long-Term Decline Jupiter surged by over 26% in the past month, indicating a brief recovery from a significant downturn, where it dropped nearly 46% over the last six months. This stark contrast in performance highlights the volatility of the market, driven by shifting investor sentiments. The recent rebound may indicate a potential turning point for Jupiter, drawing renewed interest from traders who previously observed weakness. Currently, Jupiter is trading near a support level of $0.21, with resistance situated at $0.63 and an alternate cap at $0.84. The market shows mixed signals, with a relative strength index indicating bullish sentiment, yet overall caution remains prevalent. Traders might view this support level as an opportunity to enter positions, particularly while waiting for a decisive breakout above the resistance level. Injective Price Surge and Long-Term Volatility Past month gains reached nearly 37% with a weekly boost of about 19%. However, the six-month performance slid by over 50%, highlighting a sharp short-term recovery amid long-term decline. Volatility is evident in both timeframes, as recent rallies contrast sharply with a significant downturn seen over half a year. INJ current prices fall between roughly $7 and $11, with resistance around $13 and $17, while support holds near $4.60 and $0.43. Bulls are active in the short term amid upward pushes, yet the mixed medium-term picture suggests the trend is not firmly established. Trading within these support and resistance zones provides opportunities for careful entries and exits. Conclusion QNT , JUP , and INJ have shown impressive growth over the past week. Each token has its unique strengths and recent developments highlight their potential. The question remains whether this momentum can continue. Market trends and upcoming announcements will play crucial roles. The focus now is on watching these assets closely to see if they can sustain their upward trajectory.

This accumulation trend has made SOL one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025, as whale wallets show increased activity on-chain. As crypto whale accumulation often precedes explosive moves, many believe Solana could outperform other layer-1 networks in the next bull run. While SOL remains a top crypto to invest in now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seeing a surge in demand due to its low entry price and DeFi-focused roadmap. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are available at $0.03 per token in phase 5 of its presale. The project has already raised over $9.3 million and has attracted more than 11,500 holders. Phase 6 prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035 and holders joining at this stage stand a 100% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Solana Price Prediction 2025: Whale Accumulation Signals Possible Breakout to $500 Large investors in the cryptocurrency world are closely watching Solana (SOL), as it has seen a lot of notable transfers in recent days which usually happens before the prices rise. Though Solana’s current price is $166, its fast transactions, high number of developers and strong presence in meme coins and DeFi have kept it on top in the layer-1 space. According to some analysts, thanks to more investment groups becoming interested and the market being better, Solana’s price might climb to about $500 in the middle of 2025. Because whale investments in Solana go on boosting, it’s possible that Solana will flourish and prevail when the market rebounds. Mutuum Finance Presale The project maintains an increasing momentum since it has raised over $9.3 million in investments and now boasts over 11,500 investors. The $0.03 Phase 5 token price provides investors with a limited window considering that an upcoming 16.67% price hike delineates the termination of early investment entry. Investors in Phase 5 who enter during the presale period can achieve 100% ROI because the token has established a listing price of $0.06. With the growth of the decentralized marketplace, Mutuum Finance is leading the way with its novel lending model and favorable market positioning. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System By using Mutuum Finance, individuals can access more assets and enjoy greater amounts of transparency and control through the P2C and P2P methods they include. To earn passive income in P2C, users add stablecoins to pools held by smart contracts which constantly adjusts rates to give users more benefits while lowering the interest paid on loans. Through P2P, lending can be completed without middlemen, allowing for total freedom in rules and paperwork. This approach helps people borrow easily, quickly and transparently. USD-Pegged Stablecoin and Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin will soon be launched on Ethereum and it will be fully pegged to the US-Dollar. This system’s structure is designed to avoid the difficulties that similar systems faced with algorithmic stability. Because of open-source smart contracts and a successful Certik audit, Mutuum Finance ensures all its financial transactions are reliable. Using innovative lending services and solid infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is preparing for what’s next in decentralized finance. Crypto whales are betting big on Solana, and now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $9.3M raised and 11,500+ investors already in, MUTM’s $0.03 Phase 5 presale price offers a 100% ROI opportunity before it lists at $0.06. Backed by a completed Certik audit, a powerful dual lending model, and an upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, MUTM is gaining serious traction. Don’t miss out, join the presale today before the price jumps 16.67% in Phase 6.

On May 26, 2025, Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor explained why the company would not disclose its addresses. As of May 27, after the latest $427 million purchase, Strategy claims to hold 580,250 bitcoins. On several occasions, Michael Saylor suggested that Strategy would not sell any of its bitcoins. The lack of full disclosure of Strategy’s addresses raises doubts among skeptics about whether the company fully adheres to Saylor’s words and holds the exact amount it claims to own. Some of them repeatedly demanded that Saylor show the addresses, but he never did. Finally, he took eight minutes to explain why Strategy wouldn’t do that. Aren’t Strategy’s addresses already well-known? Arkham Intelligence reported in January 2025 that it had identified 96% of Strategy’s Bitcoin addresses and published them. The company didn’t confirm if these addresses actually belong to it. Approximately 4% of the BTC funds in Strategy are not located at any of these addresses. Given the BTC price, this tiny particle is a multi-billion-dollar loophole that raises concerns among strategy skeptics who want Strategy to make a full disclosure of addresses. Read more: Will Michael Saylor pull the rug? How does Saylor explain the reluctance to show Strategy’s addresses? In a speech published on X on May 27, Saylor admits that Mt. Gox and FTX were the hard lessons, but he believes that “the current conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves.” According to Saylor, disclosure of public addresses simultaneously jeopardizes several groups of stakeholders: the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges, and the investors. “It’s like publishing the address and the bank accounts of all your kids and [the] phone numbers of all your kids and then thinking somehow that makes your family better.” While Strategy’s holdings, one’s kids are not subjected to investments by third parties, Saylor continued to elaborate on why he sees publishing proof of reserves as not secure. It’s safe to say that in his speech, Saylor distanced Strategy from Bitcoin purists, emphasizing that Strategy is a publicly traded company and its investors are institutional investors while the demand to reveal the wallets is rather something dictated by a Bitcoin maximalist logic. The Strategy chair says that in contrast to proof of liabilities, safe proof of reserves is simply impossible. He recommended all the Bitcoin maxis to hold bitcoins in self-custody instead of relying on Strategy. For securities investors, he says, it’s safer to rely on proof of assets and proof of liabilities, and “the best practice is not to publish the wallet.” It is the responsibility of the Big Four auditors to ensure the solvency and soundness of the company. The data should be confirmed on multiple levels, including by the custodians and the exchanges. In the case of Strategy, the audits are conducted by KPMG LLP , a Big Four audit company. Furthermore, he emphasized that as an American company, Strategy cannot lie about its finances, as its personnel would face jail time due to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which protects investors from inaccurate disclosures and statements. Saylor added that in the future, he may implement zero-knowledge proof of reserves that would not reveal the wallet addresses publicly. However, this possibility won’t free Strategy from confirming all the data independently by the involved parties and Big Four auditors. According to Saylor, the lesson learned from the failures of FTX and Mt. Gox was not that the missing proof of reserves is bad, but rather not to do business with “shaky offshore exchanges run by juvenile tweakers.” Saylor finished his speech by saying that the wallets, once they are published, are “the intact vector for hackers, nation-state actors, every type of troll imaginable. It creates so much liability that you should think twice before you do it.” However, Saylor admitted that there is nothing wrong with publishing addresses at a small level. It is unclear whether Bitwise, whose BTC addresses are disclosed, is on a small scale, according to Saylor’s opinion. Somehow, Bitwise manages to maintain transparency and safety simultaneously. However, there is no other such big company holding bitcoins. In this regard, Bitwise is the only corporation to do so, and others don’t follow in its footsteps. Public reaction Some found Saylor’s speech convincing, while others saw it as just a baseless excuse to hide the shady operations. Seemingly responding to Saylor’s speech, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao jokingly tweeted, “he probably sold bitcoins.” CZ is too scared to tag the @, but we all know he's subtweeting @saylor https://t.co/s98EFov6tB — Pledditor (@Pledditor) May 27, 2025 The skeptics believe that Bitcoin wallets are unhackable. Therefore, Saylor has no good excuse for not publishing proof of reserves. People who defend the Strategy chair’s stance claim that, as the disclosure involves several parties, there is a risk of key leaks at some level, so disclosing the wallets is not secure. It’s the same process that all of the Coinbase info leaks follow: 1) identify owner of address 2) dust attack and track address movements 3) correlate address to individuals 4) social engineering attack and/or wrench attack Nobody who’s lost coin to theft actually had Bitcoin… — William Graham (@williamgrahamiv) May 27, 2025 If hackers associate the addresses of Strategy with certain institutions, they may use social engineering or other sophisticated tactics to obtain private keys. Trust in Strategy continues to an extent to which we can trust public companies. As Saylor puts it, if you like to have full control over addresses, it is vital to hold bitcoins yourself.

As the cryptocurrency market reacts to these fluctuations, analysts find themselves divided on BTC’s price future trajectory. Bitcoin Could Hit New ATH Of $113,000 This Week Market expert Doctor Profit took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to reaffirm his bullish stance, citing the recent occurrence of a “Golden Cross”—a technical indicator that has historically signaled significant price increases. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic With an accuracy rate of 87.8% on higher time frames, the Golden Cross has flashed only twice in the past two years and has now reappeared. Doctor Profit emphasized its rarity, stating, “This is a rare and powerful signal that deserves serious attention.” The expert pointed out during his analysis that the previous instances when the Golden Cross appeared resulted in remarkable price surges: in October 2023, Bitcoin jumped from $27,000 to $73,000, representing a 170% gain, and in October 2024, it rose from $63,000 to $109,000, marking a 73% increase. The expert now anticipates that the Bitcoin price could reach a new all-time high of $113,000 this very same week, citing substantial liquidity in that area and robust momentum in the market. Potential Bull Trap In BTC Additionally, Doctor Profit highlighted the significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are nine times greater than the amount of Bitcoin being mined. He also pointed to Strategy’s (previously MicroStrategy) ongoing accumulation of Bitcoin with a new purchase made on Monday by the company, suggesting that this trend is constraining supply and creating opportunities for further price appreciation. In contrast, fellow analyst Cameron Fous expressed a more cautious outlook on X, suggesting that the current price may represent the peak of the 2025 bull run. He referenced historical price patterns from the previous bull market, asserting that Bitcoin’s recent performance could resemble a “bull trap,” where prices see a sharp decline after reaching a peak. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? Fous indicated that signs of a potential reversal could be forming, especially if Bitcoin breaks below the 50-day moving average (MA). Despite his caution, he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still rally to between $130,000 and $200,000 in the short term. He emphasized that while the market remains bullish, top signals often precede trend reversals and cautioned that past behavior should inform present decisions, as market dynamics can shift rapidly. When writing, the market’s largest cryptocurrency is trading at approximately $108,739, registering a slight 0.6% retrace in the 24-hour time frame. In total, BTC has retraced little over 3% from its all-time high reached last week.

Once primarily known for electrical equipment , these firms have successfully pivoted to supplying critical components such as power systems, cooling solutions, and server cabinets, capitalizing on the rapid expansion of AI technologies. The jump is even more striking in some cases since ChatGPT was introduced in November, with shares up over 60% at Siemens AG in Germany, for example. European powerhouses fuel AI’s backbone as data center demand surges Eu ropean companies, makers of everything from switches to smart meters, supply the servers and infrastructure that power data centers behind advanced language models and cloud computing. Traditional electrical equipment firms like Legrand have recently doubled data center sales. In the wake of this success, the chief financial officer of Legrand, Franck Lemery, said that, unlike Microsoft and Meta, they were not putting $70 or $80 billion on the table. He continued, “[But] we [provide] the components, and our business is growing relative to that [spending].” Meanwhile, an analyst at Dell’Oro, Alex Cordovil, also expressed his view on the subject. He mentioned that American companies dominate a significant part of AI. However, Cordovil raised some exceptions. According to him, most of the infrastructure is controlled by European companies regarding nuts and bolts. It is worth noting that although the companies provide power to homes and industrial groups, data centers have emerged as their fastest-growing source of income due to their heavy computing demands, like those used in AI models, and needs from gaming, cloud services, and streaming. This concentration in data centers has also left them vulnerable to big changes in their stock prices. A notable market downturn occurred earlier this year, triggered by the introduction the large Chinese language model DeepSearch, which its developers say was trained with less processing power. Cordovil also added that investors were concerned about the constraints on power grids and supply While these fears have some worried, there is a longer-term trend of growing demand for data processing, according to Cordovil. He speculated that data center investments will be more than $1 trillion by 2028, from nearly $600 billion in 2025. Lemery mentioned that all this uncertainty was relative. He said they were very confident in their portfolio’s potential, emphasizing that the only way out was to deal with these ups and downs. Generac bets big on AI boom with $130M push into data center power market Generac Holdings Inc., a manufacturing company of backup power generation products for residential, light commercial, and industrial markets based in America, is another example of a firm that showed interest in investing in data centers. On May 14, the company announced plans to invest approximately $130 million into new equipment and a factory to produce larger backup generators for big computing centers that run artificial intelligence applications, according to Chief Executive Officer Aaron Jagdfeld. During an interview, Jagdfeld mentioned that the company recently made its first international shipments of these larger generators to clients in data centers. He added that they had a strong pipeline of activity apart from that. The significant increase in power demand from AI and new factories has drawn Generac to enter the data center market. This level of demand has not been seen in at least a generation, and some predictions suggest it could grow at a pace not experienced since the 1950s. However, there is no guarantee this high demand will actually happen. This is because the expected demand for energy will be further reduced if more effective models, such as the one proposed by DeepSeek AI, are employed. Microsoft Corp. also has slowed some global data center rollouts as it rethinks its approach. As a result, the new projects have their restrictions.

Alongside MAGACOIN, market leaders like Solana (SOL), Bitcoin (BTC), and TRUMP (Trump Media and Technology Group) are making headlines—but none offer the explosive presale upside that MAGACOIN FINANCE does, combining audited contracts, a hyper-engaged community, and clear tokenomics for maximum growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Growth and Community Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised over $8 million in presale, with analysts projecting up to 18,500% ROI in some models—though a conservative consensus points to 12,500% growth potential. Its scarcity-driven model, audited smart contracts, and strong community engagement are fueling investor confidence and positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as the breakout altcoin of 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Solana (SOL): Ecosystem Strength and Upcoming Integrations SOL is trading around $172, with new integrations and rising DeFi volume signaling continued momentum. Analysts suggest SOL could outperform rivals like BNB and XRP, with a potential 90% rally as adoption and staking surge. While SOL offers robust upside, its growth is more gradual compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale projections. Bitcoin (BTC): Record Highs and Institutional Demand BTC recently smashed past $111,000, setting a new all-time high and confirming the bull market. Analysts expect BTC to test $112,000–$115,000, but further gains from current levels would represent only a 10–35% upside—far below MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale return potential. TRUMP (Trump Media and Technology Group): Major Crypto Ambitions Trump Media is seeking to raise $3 billion to invest in crypto assets, with plans to launch a financial services platform focused on crypto and exchange-traded funds. This move signals growing institutional interest in crypto, but TRUMP’s direct return potential for investors remains uncertain compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale growth. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts While SOL, BTC, and TRUMP remain strong market leaders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top opportunity for outsized gains in 2025.

A recent post by crypto researcher ""Ripple Van Winkle"" triggered fresh discussion among XRP holders. He argued that if XRP were to rise to $12 and then drop to $6, retail investors might panic. However, he believes smart money would see it as a golden opportunity to accumulate.This commentary suggests that $6 could become the new support level around which XRP consolidates after a monumental run into the double digits. While retail investors may focus on the 50% drop in value, Winkle believes others would see it as a discounted entry point.His proposition gained traction, sparking optimism and caution among members of the XRP community.When XRP ATH, Let Alone $12?X user Jenny Lemaire acknowledged Winkle’s perspective but raised concerns about the time it would take for XRP to reach $12.Notably, XRP has been trading below its all-time high for seven and a half years. The prospect of setting a new high seems more likely than ever this year. Yet the wait continues. Amid this uncertainty, some XRP proponents are already entertaining a future where the asset trades in double digits.Meanwhile, another commenter argued that XRP is no longer retail-driven and that most people still don’t grasp the full scale of what’s coming. This view leans on the belief that XRP’s momentum is now powered by institutional forces, which may prevent such a dramatic dip from $12 to $6.Veteran Holders Voice FrustrationHowever, X user Randhir Gangsi tempered the heated optimism around XRP reaching $12. He pointed out that XRP continues to trade between $2.30 and $2.45, suggesting that price speculation should take a backseat until XRP achieves a new all-time high.For him, price should follow adoption. So far, he noted, adoption-related news has not translated into price movement.Long-time investor Marc expressed a similar sentiment. He reflected on waiting over eight years for XRP to regain its all-time high and admitted that if XRP reaches $6, he likely wouldn’t have any holdings left to sell at $12. His comment suggests he would have taken profits and bid farewell to the market, worn out from holding through losses across multiple past cycles.Essentially, the community is divided as XRP continues to hover around the $2 mark. Some anticipate explosive growth, while others urge caution against premature price speculation amid continued underperformance. XRP community reactions to the $12 forecast amid low levels But When Can XRP Reach $12?Numerous analysts in the crypto community have suggested the possibility of XRP surpassing $10 this year. However, industry research from notable firms like Bitwise suggests it may take longer.In its report , Bitwise suggests that the earliest XRP could reach $12 is 2028, under ultra-bull market conditions. Should that fail to materialize, the outlook shifts toward 2030.

The market is currently in a state of anticipation, waiting for fresh demand or supply to define the next major move. Despite the pause, the broader outlook continues to favour a bullish continuation. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Bitcoin is currently navigating through a consolidation phase beneath its recently established all-time high of $111K, indicating a slowdown in bullish momentum following the breakout above the former ATH at $109K. The market is showing signs of indecision, awaiting a fresh wave of demand to reignite the uptrend. Despite the modest pullback to the $109K region, now acting as support, the lack of strong buying activity suggests that the bulls are cautious. For BTC’s price to resume its upward trajectory and reach the critical psychological level of $120K, increased participation from buyers is essential. Conversely, if the price fails to hold above the $109K breakout level, it may trigger a more significant correction, potentially targeting the $100K support zone. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin continues to respect an ascending channel structure, consistently forming higher lows and higher highs. Following its rejection from the $111K resistance zone, the price retreated to the lower boundary of the channel near $106K, where it found temporary support and rebounded slightly. The market currently reflects a state of balance between bulls and bears, suggesting that further consolidation may occur in the short term. A breakdown below the channel support could open the door for a sharper decline toward the $100K range. However, as long as the structure remains intact, BTC is more likely to oscillate between the lower trendline and the $111K resistance, building pressure for an eventual decisive breakout that will define the next major move. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis Despite reaching a new all-time high at $111K, a wave of profit-taking is typically expected. Particularly if long-term holders start to sell, it could trigger a significant correction. To evaluate whether this cohort is distributing, the Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric serves as a key indicator. Historically, each major peak in Bitcoin’s price during previous bullish cycles has been accompanied by sharp spikes in this metric, reflecting the movement of long-dormant coins to exchanges, often signaling that long-term holders are offloading their assets. However, this current rally paints a different picture. Despite the price climbing to a new high, the Exchange Inflow CDD has remained subdued. This lack of activity from seasoned holders suggests that they are not yet participating in profit-taking and instead continue to hold their coins with conviction. This behavior underscores strong confidence in the continuation of the uptrend, with expectations for even higher price targets in this cycle. As long as this group remains inactive and does not exert significant sell pressure, the path remains open for Bitcoin to push toward new highs in the mid-term.

MetaMask users are finally able to transfer to keep their Solana (SOL) assets in their wallet. On Tuesday, May 27, MetaMask officially added support for the Solana network on its web browser extension. This means that users will be able to hold SOL and Solana-based tokens in the wallet. While the Solana network is not yet available on the MetaMask mobile app, mobile support is expected “in a few weeks,” according to the company. MetaMask also announced plans to expand support for additional networks not powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine. “Solana is just the start.

With this update, they can now access and manage all supported assets from MetaMask. That said, not all Solana users are expected to immediately switch to MetaMask.

45164421,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68690,1748362088,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Big Amendment Coming to XRP Ledger NFT Ecosystem. Here’s when,https://timestabloid.com/big-amendment-coming-to-xrp-ledger-nft-ecosystem-heres-when/,"In an exciting development for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the broader NFT ecosystem, a significant amendment called DynamicNFT is poised to bring revolutionary changes. According to a recent post by Vet, the amendment has garnered 29 Yea votes, securing its place in a two-week activation period, set to take effect on June 9, 2025, at 21:33:00 UTC. This is a milestone in the XRPL’s NFT capabilities and promises to unlock new opportunities for innovation within the blockchain space. The DynamicNFT amendment allows for the creation of mutable NFTs on the XRP Ledger. Unlike traditional NFTs, which are typically static once minted, DynamicNFTs introduce a level of flexibility. These NFTs can evolve and retain an on-chain record, enabling real-time updates and modifications. This flexibility opens up an array of exciting use cases, ranging from gaming to supply chain management, where NFTs could track items or levels, and even facilitate dynamic changes to the digital assets representing characters or products. The Impact on the NFT Space This proposed change is transformative for the NFT landscape on the XRP Ledger . With 29 Yea votes and 6 Nays, the amendment has garnered strong support, showing that the community is ready for a new era of dynamic and adaptable digital assets. The ability to update and modify NFTs directly on-chain could pave the way for more innovative uses of NFTs, far beyond just collectibles or static art. In the gaming industry, for instance, NFTs could represent characters that level up based on player progress. These evolving NFTs would serve as both a representation of in-game achievements and a method for tracking progression. Players could see the NFT dynamically change as they advance through a game, adding an immersive layer to the experience. Additionally, DynamicNFTs could have a significant role in supply chain tracking. Imagine an NFT tied to a physical product that evolves as it moves through different stages of production, distribution, and sale. This would allow for a transparent, real-time, and immutable record of the product’s journey, making it easier for consumers and businesses to verify authenticity and track product history. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Vision for the Future The arrival of this amendment is set to elevate the XRPL ecosystem and position it as a frontrunner in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology. As the world’s first digital ledger designed to facilitate fast and low-cost cross-border payments, XRPL is already a powerful tool in the financial sector. With DynamicNFTs, the ledger’s use case extends far beyond finance, reaching into new territory with real-time updates and interactivity for NFTs. The activation date for this change is still over a year away, but the excitement is palpable. By enabling these features, the XRP Ledger is on track to expand its offerings and establish itself as a premier platform for a wide range of digital asset use cases. The support for this amendment shows that the community believes in the potential of DynamicNFTs and is ready to embrace this new frontier in blockchain technology. In conclusion, the upcoming DynamicNFT amendment marks a pivotal moment for the XRP Ledger’s NFT ecosystem. By allowing NFTs to be mutable and tracked on-chain, it opens up new possibilities that could revolutionize industries like gaming, supply chain management, and more.

By 2025, the country has shifted toward a more regulated and voluntary framework for cryptocurrency , balancing innovation with international financial obligations and domestic realities.

The focus shifts from mandated usage to voluntary adoption and compliance . February 2025: New Amendments Rolled Out Bitcoin use in paying taxes and government fees was banned. The state is no longer obligated to support Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin remains voluntary legal tender, i.e., permitted but not mandatory. January 2025: Bitcoin Legal Tender Status Revoked The Legislative Assembly voted to substantially rescind the Bitcoin Law . Businesses are no longer legally required to accept Bitcoin. Government’s official Bitcoin wallet, Chivo , was phased out. Key Crypto Regulation Milestones in El Salvador Date Event/Update June 2021 Bitcoin Law announced and passed, making BTC legal tender September 2021 Bitcoin Law takes effect; Chivo wallet launched 2021–2024 Continued government promotion, mining initiatives, and international criticism December 2024 IMF loan deal agreed, requiring rollback of Bitcoin’s legal tender status What the Government and Regulators Are Saying National Commission for Digital Assets (CNAD): The main regulatory authority, CNAD oversees licensing, compliance, and enforcement for digital assets, aiming to foster innovation while ensuring financial integrity. Central Reserve Bank (BCR): Supervises crypto activities, enforces anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards, and registers Bitcoin service providers. Government Position: President Bukele and regulators emphasize building a transparent, compliant, and internationally connected crypto ecosystem, even as direct state involvement in Bitcoin is reduced. Crypto Tax 2025 For Investors/Traders: No capital gains tax on Bitcoin transactions, making El Salvador highly attractive for individual crypto investors. For Crypto Companies: Firms benefit from substantial tax exemptions, especially if revenue is generated outside El Salvador. However, compliance with AML, KYC, and reporting standards is mandatory. Reporting: Both individuals and companies must maintain records and report to CNAD and the Ministry of Finance as part of annual financial statements 1 . Crypto Adoption Rate in El Salvador Public adoption remains low, with user penetration at 3.34% in early 2025. The number of active users is expected to reach over 214,000 by year-end, but most Salvadorans do not use Bitcoin for daily transactions. The government is working on new initiatives to boost crypto utility and public perception. Country’s Government Crypto Holdings As of 2025, the Salvadoran government holds approximately 6,100 Bitcoins, valued at over $639 million, with continued purchases planned despite the policy rollback. These holdings are managed as part of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund. Crypto Mining in El Salvador El Salvador has promoted Bitcoin mining using geothermal energy from volcanoes, positioning itself as a pioneer in sustainable crypto mining 5 . The state-owned geothermal company LaGeo operates mining facilities powered by 100% clean, emission-free volcanic energy, with a capacity of up to 95 MW5. In Q1 2025, Bitfinex Securities announced plans to launch the Blockstream Mining Note 2 (BMN2) in El Salvador, further expanding institutional mining activities in the country 7 . The government continues to support mining as part of its broader digital assets strategy, leveraging renewable resources to attract global investment and innovation. Conclusion El Salvador’s approach to cryptocurrency in 2025 is defined by regulatory maturity and strategic adaptation. While Bitcoin is no longer mandatory as legal tender, the government maintains a crypto-friendly, tax-exempt environment and continues to invest in both Bitcoin holdings and sustainable mining initiatives. The regulatory focus has shifted to compliance, transparency, and international cooperation, positioning El Salvador as a unique hub for digital asset innovation in Latin America. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

If volume supports the breakout, ETH could rally toward $4,000 in the next impulsive move. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) current price action is forming a bullish continuation pattern just below the $2,700 resistance level. The market has shown strength following a recent swing low, and price is compressing into a high-conviction breakout setup. The structure suggests growing momentum, but confirmation will depend on how price reacts at this major level. Key technical points $2,700 Resistance Level: ETH is consolidating just beneath this horizontal resistance, which has held for weeks. Ascending Triangle Formation: Bullish pattern formed by higher lows pushing into a flat resistance line. Bullish Market Structure: Consecutive higher highs and higher lows remain intact, signaling strength. ETHUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Ethereum’s price action has been consolidating under the $2,700 mark for the past few weeks. This zone is significant because there is limited historical resistance above it, opening the door for a swift expansion toward the $4,000 region. The current ascending triangle pattern, formed by rising lows pushing into a flat resistance, is typically associated with bullish continuation. This structure echoes previous Ethereum breakout setups, where prolonged compression under key resistance levels preceded sharp directional moves. Historically, ETH tends to build pressure over time before releasing it in high-momentum breakouts. Notably, sellers have repeatedly failed to drive price below the trendline, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Ongoing accumulation near resistance often signals that smart money is positioning ahead of a larger move. You might also like: Trump Media to buy $2.5b Bitcoin, creating one of crypto’s largest corporate treasuries A critical signal to monitor is volume. The declining volume during consolidation suggests the market is coiling, preparing for expansion. However, volume must return at the breakout to validate the move. A breakout attempt on weak volume would raise the risk of a fakeout or bull trap. That said, the strength of the recent impulse from the swing low supports the view that a significant bottom has been set. Structurally, Ethereum remains bullish. Price continues to make consistent higher lows, with no signs of a bearish reversal. The trend is intact, and the longer ETH holds this ascending formation, the greater the probability of a breakout. What to expect in the coming price action If ETH maintains its ascending structure and breaks above $2,700 with strong volume, it could trigger a sharp move toward $4,000. Until then, the ongoing consolidation remains bullish and constructive, signaling strength, not weakness.

Despite growing optimism, falling activity on Shibarium raises concerns about user engagement, with some experts suggesting that real utility and adoption on the network are crucial for SHIB’s sustained growth. Is SHIB the Right Horse? The popular X user Del Crxpto recently praised Shiba Inu (SHIB) for becoming “one of the most complex tech investments in crypto.” That said, he suggested that those who take the time to learn this “ will win .” SHIB has indeed emerged from a meme coin into a growing ecosystem in the past few years. Some of the features include the launch of the decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, the introduction of the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium, the development of gaming elements, and more. Del Crxpto is not the only one who recently spoke favorably about Shiba Inu. Earlier this month, X user Henry described the meme coin as a gem with “100x potential.” The analyst predicted a “huge pump which is going to break all the past levels ATH and will be at least 790% .” Other bullish industry participants include SHIB KNIGHT and CW. The former observed the recent price charts of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin to opine that the “bottom is in” and “both are destined to moon .” CW argued that SHIB is in the process of forming a bull flag pattern, envisioning a rally if the valuation breaks to the upside. “And this rise is likely to continue to the $0.000022 level where there is a selling wall,” they concluded. What are Indicators Signaling? Some important metrics support the bull case thesis outlined by the aforementioned analysts . Over the past week, the SHIB exchange netflows have been predominantly negative, suggesting that investors may have shifted from centralized platforms to self-custody methods. This , in turn, reduces the immediate selling pressure. SHIB Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant On the other hand, there are some bearish factors. For instance, Shibarium’s activity has stalled lately, with daily transactions plunging from millions throughout the past few months to roughly 141,000 on May 25 and less than 100,000 on May 26. This suggests a reduced network engagement and diminished interest from investors, which could possibly have a negative impact on SHIB’s valuation. According to some industry participants, the further advancement of Shibarium ( which officially debuted in August 2023 ) is an essential element that could contribute to a bull run for the meme coin. One of those is the Bitcoin advocate Jeremie Davinci, who said : “I like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically , it’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet . If they get that solved, Shiba Inu will go to the moon.” The post Learn About Shiba Inu (SHIB) And You Will Win, Says Analyst appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|SHIBBTC|SHIBUSD|Shiba Inu (SHIB),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-27 16:10:07

The deal is part of Cantor’s $2 billion Bitcoin financing initiative, which also included a facility for FalconX. The program aims to provide institutional leverage against Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings, reviving confidence in crypto lending after collapses like Celsius and BlockFi in 2022. “This financing facility through Cantor enables Maple to accelerate its growth and expand its reach as a provider of digital asset credit,” said Sidney Powell, CEO and Co-Founder of Maple, in a note to crypto.news. The company positions itself as a crypto-native asset manager with institutional experience, targeting rising demand for regulated crypto credit access.

Anchorage Digital served as custodian on the Maple Finance ( SYRUP ) transaction, ensuring regulated settlement and storage of the Bitcoin collateral. Crypto-backed lending markets are showing signs of recovery, with total outstanding loans rebounding to $36.5 billion by Q4 2024, up from a post-crash low but still under the 2021 peak of $64.4 billion, according to Galaxy Research.

Priced at $2.31 today, Ripple is still growing and showing the potential of decentralized finance for cross border transactions. But as the market evolves new projects are capturing the attention of investors who are looking for the next big thing in blockchain. According to one early Ripple supporter Ruvi AI (RUVI) is the altcoin to watch in 2025 . Positioned at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain Ruvi AI is making waves as it combines cutting edge innovation with real world application. Why Ruvi AI stands out Ruvi AI is not just another cryptocurrency it’s an ambitious project that combines artificial intelligence capabilities with the security and transparency of blockchain. Specifically Ruvi AI aims to enhance industries like healthcare, logistics and finance by providing AI powered solutions through a decentralized tamper proof system. Ruvi AI’s value proposition is its ability to handle massive datasets and deliver actionable insights in lightning speed all while maintaining high levels of privacy and security. Its seamless integration of these two technologies sets the stage to tackle the big challenges in industries that need precision and scalability. The platform has already reached some key milestones that has boosted confidence in its long term potential. Most notably Ruvi AI’s Beta platform is live and users can try it out. Ruvi AI has also secured its first exchange listing and plans to roll out more partnerships and listings in the coming months to make it more accessible to investors globally. A success driven presale Investors have already taken notice of Ruvi AI’s potential as seen in its highly successful presale . During Phase 1 Ruvi AI tokens were offered at $0.01 and sold out in 2 weeks. Early participants in this phase have seen their token value increase by 50% as the project moves to Phase 2 and tokens are now priced at $0.015 . Current predictions is that Ruvi AI will be $1 shortly after listing. This massive potential for growth combined with reward tiers that incentivize early participation has attracted smart investors to jump in. Unbeatable investment opportunity Ruvi AI is an attractive option for those looking for a high growth altcoin. Here’s what a $750 investment in Ruvi AI during Phase 2 will get you: At the current price of $0.015 per token a $750 investment qualifies for the VIP 2 bonus and will get you: Tokens purchased: 50,000 Bonus tokens (40%): 20,000 Total tokens: 70,000 At Ruvi AI’s confirmed listing price of $0.07 this investment will be worth $4,900 . If Ruvi AI reaches $1 the same tokens will be worth $70,000 . This is in contrast to many established cryptocurrencies where growth is incremental not exponential. Larger Contributions, Bigger Rewards For those who want to increase their exposure Ruvi AI offers additional VIP bonuses to maximize returns: VIP 3 (100,000 Tokens): This $1,500 investment comes with a 60% bonus and will get you 160,000 total tokens . At $0.07 this investment is worth $11,200 . If Ruvi AI reaches $1 it’s worth $160,000 . VIP 5 (500,000 Tokens): With a $7,500 investment you’ll double your holdings with a 100% bonus and get 1,000,000 tokens . At $0.07 this investment is worth $70,000 and at $1 it’s worth $1,000,000 . Shaping Industries and Growth Potential Ruvi AI isn’t just about token economics it’s about leading the wave of innovation. By using AI to deliver predictive analytics and smart solutions industries can improve processes and reduce inefficiencies. For example in healthcare AI powered diagnostics can improve patient outcomes while advanced logistics algorithms can optimize supply chains. This focus on practical applications means Ruvi AI isn’t limited by the constraints of speculative crypto projects. It’s about solving today’s problems with tomorrow’s technology so it will be relevant and valuable for years to come. The Future of Blockchain with Ruvi AI If you saw the potential in Ripple early on Ruvi AI is similar. Both projects emerged at a critical time in crypto and both have a vision to change the game.

At mid-afternoon in Europe the token hovered at $0.228, nearly 12% below its May 11 peak and nursing modest intraday losses. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone Reviewing the daily chart, the analyst rewound to the explosive move that began on May 8 and produced a 50% three-session surge: “Last time we checked in over here on May 8, when we got this big green candle, we said, guys, looks like we’re kicking off our fifth microwave here,” he reminded viewers. His initial upside projection had been a modest 2.36 Fibonacci extension, yet Dogecoin “actually went up much higher,” a sign, he added, of strong retail momentum but also of a pattern that now looks finished. Quantum Ascent has since migrated his wave counts to show that the thrust was merely the fifth sub-wave inside a larger first-wave advance. “We’re in the middle of an ABC as we speak… these blue waves are going to move over to here,” he said, redrawing the labels to mark the ongoing retracement. In Elliott-wave parlance the C-leg must at least equal the A-leg, and the presenter converted that rule into arithmetic: “Eighteen-point-eight per cent from there… that’s one of our targets, right around 20.5 cents.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic Deeper penetration is not only possible but statistically common, he argued, because “oftentimes it makes it down into this third or fourth wave.” Measuring from the early-May low to the mid-May top, he plotted the 0.500, 0.618 and 0.702 retracements — a band stretching roughly from 19.5 cents to 17 cents — and called it “the logical zone for a first-and-second-wave reset.” A shallower halt at the 0.382, around 21.8 cents, would in his view be “a pretty shallow correction.” One attempt to break higher has already stalled in what he labelled the “danger zone” between the 0.618 and 0.786 retracements: “We took a stab to break through, but we didn’t close… we wicked above it, ended up right there at the 702, the rejection, and now it’s kind of rolling over again.” That failure leaves a nearby trigger level: “We break this low here at 21 cents, then we’re for sure seeing 20.5 cents.” The tape action, he added, resembles a Wyckoff re-accumulation structure: “Looks like honestly a form of Wyckoff and we’re building the sign of strength right here before we take off.” Yet the bullish pay-off, if it comes, likely lies several weeks ahead. The correction underway marks “a macro two that we’re working on right now,” he said, emphasising that the subsequent third wave would be decisive: “Macro wave threes — those are the daddies. Those are the big ones. That’s where we’re really going to get some juice.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens Macro context tempers any near-term enthusiasm. Bitcoin — whose own fifth-wave top arrived sooner and overshot its prior cycle high — has already rolled into an ABC of its own, and Quantum Ascent expects altcoins to “settle down” alongside the bellwether. “Whether it goes quickly in a C-wave or we just kind of keep meandering, we’re going to have to wait and see,” he concluded, urging followers to watch volume profiles and closing levels rather than intraday wicks. As always, Elliott-wave counts remain interpretative rather than predictive, and traders should align any positioning with their personal risk limits. Dogecoin retains the eighth-largest market capitalisation in crypto, but elevated volatility means even minor price gaps can translate into double-digit percentage swings. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

Alongside MAGA, established cryptos like XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cosmos (ATOM) continue to show strong momentum—but none match the explosive presale growth and community-driven rally that MAGACOIN FINANCE is delivering. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA): Explosive Volume and Bullish Forecasts MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum has accelerated, with a 37% spike in volume signaling intense investor interest. Analysts now project up to 11,000% ROI, driven by strong tokenomics, audited contracts, and a supportive community. The project’s scarcity driven model and early-stage positioning make it a standout opportunity for exponential gains. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! XRP: Technical Breakout and Institutional Interest XRP is trading around $2.34, maintaining strong support at $2.31 despite short-term market uncertainty. Technical analysts see potential for a breakout above $2.36, targeting $2.47 and beyond if bullish momentum holds. Forecasts suggest XRP could reach $8 by year-end, though its upside is more gradual compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale potential. Solana (SOL): Consolidation with Upside Potential SOL is consolidating between $158 and $183, with analysts eyeing a potential breakout toward $210 if momentum continues. The 50-day EMA at $158.61 provides underlying support, and MetaMask’s upcoming native support for Solana is expected to drive further adoption. While SOL offers robust upside, its growth is steady rather than explosive. Cosmos (ATOM): Stable Growth and Exchange Listings ATOM is trading near $4.41, with forecasts suggesting a range of $4.15 to $4.67 in May. Recent listings on major exchanges have boosted trading activity, but ATOM’s growth is expected to remain stable and gradual, making it a solid but less dramatic investment compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts While XRP, SOL, and ATOM remain strong market leaders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top opportunity for outsized gains in 2025. With a 37% volume spike and analysts projecting up to 11,000% upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the clear choice for investors seeking explosive presale returns.

Meanwhile, Shiba Inu and PEPE are maintaining critical support levels. This pivotal phase could signal potential growth for these popular tokens, catching the eye of investors. Play close attention to these three memecoins that could be gearing up for exciting moves. Dogecoin: Recent Gains Amid Extended Decline Dogecoin delivered a 23.56% gain over the past month while experiencing a 44.02% drop over the past six months. Price movements have illustrated rapid shifts, highlighting a short bullish period against a broader downward trend. Volatility is evident, with a clear reversal in short-term momentum contrasted by the long-term decline, indicating that the coin is navigating both challenges and opportunities in its recovery. Currently, Dogecoin trades between $0.1371 and $0.2003, with support at $0.1019 and resistance at $0.2281. The market shows no clear trend as indicators hover around neutrality, allowing for cautious bullish attempts toward resistance at $0.2912 and defensive bearish strategies near support at $0.0388. Shiba Inu Analysis: Short-Term Bounce vs Long-Term Decline at Key Levels Shiba Inu recorded a modest gain of around 1.70% over the past month, while its performance over the last six months shows a steep decline of approximately 44.12%. A one-week dip of 1.51% highlights ongoing volatility. Price movements during this period indicate brief recovery spurts amid a prolonged downturn, suggesting turbulent fluctuations in the broader market landscape. Current prices range between $0.00001 and $0.00001556, with support marked at $0.00001 and resistance near $0.00002. Market sentiment remains divided, with neither bulls nor bears in full control, resulting in a sideways trend. Traders may consider testing the resistance while closely monitoring the support zone for potential breakouts or reversals. Pepe's Volatile Surge Amid Mixed Trends Pepe has shown a striking contrast in behavior over recent periods, recording a 50.31% gain in the last month while suffering a 30.22% drop over the past six months. A modest gain of 3.83% in the most recent week indicates intermittent bullish bursts amid overall volatility. Historical price movements reveal both rapid rallies and significant pullbacks, underscoring an unpredictable market journey. Current prices are near a key resistance at $0.000012, with solid support at $0.000004. The second resistance level at $0.000016 may act as a target for bulls, despite mixed signals from oscillators. Trading strategies should focus on monitoring for rebounds off support and cautious attempts toward resistance, as market participants balance short-term trends with longer-term hesitance. Conclusion DOGE has shown signs of stabilization, indicating it might be a reliable option for those looking into memecoins. SHIB and PEPE , on the other hand, maintain key support levels, suggesting ongoing interest and potential for future growth. Each coin offers unique opportunities and should be monitored closely for any significant movements. Memecoins continue to attract attention, making it important to stay updated on their performance.

The model’s latest 463-day forecast suggests Bitcoin should currently be trading at approximately $260,031, a more than 130% premium over its current price. Current Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model. Source. Bitbo For those unfamiliar, stock-to-flow is a ratio derived from the total existing supply of Bitcoin (stock) divided by the new issuance (flow) entering circulation through mining. It is, in essence, a measure of absolute scarcity. The orange trajectory on the model indicates that Bitcoin’s price historically gravitates toward the S2F curve over time, albeit with volatility. The closer Bitcoin tracks to this model, the more confidently one might view BTC as behaving like a commodity with predictable scarcity-driven value appreciation, akin to gold or silver. Yet at the moment, Bitcoin is trailing the model’s predicted path. This divergence has raised eyebrows but is not unprecedented. Historically, periods of underperformance versus the S2F baseline have often preceded parabolic surges, as seen during the 2013 and 2020 bull runs. Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model. Source. Bitbo The current discrepancy between the S2F model and actual price suggests a significant asymmetry in sentiment versus on-chain fundamentals. While skeptics might argue that Bitcoin is overheating, proponents of S2F view this lag as latent potential, evidence that the market has yet to fully price in the asset’s post-halving supply dynamics. https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1925464216175087957 Why does this matter for BTC? Because stock-to-flow is not only a technical model, but a proxy for behavioral dynamics. When Bitcoin trades below its modeled valuation, it often signals a period of consolidation, disbelief, or macro headwinds. But in the past, such gaps have presaged major upside moves. In psychological terms, these dislocations can be seen as moments of latent potential energy, times when market participants are failing to fully integrate the implications of emergent scarcity. This is especially relevant in a world where sovereign actors, institutions, and public companies are rapidly acquiring Bitcoin, not merely as an asset, but as a hedge against systemic fragility. Trump Media’s $2.5 billion Bitcoin treasury announcement is only the most recent example of this structural rotation.

The fund has raised $28 million, significantly oversubscribed, and will back founders building frontier technology in the blockchain and decentralized ecosystem. The fund, spearheaded by Gil Rosen, Kun Peng, and Steven Willinger, is embedded within Stanford’s thriving blockchain community and focuses on pre-seed and seed-stage investments. It aims to support exceptional founders not only from Stanford but also from other top institutions with strong research and entrepreneurial cultures. To date, Blockchain Builders has already deployed over $16 million across 40 ventures. These span a diverse array of verticals, including artificial intelligence (AI), infrastructure, decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world assets (RWAs), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and crypto payments. The remaining capital is on track to be deployed by the end of 2025, with several portfolio companies preparing for token generation events (TGEs) in the coming months. From Stanford classrooms to venture capital Blockchain Builders emerged from within the thriving Stanford blockchain community. Blockchain Builders has deep roots in Stanford’s academic and entrepreneurial community. The founding trio is not only investors but also educators and ecosystem builders. They launched the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, teach the MS&E 447 Blockchain Entrepreneurship course, and host the Blockchain Application Stanford Summit (BASS). These initiatives have supported over 200 founders, trained 400 students, and reached nearly 5,000 event attendees. They also have experience in the finance and crypto industry. Willinger previously led Coinbase Ventures, invested at Capital One Ventures, and worked in product and partnerships at Blockstream and Google / Google X. Rosen, a prolific angel investor, bootstrapped a 100-employee venture, building distributed compute infrastructure for JPMorgan, London Stock Exchange, and the IRS; exiting to AI platform NGData. While Peng has extensive founder experience in web3 spanning crypto analytics and indexing, NFT, DeFi, and infrastructure. Peng said, “Blockchain Builders was born from our firsthand experience scaling the Stanford blockchain ecosystem. It gives us a unique vantage point and network to support tomorrow’s breakout founders.” Professor David Tse, a leading figure in blockchain infrastructure and founder of Babylon, echoed the sentiment. “Stanford’s ecosystem—through our research, courses, and accelerators—has become a launchpad for the next wave of blockchain innovation,” he said. Looking ahead, Blockchain Builders plans to extend its reach through partnerships with Cornell’s IC3 accelerator, which now includes Berkeley, Princeton, Yale, and UCL. The fund is also collaborating with key ecosystem players such as the Ethereum Foundation, Solana, BASE, and Starkware to continue scaling its impact across the Web3 landscape. Backing tomorrow’s blockchain future Blockchain Builders has invested in 0G, a modular AI blockchain backed by Hack VC and Delphi Digital, Nexus Labs, a decentralized supercomputing startup supported by Pantera, Lightspeed, and Dragonfly. They have also invested in Hyperbolic, an open-access AI cloud project with investors like Variant and Polychain, and Pod, a blockless Layer-1 chain supported by a16z and 1kx. The founders emphasize their hands-on approach, working closely with startups on strategy, go-to-market execution, and fundraising readiness. “We roll up our sleeves and dive deep with founders,” said Gil Rosen. “We help position them for top-tier follow-on investment.” The post Stanford grads launch $28M blockchain fund backing next-gen web3 startups appeared first on Invezz",Alternative Investment|Blockchain technology|Crypto|Venture Capital|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-05-27 17:11:40

The wireless mobile technology is staring at an evolving climate as the Web3 revolution pushes advancement beyond basic connectivity. RZTO , a Solana-based utility token, is looking to make a mark on the global telecom sector with Web3 capability and major innovative features to make the Web3 transition possible. However, having a utility token is one thing, and getting it out there in the real world is another struggle. Most of the digital coins talk a big game, but they don't have any real-world application. The telecom token RZTO looks to break this trend as it has inked a major partnership with Rizz Wireless, an FCC-licensed Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) in the USA. The partnership aims to realize a Web3 telecom ecosystem that redefines user engagement and the future of mobile connectivity. Rather than focusing on a rigid centralized layout, the RZTO ecosystem represents a complete reset of the workings of the telecom sector. The main benefit of a digital coin-based infrastructure is that it can be used to reward users for loyalty and engagement over the years. Rather than wasting unused data, it is rolled over to the next month, or users are rewarded in the form of tokens. Subscribers earn free tokens every step of the way, which helps reduce costs and provides access to a large tokenized digital economy. Rizz Wireless-Changing Connectivity for the Better Rizz Wireless is the first use case for the RZTO system. It brings much-needed MVNO credibility and reach to the table. The Rizz Wireless token partnership offers useful services, including 5G connectivity, flexible payment plans starting at just $25/month. It supports all kinds of cellular modules, including physical SIMs and eSIMs. This development is ideal for international users who are looking for seamless global connectivity. RZTO is not just a Proof of Concept but a real-world implementation of blockchain technology in a futuristic Web3 package. RZTO tokens are used for data top-ups, paying roaming fees, and even international merchant payments through secure outlets. For this purpose, an agreement was struck with Amdocs Connect for international roaming and another with Zoyilli.com for extended token utility. Technical Details The telecom token RZTO employs tangible Web3 principles across a major Call-to-Earn model to help subscribers enjoy extensive rewards based on everyday mobile usage. With its robust tokenomics, it maintains a supply of just 10 billion RZTO tokens. The scarcity of these Solana-based utility token coins is improved by equitable distribution across public-private sales, liquidity pools, staking rewards, and deflationary mechanisms like token burnings. The staking model is inspired by Bitcoin itself, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It allows users to earn fixed passive income through an APY pool. These DeFi principles are much needed in telecom services. The token burn mechanism is set to choke the supply constantly over time, ensuring long-term value and ecosystem sustainability. In addition to tokenomics and DeFi capability, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) mechanism is also on the cards, and it will help decentralize decision-making on the RZTO platform. Strategic Advantages for Crypto Investors A Certik audit is in progress to ensure third-party scrutiny around overall platform security and code integrity. Planned listings on major digital currency aggregation websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are also in the works to gain legitimacy within the crypto space. The Rizz Wireless token ecosystem's major strength lies in real-world application, and that cannot be achieved with pure speculation like other new cryptocurrencies focus on. The firm maintains that working with a regulated player like Rizz Wireless brings credibility to the table. How to Join the RZTO Ecosystem Watch the telecom token RZTO presale live on the website. Market rollout is focused on Dubai and other parts of the Middle East, as well as key regions in Europe and Asia. The United States is currently excluded from the token campaign. For investors researching cryptocurrency opportunities, this innovative Solana-based utility token represents a unique intersection of blockchain technology and telecommunications.

Crypto ETF inflows hit $3.3B last week, pushing the YTD total to a record $10.8B. BlackRock’s IBIT leads with $2.43B in inflows, holding 3.32% of Bitcoin’s market cap. Bitcoin traded at $109,637 at press time, after gaining 4.38% in the past seven days. The asset remains just below its record high, as $11 billion in short-term holder profits and macro uncertainty weigh on momentum. Bitfinex analysts reported that short-term holders realized $11.4 billion in profits over the past 30 days. This figure marks a steep rise from the $1.2 billion realized in the prior month. The analysts warned that without an equal influx of new capital, further upside could remain limited in the near term. While spot bitcoin ETFs attracted over $5.3 billion in May, the increased pace of profit realization suggests a near-term pause may be underway.

Now, the spotlight shifts to UNI , which is making waves with a breakout aiming for the $7.50 target. As the crypto market buzzes with excitement, find out which coins are showing strong potential for growth and their prospects for a positive monthly close. Sui Token Seeks Stability Amid Mixed Price Movements Sui prices declined by about 1.54% over the past month, while managing a modest 0.86% gain over the last six months, indicating a slight recovery. Price fluctuations have remained relatively mild, characterized by small corrections without a clear long-term trend. The recent performance displays a balance, with neither strong bullish surges nor deep bearish slides shaping the market. Current prices trade between $2.19 and $4.34, with support visible around $0.88 and resistance near $5.19; a higher barrier is found at $7.34. Bears currently exert some influence, though there is no definitive trend dominating the market. Traders might look to buy near support levels and set profit targets as prices approach established resistance levels. Uniswap's Recent Performance and Trading Outlook Uniswap recorded a weekly gain of 9.27% along with a one-month increase of 11.36%. However, it faced a significant decline of 52.01% over the past six months. The price movements have shown considerable volatility, with short-term strength contrasting against a longer-term bearish trend. Despite the market's downturn, recovery efforts indicate that sentiment can quickly turn positive under the right conditions. Current prices fluctuate between $4.39 and $6.32, with immediate resistance around $7.36 and another level near $9.29. Support is identified at $3.51 and further backed by levels at $1.58. Bulls are gaining traction in this range, though a strong trend is not yet established. Traders may find opportunities by focusing on support levels while being mindful of possible pullbacks. Conclusion SUI shows a strong performance, staying above $3.50. Meanwhile, UNI has managed a breakout towards $7.50 and is targeting its first positive monthly close. Both cryptocurrencies demonstrate resilience, and their current trends suggest they might continue to gain momentum. Investors are watching these developments closely as they indicate ongoing strength in the market. Moving forward, SUI and UNI's ability to maintain their respective levels will be crucial for further growth. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Large-scale sell-offs by SUI whales have triggered a significant price correction, shaking investor confidence in the project. While Sui struggles to regain momentum, another cryptocurrency, Ruvi AI (RUVI) , is shining brightly as it gains traction among forward-thinking investors. Ruvi AI, an innovative project merging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, is rapidly positioning itself as a frontrunner in the next wave of blockchain innovation. With a strong roadmap, successful presale, and ambitious long-term potential, Ruvi AI is attracting investors who want to capitalize early on a promising opportunity. Sui (SUI) Whales Spark Market Concerns The sudden sell-off of massive Sui (SUI) holdings by whales has sent shockwaves through the market. Once celebrated for its high-speed blockchain technology and unique approach to scalability, SUI has seen increased market volatility in recent weeks. Investor sentiment took a hit as the sell-off led to price fluctuations, and recovery efforts now hinge on the project’s ability to rebuild trust and stabilize its ecosystem. For those seeking an alternative to Sui, Ruvi AI offers a fresh perspective, thanks to its innovative integration of AI and blockchain technologies. With its focus on delivering real-world solutions and exponential growth potential, Ruvi AI is quickly emerging as an investor favorite in 2025. Ruvi AI’s Revolutionary Vision Ruvi AI (RUVI) is reshaping how blockchain intersects with artificial intelligence. By combining these two powerful technologies, Ruvi AI creates solutions tailored to industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. The goal is to enhance transparency, efficiency, and intelligence in ways that make a tangible impact on the world. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its ability to back its vision with real-world implementation. The launch of its Beta platform has provided early adopters with a preview of its capabilities, showcasing its potential to solve pressing challenges across multiple sectors. Furthermore, Ruvi AI has secured its first exchange listing , which is a significant milestone toward broader accessibility for investors. Additional listings are anticipated soon, increasing confidence in the project’s long-term scalability. A Record-Breaking Presale Ruvi AI’s presale success underscores the excitement surrounding the project. During Phase 1 , tokens were offered at an introductory price of $0.01 and sold out within two weeks, highlighting overwhelming investor interest. Since then, the token’s value has risen to $0.015 in Phase 2 , with predictions pointing to a potential surge to $1 per RUVI following its official listing. Ruvi AI’s presale features a lucrative bonus structure, rewarding early participants with additional tokens based on their purchase tier. Here’s a breakdown of three investment scenarios showcasing the potential rewards: VIP 2 ($750 Investment) At $0.015 per token , a $750 investment qualifies for the VIP 2 bonus , which provides an additional 40% tokens : Tokens purchased: 50,000 Bonus tokens (40%): 20,000 Total tokens: 70,000 At Ruvi AI’s confirmed listing price of $0.07 , this investment would grow to $4,900 . If Ruvi AI achieves a valuation of $1 , the investment would soar to $70,000 .

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen rapid growth thanks to its big community and rising popularity, currently being valued around $0.000015 and liked by investors seeking big earnings. Next to SHIB, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a noticeable altcoin in DeFi and is gaining more users, preparing for a possible profit of 2500% as interest in crypto rises. The project has entered phase 5 of its presale following phase 4 selling out in less time than projected. MUTM will enter the markets officially at $0.06, while currently up 200% since its presale launch. The next phase prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035. The tokens are available at $0.03, with listing at $0.06, offering early investors up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.3 million raised and attracting more than 11,500 investors. These top cryptos combine hype, innovation, and solid fundamentals, making them must-watch opportunities for anyone aiming to maximize gains in 2025. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06, early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.3 million raised and attracting more than 11,500 investors. As Phase 5 is in, the token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency Delivered: Stablecoin and Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance is not only innovating, it is establishing trust. The platform’s open-source smart contracts have undergone a rigorous, officially completed audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin that is engineered to steer clear of pitfalls that have toppled other algorithmic stablecoins. Constructed on the Ethereum blockchain, the stablecoin is a keystone of the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are always primary pillars of the ecosystem. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are the leading crypto investment opportunities for investors looking to uncover explosive gains this summer. SHIB is still poised to benefit from its astronomical community and adoption, while MUTM is also rapidly rising with over $9.3 million generated and well over 11,500+ investors supporting its groundbreaking hybrid DeFi lending protocol. Priced at $0.03 in stage 5 of its presale and with a listing price of $0.06, MUTM promises early investors as much as 100% returns, and perhaps even a great deal more since the token price will increase by 16.67% in the next stage. The completed Certik audit and stablecoin development further reinforce MUTM’s commitment to security and sustainability. Don’t miss your chance to join this momentum to explore Mutuum Finance today and position yourself for the potential 2500% profit surge.

45166929,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68694,1748367005,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Market Strategist Is Bullish On Cardano Over Solana This Cycle. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-is-bullish-on-cardano-over-solana-this-cycle-heres-why/,"Popular crypto analyst and YouTuber Alex Becker has recently shared his outlook for the altcoin market, and his message is clear: he believes Cardano (ADA) could outperform Solana (SOL) in the current cycle. Even though Solana holds a much larger market cap , Becker argues that Cardano has greater potential for delivering stronger returns in the coming months. As of now, ADA is trading between $0.735 and $0.765, following a recent peak above $0.83 on May 23. Meanwhile, Solana sits at around $174.76, with its market cap nearing $91 billion — a stark contrast to Cardano’s valuation, which remains under $28 billion. Why Becker Sees More Upside in Cardano (ADA) In his latest video, Becker explained that both Solana and Cardano are solid blockchain projects, but ADA offers the chance for larger percentage gains. While he acknowledged Ethereum (ETH) as a relatively safer choice, he suggested that ADA could rise by 5x to 8x from its current levels, potentially pushing the price to around $6.10. Although Solana has shown consistent strength and market resilience, Becker believes mid-cap coins like Cardano, Sui, and others are positioned for more aggressive price moves, especially for investors willing to take on higher risk for higher reward. Beyond ADA, Becker also mentioned Avalanche (AVAX), which he sees benefiting from developments in sports and gaming, and Chainlink (LINK), which he feels is still underappreciated despite its critical role in the blockchain ecosystem. Summing up his thoughts, Becker confidently stated, “I think Cardano is going to do great. You can’t go wrong with it.” Becker’s Ongoing Support for ADA Interestingly, Becker’s bullish stance on Cardano has persisted despite his often playful jabs at the ADA community. Back in March, he boldly predicted that Cardano could hit $5 — a forecast that caught widespread attention. By April, Becker revealed that he had heavily bought into ADA during past market dips and was already enjoying substantial profits. He jokingly admitted that these gains left him feeling “gross” and “terrible,” while also teasing that a surge to $5 could boost his wealth to “Dubai royalty” status. Even though Becker frequently pokes fun at Cardano holders, he has consistently shown respect for Charles Hoskinson , the project’s founder. In another April YouTube analysis, Becker placed ADA among eight coins he believes could soar up to 15x by 2026. Despite his playful clashes with the Cardano fanbase, Becker described ADA as one of the fastest, most decentralized, and technically solid blockchains after Ethereum. He emphasized that ADA’s current undervaluation and growing ecosystem make it an “easy bet” — predicting it could rise to between $3 and $5 if bullish market momentum builds. Hoskinson Adds an Institutional Perspective Separately, Charles Hoskinson offered his perspective on ADA’s market position during a March appearance on the Gokhshtein podcast. Hoskinson compared Cardano and XRP, describing both as resilient blue-chip assets while classifying Solana as more of a mid-tier player. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hoskinson further noted that the U.S. government has reportedly selected five cryptocurrencies for its strategic reserve : Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). He attributed Cardano’s inclusion to its longevity and ability to withstand bear markets. Hoskinson also acknowledged Solana’s remarkable rebound following the FTX collapse, where it surged from $8 to an all-time high of $294 in January 2025. While he referred to Solana as “mid,” he nonetheless praised its resilience, aligning it with the select assets making up the U.S. crypto reserve basket. Analysts Suggest Cardano’s Bull Run Has Yet to Start Beyond short-term price action, some analysts believe Cardano’s larger bull phase hasn’t yet arrived. Earlier this month, Dan Gambardello, founder of Crypto Capital Venture, released a risk model indicating that ADA’s bull market remains in its early stages. According to Gambardello’s model, Cardano’s long-term risk score currently sits at 37 — a level he described as a “Moderate Buy.” Historically, when ADA has hit similar risk levels, it was followed by major rallies, including its moves past $1 in 2017 and above $3 in 2021. Gambardello concluded that ADA remains in a buildup phase, with significant room to run once the next full-fledged bull cycle takes off. As momentum builds in the crypto market, analysts like Alex Becker are zeroing in on Cardano as one of the most promising opportunities this cycle, even when compared to giants like Solana. With its smaller market cap, strong technical foundation, and growing institutional recognition, ADA appears well-positioned for aggressive growth. While debates continue over which platform will ultimately dominate, Becker’s consistent bullish stance and strategic accumulation suggest he’s betting on Cardano to lead the next wave of altcoin gains.

Within just 90 days, holders who joined during the early funding rounds have witnessed their investments triple in value. The initial phase 1 token price was set significantly lower than today’s rate of $0.03, marking over a 200% increase and solidifying Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the fastest-growing DeFi projects in 2025. Early backers see real 3x gains Early adopters who recognized the potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have already secured serious gains. With the token’s price jumping from phase 1 to the current phase 5, the value has risen by more than 200%. This surge isn’t just theoretical. Investors who purchased $10,000 worth of MUTM during the first round are now holding assets worth approximately $30,000 — a real and measurable profit. The current price of $0.03 still offers significant upside, but the lower entry points are now history. Those waiting for the “right time” to join are watching from the sidelines as the price continues to climb and opportunities to maximize ROI shrink with each passing day. With a capped total supply of 4,000,000,000 tokens and just over 11,500 holders at the time of writing, the scarcity factor is playing a key role in driving demand. As more investors become aware of the high returns and strong utility, supply on the open market is thinning rapidly. Every phase brings a price increase, and those who delay face diminishing returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already deep into phase 5, with the raise reaching $9.3 million. The clock is ticking for new investors to join before the token becomes more expensive and ROI margins narrow further. Exclusive DeFi utility behind the hype What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart isn’t just hype — it’s real utility. The platform offers users powerful DeFi functionality, including lending and borrowing, all built with efficiency, transparency, and user control in mind. Users who deposit stable assets such as DAI into the Mutuum Finance protocol receive mtTokens — smart derivatives that not only represent your deposit but grow in value as interest accrues. For example, depositing $10,000 worth of DAI or ETH can generate passive income at an annual rate of 8%, depending on the pool’s utilization. This transforms idle assets into steady income without the need for complex trading or risky speculation. Borrowers also benefit from the platform. Instead of selling ETH at an unfavorable market point, users can deposit it as collateral and borrow stablecoins. This strategy allows them to keep ownership of their assets while accessing liquidity to cover expenses, trade, or pursue new opportunities. The absence of fixed repayment dates means flexibility is baked into the core experience. Trust and transparency are pillars of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. The project underwent a comprehensive CertiK audit, covering both static analysis and manual code review. This trusted validation assures investors that Mutuum Finance operates on a secure, robust, and professionally reviewed codebase. The audit was initiated in February 2025 and revised in May 2025, showing a clear commitment to ongoing improvements and long-term safety. In a space where many protocols skip formal checks, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for prioritizing the safety of its user base. Holding MUTM means earning more Owning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens isn’t just about price appreciation — it’s also about long-term rewards. The platform’s revenue-sharing mechanism includes a buyback strategy where part of the protocol income is used to purchase MUTM from the market. These tokens are then distributed to users who stake their mtTokens in the safety module. This means that by participating in the ecosystem and staking mtTokens, users earn passive dividends in MUTM. These payouts reward community members for helping secure the protocol and contribute to a healthy token economy that prioritizes sustainability and investor satisfaction. Waiting to invest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now means accepting a lower reward later. The difference between the phase 1 price and the current phase 5 pricing is over 200%. Investors who wait for later rounds or market listings are stepping into a higher entry point with lower upside. The earlier you join, the more profit you lock in. With growing demand, a proven 3x return in under three months, and powerful real-world use cases, the current market window is closing fast. Token availability is shrinking as more users enter the protocol, and the opportunity to multiply returns with the next wave of price movement is happening now. Join before the next multiplier event The current market signals are clear: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not slowing down. Its combination of verified security, DeFi innovation, and passive income rewards is attracting thousands of new holders each week. With phase 5 already raising $9.3 million and the token price firmly at $0.03, this is the moment to act. Those who join now will still benefit from the next price jump, while those who hesitate will only see returns diminish with each future round. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the future of smart, secure, and rewarding DeFi — and it’s rewarding the bold. Be among the next wave of backers to lock in serious gains. Don’t wait. Join the revolution today and earn like the early believers who tripled their capital in under 90 days.

MARA shares also expanded to a one-month peak. Mara Holdings posted $752M in annualized income from its Bitcoin mining business. The company has turned into one of the most profitable corporate miners, growing its hashrate over the years. To achieve its current earnings, Mara Holdings built 57.3 EH/s in total hashrate. Years ago, we started down the road of Bitcoin mining with just ~0.2 EH/s. Since then, we’ve gone far beyond the benchmarks that once defined the industry, with over ~57 EH/s of computational power energized. We have redefined what it means to be a Bitcoin miner. Today, we are… pic.twitter.com/MYZTonMVRd — MARA (@MARAHoldings) May 27, 2025 The miner runs its own pool, which includes all its data centers and farms. Mara Holdings produces up to 10% of blocks due to the high efficiency of its mining operations. The corporate miner is among the top 10 pools and the second-largest US-based mining pool following Foundry Digital. Mara Holdings produces new BTC both through its native pool, and through Foundry.USA, receiving regular inflows of BTC. The corporate miner holds 10,765 BTC in its mining-connected wallet for a constantly growing treasury. The mining operations were also the basis of Mara Holding’s leveraged buying. Mara is the second-biggest BTC holder after Strategy (MSTR), with a total of 48,137 BTC . The fund has an extremely low-cost basis for its BTC treasury, fulfilling the purpose of tapping value. The company increased its holdings by 174% in the past five quarters on a mix of mining and sporadic acquisitions. The success of Mara showed miners were now immune to panic-based capitulation, even during BTC downturns. Miners continue to produce BTC under stressful conditions but retain most of the coins. BTC miners hold over 1.8M coins, some of which have been used as the basis for corporate treasuries. MARA shares reach a one-month peak MARA shares recovered to a one-month peak, gaining more rapidly in the past day. MARA traded at $16.34, tracking the BTC expansion in May. Interest in MARA also increased as traders focused on companies carrying Bitcoin treasuries. MARA increased its mindshare on social media, for its unique position as a scalable block producer and direct BTC buyer. The companies also gained exposure during the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas. MARA also achieved the biggest daily gains, though other corporate miner stocks were in the green. Most corporate miner stocks tracked the BTC market, with net gains for the past month. US-based mining corporations were among the big winners in the past month, as BTC recovered above $100,000. | Source: CompaniesMarketCap The shares of Mara Holdings have reflected both its mining results and the robust BTC treasury. However, Mara Holdings has not announced new acquisitions and has not competed with Strategy to acquire more BTC through leveraged instruments. Despite this, the holding’s approach is more sustainable, supported by its mining operations, locations, and the ability to pivot to data centers. The company expanded to a total of 17 data centers as of May 2025. The company has highly efficient mining operations, accessing 1.1 GW in energy, with the option to expand to 1.7 GW. BTC mining costs are estimated at $91,950 per coin, though Mara Holdings has achieved a lower production price due to its early investment and access to cheap energy.

Unlike many decentralized exchanges that rely on off-chain order matching and on-chain settlement, Hyperliquid processes all transactions, orders, and trades directly on-chain. The system is anchored by two main components: HyperBFT and HyperEVM. HyperBFT, a consensus protocol influenced by Meta’s LibraBFT, is built to handle throughput of up to 2 million transactions per second. It finalizes blocks in under a second and can process as many as 100,000 orders per second. HyperEVM ensures compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine , giving developers the ability to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts while benefiting from faster execution and lower transaction fees. The platform offers perpetual futures trading across several major crypto assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), Solana ( SOL ), and Sui ( SUI ). Traders can use up to 50x leverage and are not required to hold the underlying asset to open a position. New users onboard through wallet-based login, and the exchange does not conduct know-your-customer checks. This model stands in contrast to most centralized platforms and may raise regulatory questions in certain jurisdictions. In addition to derivatives, Hyperliquid enables spot trading through its HIP-1 token standard, which is structurally similar to Ethereum’s ERC-20 . Token listings come with relatively high costs, a measure aimed at reducing spam and filtering out low-quality projects. The protocol also includes a Vaults feature that allows users to allocate capital to traders or algorithmic strategies in a non-custodial way. All vault performance data is public, and fund movements occur entirely on-chain. Hyperliquid has stated that it has not taken any venture capital funding. Positioning the absence of VC involvement as a strategic choice, the team says it is focused on building long-term infrastructure rather than chasing short-term token performance. James Wynn’s $1.25B position boosts trust in Hyperliquid wallet Hyperliquid’s growing presence in the DeFi space is backed by a series of tangible developments that have unfolded over the past few months. On May 23, Hyperliquid Labs submitted two public comment letters to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in response to the agency’s request for feedback on the future of perpetual futures and 24/7 crypto markets. The letters called for regulatory approaches that support decentralized infrastructure while maintaining financial safeguards, marking the first time Hyperliquid participated in policy discussions at this level. The market reacted swiftly. HYPE rose 15% that day, according to CoinMarketCap data, signaling investor confidence in the platform’s long-term regulatory position. Infrastructure has also remained central to Hyperliquid’s momentum. The February rollout of HyperEVM introduced Ethereum compatibility, enabling smart contracts from the Ethereum ecosystem to run natively on Hyperliquid. This upgrade paved the way for new integrations, including support for Tether ( USDT ), expanding the platform’s stablecoin functionality. As a result, the ecosystem now allows for more flexible trading strategies, smoother interoperability, and easier capital movement across networks. High-volume traders have taken notice. Earlier last week, derivatives trader James Wynn opened a $1.25 billion Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid, one of the largest on-chain derivatives trades recorded to date, showing that the network can handle institutional-scale activity without performance issues.

Throughout May, social media posts have speculated about a second token airdrop. With 38% of the HYPE supply still unallocated, users have begun tracking on-chain signals for eligibility. The speculation builds on the original airdrop from November 2024, which distributed HYPE to early users. Rising wallet activity and cross-chain transactions this month suggest renewed engagement from both first-time participants and returning users. Hyperliquid price prediction: Hyperliquid token may face resistance Hyperliquid’s strong momentum in May has pushed the token into price discovery territory. On the HYPE/BTC weekly chart, the asset is now trading at all-time highs relative to Bitcoin — a rare position for any altcoin during a period when many others are still struggling to break through resistance. https://twitter.com/MetamateDaz/status/1926792832863379662 Pushing higher from this point presents more complexity. One perspective, shared by Defi Monk, a researcher at Messari, suggests that Hyperliquid may be approaching saturation in terms of retail trading activity. There’s actually one $HYPE bear case I see very few people mention. The idea that Hyperliquid is close to maxing out retail taker flow onchain and that getting from 20% of Binance’s volume share to 50% will be a much harder path than getting from 0 to 20%. This is because… https://t.co/Iw4c7akhxb — MONK (@defi_monk) May 18, 2025 According to him, the platform’s growth from zero to capturing 20% of Binance’s volume share happened during a unique window in the market. Expanding further into high-frequency and institutional territory, however, may prove slower. “Getting from 20% of Binance’s volume share to 50% will be a much harder path,” he explains, pointing to latency requirements and the challenges of attracting professional trading flow. At the same time, he notes that Hyperliquid’s current position is difficult to displace. Early on, competition was limited. Now, any new entrant must compete directly with Hyperliquid’s infrastructure, depth of liquidity, and established user base. As he puts it, “Now the bar is Hyperliquid itself.” Going forward, the protocol’s trajectory may depend less on rapid growth and more on how effectively it defends its position against emerging platforms like GTE_XYZ and others. In terms of price action, near-term technical models offer a more cautious view. Forecasts from Coincodex suggest HYPE could decline more than 22% over the next 30 days, targeting a price of $28.50 by June 26. Despite the projected correction, broader sentiment remains positive. The Fear & Greed Index is holding at 74, indicating elevated market appetite, while the sentiment indicator stays in bullish territory. On a longer time frame, projections from Coincodex outline a wider range of outcomes. For 2025, the model places HYPE’s maximum price at $36.86, which sits near current levels and implies limited upside in the short term. For 2026, the model projects a potential high of $94.85, which would represent a gain of over 150%. Estimates continue to climb through 2029, with the upper bound reaching $145.28. Price forecasts, regardless of how data-driven they appear, always involve a degree of uncertainty. The DeFi space moves quickly, and changes in regulation, platform security, or user behavior can shift token performance without warning. Traders considering exposure to HYPE should treat it like any other high-volatility digital asset. As always, trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Onchain indicators enter overheated territory, suggesting prolonged profit-taking from BTC investors. Bitcoin (BTC) showed strength on May 27, briefly tagging $110,700 after a strong US equities market open and the Trump Media and Technology Group’s announcement that it would raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets. US National Financial Conditions Index. Source: Ecoinometrics Ecoinometrics mentioned that within four weeks, liquidity has returned, creating a supportive macroeconomic environment for risk assets like Bitcoin. The newsletter noted, “That’s the kind of macro backdrop where Bitcoin thrives. Bitcoin’s rally to new highs didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.” With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity. As illustrated below, if Bitcoin breaches $115,000, over $7 billion in short positions could get liquidated, triggering a cascading effect that pushes prices higher. Bitcoin liquidation map. Source: CoinGlass Related: Bitcoin shows signs of 'easing momentum' but traders still expect $150K Onchain data shows Bitcoin in ‘overheated zone’ While the overall momentum remains bullish, Bitcoin’s rally has pushed the market into a zone where historical patterns urge caution. Two key onchain indicators—Supply in Profit Market Bands and the Advanced Net UTXO Supply Ratio—are flashing signals consistent with prior market tops. The Supply in Profit Market Bands metric tracks how much of the circulating BTC supply is currently in profit. As of late May 2025, this figure has surged to 19.4 million BTC, nearing historical extremes and entering the “Overheated Zone.” Previously, BTC prices tested this zone on Dec. 17, 2025, which was followed by a price correction to $93,000 from $107,000. Bitcoin Supply in Profit Market Bands.

Red markers on the chart indicate prior instances when such conditions led to local price tops or prolonged consolidations. Bitcoin Advanced Net UTXO Supply Ratio chart.

Trump, EU, hopeful about trade talks The broader rally in equities was driven by optimism on the trade front.

The bloc is aiming to avoid 50% mutual tariffs, which Trump has delayed until July 9. “This is a positive event, and I hope that they will, FINALLY, like my same demand to China, open up the European Nations for Trade with the United States of America,” Trump posted on Tuesday. “They will BOTH be very happy, and successful, if they do!!!” The negotiations, led on the EU’s side by trade chief Maroš Šefčovič, will focus on key areas such as semiconductors, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and aluminum. In parallel, the EU and the U.S. will also tackle tariffs and non-tariff barriers.

With strong bullish structure intact, a higher low at support could send price toward the $44 Fibonacci extension level. HYPE Coin ( HYPE ) has entered a corrective phase following a powerful bullish expansion that pushed price into uncharted territory. After topping near $40, price action has pulled back—but in a manner consistent with a strong uptrend. The correction appears to be part of a broader pattern of higher highs and higher lows, which continues to define HYPE’s bullish market structure. Currently, price is testing a key support confluence zone. From a technical perspective, this level could serve as the ideal launchpad for the next leg higher. Key Technical Points $35 Support Zone: Major confluence with 0.618 Fibonacci, VWAP SR, and Value Area Low. $33 Critical Level: Last line of defense for higher low structure—falling below would risk trend invalidation. $44 Fibonacci Extension: Target drawn from previous swing low to all-time high; next likely upside level if support holds. HypeUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView The $35 level is no ordinary zone, it represents a high-confluence support cluster. The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the most recent swing, the VWAP-derived support, and the Value Area Low all converge here. This technical alignment increases the probability of this level acting as a higher low and base for trend continuation. As long as price remains above $33, the broader bullish market structure remains intact. A break and close below $33, however, would invalidate the current pattern of higher lows and could shift momentum to the downside.

What to expect in the coming price action As long as HYPE Coin holds above the $35–$33 support confluence, the market structure remains bullish. A bounce from this zone could initiate the next leg higher, with $44 as the next major upside target.

While LTC’s price action offered little clarity, the bigger picture may be unfolding elsewhere. According to market watchers, the real catalyst for Litecoin’s next significant move could come from Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). A shift in BTC.D could tip the scales, either paving the way for a bullish breakout or extending its current sideways drift. Litcoin And LTCBTC Await A Clear Signal In a recent update, market analyst CRYPTOWZRD offered a detailed, cautious take on Litecoin’s current technical position while highlighting key factors to watch for a potential upside move. He observed that the LTC/USDT and LTC/BTC daily candles “closed indecisively,” a classic sign of market hesitation. Related Reading: Market Expert Projects ‘Undervalued’ Litecoin To Soar At Least 1,000% — Here’s How This kind of price behavior often reflects a lack of conviction from traders and can precede either a continuation or a reversal, depending on how subsequent candles develop. According to CRYPTOWZRD, what’s needed now are “more healthy candles” to confirm renewed bullish intent in the coming sessions. A major factor influencing Litecoin’s outlook is Bitcoin dominance. CRYPTOWZRD explained that a decline in BTC.D would likely benefit altcoins like Litecoin, allowing LTCBTC to gain traction. If such a shift occurs, Litecoin could begin forming a bullish “W” reversal pattern, typically a reliable signal of a bottoming process and the start of a new upward trend. This pattern, if confirmed, would signal improving market sentiment around LTC and open the door for a stronger recovery. CRYPTOWZRD is keeping a close eye on the $96 level, which he identified as a key threshold on the daily chart. A sustained move above this level could give Litecoin the strength to rally toward the $128 resistance area. “I will be tracking the intraday chart development,” he noted, suggesting that his next trade decision will be heavily influenced by how Bitcoin performs in the short term. Intraday Choppiness: A Battle For Direction Sharing his thoughts on Litecoin’s intraday performance, the analyst described the chart as “choppy and slow” throughout the day, reflecting a lack of clear momentum in either direction. He emphasized that a decisive move above the $96 mark, followed by sustained price action at that level, could serve as a catalyst for a potential long toward the next significant resistance around $102 or possibly higher. Related Reading: Litecoin Monthly Close Above Key Resistance Could Ignite 30% Rally – Is A Breakout Coming? However, the analyst cautioned that failure to reclaim $96 may result in continued sideways volatility, with no strong directional bias in the near term. He also highlighted the role of Bitcoin in shaping Litecoin’s next move, noting that broader sentiment and movement in BTC will likely decide whether LTC breaks higher or remains range-bound.

On May 27, the firm announced that it had raised nearly $2.5 billion from about 50 institutional investors in a private placement deal. This funding will help the company build a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury, joining the growing list of corporate Bitcoin holders. Trump Media Reveal Details of the Deal Trump Media is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol DJT. It owns the social media platform Truth Social and the FinTech brand Truth.Fi, which was launched in January 2025 . Truth.Fi was recently given the green light to invest up to $250 million in traditional and crypto-related assets. Now, Trump Media is expanding this plan with a new Bitcoin-focused strategy. The company revealed it will raise $2.5 billion through two parts: $1.5 billion in common stock and $1 billion in convertible notes. The notes can later be turned into shares at a 35% higher price than the premium price. This investment will place Bitcoin next to Trump Media’s existing funds. As of the end of Q1 2025, the company held $759 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The funds raised will allow Trump Media to buy and hold Bitcoin as part of its core financial assets. Trump Media CEO Says Bitcoin Is Financial Freedom Over the weekend, some reports claimed the company was raising $3 billion for crypto investments. Trump Media denied those reports and strongly criticized the news outlet. In today’s press release, Trump Media CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes called Bitcoin an “apex instrument of financial freedom.” He added that this new crypto investment is part of a larger strategy to protect the company from bias in the banking sector. According to Nunes, the Bitcoin reserve will support new product rollouts. This includes utility tokens and subscription payment tools on Truth Social and the upcoming Truth+ platform. Trump Media is partnering with Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital to store its Bitcoin safely. These firms will handle the security and management of the company’s crypto treasury. Trump Media Joins The Corporate Bitcoin Trend With this recent move, Trump Media has joined other major firms that embrace Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, was one of the first to take this approach and now holds almost 3% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Other firms, such as Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, MARA, Genius Group, have adopted the same strategy, seeing Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset. Now, Trump Media is aiming to follow in those footsteps, but with a focus on politics and social media.

In a post on the social media platform X, Pumpius hinted at a potential integration of XRP into the upcoming payment system being developed by the platform. Describing it as “bigger than bullish,” the post emphasized XRP’s capabilities for “fast, borderless, scalable payments” and noted that the social media platform now serves more than 500 million users globally. RUMORS: #XRP to be integrated into the new payment system on X (Twitter)?! If true, this is bigger than bullish — it’s a global liquidity onramp to 500M+ users. XRP was built for fast, borderless, scalable payments. X is building a financial empire. The stars are aligning. pic.twitter.com/rQan0E2gvf — Pumpius (@pumpius) May 27, 2025 Musk recently confirmed that a limited-access beta version of X payments will launch soon, and while the rumor of XRP integration remains unconfirmed, its implications are significant. If true, such a development would introduce XRP to a vast user base through a platform that is actively building its financial infrastructure. Ongoing Support from the XRP Community Supporters of XRP have repeatedly encouraged Musk to adopt the digital asset for X payments . One of the more vocal advocates has been XRPcryptowolf, a notable community figure who has pushed for Musk to adopt XRP for years. XRP is a good choice because it offers low fees, fast transactions, and the ability to handle cross-border transfers efficiently—factors that would support X’s ambition to become a comprehensive financial platform. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s existing infrastructure was designed for global liquidity and settlement solutions. Its integration into a platform like X would create a real-time, scalable alternative to legacy payment systems . The idea that Musk might turn to XRP for such functionality is not unfounded. While Musk has not publicly endorsed XRP, he has demonstrated prior interest in the cryptocurrency space, most notably through Tesla and SpaceX’s interactions with Bitcoin and Dogecoin. The community has also called for Tesla to adopt XRP , as the billionaire’s support for cryptocurrencies and the exposure the asset would gain could give its price a major boost while offering a better way to pay for Tesla products. XRP and The Everything App The addition of a fast and scalable digital asset like XRP would offer a practical option to support global payment rails and bring Musk closer to achieving this goal. Pumpius’s claim that “X is building a financial empire” reflects this broader vision. By leveraging technologies like XRP, Musk’s platform could provide users with real-time value transfer tools that extend beyond traditional currencies.

Chainlink ( LINK ) creator Sergey Nazarov says that the flagship cryptocurrency appears to be decoupling from the stock market and behaving more like gold, Fox Business reports . “Bitcoin is starting to behave as a safe haven asset, and there’s more and more instability in the world… For the first time now, it’s starting to get decoupled from tech stocks. So, if you wanted to choose a second safe haven asset after gold, bitcoin would now be a logical choice.” Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president of Robinhood Crypto, told Fox Business that people are beginning to see Bitcoin as a reserve asset. “And so, when there is a bit of instability in the market or in the globe, they actually use bitcoin as a reserve currency.” And crypto asset manager Bitwise says publicly traded companies are increasingly looking at BTC as a reserve asset rather than a speculative, risk-on investment. In a new report , Bitwise states that corporate Bitcoin holders increased their collective holdings from 394,131 to 786,857 BTC over a six-month period, from November 15, 2024, to May 15, 2025. The increase amounts to 392,726 BTC, which is equivalent to 196,363 BTC acquired per quarter. At time of writing, BTC is trading at $110,318, about a 1.2% move away from new all-time highs.

Investor behavior this cycle could look very different from previous ones. As such, the next big push in the crypto market might not come from where most expect. Not Retail, Here’s Whose Stepping In Instead In a recent tweet , Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, stated that the next wave of crypto mania may not be driven by retail investors but by small or emerging companies and funds attempting to replicate Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Moreno questioned whether these entities are psychologically prepared to hold through extreme volatility, while noting the challenge of maintaining conviction during a potential 90% drawdown in their stock or fund value. Several non-crypto firms have jumped on the bandwagon and are increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, in a bid to emulate Strategy’s high-profile returns. Among them, Japan’s Metaplanet has emerged as a key player with its Bitcoin-first strategy and currently holds 7,800 BTC, according to data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries. Meanwhile, Hong Kong-listed Boyaa Interactive has so far accumulated 2,410 BTC, while US-based medical diagnostics company Semler Scientific has added 3,808 BTC to its balance sheet following Strategy’s playbook. Long-Term Holder Conviction Remains Strong As CryptoPotato previously reported , retail participation in Bitcoin appears notably absent despite recent price gains. On-chain data shows exchange netflows remain negative, suggesting BTC is steadily leaving trading platforms. The Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has fallen below 1.0, which is further indicative of continued aggressive selling, likely from retail investors reducing exposure. On the other hand, long-term holders (LTHs) are showing strong conviction, with spending activity now at its lowest since September 2024. According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr., this cohort of BTC holders has accumulated 300,000 BTC over the past 20 days – an encouraging sign of confidence and a potentially bullish indicator for the crypto asset’s price trajectory.

The price of ether.fi ( ETHFI ) outpaced most top altcoins, including Ethereum ( ETH ) that surged over 5% amid adoption news as SharpLink Gaming announced plans to buy $425 million of Ethereum . ETHFI also outpaced Bitcoin ( BTC ), with the decentralized staking protocol’s 21% spike to above $1.51 outshining Bitcoin’s modest 0.7% gain as BTC hovered near $110,000. Notably, the $2.5 billion fundraising announcement from Trump Media to acquire Bitcoin had yet to trigger a significant price move. ETHFI price chart . Source: crypto.news While ether.fi remains well below its all-time high of $8.57 reached in March 2024, the latest rally reflects strong bullish momentum. The token has rebounded sharply from its April 7, 2025 low of $0.40, marking a 263% gain in just over a month. You might also like: Here’s why the ETHFI price has gone parabolic In addition to improved sentiment around Ethereum, driven by the SharpLink ETH treasury strategy, ETHFI has benefited from protocol-driven buyback initiatives. On May 24, 2025, the ether.fi Foundation announced that a total of 105 ETH worth about $267k had been used to buy back 206k ETHFI. Since initiating the program, the non-custodial ETH staking platform has used withdrawal fees to fund regular token buybacks. In addition to weekly repurchases, the project also conducts monthly buybacks and redistributes repurchased ETHFI tokens to stakers. The protocol’s revenue comes from staking and restaking rewards as well as fees on liquid vaults. In April, platform revenue hit $2.4 million, with ether.fi Foundation noting that a portion of this would be used to buy back the native token. Per DeFiLlama , the platform’s annualized fees and annualized revenue stands at $179 million and $24 million respectively. Ether.fi native token’s price has climbed amid these initiatives, with the total value locked on the protocol rebounding in recent weeks to hit $6.7 billion.

Protocol revenues have also stabilized. AAVE generated $33.8 million in fees this month, slightly higher than last month’s $33.3 million.

Earlier this week, the Dubai Land Department (DLD) unveiled Prypco Mint, a pioneering tokenized real estate platform created through a collaboration with Prypco, the Dubai Future Foundation, Ctrl Alt, and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. This innovative system allows investors to gain fractional ownership of Dubai properties by purchasing digital shares tied to real-world assets. The minimum investment starts at just 2,000 dirhams (around $540), opening the door to a wide range of participants. What’s striking is that Ctrl Alt, the technology partner behind this platform, selected XRPL as the blockchain backbone, not Bitcoin, despite its global recognition. This decision sparked heated discussions across the crypto space, with many wondering why Dubai’s government bypassed the original cryptocurrency for this $16 billion project projected to flourish by 2033. Six Key Reasons Dubai Chose XRPL Over Bitcoin To shed light on the choice, crypto analyst and social media figure John Squire offered a clear breakdown , pointing to six critical advantages that gave XRPL the upper hand. Lightning-Fast Transactions: Squire emphasized that XRPL’s transaction speed was a decisive factor. The XRP Ledger can finalize transactions in just 3–5 seconds, a stark contrast to Bitcoin’s sluggish confirmation times, which can range from 10 minutes to an hour. For a dynamic real estate platform handling countless microtransactions, speed is everything. Why did Dubai choose #XRP over #Bitcoin to tokenize $16B in real estate? Spoiler: It’s not hype, it’s brutal efficiency. pic.twitter.com/rOVCglEz0b — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) May 26, 2025 Minimal Transaction Costs : Cost efficiency played another crucial role. While Bitcoin transactions can incur notable fees, XRP transactions cost just a fraction of a cent. Squire highlighted that this ultra-low fee structure makes XRPL ideal for a high-volume system like fractional real estate trading, where every cent matters. Superior Scalability : When it comes to scaling, XRPL outperforms Bitcoin by a wide margin. Squire pointed out that XRPL can process up to 1,500 transactions per second, compared to Bitcoin’s limit of about seven per second. This scalability ensures the platform can handle massive future demand, aligning with Dubai’s long-term vision for a large-scale, tokenized property market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Eco-Friendly Infrastructure : Sustainability is central to Dubai’s development agenda, and here, XRPL shines. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mechanism, which relies on energy-hungry mining operations, XRPL uses a consensus protocol that’s energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Squire explained that this green approach aligns perfectly with Dubai’s push toward eco-conscious innovation. Institutional Compatibility : According to Squire, Ripple — the company behind XRP — has spent years building bridges with banks, regulators, and government agencies worldwide. This track record of institutional engagement made XRPL a natural fit for Dubai’s government-backed project. By contrast, Bitcoin, while popular among retail investors, lacks the same level of institutional alignment and is often seen as less adaptable for large-scale, regulated initiatives. Diverse, Proven Use Cases : Lastly, Squire pointed to XRPL’s broad utility across sectors like cross-border payments, stablecoin issuance, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and asset tokenization. While Bitcoin is predominantly regarded as a store of value, XRPL offers proven technical infrastructure for tokenization, making it the clear winner for a project centered on digital property shares. The Bottom Line: Utility Over Ideology Squire summed it up simply: major government-backed projects prioritize practical utility over ideological appeal. “Dubai chose XRP because it’s fast, cheap, scalable, energy-efficient, and institution-ready,” he explained. With the Dubai real estate tokenization market expected to swell to $16 billion by the next decade, the decision to use XRPL marks a powerful endorsement of the blockchain’s capabilities. As global interest in tokenized real estate grows, Dubai’s move may set the standard for how governments and institutions approach blockchain adoption, prioritizing functionality, sustainability, and scalability over mere name recognition.

This marks a significant milestone in the evolution of fine art as a mainstream, investable asset class, bridging the worlds of blue-chip art, institutional finance, and blockchain technology. ArtWise is taking a revolutionary step further in tokenization by embedding perpetual revenue-sharing models. ArtWise is pioneering a new standard for art investment through tokenization and asset-backed financing of only the highest-caliber, institutional-grade artworks. Through a unique combination of rigorous authentication, blockchain-powered provenance, and a global community of art professionals, ArtWise ensures that each artwork on its platform meets the strictest standards of quality, valuation, and transparency. Investors can access fractional ownership and liquidity in blue-chip masterpieces—beginning with a private collection that includes works by Salvador Dalí and Jean-Michel Basquiat—while art owners gain new opportunities for capital efficiency without forced sales. Unlike other NFT or art tokenization platforms, ArtWise is not a marketplace for speculative collectibles or digital novelties. The platform’s focus is on blue-chip, institutional-grade artworks with established market value, verified provenance, and enduring cultural significance. The platform will launch with an exclusive private collection of Jean-Michel Basquiat , and continue to expand curation of iconic modern and contemporary masterpieces. Investors gain access to fractional ownership and returns, while collectors unlock new access to liquidity and financing solutions for their assets. ArtWise’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) brings together a vetted network of galleries, appraisers, and art market professionals to set transparent standards for valuation, authentication, and governance, ensuring trust and accountability at every step. Founder’s Statement: Grace Lau, Founder and CEO of ArtWise, commented: “Most art investment platforms focus solely on acquisition – but true investable asset class requires liquidity. That’s why ArtWise selects only museum-grade works with established secondary markets, and structures every listing with exit pathways from day one. While others speculate, we institutionalize: partnering with auction houses, galleries and collectors to secure not just ownership, but also enable realized returns. In art as in finance, the test of an asset isn’t what you pay – it’s what you can sell it for.” About ArtWise: ArtWise is a decentralized protocol dedicated to transforming blue-chip art into a mainstream, investable asset class. By combining blockchain technology, expert-driven authentication, and innovative financial products, ArtWise provides a secure, transparent, and efficient ecosystem for both art owners and investors.

After a strong rally in recent weeks, BTC is showing signs of strength and stability, trading in a tight range that many analysts view as a launchpad for the next major move. The setup points to further upside, with growing confidence that Bitcoin could break into new highs soon. Analysts are increasingly optimistic, calling for an expansive summer as capital begins to flow back into crypto markets. Both technical resilience and compelling on-chain data are fueling the sentiment shift. According to insights from Alphractal, long-term holders (LTHs)—those holding BTC for more than six months—continue to accumulate but not distribute. In fact, the supply held by LTHs is steadily increasing, a sign of deep conviction and reduced liquid supply in the market. This behavior from experienced holders reinforces the bullish thesis: when LTHs are not selling into strength, it often sets the foundation for sustainable rallies . With a strong technical base, rising institutional interest, and long-term holders tightening supply, Bitcoin appears primed for a powerful summer ahead. Bitcoin Consolidates As Market Dynamics Shift Bitcoin is currently consolidating just below the $110,000 level, holding steady after an aggressive rally that brought it close to its all-time high of $112K. Despite the pause in upside momentum, bulls remain firmly in control. Both the daily and weekly charts show a well-defined uptrend structure, with higher highs and higher lows continuing to build. The consolidation appears to be a healthy cooldown before the next major move. Top analyst Darkfost recently shared insights into the market’s underlying structure, focusing on the behavior of Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). According to Darkfost, LTHs are not distributing their coins—in fact, they are doing the opposite. The supply held by LTHs is steadily increasing, signaling conviction and reinforcing the idea that seasoned investors expect more upside. Interestingly, the behavior of STHs paints a very different picture. Darkfost expressed surprise at the data, which shows that STHs are actively distributing. Unlike past instances where STH selling occurred during corrections, this time the selling is taking place at an all-time high. It suggests a possible transfer from strong hands (LTHs) to weaker hands (STHs), a dynamic that often precedes increased volatility. While STHs may be locking in profits at the top, Darkfost notes it’s hard to say they’re wrong—after all, BTC is at an ATH, not in a mid-cycle dip. Still, with LTHs continuing to hold and reduce available supply, the broader trend remains bullish. The coming days could define whether BTC reclaims $112K and enters price discovery or retreats under growing short-term pressure. Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is currently trading at $109,863 on the daily chart, holding firm just below its all-time high of $112,000. Price action remains bullish, with BTC consolidating in a tight range after a powerful breakout above the $103,600 resistance zone, now acting as a key support level. This consolidation appears healthy and controlled, as buyers continue to defend higher lows. The 34-day EMA sits at $101,928 and is rising steadily, confirming strong short- to mid-term momentum. BTC is also comfortably above the 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, all of which are now aligned to the upside—a classic signal of trend strength. Volume has slightly decreased during this phase, which is typical for consolidation after a breakout. This price behavior suggests bulls are not exhausted but rather preparing for the next leg up. A daily close above $112K with volume confirmation would likely push BTC into price discovery, with potential upside targets around $120K to $125K. Until then, the $103,600–$105,000 zone remains the critical area to hold. As long as BTC stays above this region and maintains its higher structure, the broader uptrend remains intact, and the bullish outlook is unchanged.

Alongside MAGA, market leaders like Solana (SOL), Trump (TRUMP), and XRP are making headlines—but none offer the explosive presale momentum and community-driven returns that MAGACOIN FINANCE is delivering. With strong tokenomics and audited contracts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the top speculative pick of 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA): Presale Frenzy and Exponential ROI MAGACOIN FINANCE is trading under $0.01 in presale , with a $0.007 listing target and 100 billion total supply—45% reserved for early access. Analysts are projecting 35x to 50x returns, and some models suggest up to 12,800% ROI if momentum continues. Wallet activity is spiking, and repeat buyers are piling in, positioning MAGACOIN as one of the most watched early-stage plays of the year. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength and Ecosystem Growth SOL is consolidating between $158 and $183, with analysts eyeing a potential breakout toward $210 if momentum holds. Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, but its upside is expected to be steady rather than explosive, making it a solid but less dramatic investment compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE . Trump (TRUMP): Volatility and Political Backlash Trump’s meme coin has seen dramatic price swings, recently dropping 16% after a controversial gala and triggering political backlash. While the token generated over $324 million in trading fees, the vast majority of retail investors lost money as insiders profited. The project’s price has collapsed from $74.34 at launch to $14.44, highlighting the risks of hype-driven meme coins. XRP: Bullish Technicals and Institutional Interest XRP is trading around $2.34, with strong support at $2.31 and forecasts suggesting it could reach $8 by year-end if bullish momentum holds. Institutional adoption and regulatory clarity are fueling optimism, but XRP’s upside is more gradual compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale potential. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Final Thoughts While SOL, TRUMP, and XRP remain strong market players, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top opportunity for outsized gains this cycle. With up to 12,800% upside still in play and traders moving fast to secure positions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the clear choice for investors seeking explosive returns.

Will it surge past $3,000 or fall to $2,380? Meanwhile, Solana 's behavior in this scenario could catch traders off guard. The unfolding dynamics between these major cryptocurrencies promise insights into potential market growth. Ethereum Experiences Mixed Trends Following Recent Price Movements Ethereum saw a rise of 40.09% over the past month, marked by daily fluctuations between 1468.66 and 2037.85. However, the last six months reflected a decline of 30.16%, indicating ongoing bearish pressure. This behavior shows short-term gains while long-term trends remain negative. Technical indicators suggest moderate strength, with the RSI at 63.58 and a momentum reading of 78.58. The Awesome Oscillator records a value of 338.55, supporting the recent upward movement. The current price action is centered around a support level at $1142.44 and resistance at $2280.82, with additional levels at $573.25 and $2850.01. Bulls are starting to test resistance, although movements are still somewhat sideways. Entering trades near support may be beneficial if the momentum persists, with profit-taking opportunities near resistance levels. Solana: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels Solana saw a notable 16.50% increase over the last month and a modest 4.27% gain over the past week, while it recorded a 28.15% drop over the last six months. The price fluctuated between a broader range of $109.63 and $171.27, showing moments of strength amid downturns over half a year. The current price is trading inside a range bounded by support at $71.65 and second support at $10.01, facing resistance at $194.93 and a second level at $256.57. Bulls seem present in the short term with recent gains, though no clear trend emerges. Trading ideas involve looking for dips near support and exits near resistance levels. Conclusion ETH is facing crucial resistance around $3,000. A breakthrough could signal a strong upward trend. If it fails, it might drop to $2,380. SOL could react differently, potentially surprising traders with unexpected moves. Both coins are worth close monitoring for significant trades.

45170864,https://invezz.com/?p=2736021,1748372620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Why smart investors are diversifying into yield-driven tokens like MUTM,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/27/why-smart-investors-are-diversifying-into-yield-driven-tokens-like-mutm/,"Over the past few years, Cardano (ADA) has become a favorite for long-term crypto holders due to its strong academic roots and focus on sustainability. However, a growing wave of prudent investors is now diversifying into newer projects that offer not just vision but also direct passive income. One of the top names gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a yield-driven DeFi protocol that is turning heads with its smart tokenomics, real utility, and explosive early growth. The market is shifting, and smart investors are moving with it—those who once held Cardano (ADA) alone are now reallocating portions of their portfolios to MUTM, not out of speculation, but because it’s delivering consistent returns and offering better incentives for long-term holders. Why Cardano (ADA) holders are switching gears Cardano (ADA) remains a solid project with long-term potential, but many investors are no longer satisfied with passive holding. Staking rewards in Cardano (ADA) often sit around 4-6% annually, which is lower than what next-gen platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are currently offering. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to deposit assets like ETH or DAI and earn attractive annual returns based on the platform’s pool utilization. For instance, depositing $10,000 worth of DAI into a Mutuum lending pool can generate an annual yield of up to 18%, depending on pool activity. This is a massive leap from Cardano (ADA)’s standard rewards—and it’s all happening while users retain access to their deposits via mtTokens, which grow in value automatically. P2C vs P2P: flexibility that brings yield and utility together A major appeal of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies in its dual lending architecture: Pool-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, users contribute assets into liquidity pools and earn interest passively, with the APY determined by real-time demand. Meanwhile, the P2P model lets users directly negotiate lending agreements with others. This is where holders of meme tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Dogecoin (DOGE) benefit. Unlike traditional P2C platforms that restrict such assets, Mutuum’s P2P system embraces them, opening new revenue channels for a broader audience. This flexibility gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a major edge over older DeFi systems and appeals to risk-tolerant investors who want higher, more personalized returns. At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its native token, MUTM. Unlike passive tokens that simply exist for governance or speculation, MUTM plays an active role in the ecosystem. Staking MUTM or mtTokens in safety modules grants holders a share of passive dividend distributions. These dividends are funded through a portion of protocol revenue, which is used to buy MUTM from the market and redistribute it to loyal users. This means that by holding and staking MUTM, you not only gain from price appreciation but also from a consistent stream of additional tokens—adding layers of income to your portfolio. Over 11,500 users have already jumped in, driving the token’s momentum into higher gear. Triple returns in 90 days: real numbers, real profits Since its early phases, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has made early adopters very happy. In just under 90 days, those who joined in Phase 1 of the public sale have already seen a 3x return. With the price of MUTM now at $0.03, compared to just $0.01 in Phase 1, investors have seen clear and measurable profits. With the current phase targeting $9.3 million in raised capital and the token supply fixed at 4 billion, the opportunity to maximize gains is shrinking with each new round. Entering now allows new users to still ride the exponential curve—later phases will offer reduced margins for the same risk. Security is a non-negotiable in DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking it seriously. The platform underwent a thorough CertiK audit, completed in May 2025, after an initial request in February. Using a combination of static analysis and manual review, CertiK validated the robustness of Mutuum’s smart contracts, giving investors peace of mind in an industry still plagued by unreliable code and sudden collapses. The CertiK seal of approval not only boosts confidence but also sets Mutuum apart from newer unverified platforms. Strategic roadmap and upcoming beta launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just about hype; the roadmap reflects deep planning and long-term execution. The team is preparing for the upcoming beta release, which will include advanced user dashboards, real-time yield tracking, and integration of new assets for lending and borrowing. This development aligns with the broader goal of creating a user-first, yield-focused DeFi hub. As beta access nears, the community is preparing for the next growth spike, and historical data shows that major announcements often lead to significant price movements. For anyone watching the crypto space closely, it’s clear that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is no longer just an emerging project—it’s positioning itself to reward early believers. From yield farming to passive dividends, from a fully audited protocol to a unique dual lending model, MUTM is becoming a must-have asset for those who want more than just speculative gains. Don’t wait until MUTM hits a higher phase with thinner profit margins. Act now, while the token is still priced attractively and the protocol continues to gain momentum. Smart Cardano (ADA) holders are already rebalancing their portfolios. The question is—will you be part of the next wave of winners?

What Are the Key Levels?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-mega-rally-has-stalled-whats-next-what-are-the-key-levels/,"Cryptocurrency analysis company MakroVision stated in its latest technical analysis report that Bitcoin continues its upward trend. The report stated that the leading cryptocurrency broke the $ 102,000 resistance and then surpassed the first extension target at $ 107,365. According to the analysis, Bitcoin is currently moving towards a new liquidity zone at around $ 112,500. MakroVision states that this rise is technically healthy and has a controlled structure. According to the analysis, the rally that started above $ 102,000 has an impulsive structure, while the pullbacks have been short-lived and limited so far. This shows that the market is still driven by buyers and the upward dynamics continue strongly. Related News: Google Publishes Scientific Paper That Could Change What We Know About Bitcoin: “20 Times Easier to Break Than Previously Thought” The first significant resistance level against Bitcoin stands out as $111,200. This level is notable because it is both a Fibonacci 0.618 extension point and a region of intense liquidity. If this level is broken to the upside, analysts consider $121,100 as the next target. This point is seen as a 1.236 extension target on the larger time frame. On the other hand, some critical support levels that investors should follow in case of a possible pullback were also included in the analysis. While it is stated that $ 107,365 works as support in the short term, the $ 106,455 level stands out as a stronger and strategic support area. It is also stated that as long as it remains above $ 102,000, the general technical structure is not disrupted and the upward momentum continues. *This is not investment advice.

This comes as some countries on the continents begin to explore clear rules for digital assets. With more government support, Africa could become a major part of the global crypto world. Blockchain is positioning itself to benefit from this shift. Nigeria to Lead The Blockchain.com Expansion Strategy Blockchain.com has set its sights on Nigeria as its key market in West Africa. According to Owenize Odia, the company’s general manager for Africa, Nigeria is Blockchain.com’s fastest-growing market. In a recent interview, Odia said Nigeria has made strong progress in shaping a clear set of rules for the crypto industry. He also revealed that Blockchain.com plans to open a physical office in Lagos in the second quarter of 2025. This move comes after Nigeria introduced a new investment law that allows crypto exchanges to apply for licenses. This law shows the government’s growing interest in supporting the crypto space and allowing it to contribute to the economy. Ghana and Kenya Follow in Nigeria’s Footsteps While Nigeria leads the way, other African countries are also making moves to regulate crypto. Odia said that Ghana’s central bank has published draft guidelines that could lead to full regulation by September 2025. These steps suggest Ghana may soon allow crypto companies to operate under official licenses. Kenya is also studying how to manage the crypto sector. Although its progress is slower than that of Nigeria and Ghana, its government is conducting research that shows growing interest in building a safe and open digital finance system. South Africa Drives Growth Through DeFi South Africa is currently at the forefront of the continent’s crypto transformation. It has been leading in developing the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. A report from the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) shows that DeFi markets in South Africa are expanding quickly. Today, the country has over $27 million in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi services, which is expected to grow to $180 million by 2028. The top areas of DeFi use in South Africa include payments, lending and borrowing, and decentralized exchanges. Blockchain.com wants to be part of the growth as more African countries create better rules.

Two men fell victim to the P2P crypto scam involving three Russian nationals. South Korean police have arrested a Russian national linked to a violent robbery attempt in a staged cryptocurrency transaction involving 1 billion won, approximately $728K. The Russian man in custody in Busan is in his 20s. His two accomplices, who are also Russian nationals, fled the country shortly after the incident, and an international manhunt is now on. The Gangseo Police Precinct in Seoul confirmed on Tuesday that the arrest took place at approximately 3:40 p.m. The suspect is part of a group that allegedly staged a brutal ambush targeting Korean nationals involved in a peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency trade. One Russian suspect was arrested in South Korea The incident occurred on May 21, 2025, in a hotel in Gangseo District, western Seoul. According to police reports, the three Russian suspects lured 10 Korean men to a hotel under the pretense of conducting a P2P crypto trade involving a large sum of cash. The group told eight of the victims to wait in the hotel lobby and instructed the last two to come up to the designated room, where they would later be ambushed. As soon as they entered the room, the suspects, who were wearing protective vests and hiding in the bathroom, launched a sudden attack on the two unsuspecting men. They threatened the victims with a replica handgun and beat them with both a telescopic baton and their fists. The victims were bound with cable ties, and one suffered injuries before managing to escape. That victim fled to the hotel lobby and alerted the others waiting downstairs. The attackers attempted to steal a bag containing the 1 billion won prepared for the trade, but they were forced to flee the scene without the money once the rest of the group intervened. The police received an emergency report at approximately 8:30 p.m. regarding a bleeding man in the hotel lobby. Officers arriving at the scene found a cash counter, bulletproof vests, the replica firearm, and the baton used in the assault in the suspects’ hotel room. The Gangseo Police Precinct has issued a public statement encouraging anyone with relevant information about the fugitives to come forward. International manhunt for accomplices The morning after the robbery attempt , police requested an overseas travel ban under the identity used to book the hotel room. It was later discovered that one of the suspects had already boarded a flight out of South Korea within hours of the crime and that the second had escaped the country shortly after. Interpol has since been brought in to help track down the fugitives. A spokesperson for the Gangseo Police stated, “We have requested assistance from Interpol to track down the suspects who fled overseas. We are currently questioning the apprehended suspect on the motive and details of the crime and are considering filing for a pretrial detention warrant.” Investigators are now working to determine whether or not the crime was premeditated by a larger criminal group or an isolated attempt at theft. The group used tactical equipment, such as body armor and a cash counter were found in the suspect’s room. This suggests a high level of preparation and so the South Korean police have not ruled out the possibility of additional accomplices or links to organized crime.

PI remains up by 1.5% in a week, and while it is down by a hefty 33% in a fortnight, it holds on to a 17% increase in a month. However, its chart currently looks unpromising, with the formation of a bearish flag pattern suggesting that more falls may be on the way in the near term. Yet given how oversold the coin has become, it may not be too far from hitting a bottom, with Pi Coin’s long-term price prediction remaining promising. Will Pi Coin Break Down Further? Bearish Flag Forms – But Smart Traders Are Watching This Pi Price Prediction Pi Coin has had a very tough few weeks, given that it has fallen from a two-month high of about $1.57 on May 12 to $0.746 today, which is a drop of just over 50%. PI’s chart reflects this plunge and the resulting weakness, with its indicators nearing very oversold positions. Source: TradingView Not only has Pi Coin fallen formed a bearish flag in the wake of its plunge from $1.57, but it has just fallen below the flag’s support level (green). This signals the possibility of further falls in the shorter term, with PI potentially enough to sink below $0.60 in the next few weeks. That said, its indicators also highlight how the market has oversold it recently, with its 30-period average (orange) having been below the 200-period (blue) for over a month now. At the same time, its RSI is getting close to 30, a level from which it should bounce up. In terms of PI’s fundamental picture, it continues to suffer from the lack of listings from Binance and other major exchanges (e.g. Coinbase, Kraken). We want to hear from you! Should $PI be launched on #Binance ? Vote now on Binance Square and share your thoughts! Cast your vote https://t.co/gXvkN6nbqi pic.twitter.com/RZkCLdg8Yd — Binance (@binance) February 17, 2025 If such listings do not ever materialize, then the Pi Coin price could suffer an irreversible decline, since an absence of exchange support signals a lack of industry confidence in the token. On the other hand, the Pi Network has been doing things to bolster its overall utility, including the launch of the $100 million Pi Network Ventures fund earlier this month. This creates the reassuring impression that the Pi Coin team are playing the long game, so while its price could decline in the next one or two weeks, it should return to growth by the end of the year. It could hit $1.50 again by the end of Q3, and $3 by the end of Q4. Bullish New Alts with Strong Long-Term Potential Because of the risk that PI may not secure a listing from Binance and other big exchanges, many traders may already want to turn to alternatives for big, market-beating gains. Presale coins could be one lucrative option in this respect, given that the biggest and most popular sales can translate into big post-listing rallies. This doesn’t happen to every presale token, but one such coin with good prospects is MIND of Pepe (MIND) , which has now raised $10.6 million in its ICO.

As an AI agent, MIND of Pepe will have two main functions, which you can access by holding its native MIND token. Firstly, it will process huge amounts of data (e.g. social and trading) to produce real-time market analysis, helping MIND holders make better investment decisions. Secondly, it will use its insights into emerging trends to generate its own viral meme tokens, which could storm the market in the way that Fartcoin, for example, has. And in this case, holding MIND is the way to gain early access to its self-generated coins, before they hit exchanges. Unfortunately, the MIND of Pepe presale will end in just under 4 days, but you can still join by going to the token’s official website . It’s available at $0.0037515, but given how popular its sale has become, it could rise well beyond this price next week. The post Will Pi Coin Break Down Further?

KindlyMD’s move to buy 21 Bitcoin ( BTC ) comes a few weeks after David Bailey, the chief executive officer of BTC Inc., and crypto advisor of U.S. president Donald Trump, announced the launch of Nakamoto Holdings. The Bitcoin-native company, whose name pays homage to Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto , recently revealed an upcoming merger with KindlyMD. KindlyMD is a Nasdaq-listed integrated healthcare and healthcare data company looking to become the next Strategy. With its initial BTC purchase, KindlyMD says its on the path to making this quest a reality. The purchase of 21 BTC was completed at an average price of $109,027 per coin, representing a $2.3 million investment. Funds came from gross proceeds of $8.7 million raised through recent warrant exercises. “KindlyMD chose 21 BTC, which is one millionth of the total supply of bitcoin, as a symbolic first step on our journey to be the leading Bitcoin treasury strategy,” Bailey said. “There are many more milestones ahead and we can’t wait to continue to execute our roadmap with KindlyMD.” You might also like: Strive announces $750m private investment to buy Bitcoin Nakamoto Holdings’ launch followed Bailey’s $300 million raise in equity and convertible debt earlier this year. On May 21, KindlyMD shareholders approved the strategic merger and partnership with Nakamoto Holdings.

Commenting on the purchase, KindlyMD CEO Tim Pickett said: “This strategic purchase was possible after significant warrant redemption, which we believe reflects our investor’s support of the merger and in our confidence of Bitcoin as a store of value. We look forward to working diligently towards the closing of our merger with Nakamoto to further accelerate our Bitcoin treasury strategy.” KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings’ merger will close later in the year.

Investors’ belief that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates favors Bitcoin price upside. Stock markets around the world responded positively to the temporary suspension of import tariffs between the United States and the European Union, with the S&P 500 rising 1.5% on May 27. However, concerns over a global economic recession persist, capping Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) upside, especially since the baseline US import rates have been raised for most regions. Bitcoin remains antifragile and poised to outperform in uncertain times Given the growing investor uncertainty about economic conditions, Bitcoin hovering around the $110,000 level has taken investors by surprise as it consolidates the top-6 position as a global tradable asset by market capitalization. Investors now ask whether Bitcoin is becoming antifragile or if a drop below $100,000 is inevitable in a recessionary environment. Traders currently estimate a 41% chance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will maintain interest rates through September, a steep rise from just 2% one month ago. CME FEDWatch target rate probabilities. Source: CME Normally, a higher cost for capital is bearish for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. However, in this context, it also suggests potential liquidity injections from the Fed, given the unfavorable US fiscal outlook , where government spending exceeds revenue capacity. US President Donald Trump has called for lower interest rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious due to a strong labor market and rising inflation pressures, whether driven by tariffs or easy credit conditions. This tension helps explain why the S&P 500 has struggled to retake its February all-time high of 6,147 and why Bitcoin’s upside has also been limited. Bitcoin’s current market capitalization of $2.2 trillion now exceeds that of Google and Meta, which partially explains the $112,000 resistance level. Still, it would be inaccurate to suggest Bitcoin has decoupled from traditional markets; its 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has remained above 70% over the past four weeks. As such, if equities enter a bear market, Bitcoin is likely to face downside as well. 30-day correlation: Bitcoin/USD vs. S&P 500 futures. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Companies are currently reporting earnings for the first quarter, a period that predates the escalation of the trade war. As a result, the stock market may take longer to reflect the full negative impact, even as macroeconomic indicators show signs of contraction. The 6.3% drop in US durable goods orders in April, reported on May 27, could be the first signal of a weakening economy. US durable goods–new orders for April. Source: US Census Bureau However, even if corporate earnings for the first quarter fall short of expectations, this does not automatically mean the S&P 500 will suffer significantly. In fact, disappointing results could open the door for faster interest rate cuts, which tend to benefit companies by lowering financing costs and potentially stimulating consumer demand. Bitcoin's appeal as a strategic asset grows, Trump Media joins the party Bitcoin’s risk profile appears to have improved after Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans to acquire BTC following a $2.5 billion mix of debt and equity financing. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom,” Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said, according to Reuters. This development suggests that Bitcoin’s trajectory toward $112,000 is not solely tied to broader economic growth. Related: Bitcoin stalls at $110K but institutional investors continue gobbling up BTC The growing institutional and corporate interest in Bitcoin adds a new dimension to its market behavior. While macroeconomic trends and correlations with traditional assets still matter, Bitcoin is increasingly being framed as a strategic asset with utility beyond speculation. As such, its performance could diverge, at least partially, from that of equities, especially as adoption broadens among influential companies and investors. While the stock market may remain sensitive to macro data and earnings surprises, Bitcoin’s upside potential appears to rest on a mix of monetary policy, institutional positioning, and its emerging role as a hedge against systemic financial risk.

With a current price of just $0.03, this decentralized finance protocol is drawing serious investor attention thanks to its ambitious roadmap, audited smart contracts, and passive income mechanics. A projected price of $3 per token represents an explosive 9900% gain from today’s level — and that’s a rally seasoned traders have seen before in similar projects like AVAX and BNB. From $0.01 to $0.03: early investors already tripled Since launching its presale in Phase 1 at $0.01, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already surged to $0.03 in Phase 5, delivering a 200% return to its earliest backers. Over $9.3 million has already been raised, with more than 11,500 holders participating. Waiting any longer to invest only means settling for slimmer profit margins in later phases. The numbers don’t lie: those who jumped in early have already made three times their investment. This price action alone confirms that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another presale project. The market has responded, and it’s responding fast. With each phase introducing a price increase, later-stage investors are locking in lower gains while early movers are preparing for the long ride up. Clear roadmap, CertiK audit, and DeFi utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not operating in the dark. The platform has been rigorously audited by CertiK, one of the most respected names in blockchain security. The audit involved both manual review and static analysis, ensuring transparency and reliability. The token scan score of 70.00 further boosts confidence in its smart contract design. The roadmap is equally compelling. By the time the token launches publicly, a fully functional beta version of the Mutuum platform will be ready. This level of delivery before listing is rare and reflects the team’s commitment to utility and user experience. The beta launch is set to align with the platform’s move to the live phase, allowing new users immediate access to its services without delay. At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a non-custodial liquidity protocol that enables users to lend, borrow, or act as liquidators. Unlike traditional pool-based models (P2C) only, Mutuum also offers peer-to-peer (P2P) borrowing and lending. This means users can access a broader range of tokens, including volatile assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which are typically excluded from standard lending platforms. Mutuum’s lending protocol offers interest rates that automatically adjust based on market dynamics. If you deposit $5,000 worth of ETH into the platform’s liquidity pool, you’ll start earning passive income instantly. Depending on the utilization of the pool, you will earn an annual return of up to 12%. These returns compound as interest is paid out through the mtToken system, which tokenizes user deposits and grows in value over time. MUTM token: the engine behind the ecosystem Holding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers more than just speculative value. The token serves multiple functions across the platform. First, MUTM fuels the protocol’s dividend mechanism. A portion of the platform’s revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. These are then distributed to users who stake mtTokens in designated contracts, creating a passive dividend model that directly rewards long-term participants. Imagine this: you stake your earned mtTokens, and the protocol rewards you by purchasing MUTM from open markets and distributing them to you. This system turns staking into a revenue-generating activity while creating constant demand for the token — which supports upward price pressure. Historical parallels: 100x plays aren’t new We’ve seen similar stories play out before. Early investors in AVAX saw their tokens rise from under $0.50 to over $100. Binance Coin (BNB) famously climbed from its sub-dollar presale days to an all-time high of nearly $700. These projects had clear utilities, dedicated communities, and active development — exactly what Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating now. MUTM sits in the same starting lane as those giants once did. It’s undervalued, underexposed, and building fast. The difference is that the market today is even more mature, and DeFi has proven itself as a long-term trend, not just a passing fad. And the team isn’t stopping there. A $100,000 giveaway campaign is ongoing, adding even more incentive to join the ecosystem early. With multiple exchange listings on the horizon and the official token launch approaching, the FOMO is justified. A $1,000 investment at $0.03 can turn into $15,000 Let’s talk numbers. Investing $1,000 in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at the current $0.03 price secures roughly 33,333 tokens. If the price hits $0.45, your investment would be worth $15,000 — that’s a 15x return. This projection isn’t based on fantasy. It’s based on real market mechanics, growing user demand, and expanding utility. And that’s not even the final goal. The roadmap and investor sentiment are both pointing toward a long-term target of $3. That’s where the 9900% figure comes into play — and where early investors will find themselves in a league of their own. Later investors are always left with fewer gains. That’s the nature of structured presales. Phase 6 of the presale is already priced at $0.035, a 16% jump from the current $0.03. Every phase that passes is another lost opportunity. Now is the window to get in before the price crosses key thresholds and the public rush begins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than a DeFi project — it’s an income engine, a community-powered protocol, and a smart investment backed by data and delivery. While the market scans for the next 100x token, the answer is already forming, and it’s priced at just three cents.

He alluded to fundamentals and technicals, which could spark this parabolic rally. What Could Spark The XRP Price Rally To $12 In a YouTube video, Cryptoinsight highlighted the Dubai Land Department’s recent move to launch a tokenization platform on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as one of the catalysts that could spark the XRP price rally to $12. He also mentioned other recent partnerships and major moves Ripple has made as factors that could contribute to the price surge. Related Reading: $10,000 XRP Theory: Factors Analyst Shares Scenarios That Could Drive Growth One is the crypto firm’s acquisition of the prime broker Hidden Road, which is expected to boost the XRP Ledger’s utility. This is ultimately bullish for the XRP price as the network’s native token. The crypto analyst also mentioned the alleged link between Hidden Road and the DTCC, which enables the prime broker to process trillions of dollars in US Treasury trades daily. Cryptoinsight also noted that Ripple has acquired a payments license in Dubai, which is bullish for the XRP price, since it is the native token of the crypto firm’s payment services. He alluded to reports of the crypto firm allegedly looking to acquire USDC issuer Circle and the XRP ETFs, whose approval odds continue to soar. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently discussed crypto ETFs, which the analyst believes could be a hint that these ETFs will be approved soon. Lastly, he mentioned the XRP lawsuit as another event that could be a catalyst if the long-running legal battle ends soon. Cryptoinsight predicts that the XRP price rally to $12 could happen in the next few months. From a technical perspective, he also highlighted bullish indicators like a bull flag that had formed on XRP’s weekly chart. The crypto analyst stated that momentum is starting to reverse to the upside and that buyers could step in soon. The Altcoin On The Verge Of A Local Low In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the XRP price hasn’t made a local low yet but is on the verge of doing that. She remarked that all signs point to a retest of the $2.25 to $2.26 zone. The analyst added that this is a major structural support that aligns with the macro .382 retracement and has been a key level for the last six months. Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion To $5.9: Current Consolidation Won’t Stop XRP From Growing If that support zone holds, she claimed it could mark the base for a new wave toward $2.70. However, if it breaks, the deeper support levels at $1.90 and $1.55 would come back into focus, meaning that the altcoin could still drop below the psychological $2 level before the next leg up. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.30, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Futures Say Yes, Charts Say “Any Minute Now” (XRP Price Prediction)",https://cryptonews.com/news/is-a-massive-xrp-move-coming-derivatives-say-yes-charts-say-any-minute-now-xrp-price-prediction/,"XRP (XRP) has dipped by 1% over the past week, consolidating below $2.60 — but rising futures activity could change that soon, raising bullish XRP price prediction hopes. Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have gone up slightly by 8.4% and currently stand at $2.2 billion as Bitcoin (BTC) seems determined to retest its latest all-time high of nearly $112,000. Even though the token’s price action has been relatively calm, the futures market has been quite active, according to data from CoinGlass . Open interest in XRP futures across top exchanges have increased since May 7 from $3.6 billion to $4.8 billion – a 29.7% increase in less than a month. However, during this period, the price has gone up by just 8.5% from $2.13 to $2.31. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Drop to $2 Before Rising to a New All-Time High XRP’s daily chart shows that the price has broken its bullish structure and has already retested this former support from below. This is a bearish indication in the near term but not necessarily a sign of an impending collapse as the market needs to raise liquidity for the next leg up. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) seems like the most plausible landing zone for XRP as it coincides with a key psychological level at $2 per token. It is highly likely that bears will push the price to this threshold to unlock additional liquidity in the next few days to catalyze a pronounced move. In bull markets, short squeezes tend to be one of the most effective ways to propel the price of an asset higher. Hence, a break below $2 could be what the token needs to recapture buyers’ interest and support a bullish XRP price prediction to $3 at least. Patient investors and traders will benefit the most if they wait for the best entry, which is probably the $2 level. In the mean time, as Bitcoin reaches $110,000, the first milestone of a crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) could soon be hit and, with it, an attractive reward for token holders will be unlocked. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Pays Out Bitcoin to Holders BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is an innovative meme coin presale that introduces a reward mechanism tied to the performance of the top crypto – Bitcoin. Rewards are distributed to token holders every time that BTC reaches a new price milestone, the first of which sits at $125,000. Once the price gets to that level, a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. This will foster scarcity and should result in an immediate uptick in its price. Next up, once the price reaches $125K, token holders will receive a direct airdrop of Bitcoin tokens. This system repeats every time that BTC adds $25,000 more to its price, starting at a baseline of $100K.

The suspects lured 10 Korean men to a Seoul hotel, ambushing two of them in a room prepared with replica weapons, cable ties, and body armor. Authorities have confirmed that at least two suspects fled the country after the incident. South Korean police have arrested a Russian national in connection with a violent robbery attempt linked to a fake cryptocurrency deal in Seoul, according to a report by local news outlet JoongAng Daily on May 27. Authorities said the suspect, a man in his 20s, was taken into custody in the city of Busan on Tuesday afternoon. He is accused of assault and attempted robbery involving 1 billion won, or roughly $730,000, in cash. Source: JoongAng Daily South Korea Police Bust Violent Robbery Disguised as Crypto Trade According to the Gangseo Police Precinct, the incident happened on May 21 at a hotel in Seoul’s Gangseo District. Police say the suspects lured 10 Korean men to the hotel under the pretense of a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transaction. Eight of the victims were asked to wait in the lobby, while two were invited to a room upstairs to finalize the deal. The suspects had prepared for an ambush inside the room, hiding in the bathroom, wearing protective vests. As the two Korean men entered, the attackers jumped out and assaulted them, with one of the suspects carrying a replica handgun. The victims were tied with cable ties and beaten with a telescopic baton and fists. The situation escalated quickly as one of the victims managed to escape and ran to the lobby, where he warned the others. The attempted robbers tried to flee with a bag containing the cash but failed when the rest of the group intervened. Police received a report at around 8:30 p.m. about a bleeding man in the hotel lobby. When officers arrived at the scene, they discovered the attackers had already fled. A search of the hotel room turned up a replica firearm, protective gear, a telescopic baton, and a cash counter, items investigators believe were prepared specifically for the planned theft. Authorities identified the suspects through the name used to book the hotel room. The next morning, authorities filed a travel ban request using the name registered for the hotel booking. However, it was later confirmed that one suspect had left South Korea shortly after the incident. A second accomplice is also believed to have fled the country. “We have requested assistance from Interpol to track down the suspects who fled overseas,” a police official said. “We are currently questioning the apprehended suspect on the motive and details of the crime and are considering filing for a pretrial detention warrant.” Investigators believe the robbery was carefully planned, using the promise of a crypto trade to lure victims into a trap. The suspect now in custody may face serious charges as police work to locate the remaining fugitives. The investigation is ongoing as authorities continue efforts to capture the remaining suspects and uncover more details about the planned heist. South Korea Busts Scam Ring as France Faces Brutal Kidnappings The arrest of a Russian national in Seoul over a staged crypto deal and armed robbery attempt coincides with a growing wave of violent and organized crypto-related crimes globally. In South Korea, authorities on May 14 dismantled a large-scale crypto investment scam , arresting 25 people linked to four criminal organizations. According to the Jeju Metropolitan Police Agency, the group defrauded at least 48 victims of nearly 734 million won (around $540,000) by posing as investment advisers and luring victims to fake crypto platforms. Victims were shown fabricated profits through manipulated dashboards and encouraged to invest more. When they tried to withdraw funds, scammers either delayed the process or disappeared altogether. Meanwhile, in France, police have intensified crackdowns after a string of violent kidnappings targeting crypto-linked people. In one case, a victim’s finger was severed to pressure a ransom payment. A shocking attempted kidnapping unfolded in central Paris when armed, masked men tried to abduct the daughter of a prominent cryptocurrency executive and her two-year-old child in broad daylight. #Crime #Crypto https://t.co/LmQxccrcJr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 13, 2025 Another attempted abduction involved the daughter of a crypto exchange CEO. Authorities believe both incidents are tied to a single criminal network operating across multiple regions. Authorities across both countries are warning of a sharp rise in organized criminal activity targeting the crypto sector, with scammers and kidnappers exploiting both digital and physical vulnerabilities.

One Analyst Thinks $420 Is Just the Beginning,https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-next-leg-up-analyst-thinks-420-is-just-the-start/,"Ananda warned that those still sidelining SOL may miss out, highlighting a bullish reversal structure with parabolic potential shaping the mid-term Solana price outlook . Their analysis notes macroeconomic shifts as a potential catalyst for altcoins, with the US Federal Reserve expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming months. For now, however, the broader altcoin market remains stagnant as US-EU tariff tensions rise and investors flock to safe-haven assets like Bitcoin and gold amid a weakening dollar. Analyst Anticipates Parabolic Move Beyond $420 Mastor Ananda highlighted a “textbook” rounded bottom pattern breakout—spurred by an 80% climb since the mid-April market bottom—has set Solana on the path to new all-time highs. SOL / USDT 1-day chart, rounded bottom pattern. Source: TradingView / Master Ananda. With a break above its baseline resistance at $160, the level has now flipped to support as a psychological stronghold for the market. As long as the $160 level holds, Ananda believes the current trend is likely to extend to higher Fibonacci resistance levels, culminating in the 1.618 extension at around $420—a 120% gain. Even if the Solana price dips below $160, Ananda suggests it would likely be a temporary shakeout or bear trap, emphasizing that $420 may not even mark the final target. Solana Price Analysis: How Much Further Could Solana Go? The rounded bottom breakout could ignite a move through a broader cup-and-handle pattern dating back to late 2021, currently trading within the descending channel forming the handle. SOL / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle pattern. Source: TradingView / Binance. While momentum from the immediate breakout has cooled into consolidation between $160 and $190, Ananda maintains that Solana’s bullish trend remains intact. Technical indicators support this view. The RSI holds steady above the neutral 50 mark at 53, signaling that buying pressure continues to outweigh selling on higher timeframes. More so, the MACD line continues to build its lead on the signal line following a golden cross. This formation typically coincides with longer-term uptrends on the weekly chart. The last of which corresponded to the post-election and inauguration rallies—an explosive period which took the Solana price to new highs. If the rounded bottom pattern completes at $300, the next leg toward $420 could act as a mid-point to the full 160% breakout implied by the broader cup-and-handle formation. This Fleeting Opportunity Could Ride The Next Solana Rally New ICO Solaxy ($SOLX) could be the biggest beneficiary of a Solana price breakout as its first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution, filling a critical gap in the ecosystem. Solana has long lacked this capability, limiting its DeFi and cross-chain use case—until now. By processing transactions off-chain and finalizing them on Solana, Solaxy significantly reduces congestion and lowers transaction costs, while offering seamless interoperability across both blockchains. With over $40 million in its ongoing presale , investors are already rallying behind the project. When demand for Solana increases, it could be the one to reap the fresh ecosystem liquidity. There are just 20 days before this phase ends, unlocking the untapped demand of exchanges. You can keep up with Solaxy on X and Telegram , or join the presale on the Solaxy website .

After spending approximately six months in a consolidation phase, the cryptocurrency is showing signs of renewed strength. Market observers believe this could result in a breakout, with price projections reaching as high as $4. Market Context and Background The consolidation trend began in early December 2024, shortly after XRP experienced a dramatic rally that saw it climb by 480%, reaching a peak of $2.90. This upward movement followed political developments in the United States, specifically the election victory of President Donald Trump in November 2024. Before the rally, XRP had been trading near $0.50. Since reaching its local high, XRP has struggled to maintain upward momentum, entering a phase of sideways trading that has persisted for half a year. Data from technical analyst Poseidon indicates that during this period, XRP’s price has fluctuated within a relatively narrow band, primarily between $2.00 and $3.00. $XRP 6 months of consolidation now appears to be reconsolidating before new highs. We’ve seen a failed breakdown, a reclaim of the H12 EMA 200, and now a first higher high, all clear signs of strength. If the price breaks above $2.4, I'm targeting $4 next. pic.twitter.com/uDOHxwblcH — Poseidon (@CryptoPoseidonn) May 26, 2025 Technical Analysis and Key Indicators According to Poseidon, the $3.00 level has acted as a significant resistance point, with bears consistently defending it. Conversely, bulls have managed to hold the $2.00 support level. While the token has briefly moved outside this range, reaching as high as $3.30 in January 2025 and dropping as low as $1.60 in April, it has repeatedly reverted to the $2.00–$3.00 zone. Poseidon’s most recent assessment highlights three key indicators suggesting potential upward movement. These include a failed breakdown attempt, XRP reclaiming the 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 12-hour chart, and a newly established higher high of $2.36, observed on May 26, 2025. He also identified a descending trendline that has suppressed upward movement since the local high of $2.60 on May 12. Poseidon states that breaking above this trendline, specifically surpassing the $2.40 resistance, would confirm a bullish breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Based on current technical conditions, Poseidon anticipates that XRP could reach $4 in the near term. This projection represents a 72% increase from the current trading price of approximately $2.33. If realized, this would mark a new all-time high for the asset. Additional Insights from Market Experts Another market analyst, Dom (@traderview2), has been monitoring the XRP/USOIL pair. He suggests that XRP is demonstrating underlying strength despite recent market fluctuations. Dom identifies $2.47 as the critical resistance level on the USD chart. Like Poseidon, he believes that breaking above this level would validate the beginning of a sustained upward trend, while any movements below it do not indicate a change in the broader trend. Following months of limited volatility within a defined trading range, XRP appears to be gaining momentum. With several technical indicators aligning and analysts watching closely, expectations are growing for a breakout that could lead to a significant price increase. If the predicted move materializes, XRP could reach the $4 mark, setting a new record in its trading history.

Hassett’s remarks came after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple for iPhones made outside the U.S. The American economist noted that everybody is trying to make it seem like a catastrophe if there’s a tiny little tariff on them to try to negotiate down the levies. He believes they’ll see the outcome, but the administration doesn’t want to harm Apple. Trump threatens to impose 25% tariffs on Apple Did Trump eat a bad prawn with his crypto mates last night? Back on his mobile threathening 50% tariffs on Europe and 25% on Apple if iphones are not made in the US. — Ole S Hansen (@Ole_S_Hansen) May 23, 2025 U.S. President Donald Trump announced on May 23 that he expects Apple’s iPhones that will be sold in the U.S. to be manufactured and built in the country, not India or anyplace else. Trump warned that if Tim Cook of Apple doesn’t comply, the company must pay a tariff of at least 25% to the U.S. Early last month, Trump argued that the U.S. has the workforce and the resources to build iPhones in the U.S., but nobody at Apple has come out to back that claim. Former President Barack Obama asked the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs about making an iPhone in the U.S., and he said at a dinner with Obama in 2011, “Those jobs aren’t coming back.” Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan revealed in April that the iPhone 16 Pro, which is currently priced at $1.199, could increase by 25% based on labor costs alone. Estimates would make it a roughly $1,500 device. Wedbush’s Dan Ives pegged a U.S. iPhone’s price at $3,500 shortly after Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement. Ives also estimated that Apple would need to spend $30 billion over three years to move 10% of its supply chain to the U.S. “If you think that Apple has a factory some place that’s got a set number of iPhones that it produces and it needs to sell them no matter what, then Apple will bear those tariffs, not consumers, because it’s an elastic supply.” -Kevin Hassett, Director of the U.S. National Economic Council. Trump’s threats came after Apple reported investing $1.5 billion into manufacturing in India through its long-time manufacturer Foxconn to shift iPhone production away from China. Trump revealed his discontent over the move during last week’s Middle East tour. Trump spotlights Apple’s supply chain In his new book, The Capture of the World’s Greatest Company, Journalist Paul McGee argues that Apple’s massive foreign investment and involvement in China were necessary in transforming the country’s economy and tech sector. He also added that Apple contractors like Foxconn passed on tech expertise to Chinese competitors like Huawei. The iPhone contractor has come under scrutiny for worker conditions over the years, including in 2011, when the company installed nets around some of its buildings after a rash of worker suicides. Oversight groups also argued that Foxconn’s work is grueling and that workers are pressured into working overtime. Apple’s CEO mentioned in a 2017 interview that another issue is that American workers don’t have the necessary skills. Cook acknowledged there aren’t enough tooling engineers in the U.S. According to him, those engineers work on and configure the machines that take the sophisticated designs from Apple, which come in the form of computer files, and transform them into physical objects. U.S. President Donald Trump announced a $10 billion investment from Foxconn to build plants in Wisconsin in 2017. The iPhone maker was never officially attached to Foxconn’s Wisconsin plant, but that didn’t hinder Trump from claiming Apple would build three big plants in the U.S. Mohan noted that even if iPhones could be assembled in America, much of what goes into an iPhone comes from countries around the world, all of which the U.S. has imposed tariffs on. Most iPhones are made in Asia; TSMC manufactures their processor in Taiwan, the display is produced by South Korean companies such as LG or Samsung, and the majority of other components are made in China. Mohan believes Apple will face tariffs on most parts unless it can secure waivers for individual parts. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The project will use its cash and coin treasuries to cover the losses. Cetus Protocol may use its own reserves to cover the losses from its recent hack. The DEX lost $223M during one of its most active trading periods, seeking multiple pathways for recovering the funds. Cetus Protocol announced plans for a conditional recovery, where it will use its own funds while still expecting to regain access to the hacker wallets blacklisted on SUI. 📢 New Progress Update – A Path Forward Together!

Today, we want to share a meaningful step… — Cetus🐳 (@CetusProtocol) May 27, 2025 Additionally, the SUI Foundation announced it would support Cetus DEX with a bridge loan to speed up the fund recovery. The secured loan will attempt to compensate for losses in full quickly and will be added to the Cetus treasury. The loan and reserves will cover the funds that have been bridged out of the Sui network and are only partially recoverable in the best of cases. SUI Foundation has not set aside funds for the frozen assets on its network and may work toward a future solution for on-chain recovery. In that case, the community and validators will have to reach a consensus on the approach to unlocking and moving the funds. The hacker has not responded to the white hat deal offered by Cetus, leading to the next step in asset recovery. The recent hack analysis revealed the flaw lay with the Cetus Protocol DEX, which used a flawed math library. The hacker could manipulate the price of token pairs, allowing access to the available liquidity. Multiple pairs were affected, with losses of CETUS, SUI, and USDC. A part of the tokens were bridged to Ethereum and can be mixed, while $160M are still sitting in SUI addresses. Cetus now waits on the SUI community to vote on a way to move the funds from the hacker’s address. SUI has blacklisted the wallets through an emergency validator consensus but has not worked out a way to move the funds. Even in the case of a negative vote, Cetus will take care to start a fund recovery for liquidity providers and token holders. The significant overlap between the SUI and Cetus communities may lead to a favorable vote and a recovery of funds. CETUS and SUI recover market prices SUI itself continues to carry transactions, though its total value locked fell since the incident. SUI TVL slid from $2.13B to $1.74B. The SUI token recovered in the past days from $3.43 to $3.70, but the loss of liquidity from Cetus was felt by the entire protocol. The impact of Cetus was also felt in overall SUI activity. Active addresses fell from 1.7M daily and are now dipping under $300K. SUI was just breaking out with meme token trading, with Cetus becoming one of the major sources of on-chain activity. Following the message of the potential recovery, CETUS tokens also rallied, adding 23% within hours to $0.15. CETUS is still down from its quarterly peak above $0.23.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent volatility has created a notable liquidation pocket, analysts at crypto exchange Bitunix told crypto.news. On Tuesday, May 27, total crypto liquidations reached $211 million, with a clear bias toward long positions. Specifically, $131 million in longs were liquidated, compared to $79.84 million in short positions. Bitunix analysts interpret this imbalance as evidence of a long-side wipeout during Bitcoin’s recent dip to $108,000. As a result, they caution against entering overly aggressive long positions while BTC trades near this key support. “Short-term attention should be paid to the effect of support at $108,500–$109,000, and it is not recommended to chase higher. Analysts advise observing whether the $110,800–$112,000 pressure band is effectively broken before considering further positions,” Bitunix wrote.

Despite short-term risks, there are signs that Bitcoin’s long-term outlook is strong.

He made that announcement over the weekend, just before his SpaceX Starship rocket launch. According to a report from the Washington Post, Elon is stepping away from his role in Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency to focus fully on business. That sudden change in priority came after yet another outage hit X, previously known as Twitter. The outage over the weekend left thousands of users locked out. Earlier that same week, the platform had suffered a data center failure. Since Elon bought the company in 2022, X has seen frequent breakdowns. He addressed it directly on X, writing, “As evidenced by the uptime issues this week, major operational improvements need to be made,” adding that the “failover redundancy should have worked, but did not.” He also declared that he’s going back to “spending 24/7 at work.” That post landed hours before SpaceX was due to attempt the launch of Flight 9, following two failures earlier this year — in January and March — where the Starship rockets exploded. Elon says he’s done with politics, investors respond fast The rally in Tesla shares comes after a wider pattern of Elon scaling down his involvement in political activities. During Tesla’s April earnings call, he said he would “significantly reduce” his time working for Trump’s government department. In the 2024 election cycle, Elon had thrown billions of dollars into Trump’s re-election campaign and into various conservative political projects. But when someone on X posted about DOGE and his government reform efforts, Elon simply responded: “did my best.” In a separate interview at the Qatar Economic Forum, he said he plans to spend “a lot less” on campaign donations moving forward. Those comments, combined with the operational chaos at X and pressure mounting ahead of the next rocket launch, made it clear to investors that Elon had no room for distractions. Despite the stock rally, Tesla is still dealing with blowback from Elon’s political entanglements. Protesters have appeared outside Tesla showrooms, and the brand continues to take hits globally. In April, Tesla sold 7,261 vehicles in Europe, which was a steep 49% drop from the same time last year. The data came from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

According to a new Bloomberg report, PME says US money managers are allegedly risking significant business by “caving into pressures” from President Donald Trump’s administration by abandoning basic principles of responsible investing. Says Daan Spaargaren, PME’s senior strategist for responsible investing, “[US money managers] aren’t condemning what Trump is doing and how he is operating and how he is handling issues like climate change and demolishing the judiciary. We are worried about that.” The PME warns America’s investment industry that a Trump capitulation is prompting it to think twice about its US investments. The PME is reconsidering its $5.7 billion mandate with BlackRock Inc., after the world’s largest asset manager withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. A decision from PME is expected within weeks. Spaargaren says Trump’s actions that are raising concerns include attacking judges, countering America’s move to cleaner energies and the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. “[If asset managers] align their interests and their policies with the current administration in the US, then we are legitimizing also these steps and these practices by offering them our funds.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here’s what’s fueling the sharp rise in TVL, and why experienced teams and trusted integrations matter more than ever. While much of the crypto space continues to wrestle with weak funding rounds, user skepticism, and a painful hangover from past rug pulls, some projects are managing to break away from the pack. Total Value Locked (TVL)—a key metric of DeFi health—is on the rise across a few standout protocols, thanks to a mix of product innovation, smart integrations, and battle-tested teams. As of May 2025, the TVL across all decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and blockchains is approximately $85–90 billion, with Ethereum alone accounting for over $46 billion, more than half of the market. Likewise, Bitcoin’s Liquid Network surpassed $3.27 billion in TVL, reflecting growing interest in tokenized real-world assets on Bitcoin Let’s take a look at the most notable projects that have seen meaningful TVL growth in the last few months—and unpack why they’re surging when so many others are stuck in the mud. Spark Protocol Nearly Doubles TVL in One Month TVL Growth: +95.54% (now at $4.39 billion) Spark Protocol, focused on maximizing stablecoin yields and providing transparent, efficient lending and borrowing solutions, has come out swinging in 2025. A key subDAO within the Sky Protocol ecosystem (formerly MakerDAO), Spark has become a hub for DeFi lending thanks to its freshly launched Aave vaults. The term ‘vaults’ refers to smart contract-based liquidity pools where users deposit assets (like ETH, USDC, DAI, cbBTC, etc.). These vaults are ERC-4626 compliant yield-bearing and allow users to deposit and withdraw ERC-20 tokens supported by Aave V3. They automatically manage the supply and withdrawal of assets in the Aave Protocol while enabling vault managers to take a fee on the yield earned. What makes Spark especially powerful is its synergy with Sky. As users move funds between the two, seeking optimized yield opportunities, TVL climbs on both ends. With integrations that prioritize safety and efficiency, it’s no surprise Spark is leading this cycle’s DeFi conversation. Sky Protocol is Reinventing MakerDAO with Cross-Chain Yield TVL Growth: +55.59% (now at $5.86 billion) Sky Protocol is a major decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that evolved from MakerDAO, one of the earliest and most influential DeFi projects. Launched in 2024, Sky is showcasing that legacy doesn’t mean outdated. USDS is the protocol’s flagship stablecoin, upgraded from DAI. It is soft-pegged to the US dollar and can be minted by depositing approved collateral into smart contract vaults (formerly called CDPs). With high-yield USDS (now boasting 1.8 billion tokens in circulation), Sky is attracting new deposits by offering an eye-catching 12.5% APY. But it’s not just about yield. Sky’s expansion across chains like Solana and Base, combined with strategic partnerships, especially with Spark Protocol, has enabled a layered ecosystem where capital flows freely and rewards are competitive. Deflationary tokenomics for the SKY token adds incentive for long-term holders. Moreover, users can withdraw their supplied assets at any time, with no minimum or maximum restrictions and no liquidity lockups SparkDEX and Flare: A 500% TVL Explosion with USDT0 TVL Growth: +500% (surpassing $60 million) Here’s where experience really comes into play. SparkDEX , a decentralized exchange suite built on the Flare Layer 1 EVM chain, has posted extraordinary growth following its timely integration of USDT0, a cross-chain stablecoin designed to streamline liquidity between ecosystems. Since the integration, SparkDEX has added over 2,000 new users, pushed past $300 million in total trading volume, and now sees TVL growth exceeding $15 million per week. It grew from $15.9 million in February 2024 to over $80 million by February 2025, showcasing a 410% increase. The platform’s native analytics dashboard (sourced directly from Flare’s blockchain) offers real-time transparency, reinforcing user trust—something that’s rare in DeFi today. Flare, a scalable Layer 1 network with a focus on interoperability, also deserves credit here. By natively supporting USDT0, Flare enables DeFi apps like SparkDEX to skip complicated bridging mechanisms, reducing risk while deepening liquidity. What’s fueling SparkDEX’s momentum is its direct connection to some major players in the crypto space—QuickSwap, Lunar Digital Assets , and the team behind “The Aggregated” smash hit podcast. This isn’t just a random group of names; it’s a collective with a solid track record of building credible, high-impact products. Solana Shows Steady Growth with Real Utility TVL Growth: +2.41% (now at $7.22 billion)Solana continues to prove it’s more than a memecoin magnet. Its high throughput, low fees, and growing lending ecosystem are helping it quietly attract capital. Projects like Sky deploying on Solana are also contributing to the upward trend, as cross-chain liquidity becomes more viable. Avalanche and Tron: Smaller Gains, Still in the Game Avalanche TVL Growth: +8.55% (now at $1.19 billion)Tron TVL Growth: +4.97% (now at $4.91 billion)Avalanche benefits from Ethereum compatibility and targeted ecosystem incentives, while Tron remains strong in stablecoin-driven DeFi—especially in emerging markets. Lending protocol JustLend alone has helped Tron’s numbers move in the right direction. Why Experienced Teams Still Matter in DeFi In a landscape riddled with smart contract exploits, flash loan attacks, and all-too-frequent rug pulls, trust has become a core value. Teams like the one behind SparkDEX and Flare, who have proven track records with QuickSwap and other respected DeFi ventures, are showing why experience and a proven track record of results isn’t optional anymore. It’s not just about building a novel product. It’s about building one that works, earns user trust, and delivers transparent results. And that often comes down to the people behind the code. Take Roc Zacharias, for example. He’s the CEO of Lunar Digital Assets, a co-founder of QuickSwap, and has been instrumental in launching major projects like Polygon, QuickSwap, “The Aggregated” and Dogechain. The team’s work on The Aggregated podcast and their advisory roles throughout the DeFi space also speak volumes about their visibility and influence. They’ve consistently delivered on both innovation and insight, blending product development with thought leadership. All of this gives SparkDEX a rock-solid foundation to drive trust, foster innovation, and accelerate adoption, especially within the Flare ecosystem and potentially well beyond it. Market Reality Check: Not Everyone’s Winning While the projects above are thriving, they’re the exception, not the rule. Many early-stage builders are struggling to raise capital, hampered by the lingering mistrust created during 2022–2023’s wave of scams and collapses. Investors are cautious, and users are hesitant to deposit funds into protocols with unproven track records or unclear tokenomics. In this environment, hype alone won’t cut it. Protocols need utility, transparency, and a team that knows what it’s doing. Otherwise, even the best ideas are dead on arrival. The current DeFi market may not be a bull run, but it's far from dormant. A handful of standout projects, like Spark, Sky, SparkDEX, and Solana, are showing that growth is still possible with the right mix of yield, utility, and credibility. For new projects looking to break through, the lesson is clear: trust, transparency, and execution will always matter more than buzzwords and branding. And with USDT0, cross-chain yield strategies, and proven teams leading the way, the next phase of DeFi might just be more stable, trustworthy, and sustainable than the last.

Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi Model Mirrors Solana (SOL) Breakout Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/from-0-030-to-5-why-mutuum-finance-mutm-defi-model-mirrors-solana-sol-breakout-potential/,"The world of decentralized finance is rapidly growing, and smart investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big thing. One name catching serious attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With its innovative lending architecture and explosive user growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now drawing comparisons to early-stage Solana (SOL). While SOL rode the waves of utility and scalability to meteoric heights, MUTM is showing all the signs of repeating that success story—this time from a DeFi-first perspective. Early Growth with Deep Fundamentals In its current Phase 5 of presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $9.2 million and attracted more than 11,100 holders. The token is now priced at just $0.030, a 200% increase from the Phase 1 price of $0.01. Early adopters have already tripled their initial investment, and the profit window is tightening. With each phase, the entry price rises—meaning less upside for those who wait. Investors understand this, which is why interest and demand continue to climb at an aggressive pace. Smart Lending, Passive Income Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another DeFi protocol—it is redefining how digital assets are borrowed and lent. It offers two distinct models: a pool-based (P2C) system where funds are matched automatically, and a direct peer-to-peer (P2P) model where users customize their lending agreements. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in DAI into Mutuum’s liquidity vaults. Based on current utilization rates, this capital can earn you 8% to 12% annually, passively. That’s $400 to $600 a year, without selling your assets or actively trading. You also receive mtTokens, digital receipts that represent your share in the pool and the interest you accumulate. These can be redeemed at any time, assuming liquidity is available, which Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures by maintaining a protocol reserve buffer. This system offers complete transparency and control while letting your assets work for you. Why MUTM Isn’t Just a Token—It’s a Utility Engine The MUTM token itself is the fuel powering the entire Mutuum ecosystem. By holding MUTM, users can access benefits like staking rewards. Most importantly, those who stake mtTokens in designated safety modules become eligible for passive MUTM dividends, distributed during buyback cycles funded by protocol revenue. This unique mechanism means every protocol transaction—every loan issued, every interest payment made—feeds back into the value of MUTM. As usage expands, so does the pressure on the token’s price. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a mathematically driven growth model. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has engineered its tokenomics to encourage early adoption and long-term commitment. The presale is broken into eleven escalating phases, with supply and pricing carefully balanced to maximize upward price mobility. By the final phase, the token will cost $0.06, double today’s price. That alone should ring alarm bells for anyone sitting on the sidelines. Waiting costs you profit. Buying now means riding the wave that others will join later at a premium. Looking forward, as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) pushes toward its beta platform launch, expected around the time of the token’s public release, utility will drive real adoption. With plans to expand across multiple blockchains, add institutional-grade partnerships, and implement advanced risk analytics, the platform is poised to capture a significant slice of the DeFi market. Following Solana (SOL)’s Playbook for Growth Solana (SOL) scaled through speed, user onboarding, and real-world utility. It wasn’t just about hype—it was about how well the tech worked. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) follows a similar philosophy, offering real yield, transparent lending, and flexible user options with zero custodial risk. As adoption grows and more users plug into the Mutuum ecosystem, the compounding effect on MUTM’s demand will become unstoppable. With a live $100K giveaway underway and user interest surging, this is more than a hype cycle. It’s a community in motion, powered by a product that delivers real financial utility. The longer you wait, the more expensive MUTM becomes, and the less you stand to gain. Every new phase reduces the reward curve for newcomers, and right now, at just $0.030, the upside is massive. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor or new to DeFi, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a rare opportunity—one backed by solid tokenomics, real utility, and a partial roadmap’s initial phase already being executed with precision. As the beta platform nears and the ecosystem deepens, this is your chance to catch the wave early, before the mainstream headlines and exchange listings start driving the price closer to its real value. Start your DeFi journey now. Because the next time you look, MUTM won’t be 3 cents anymore—it’ll be closer to $5.

Its media-friendly narrative and celebrity endorsements helped push it to top-tier status — but its core mechanics remain unchanged. Dogecoin offers no smart contract capabilities, no native yield, and no supply cap. As a result, serious financial professionals are increasingly viewing it as a speculative tool, not a vehicle for sustainable wealth. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris has begun attracting quiet accumulation from financial advisors and portfolio strategists seeking real utility, fixed tokenomics, and protocol-level access. With its mobile-native mining model and decentralized daily earnings, BTC-S is now being recognized as one of the few under-the-radar opportunities with real fundamentals and growth architecture. From Speculation to Participation: A Shift in Strategy Bitcoin Solaris introduces Nova App, a mobile mining platform that transforms smartphones into income-generating assets. Users allocate 1–5 GB of storage and background CPU power, typically while the phone charges, and receive BTC-S tokens based on uptime. No staking, technical skills, or third-party platforms are required. This model appeals to financial professionals because it represents predictable, participation-based earnings rather than sentiment-driven performance. Unlike Dogecoin, which offers exposure to price movement alone, Bitcoin Solaris gives users the ability to earn directly from decentralized infrastructure — turning clients into contributors, not just holders. Technology That Scales with Adoption, Not Hype Bitcoin Solaris is built on a dual-layer blockchain designed for high throughput and broad accessibility. The Base Layersecures the network using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), while the Solaris Layer handles contract execution and mining logic via Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT). This architecture enables over 10,000 TPS with 2-second finality, ensuring the network can support thousands of mobile miners simultaneously. This system allows Bitcoin Solaris to function as both a high-performance blockchain and a passive income protocol — without congestion, bottlenecks, or reliance on Layer 2 patches. For institutional advisors and high-net-worth planners, that means scalability and long-term viability without speculative dependency. Audited and Verified for User Confidence Bitcoin Solaris has undergone extensive third-party auditing and governance verification. The Cyberscope audit reviewed contract logic and emission structure. The Freshcoins audit validated mobile mining at scale. KYC verification was also completed to ensure transparent governance and compliance alignment. These security layers are a prerequisite for advisors recommending digital assets in structured portfolios — especially those with client exposure mandates. Early Entry Offers Direct Protocol Exposure Bitcoin Solaris is now in Presale Phase 5, priced at 5 USDT per BTC-S token. The listing price is set for 20 USDT, with no future token creation beyond the fixed 21 million supply. Of that, 4.2 million tokens (20%) are allocated to presale participants. Unlike Dogecoin, which has an uncapped supply and no formal distribution model, Bitcoin Solaris offers a defined economic entry point — one that grants both price access and early mining participation before the Nova App goes live and user difficulty increases. In a new segment, Crypto Nitro highlighted the divergence between meme-driven assets and blockchain projects with reward logic. He outlines how Bitcoin Solaris’s fixed-supply model and Nova App structure make it a long-term holding for professionals and early-stage investors alike. Dogecoin helped bring attention to crypto — but attention alone doesn’t create wealth. Bitcoin Solaris offers what Dogecoin never did: structured tokenomics, real utility, and consistent user rewards. For long-term investors, the opportunity is clear — and it’s happening before the headlines.

It also engaged a digital forensics and incident response firm to conduct an investigation to determine whether any data may have been affected… Following a comprehensive and thorough review of the data involved, the city learned on May 14, 2025, that certain individuals’ personal information was affected by this incident.” The law firm says letters of notification were sent to those affected to inform them about the data breach, while offering free identity protection services to victims whose Social Security numbers were stolen. For now, the law firm says the Sheboygan city government is currently implementing enhanced security protocols to mitigate the risk of another data breach.

Some Traders Are Saying This XRP Rival Is the Next Generational Wealth Play Instead,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/dxrp-price-to-hit-10-some-traders-are-saying-this-xrp-rival-is-the-next-generational-wealth-play-instead,"XRP loyalists have waited years for this moment. With Ripple gradually shaking off regulatory shackles and bullish sentiment brewing, some traders are daring to whisper what once seemed unthinkable: a $10 XRP. It’s the kind of price target that would’ve been laughed off in bear market blues, but today, the charts are shifting, and optimism is back on the table. But just as XRP prepares for a long-awaited breakout, a new contender is quietly rewriting the rules. Remittix (RTX) isn’t chasing courtroom victories or legacy banking deals, and it’s building the future of money movement in real time. Priced under a dime, this Ethereum-based PayFi upstart is already making waves, offering lightning-fast crypto-to-fiat transfers without middlemen, banks, or borders. So, while XRP eyes $10, seasoned investors are asking a different question: What if the real moonshot is happening somewhere else? XRP makes a bold comeback as charts hint at a $10 breakout For years, XRP has lived under the shadow of legal battles and stalled momentum, but 2025 is telling a different story. Trading at $2.44 with an 18% weekly climb, XRP price has retested support and is holding strong, backed by a growing wave of bullish indicators. The most electrifying? A flip in the SuperTrend indicator on the 12-hour chart, something that hasn’t happened since XRP’s legendary 470% run. Source: TradingView Crypto analyst Ali Martinez was quick to point it out: the last time this exact signal flashed, XRP went vertical. If history repeats itself, we could be looking at a rally toward $10, a milestone that once felt out of reach. Technical minds like Peter Brandt add fuel to the fire. He sees a “half-mast flag” on XRP’s weekly market cap chart, a continuation pattern that, if it plays out, could push XRP’s valuation toward $500 billion. But there’s a catch: it needs to be resolved within six weeks. With a bullish RSI, Trump’s pro-crypto administration on the horizon, and XRP regaining its swagger, the setup feels almost too perfect. But in crypto, timing is everything, and not every rising star gets to shine alone. Remittix races ahead with wallet reveal and $15M raised, can it rewrite cross-border payments? For decades, moving money across borders has meant navigating a slow, expensive maze of banks, fees, and delays. Remittix is flipping that script. Targeting the $250+ trillion global payments market, it’s building a sleek bridge between the $183 trillion traditional banking world and the fast lane of blockchain tech. Unlike Stripe, Wise, or even Coinbase, Remittix does what others can’t: true crypto-to-fiat remittances. No intermediaries. No banking restrictions. Just near-instant payouts integrated with local networks, at a fraction of the cost. It’s not just fast, it’s built for everyone. From microtransactions to e-commerce, even the 1.4 billion unbanked can finally join the global economy. The big reveal? It's the upcoming non-custodial Remittix Wallet. Designed with real-world use in mind, it lets users hold RTX, send and receive crypto, and cash out, all with a few taps. Beta testing kicks off in Q3 2025, with a full launch to follow on iOS and Android. With over $15 million raised in its presale and more than 538 million RTX tokens sold at a price of $0.0757, Remittix is gaining serious traction. Now nearing 20,000 token holders, the project is building a powerful community of early adopters. This isn’t just hype; Remittix is executing on a vision to redefine global payments at scale. Final thoughts: Why XRP’s comeback might not be the whole story As XRP eyes its long-awaited $10 breakout, the crypto landscape is changing fast, and investors are taking notice. The old guard is regaining strength, but the new wave is already building. Remittix may not have XRP’s legacy, but with real-world use cases, serious momentum, and a global mission, it’s capturing attention as the next generational wealth play. In 2025, the race isn’t just about who moves first, but who moves best.

45171516,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=398091,1748376303,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/45171516.jpeg,Trump’s Tariff Threats Have Derailed Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum: Santiment,https://cryptopotato.com/trumps-tariff-threats-have-derailed-bitcoins-bullish-momentum-santiment/,"Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally last week collided headfirst with geopolitical turbulence, as U.S. President Donald Trump returned to making tariff threats, this time aimed at the European Union (EU). The move injected volatility into a market fresh off its all-time high (ATH) after BTC came within a couple of hundred bucks of flying past $112,000. It has since wobbled, trading sideways around $109,500 as traders weigh the implications of escalating U.S.-EU trade tensions. Tariff Whiplash In early April, the price of BTC dropped to about $82,000 after Trump announced a raft of tariff measures impacting multiple U.S. trade partners. The president claimed the new taxes were needed to correct deficits between the United States and other countries. At the time, the EU was hit with a 20% tax on exports to the U.S. Days later, Trump was at it again, hiking levies against Chinese imports to 104% . His actions pushed BTC prices even lower, with the cryptocurrency dipping to $74,600 and wrecking crypto trades worth more than $287 million. However, after about 24 hours, the White House announced that more than 75 countries had contacted the U.S. for tariff negotiations, prompting Trump to lower the taxes to 10%, although products from China suffered an increase to 125%. The good news gave Bitcoin a leg up to around $82,000 from around $77,000. As the first week of May closed, news emerged that the U.S. and China were planning high-level trade talks to iron out their differences. The reports stirred BTC into action, helping push it past $97,000 from a low of $94,000. Soon after, it went past $100,000, buoyed by easing geopolitical tensions, exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, and increased institutional demand. On May 22, the king cryptocurrency recorded a new ATH, with market watchers expecting it to move on to the next milestone quickly. However, once again, Trump threw a spanner in the works, announcing a 50% tariff on EU goods on May 23 due to stalled negotiations. BTC promptly tumbled 4% to $107,500, dragging altcoins like Monero (XMR) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) down 5.5% and 3.5%, respectively. Social media sentiment, tracked by analytics firm Santiment, mirrored the panic, with retail traders fleeing altcoins and “tariff” mentions spiking 300%, the largest surge since April’s market correction. Yet the selloff proved short-lived. By May 25, the American president paused the tariffs, citing ongoing talks. BTC responded soon after, clawing back to $109,500 per CoinGecko data. July 9: The Next Inflection Point Santiment said in a May 27 blog post that this “threat-then-delay” tactic, a hallmark of Trump’s trade strategy, has kept markets oscillating between fear and cautious optimism. For investors in crypto, where volatility is already baked into the landscape, this adds another layer of unpredictability,” noted analyst BrianQ “It’s hard to deny that digital assets are way more intertwined with global macro trends than they were a decade ago, back when crypto felt like a true free-for-all.” With the next tariff decision now delayed until July 9, Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory is hostage to geopolitics. If Trump proceeds, the fallout could cascade across equities, currencies, and yes, crypto. Until then, digital asset traders are caught between technical optimism and political unpredictability.

45171542,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68729,1748376304,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Researcher States Major Reason XRP Price May Keep Seeing Notable Rally,https://timestabloid.com/researcher-states-major-reason-xrp-price-may-keep-seeing-notable-rally/,"XRP’s price has remained relatively stable in recent weeks, but recent discussions in the crypto community suggest that its deflationary supply model could play a key role in driving future value appreciation. A well-known XRP researcher who goes by the name “SMQKE” recently brought renewed attention to the token’s economic structure. In a social media post , SMQKE emphasized that XRP has a declining supply due to a built-in burn mechanism that reduces the total number of tokens over time. This characteristic, he argued, contributes to the asset’s scarcity and could influence its price trajectory as adoption increases. XRP = Deflationary Which means: “…XRP token cannot be mined and its quantity will constantly decrease, and everything that exists in a limited amount and is actively used is becoming more expensive, therefore, with the growth of the network, the XRP price will increase… pic.twitter.com/CsJj6UK6e1 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 26, 2025 Built-In Deflationary Structure Unlike other cryptocurrencies that rely on mining or adopt inflationary token issuance models, XRP’s entire supply was generated at the outset, capped at 100 billion units. Each time a transaction occurs on the XRP Ledger , a small amount of XRP, typically 0.00001 units, is permanently removed from circulation. This design aims to prevent spam on the network but also introduces a natural deflationary element. According to official data, over 13.9 million XRP tokens have been destroyed through this process since the network launched. These tokens are not reallocated or recovered, making their removal permanent. XRP Ledger documentation and third-party research funded by Ripple confirm that no mechanisms exist to replace burned tokens or inflate the supply. At present, XRP’s total supply stands at approximately 99.98 billion, indicating only a modest reduction since inception. While critics argue that the burn rate is too slow to significantly impact market dynamics, proponents contend that increased transaction volume over time could make this supply contraction more meaningful, especially as global adoption grows. Broader Utility and Technical Advantages Beyond tokenomics, XRP offers features that support its utility in global payment systems. The XRP Ledger facilitates fast, low-cost transfers across a variety of asset classes, including fiat currencies, digital tokens, commodities, and securities. Transactions typically settle within five seconds, and average transaction fees remain a fraction of a cent, making XRP one of the most efficient options for value transfer. This performance gives XRP an advantage over legacy systems such as SWIFT , which can take several days and charge significant fees for international transfers.

Integrations with interoperability protocols like Axelar allow XRP to function within a broader web of digital assets, expanding its reach and enhancing liquidity. This cross-chain compatibility is considered a strategic advantage in the landscape of decentralized finance. Market analysts have noted that these interoperability capabilities, combined with XRP’s cost-efficiency and decentralization, make it competitive with stablecoins like USDC and upcoming central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), many of which are limited in scope and functionality. XRP’s long-term prospects appear increasingly favorable to some observers. As institutional interest grows and the number of transactions increases, the deflationary mechanism may begin to exert greater influence on supply dynamics. In theory, a continued rise in usage without an increase in supply could result in upward price pressure. Currently, the asset is valued at $2.33 , reflecting a slight increase of 0.12% over the past 24 hours. Despite short-term price fluctuations, supporters believe that the underlying fundamentals, including deflationary supply, expanding use cases, and cross-chain capabilities, position the token for significant growth over time.

CZ recently shared a message with the phrase, “Probably sold Bitcoin,” and added a laughing emoji at the end of his message. It is not known exactly who the Binance founder targeted with this mysterious statement, but there are some guesses among the cryptocurrency community. One of the biggest BTC bulls, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, said in a statement today that there is no need for interventions such as Proof of Reserves and audits for companies holding Bitcoin and that these create security vulnerabilities. Related News: New Development Regarding Ripple's Alleged Historic Acquisition Deal: Company Issues Statement Saylor, who received a huge backlash for this statement, may be the person CZ claims sold Bitcoin to. According to proponents of this theory, Saylor is not keen on measures such as Proof of Reserves because he sold Bitcoin. There is no official information that Saylor has sold BTC, and there is no information in recent SEC filings that they have sold BTC. However, purchases and sales that are not included in periodically filed SEC documents can be identified as onchain. We will see in the coming days if CZ is serious about this and if he really has Michael Saylor in his sights. *This is not investment advice.

45171771,https://cryptonews.com/?p=365464,1748376735,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45171771.jpeg,SOL Strategies Files for $1B Financing Flexibility to Capitalize on Solana Ecosystem Growth,https://cryptonews.com/news/sol-strategies-1b-financing-flexibility-solana-growth/,"Key Takeaways: SOL Strategies has filed a preliminary base shelf prospectus to give itself the option to raise up to $1 billion in capital. If approved, the company can issue a variety of financial instruments without repeating the full prospectus process each time. The CEO stated that the company may never use the full prospectus but views it as a strategic step to support potential growth. SOL Strategies, formerly known as Cypherpunk Holdings, has filed a preliminary short-form base shelf prospectus with Canadian securities regulators, planning to create up to $1 billion in financing flexibility, according to an announcement on May 27 . The move indicates the publicly traded company’s intent to position itself for future opportunities in the fast-growing Solana blockchain ecosystem. SOL Strategies Positions for Solana Opportunities with $1B Base Shelf Filing The filing, commonly referred to as a Preliminary Shelf Prospectus, is a draft version of a broader shelf prospectus. It allows a company to offer securities over time without having to submit a new prospectus for each offering. The document outlines details about the company and potential securities, although it does not include final figures such as pricing or the number of shares. https://twitter.com/solstrategies_/status/1927402949841469594 Once approved, the shelf prospectus would give SOL Strategies the ability to raise up to $1 billion through a range of financial instruments. These could include common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, units, debt securities, or a combination of these. These offerings can be made over a set period once the final base shelf prospectus is approved. For now, the company has no immediate plans to raise capital. The filing is a preparatory move, designed to increase flexibility for future financing efforts. If the company chooses to proceed with any offering, it will provide more details in a separate prospectus supplement. “The filing of a base shelf prospectus supports our growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem,” said Leah Wald, CEO of SOL Strategies. Wald emphasized that the company may never issue securities under the shelf prospectus, but wanted to be prepared as the Solana market expands. The Preliminary Shelf Prospectus must still be reviewed and accepted by Canadian regulators before any offerings can proceed. However, once finalized, the company will have a wide range of tools to raise capital as needed. By securing this flexibility, SOL Strategies is laying the groundwork to support long-term expansion and stay responsive in a fast-moving sector. SOL Strategies Doubles Down on Solana With $500M Staking-Linked Facility and Tokenized Equity Plans Following its $1 billion shelf registration, SOL Strategies is accelerating its pivot from passive investment to deep infrastructure involvement in the Solana ecosystem. In April, the firm secured a strategic financing agreement with New York-based ATW Partners, opening a convertible note facility of up to $500 million . The capital will be used exclusively to acquire SOL tokens, which will then be staked on SOL Strategies’ own validators, creating a direct link between the company’s capital structure and Solana’s staking economy. https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1915710036271129043 The initial $20 million tranche was expected to close around May 1. Interest on the notes will be paid in SOL and tied to staking performance, capped at 85% of the yield generated. The deal includes the option to convert the notes into common shares, providing ATW with upside while keeping incentives aligned. Cohen & Company Capital Markets is acting as placement agent and will receive a 4% fee. Less than two weeks later, SOL Strategies took another step toward integrating traditional finance with Solana’s on-chain ecosystem. On April 25, the firm signed a non-binding MOU with blockchain infrastructure firm Superstate to explore issuing tokenized equity on the Solana blockchain. The potential initiative would be one of the first to bring regulated public company shares on-chain. Superstate’s new “Opening Bell” platform would serve as the backend, offering real-time settlement and DeFi interoperability for tokenized SOL Strategies shares. While still exploratory and pending regulatory review, the move reflects the company’s long-term vision to institutionalize on-chain equity infrastructure.
