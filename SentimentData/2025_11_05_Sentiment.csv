Here’s Why",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/this-presale-token-will-hit-1-investors-say-heres-why/,"While the broader crypto market is caught in a storm of volatility and uncertainty, one under-the-radar project is quietly capturing the attention of smart money. Forget the meme coins and speculative hype—investors are piling into RentStac (RNS) , a presale token with a clear and inevitable path to the $1 mark. This isn’t wishful thinking. The immense confidence from early backers is built on a rock-solid foundation: a groundbreaking model that links the blockchain to the time-tested stability of the real estate market. As the project smashes through its fundraising goals, the conversation has shifted from if it will reach $1 to how much early investors will profit when it does. A New Paradigm: Real-World Assets on the Blockchain For too long, the crypto space has been a high-stakes casino. Fortunes are made and lost based on social media trends, whale manipulation, and speculative frenzy. RentStac is leading a revolution away from this chaos by offering something radically different: an asset backed by tangible, income-producing properties. The concept is simple yet powerful. RentStac acquires a portfolio of rental properties, and its (RNS) token represents a fractional share of this real estate. The rental income generated each month is then distributed directly to the token holders. This creates a “real yield” that is completely disconnected from crypto market volatility. The value of your investment is backed by property deeds and rental contracts, providing a level of security that purely digital assets can never match. It’s a game-changer for anyone looking to build sustainable wealth. The Inevitable Path to $1: A Simple Calculation The conviction that (RNS) will hit $1 is backed by the project’s explosive presale performance. Having already raised over $412,222, RentStac is demonstrating overwhelming market demand for a stable, asset-backed investment as it charges toward its first $1 million milestone. To reward its visionary community, RentStac is running a limited-time 100% token bonus. This offer doubles any investment made during the presale and is the engine behind the massive return potential. Let’s look at the numbers. The current presale price for (RNS) is just $0.025 per token. If you invest $500 today, you receive 20,000 RNS tokens. But with the 100% bonus, you get an additional 20,000 tokens for free, bringing your total to an incredible 40,000 RNS tokens. When (RNS) reaches the $1 valuation that investors and analysts project, your 40,000 tokens will be worth $40,000. Your initial $500 investment will have generated an extraordinary return. This simple math reveals the staggering upside and explains why early backers are so certain about the token’s future. What This Means for Your Portfolio The crypto market is maturing. The era of gambling on baseless hype is ending, and a new focus on real-world utility and tangible value is taking over. RentStac is not just part of this trend; it is leading it. The project offers a straightforward and powerful way to earn passive income from the stability of the real estate market, without the high costs and barriers of traditional property ownership. It’s the perfect hedge against market volatility and a foundational asset for any serious investor’s portfolio. With a groundbreaking model, immense investor confidence, and a presale bonus that doubles your stake from day one, RentStac isn’t just another token. It represents a new frontier in finance. The journey to $1 has already begun, and those who get in now are positioning themselves for the greatest rewards.

Data from Coinglass showed that more than $1.27 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out in 24 hours, with long traders accounting for nearly 90% of the losses. The slide follows Bitcoin’s break below its 200-day moving average near $109,800, a critical support zone that had held firm for four months. The Bitcoin price drop triggered widespread panic, pushing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 21, signaling “extreme fear.” Altcoins mirrored the weakness, with Ethereum (ETH) dropping 6% to $3,500, Solana (SOL) sliding 10% below $160, and XRP shedding 5.5%. Market analysts attributed the downturn to renewed uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy. Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks last week tempered expectations of a December rate cut, sending Treasury yields higher and weakening investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. ETF Outflows and Whale Selling Amplify Pressure Further fueling the downturn, Bitcoin ETFs saw significant redemptions, totaling $186.5 million on Monday, the largest single-day outflow since early 2024. According to Farside Investors, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was solely responsible for the drawdown, while other major ETFs like Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB remained neutral. The sharp ETF withdrawals coincided with an intensification of whale activity across exchanges. Data from Lookonchain revealed that long-term holders moved over 400,000 BTC, around 2% of the total supply, to trading platforms in the past 30 days. One early investor reportedly transferred 13,000 BTC ($1.4 billion) since October, while another whale deposited over 3,200 BTC to Kraken. Analysts suggest that these moves signal mounting profit-taking and a weakening of conviction among long-term holders. Despite rising self-custody activity on Binance, on-chain data from CryptoQuant indicated that dip-buying momentum remains fragile, suggesting accumulation may not yet be strong enough to reverse the trend. Bitcoin Price Support at $100K in Focus as Sentiment Turns Bearish With the Bitcoin price now hovering below key technical levels, analysts warn that a retest of the $100,000 psychological threshold is likely. Breaking this level could expose BTC to deeper losses, potentially reaching $77,000, aligning with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement zone and the April 2025 lows. Still, some strategists maintain that the long-term bull trend remains intact. “Each correction since 2023 has been followed by renewed accumulation near the 50-week moving average,” said Joel Kruger of LMAX. “The current pullback may be painful, but it’s consistent with Bitcoin’s cyclical structure.” As market fear intensifies and ETF flows remain negative, the Bitcoin price’s ability to defend the $100K level could determine whether the next phase is a temporary correction or the start of a deeper retracement.

According to an extensive fundamental analysis shared by Mr. Wall Street on X, the recent months of price stagnation and sudden drops are part of a larger accumulation phase dominated by institutional players. The overall setup, he argued, points clearly to Bitcoin’s eventual climb back above $120,000. Institutional Accumulation And Controlled Bitcoin Price Range The analyst’s first point is how Bitcoin has been trading within a 120-day range, oscillating between $107,000 and $123,000 to form what is a controlled consolidation range by institutions intended to push out weak retail investors. Mr. Wall Street noted that Bitcoin’s structure remains fundamentally bullish despite the prolonged sideways movement. Related Reading: Donald Trump Makes Nice With China, But Why Are The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Still Crashing? Each attempt to break out above $120,000 strongly or below the $107,000 support has failed, a sign that large institutions are actively controlling liquidity within this narrow band. Every crash within this period, including the one caused by the Binance sell-off and Trump’s tariff war with China, was met by strong institutional bids near the $107,000 zone, even when Bitcoin went on a flash crash to $101,000. Therefore, there is no technical or structural weakness that invalidates the bullish thesis. The imbalance to the upside, he added, is sufficient to push Bitcoin back to trading in the $120,000 and $123,000 range, which is the Value Area High. Mr. Wall Street also tied Bitcoin’s coming surge to changes within the Federal Reserve’s policies. He pointed out that despite claiming to end quantitative tightening, the Fed has quietly injected billions into the banking system through repo operations and mortgage-backed securities purchases. He highlighted a single Friday where $50.35 billion entered the system. According to him, this liquidity will ultimately find its way into risk assets, including Bitcoin, in a pattern similar to the 2019 monetary response that preceded crypto’s 2020 and 2021 bull run. Although he warned that a fabricated crash could precede the next liquidity wave, this will only strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term position for another move to $120,000 and possibly higher. Gold And Bitcoin In The Battle For The Real Store Of Value Mr. Wall Street also called attention to the psychological side of the current cycle, which has been highlighted by some investors gravitating towards gold. He argued that retail investors are being pushed to gold through manipulated narratives of stagflation and economic fear, while institutions quietly buy Bitcoin. “What’s ironic is that the same logic that drives people to buy gold should be making them buy Bitcoin instead,” he said. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals What Traders Are Missing After The Bitcoin Price Spike To $116,000 The ongoing gold hype is to distract the public while institutions accumulate Bitcoin at discount levels. Once retail participants exit the crypto market entirely, then there is going to be a move upward that redefines Bitcoin’s price level. As he concluded, the boring sideways phase is nearing its end, and the next aggressive move, one that could carry Bitcoin back above $120,000, is only a matter of time. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,200.

The announcement was made on Monday, as Ripple USD (RLUSD), the network’s native stablecoin, hit the $1 billion milestone in market cap. Ripple Prime breaks ground in the US today with the launch of digital asset spot prime brokerage capabilities – allowing clients to execute OTC spot transactions across the most prominent digital assets and stablecoins, including $XRP and $RLUSD . https://t.co/zTYb4MrPX4 — Ripple (@Ripple) November 3, 2025 Ripple Prime is the result of a prior acquisition of Hidden Road. The two companies have combined their licenses to offer OTC trading to U.S. institutional customers, facilitating the trading of crypto assets. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Needs to Stay Above This Level to Start Recovering XRP has gone down by 5% in the past 24 hours, and currently sits at $2.27. Trading volumes have exploded by nearly 100% to almost $8 billion, accounting for 6% of the token’s circulating supply. The token is now approaching what could be considered its last line of defense before a bigger decline. At $2.20, the market will decide if the latest developments are bad enough to kickstart a bear market, or buyers may step in to scoop up the token with the expectation that these ecosystem growth initiatives will lift it by year’s end. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory in the 4-hour chart, increasing the odds of a bounce off this level. If that happens, we could see XRP hitting $3 soon , meaning a 36% upside potential in the near term. As momentum begins to return, early crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could see the biggest gains. With over $25 million already raised, the project is building a faster, cheaper version of Bitcoin that supports smart contracts, trading apps, and new use cases that the original network was never built for. Bitcoin Hyper Brings Speed and Simplicity to BTC – Early Buyers Could See Big Gains Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings Solana’s speed and low fees to Bitcoin, unlocking fast and affordable crypto features for BTC holders. Bitcoin Hyper is building a faster, smarter version of Bitcoin that fixes some of its biggest problems – like slow transactions and the lack of apps. Using the Hyper Bridge, anyone can send their BTC to a secure wallet and instantly get the same amount on the Bitcoin Hyper network. Once you’re in, you can do things that regular Bitcoin doesn’t allow – like earning rewards, staking, lending, and using apps for trading, payments, and even meme coins. Crypto analysts say that as more exchanges and big investors adopt the network, demand for $HYPER could surge – giving early buyers a major advantage. To buy $HYPER before its next price increase, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper official website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can swap USDT or SOL to complete the transaction or use a bank card instead. Buy $HYPER Here.

These three altcoins have witnessed drops of at least 5% in the past 24 hours, extending a period of on-and-off negativity that began in late July. Yet they are now all so far in the red that a big rebound could be on its way, while one new token in particular looks ready to rally once it launches in the next few weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETF Arrival Could Push Altcoin Above $4 in December XRP has dropped to $2.27 today, marking a 5.5% loss in 24 hours and a 25% decline in a month. The altcoin has struggled in recent weeks, along with the wider market, yet it remains up by 350% in a year, making it the best-performing top-ten coin within this timeframe. This puts it in a commanding position to continue rising once the market regains some optimism, particularly when upwards of ten XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the next few weeks . The launch of these funds will drive institutional money towards XRP, boosting its price in much the same way ETFs boosted Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now may therefore be a great time to buy XRP, seeing as how its chart shows the coin in such an oversold position. Source: TradingView As we can see from the chart above, XRP’s indicators have been languishing in weakened positions for three months now, give or take. Its relative strength index (yellow) has plunged in the past day, falling back towards the 30 level. It could therefore bottom out soon, with XRP likely to rebound in price, potentially returning to $3 by the end of the month. And if we do see a wave of XRP ETF launches soon, it could top $4 by the end of 2025. Crypto Price Prediction: Official Trump ($TRUMP) – Meme Coin Showing Renewed Momentum After Tough Summer At $7.24, TRUMP is down by 5% in 24 hours, although it does hold on to a 6% gain in a week and a 23% increase in a fortnight. On the other hand, investors should bear in mind that it has suffered a 90% drop since reaching an ATH of $73.43 on January 19. We can interpret this fact in one of two ways, with the first being that such a huge drop is a sign of a coin in terminal decline. However, a more positive interpretation is that this gives TRUMP big potential to make a disproportionate comeback once the market becomes more bullish. Its chart today also shows that it has regained momentum in recent days, following a difficult summer. Source: TradingView Its RSI remains above 50 after the short-lived breakout rally it enjoyed at the end of October, while its MACD (orange, blue) has also turned positive in the past couple of days. As such, TRUMP may be close to another rally, which could see it push towards $10 in the next couple of weeks. From there, an ETF-inspired market-wide rally could see it climb to $20 or $30 by the end of December. Crypto Price Prediction: BNB Coin ($BNB) – Exchange Token Ready to Set New ATHs in Weeks BNB has also fallen by just over 5% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $957 representing a 15% drop in a week and a 17% decline in a month. Otherwise, BNB is in good shape, having posted a decent 71% gain in the past year. It has also recently set a record high of $1,369, a price which it attained only 22 days ago. Put differently, it retains some bullish medium- and long-term momentum, so we would expect BNB to return to growth once market sentiment picks up. This could happen as soon as the first wave of altcoin ETF approvals and launches takes place, which may be only a matter of weeks. If so, BNB would leap from its currently undervalued position, with its chart today suggesting that it may be close to a bottom. Source: TradingView Its RSI and its MACD have both fallen to decidedly negative positions, and don’t have too much space to fall lower. Because of this, we could see BNB return to $1,000 in the next day or two, while it could reach $1,300 again by December. And given Binance’s dominant position as the biggest exchange in the market, the coin could set new records before 2026 arrives. Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENODE Raises $2 Million as Presale Snowballs: Could It 100x in 2026? The three coins above all have the potential to make some very strong gains in the next couple of months, but they won’t be the only alts to do well in the near future. Traders may also want to investigate newer coins, including presale tokens, since these can often outpace the market as they list for the first time and enter price discovery. One of the most promising presale tokens right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based token that’s about to launch a mine-to-earn platform. PEPENODE is heating up 2M Raised! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/jd6PLovBJX — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 31, 2025 It has raised more than $2 million in its sale, which will end in the next few weeks. This is an encouraging sign of its growing popularity and of how successful it could be once it launches. And what’s exciting about PEPENODE is that it’s about to launch crypto’s first mine-to-earn platform. What this means is that it will give users the chance to grow and run their own virtual mining rigs, which they can use to earn rewards in other coins. By spending PEPENODE to buy more virtual nodes, users can increase the rewards they earn. This provides a strong incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, something which should boost demand over time. Also boosting demand is the fact that holders can stake PEPENODE for a regular staking income, with the current APY above 600%. This all makes PEPENODE one of the more bullish new tokens arriving on the market right now. Investors can buy it early by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. The coin is currently selling at $0.0011317, although this price will continue to rise for the duration of the sale.

Fink’s remarks, made during the Future Investment Initiative (FII) event in Riyadh, focused on how tokenization could transform the movement of money and assets worldwide, a development that many XRP supporters see as aligned with Ripple’s long-term vision. During his address, Fink stated that central banks around the world are now exploring how quickly they can digitize their currencies. He explained that this shift raises important questions about the future of the U.S. dollar, as well as the relevance of established payment companies such as Visa and Mastercard in a fully digital economy. Larry Fink Calls Tokenization the Next Major Financial Evolution Fink emphasized that while artificial intelligence dominates most conversations about financial innovation, the tokenization of assets and currencies represents an equally powerful trend. He described tokenization as a technological advancement that could streamline global finance by improving how transactions are processed and settled. According to him, many governments and institutions still underestimate the scale of this transformation. Larry Fink just confirmed what we’ve been saying for years, every central bank currency will be digitized, every ETF and asset will be tokenized, and they’ll all need a cross-border settlement layer. The plumbing of global finance is being rebuilt, and #XRP is the foundation. pic.twitter.com/hu0yArQeX7 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 29, 2025 His comments quickly gained attention within the XRP community, where advocates have long maintained that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is well-positioned to support the tokenization era. Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist and a well-known XRP proponent, responded to Fink’s remarks by suggesting that they validate the long-standing view that XRP could underpin a new, tokenized financial infrastructure. Aljarrah asserted that in a future where central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other assets exist on tokenized platforms, a unified settlement network will be necessary. He argued that XRP’s design allows it to serve as the global bridge asset connecting diverse financial systems. Ripple’s Growing Focus on Tokenization Ripple’s own executives have echoed similar sentiments in recent years. In 2023, David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, confirmed that the XRPL’s development strategy would increasingly focus on tokenization capabilities. Bitwise, a major digital asset management firm, also named XRP as one of the tokens offering the most direct exposure to the anticipated growth of the tokenization sector. These developments have helped position XRP at the center of the broader discussion about how blockchain technology might power the future of financial markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How High Could XRP Go If Tokenization Becomes Mainstream? To estimate what this global shift could mean for XRP’s valuation, a hypothetical scenario generated by Google’s Gemini AI offered an optimistic outlook. According to Gemini, the market for tokenized assets could expand to between $10 trillion and $26 trillion by 2030. Using a middle estimate of $15 trillion, Gemini projected that if the XRPL captured even 1–5% of that total market, XRP’s market capitalization could range from $6 trillion to $30 trillion. With roughly 60 billion XRP currently in circulation, this projection would place XRP’s price between $100 and $500 per token, assuming consistent adoption and supply conditions. However, Gemini emphasized that such an outcome would depend on several key factors, including regulatory clarity for digital assets, widespread institutional use of XRP for settlement, and Ripple’s ability to maintain a technological edge over competitors like Ethereum and Solana. It also noted that XRP’s deflationary token burn mechanism could gradually decrease supply over time, potentially reinforcing upward price momentum if demand increases. Although these estimates remain speculative, the renewed discussion following Larry Fink’s comments underscores a growing belief that tokenization could reshape global finance and that XRP might play a meaningful role in that transformation.

This move aims to attract more clients away from Google’s Chromebooks and Microsoft’s basic Windows PCs. The tech giant’s decision has sparked debates in the industry. Sources familiar with the situation suggest that this new device will be particularly useful for individuals who primarily work on documents, browse the internet, or edit light media. Additionally, they mentioned that the device specifically targets casual users, students, and businesses. Meanwhile, apart from an affordable Mac, Apple is also considering potential iPad buyers who may prefer a more traditional laptop experience, the sources said, maintaining anonymity. Apple aims to solidify its position as the leader in the tech industry Apple’s unreleased, low-cost budget Mac , known by the code name J700, is currently being tested and is in the early stages of production with suppliers outside the US, according to sources close to the matter. According to them, the Cupertino-based tech firm intends to launch the new device probably in the first half of next year. When reporters contacted a representative from the tech giant for comment on the situation, the spokesperson declined to respond. This news marks a significant shift in Apple’s operations, as the company has been renowned for producing cutting-edge devices that generate substantial profits. Interestingly, the tech company has vowed not to pursue market share by offering cheaper products. Regarding creating a budget-friendly Mac, the sources acknowledged that Chromebooks increasingly threaten Apple. This affordable laptop operates on Google’s Chrome OS, a lightweight, cloud-based operating system. In the meantime, Apple noted another opportunity to solidify its position as a leader in the tech ecosystem. This was after reports revealed that some individuals were unhappy with Microsoft Corp.’s change to Windows 11, which left them without security updates for the older software version. With this issue raised, the tech giant aims to appeal to Windows users. Following the release of this information, Apple’s stock reportedly rose slightly by less than 1%, reaching an all-time high of $270.25. Considering the advantages surrounding its recent decision, the tech company plans to price its new laptop below $1,000 by utilizing simpler components. This new device will feature a more basic LCD and an iPhone processor. Moreover, it will have the smallest screen of any current Mac model, measuring just below the 13.6-inch display found in the MacBook Air. This marks the first scenario in which the tech giant uses an iPhone processor in a Mac, rather than a chip specifically designed for computers. Still, internal tests indicate that this smartphone chip may outperform the M1 chip, which was designed just a few years ago. It is worth noting that Apple initially used iPhone chips in its iPads, but later transitioned those devices to its M-series processors for higher-end models. Apple to expand its footprint in schools with the creation of a budget-friendly Mac Analysts researched and discovered that Apple had already tested the market before news of creating a budget-friendly Mac leaked. This was after it provided a discounted M1 MacBook Air for less than $700 via Walmart and other stores. However, the analysts still insist that the new model will feature an entirely new design, rather than an older version, at a lower price. On the other hand, sources have mentioned that Apple’s most affordable Mac in the current market is the M4 MacBook Air. The device is priced at $999 but can go down to $899 with educational discounts. Chromebooks are available for a few hundred dollars, while high-end models cost about $600. The sources also noted that many students prefer using Apple’s basic iPad with the Magic Keyboard Folio, which is priced at about $600. The upcoming Mac would be priced similarly but include advanced features such as the added benefits of macOS software, a built-in keyboard, and better battery life. Therefore, the tech giant could attract both students and regular consumers, the sources said.

The company brought in just $5.02 billion in revenue, falling far below the $6 billion analysts predicted, according to the earnings report released after the bell. Adjusted earnings landed at 35 cents per share, also missing the expected 40 cents. But oh that wasn’t the only red flag. Revenue fell 15% compared to the same period last year, when the company reported $5.94 billion. The warning signs were there two weeks ago when Super Micro gave an early peek and slashed its revenue guidance to $5 billion, down from the earlier $6 billion to $7 billion range. The company said some expected revenue had been delayed to the next quarter due to “design win upgrades.” Super Micro’s net income got hammered too, dropping to $168.3 million, or 26 cents a share, compared to $424.3 million, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Even for a company tied to the AI server boom, these numbers showed a sharp slowdown. Super Micro says better Q2 is coming despite AI slowdown concerns In the middle of the earnings call, Super Micro tried to calm investors by raising guidance for the current quarter. The company now expects revenue between $10 billion and $11 billion, which is well above the $7.83 billion analyst consensus from LSEG. The delayed server builds are expected to ship this quarter, which may explain the bullish outlook. Even with the company’s tight grip on the AI server market, there are signs of pressure. Some analysts say Dell has started to pull ahead in market share. Though Super Micro has benefited from high demand for servers packed with Nvidia GPUs, growth has clearly slowed. Before this earnings report, the stock had jumped 55% this year. That gain now looks shaky. For the full fiscal year that ended June 30, Super Micro reported $22.0 billion in revenue, up from $15.0 billion in the previous fiscal year. But profit dropped, as net income came in at $1.0 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, down from $1.2 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share, the year before. Profit margins shrink as company outlines fiscal 2026 expectations The company’s non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal 2025 was 11.2%, after adjusting for $25 million in stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP net income totaled $1.3 billion, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $2.12 the previous year. The adjustments included a $239 million loss tied to extinguishing convertible notes and related tax effects of $75 million. There was also a $23 million write-off and $8 million in tax impacts. As of the end of June, Super Micro reported $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents, and $4.8 billion in total bank debt and convertible notes. Rounding up the earnings press release, Super Micro said it expects net sales between $6.0 billion and $7.0 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, ending September 30, 2025. It also guided GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to $0.42, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.52, “assuming tax rates of 13.0% and 15.5%, and share counts of 631 million and 644 million, respectively,” said the earnings report. Included in the GAAP forecast is a $69 million in stock-based compensation, with $20 million in excluded tax effects under the non-GAAP metric. And for the full fiscal year 2026, Super Micro is projecting at least $33.0 billion in revenue.

According to people familiar with the matter, the letter was reportedly sent on Friday, with Amazon accusing Perplexity of violating its terms of service by allowing its browser agent, Comet, to buy items on Amazon without disclosing that it was acting on behalf of a user. Perplexity , valued at around $20 billion, denied wrongdoing, saying the move was a “bullying tactic” by Amazon to suppress competition in the fast-evolving market for AI-powered browsing and shopping tools. Amazon accuses perplexity of breaking its conditions Perplexity’s Comet browser, launched in July this year, can research and, like in this case, purchase products on behalf of users, among a host of other things. Amazon’s complaint , however, claims that Perplexity’s agent failed to properly identify itself and in some cases logged directly into users’ Amazon accounts as if it were a standard Chrome browser. The company said this “degraded the customer experience” by bypassing personalization systems and introducing inaccuracies in delivery estimates and pricing. Amazon’s conditions for its online store make it clear that no one is allowed to use bots or automated tools to scrape data or make purchases. “We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers should operate openly and respect service provider decisions,” Amazon’s spokesperson Lara Hendrickson wrote in a statement, adding that Amazon has been sending requests to Perplexity to “remove Amazon from the Comet experience, particularly in light of the degraded shopping and customer service experience it provides.” Perplexity’s response In a draft blog post responding to the letter, Perplexity accused Amazon of trying to “eliminate user rights” in order to boost advertising revenue, while maintaining that its Comet browser neither trains on nor scrapes data from Amazon’s site. Perplexity’s chief executive officer, Aravind Srinivas, rejected Amazon’s characterization and stated that agents should have all the same rights and responsibilities as a human user. He added that “it’s not Amazon’s job to survey who is shopping on behalf of whom.” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy appeared to acknowledge the challenge during an earnings call last week, noting that most AI shopping agents currently deliver “not good” customer experiences due to limited personalization and inconsistent fulfillment data. Still, he hinted that partnerships with third-party developers could emerge in the future. “I do think we will find ways to collaborate,” Jassy said. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is also an investor in Perplexity AI. Competition and control in the AI era Amazon’s objections come as it develops its own set of AI-driven shopping tools . Earlier this year, it introduced “Buy For Me,” which lets users purchase items from brand websites within its app, and “Rufus,” an AI assistant capable of recommending and adding products to a cart. It recently launched another AI feature known as “Help Me Decide,” and this feature helps hesitant buyers make a buying decision faster. Some observers see the company’s action against Perplexity as a defensive move to protect its ecosystem and its advertising business, which earns billions of dollars annually by selling sponsored product placements in search results.

That was enough to push the stock lower in extended trading. The company said adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.20, beating the $1.16 consensus. Revenue reached $9.25 billion, ahead of the $8.74 billion estimate. Revenue rose 36% compared to the same quarter last year. The quarter ended on September 27. Net income was $1.24 billion, or 75 cents per share, up from $771 million, or 47 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. For the fourth quarter, AMD guided to about $9.6 billion in revenue, which implies 25% growth year over year.Analysts were expecting around $9.15 billion. The company said it expects an adjusted gross margin of 54.5%, which matched StreetAccount’s forecast.AMD repeated that the guidance does not include any revenue from shipments of its Instinct MI308 chips to China. Executives said during the release, “We are not including revenue from China‑bound MI308 shipments in the outlook at this time,” repeating the same stance from last quarter. AMD shares had climbed 107% year‑to‑date ahead of these results, while the Nasdaq had risen 21% over the same period. AMD outlines major AI infrastructure partnerships AMD reached a strategic agreement with OpenAI last month. The arrangement could lead to OpenAI holding as much as 10% of AMD.As part of the deal, OpenAI plans to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs across multiple chip generations. The first 1‑gigawatt portion is expected to roll out in the second half of next year. For years, OpenAI and many other AI developers primarily used Nvidia GPUs to train and run large models. The shift signals growing supply and ecosystem diversification. Oracle said in October it plans to deploy 50,000 AMD Instinct MI450 chips in its cloud next year. AMD also introduced its new “Helios” rack‑scale design and said it supports the Open Rack Wide standard introduced by Meta at the Open Compute Project Global Summit. Cisco and AMD expanded their collaboration with G42 to build a large‑scale cluster in the UAE using AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs.IBM and AMD announced a multi‑year effort to support Zyphra with clusters running AMD Instinct MI350X GPUs for multimodal models. Cohere is increasing its use of AMD Instinct GPU infrastructure across its enterprise lineup.Vultr said AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs are now available across its cloud network. DigitalOcean expanded cloud offerings to include AMD Instinct MI325X now and MI350X later this year. Tech Mahindra will bring AMD Instinct GPUs and AMD EPYC CPUs into its Cloud BlazeTech platform. The U.S. Department of Energy announced two upcoming supercomputers based on AMD hardware. The Lux AI system will use AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs, AMD EPYC CPUs, and AMD Pensando networking. The Discovery system, expected in 2028, will run on next‑gen AMD EPYC “Venice” CPUs and AMD Instinct MI430X GPUs, part of AMD’s new MI400 Series. Data center, client, and gaming segments show broad growth AMD’s data center business generated $4.34 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 22%. Analysts were expecting $4.13 billion. Client revenue came in at $2.75 billion, up 46%, beating the $2.61 billion consensus. Gaming revenue totaled $1.30 billion, up 181%, above the $1.05 billion estimate. Amazon, a meaningful cloud customer, disclosed in a filing that it sold all 822,234 of its AMD shares as of September 30. The position was originally built in the first quarter. AMD released ROCm 7 software to improve training and inference performance. The company also completed the divestiture of its ZT Systems data center manufacturing business to Sanmina. AMD partners expanded cloud services powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors. AWS said its new Amazon EC2 M8a instances deliver up to 30% better performance than the prior generation. Oracle introduced new X11 platforms powered by the same processors. IBM and AMD also announced plans to combine quantum computing with high‑performance compute in future architectures. AMD updated its PC and gaming lines with Ryzen Threadripper 9000WX, Threadripper PRO 9000X, and FSR 4. FSR 4 support doubled to more than 85 games. The company expanded its embedded line with AMD EPYC Embedded 4005 and Ryzen Embedded 9000 processors for industrial and edge computing.

Over the past 30 days, Cardano has dropped 37%, but the recent spike in 24-hour trading volume to $1.6 billion suggests buyers are stepping in fast. On-chain data from CoinGlass reveals that exchange netflows have remained mostly negative since October, meaning large investors are pulling tokens into cold storage instead of selling. This behavior often signals long-term conviction, as whales tend to load up quietly before major moves. With ADA now hovering at key support, the token could enter a consolidation phase before mounting a fresh rally – especially if institutional interest continues to climb. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Hits Former Trend Line Resistance from Above Cardano has tapped a key trend line resistance, and all eyes are now on whether buyers will step up to flip this zone into support. A decisive bounce here could mark the beginning of ADA’s next rally. However, the token is still trading below its 200-day exponential moving average – a level it must reclaim to confirm a bullish shift in momentum. The $0.53 zone is the key support to watch. Holding above it could spark a short-term breakout, especially as traders look to reenter positions after last week’s brutal sell-off. With billions wiped from the market, even a modest ADA recovery could spark a fresh wave of FOMO. For investors who hold through volatility, Best Wallet offers a smarter way to stay ahead – combining secure storage, low-fee swaps, and early access to emerging tokens, all in one seamless, mobile-first platform. As presales gain momentum, tools like this are becoming essential for spotting the next breakout before it goes mainstream. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Powers a New Level of User Experience Now in early presale, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is reshaping what a wallet can be – bringing together powerful trading tools, frictionless payments, and first access to top-tier presales inside a clean, user-friendly ecosystem. The wallet already supports over 60 blockchains, features low fees, and includes an integrated DEX that connects to 200+ decentralized exchanges. Now, with the launch of its native token $BEST, users will gain access to even more perks — from reduced transaction costs to exclusive presale access before listings go public. $BEST holders can also take part in staking for rewards and be the first to try out new product releases like the upcoming Best Card, which will let users spend crypto directly at stores, ATMs, and online. As the wallet’s popularity increases, the demand for $BEST will rise as well, especially as it gets users discounts on fees. To buy $BEST, simply visit the official Best Wallet Token website and link up your wallet (download the Best Wallet app here). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead.

Die Regierung präsentiert den Schritt als Signal für mehr Innovationsfreiheit und ein Ende der als feindlich wahrgenommenen Kryptopolitik der Biden-Ära. Gleichzeitig verschärft ein historischer Regierungs-Shutdown die wirtschaftliche Unsicherheit in den USA. Ein politischer Donnerschlag erschüttert Washington und die globale Finanzwelt zugleich. Mit der überraschenden Begnadigung von Binance-Gründer Changpeng “CZ” Zhao setzt US-Präsident Donald Trump ein deutliches Zeichen für seine neue Kryptostrategie. Während Befürworter von einem Neuanfang in der digitalen Wirtschaft sprechen, warnen Kritiker vor einem gefährlichen Präzedenzfall . Gleichzeitig steckt das Land im längsten Regierungs Shutdown der US-Geschichte, der Märkte und Bürger verunsichert. Was bedeutet dieser Schritt für die globale Kryptolandschaft und die wirtschaftliche Zukunft der USA? Ein Blick auf die Hintergründe und politischen Dynamiken. Trump setzt auf Krypto und Innovation Die Entscheidung, den Binance-Gründer Changpeng Zhao zu begnadigen, sorgt weltweit für Schlagzeilen. Trump bezeichnet den Schritt als Beginn einer neuen Ära, in der Innovation statt Sanktionen im Vordergrund stehen soll. Laut seiner Regierung markiert die Begnadigung den Bruch mit einer Politik, die digitale Technologien ausbremste und Talente ins Ausland drängte. Beobachter sehen darin ein klares politisches Signal: Die USA sollen wieder führend im Kryptosektor werden und ein attraktiver Standort für Blockchain-Unternehmen sein. Gleichzeitig steht die Entscheidung im Kontrast zu Trumps vorherigen Aussagen. Noch vor wenigen Tagen behauptete er, Zhao gar nicht zu kennen. Nun löscht die Begnadigung sämtliche strafrechtlichen Konsequenzen im Zusammenhang mit AML-Verstößen bei Binance. Kritiker fragen sich daher, ob politische Motive oder wirtschaftliche Interessen im Vordergrund standen. Befürworter hingegen feiern die Rückkehr einer unternehmerfreundlichen Finanzpolitik. Weiße Haus spricht von Ende des “Kryptokrieges” Pressesprecherin Karoline Leavitt betonte in Washington die Ambitionen der Regierung. Sie sprach von einem “Ende des Biden-Krieges gegen Krypto” und hob das Recht des Präsidenten hervor, Unternehmer zu schützen und Innovation zu fördern. Aus Sicht des Weißen Hauses ist der Pardon ein wirtschaftspolitisches Signal an Investoren, Technologen und Finanzmärkte weltweit. Die USA sollen wieder als Heimat für digitale Finanzsysteme gelten, nicht als Feind. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Gleichzeitig kritisieren Analysten den Tonfall, da er eine klare politische Frontbildung erkennen lässt. Während Trump Wachstum und Freiheit betone, verweisen Juristen auf die Bedeutung konsequenter Aufsicht im Finanzsektor. Die Begnadigung könnte damit zu einem Schlachtfeld zwischen Innovationsfreiheit und Regulierungssicherheit werden – zwei Themen, die global zunehmend im Fokus stehen. CZ bleibt umstrittene Figur der Finanzwelt Changpeng Zhao ist einer der bekanntesten Unternehmer der Kryptobranche. Sein Einfluss auf die globale digitale Finanzwelt ist enorm, doch die Vergangenheit bleibt kontrovers. Seine Verurteilung wegen Compliance-Fehlern und die anschließende viermonatige Haft hatten klare Signale gesetzt. Nun könnte die Begnadigung als Einladung für aggressive Expansion und risikofreudige Finanzmodelle verstanden werden. I’m still shocked that stories like this which come out daily still get largely ignored. The most corrupt person to ever hold any public office in US history. I will keep posting them every day and try to amplify them, even when most media doesn’t care. https://t.co/R9YUs3C4H4 pic.twitter.com/NwVpoyp9bC — Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) October 30, 2025 Auch Zhao selbst polarisiert weiterhin. Viele bewundern ihn als Visionär, der Kryptowährungen massentauglich machte. Andere sehen in ihm ein Symbol für unzureichende Aufsicht und Systemrisiken. Die Trump-Entscheidung verstärkt diese Spannungen und könnte in Zukunft neue Debatten über Verantwortung und Innovation auslösen. Shutdown bringt Märkte ins Wanken Parallel zur Begnadigung erschüttert ein historischer Regierungs-Shutdown die USA. Seit mehr als fünf Wochen stehen Bundesbehörden still, weil sich Regierung und Demokraten nicht auf ein Budget einigen. Der Stillstand lähmt öffentliche Dienste, schwächt Verbrauchervertrauen und belastet Unternehmen. Finanzmärkte reagieren nervös, da politische Unsicherheit oft zu Kapitalflucht führt. Beim US-Shutdown stehen Millionen Amerikaner vor leeren Tellern. Das wichtigste Lebensmittelhilfeprogramm wird ab dem 1. November nicht mehr finanziert. Während dessen ist Trump mit Badumbauten beschäftigt. https://t.co/D6CixtpDDz pic.twitter.com/LUEgwufk8A — Volkat (@DortmundaBerlin) November 1, 2025 Analysten berichten zudem von verstärkter Volatilität bei Aktien und Kryptowährungen. Die Kombination aus politischem Stillstand und starkem Eingriff in die Kryptopolitik schafft ein komplexes, kaum kalkulierbares Umfeld. Für viele Beobachter offenbart diese Situation die strukturellen Spannungen zwischen Regierung, Finanzsystem und technologischem Wandel. Trump-Lager gibt Demokraten die Schuld Trumps Berater nutzen die Situation, um klar Position zu beziehen. Sie werfen den Demokraten vor, wirtschaftliche Innovation zu blockieren und politische Machtspiele über das Wohl der Bürger zu stellen. Die Begnadigung Zhaos und die geplante Kryptostrategie seien Belege einer pro-wirtschaftlichen Agenda, so die Sicht des Weißen Hauses. Das Narrativ: Republikaner fördern Wachstum, Demokraten verhindern Fortschritt. Doch auch diese Darstellung ist umstritten. Kritiker argumentieren, dass Polarisierung und symbolische Politik zu Instabilität führen. Ökonomen warnen zudem vor langfristigen Schäden durch politische Blockaden. Während das Weiße Haus auf Dynamik und Zukunft setzt, fordern Marktbeobachter klare Regeln und verlässliche Prozesse. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Wie es für die USA weitergeht Die kommenden Wochen werden entscheidend sein. Die wirtschaftliche Lage bleibt angespannt, und die internationale Finanzwelt beobachtet jeden Schritt genau. Ob die Begnadigung ein mutiger Zukunftsschritt oder ein riskanter Präzedenzfall ist, zeigt sich erst langfristig. Fest steht: Die USA senden gemischte Signale, die Unsicherheit schaffen, aber auch Chancen bieten könnten. Die Diskussion um Kryptowährungen, staatliche Kontrolle und technologische Freiheit wird weiter an Fahrt gewinnen. Gleichzeitig bleibt die Lösung des Shutdowns dringend, um Vertrauen zurückzugewinnen. Für Anleger, Technologieunternehmen und Bürger beginnt eine Phase, die sowohl enorme Möglichkeiten als auch erhebliche Risiken birgt. Bitcoin Hyper: Aufgebaut auf einem zunehmend krypto-freundlichen Amerika Die politische Stimmung in den USA wird immer krypto-freundlicher. Gesetzgeber, große Unternehmen und Finanzinstitutionen erkennen zunehmend das Potenzial digitaler Assets – allen voran Bitcoin. Diese wachsende Unterstützung sorgt dafür, dass Bitcoin immer stärker institutionalisiert wird und seinen Platz im globalen Finanzsystem festigt. Genau hier setzt Bitcoin Hyper an: Es baut direkt auf der Sicherheit des Bitcoin-Netzwerks auf und erweitert es um die Geschwindigkeit und Programmierbarkeit der Solana-Technologie. Während die USA den Weg für eine breite Bitcoin-Adoption ebnen, schafft Bitcoin Hyper die technische Grundlage, damit Bitcoin nicht nur gehalten, sondern aktiv genutzt werden kann. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Mit Bitcoin wachsen in einer neuen Ära $HYPER ist der Utility-Token, der dieses Layer-2-Ökosystem antreibt. Je stärker Bitcoin durch politische Unterstützung und institutionelles Kapital in den USA wächst, desto größer wird der Bedarf an skalierbaren Lösungen, die BTC im Alltag brauchbar machen. Bitcoin bleibt die Basis – Bitcoin Hyper liefert die Funktionalität. In einer Zukunft, in der Bitcoin immer stärker verankert wird, kann $HYPER als technischer Erweiterungsbaustein direkt von dieser Entwicklung profitieren.

The disagreement follows a letter last month from the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) urging the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to reject Coinbase’s application because it could destabilize traditional banking. In a le tter to the OCC, the ICBA states that it “strongly opposes” Coinbase’s bid to establish Coinbase National Trust Company, as it considers the crypto exchange’s model to be “untested and risky.” The group stated that the company may face challenges in crypto market downturns and lacks the same protections and oversight as traditional banks. Coinbase said the OCC, which regulates national banks and trust companies, will determine whether it may operate under a federal charter. This change would put the digital currency exchange under direct federal oversight and expand its business by allowing it to offer custodial services, as well as trading, clearing, and settlement services. Coinbase fires back: “Banks fear competition, not risk” Coinbase’s CLO publicly criticized the ICBA position in a post on X. “Imagine opposing a regulated trust charter because you prefer crypto to remain unregulated,” he wrote. “That’s the ICBA’s position — another example of bank lobbyists digging regulatory moats to insulate themselves,” he said. Grewal’s words illustrate Coinbase’s increasing impatience with what it deems unfair resistance from traditional finance. The firm says it has no intention of becoming a full-service bank, but would prefer to operate within a single federal framework to enforce better, protect, and disclose its consumer practices. The national trust charter would ease the company’s administrative and regulatory burden across states, enabling it to bring more products to more customers. The company states that passing its proposed charter would enhance oversight of the firm’s activities by bringing it under OCC surveillance, a goal banks have long lobbied for in relation to crypto firms. Within Coinbase, this development is viewed as a milestone toward its mission of bridging the legacy financial world with the complex crypto economy. The executives note that subjecting crypto institutions to the same level of oversight as banks currently receive will foster confidence, attract institutional investors, and reduce systemic risk. Banks fight to keep control of the financial system At the center of the clash is a question that could determine the future evolution of global banking: Should crypto firms be allowed to operate under essentially the same federal framework as traditional banks, or should they remain separate and closely regulated? The banking industry holds a near monopoly on the infrastructure that enables cash to circulate, deposits to be secured, and trust in the financial system. The rise of cryptocurrency and businesses like Coinbase, which provide services such as custody, trading, and settlement, is posing a threat to some of that stranglehold. If Coinbase were awarded a federal trust charter, the company would have automatic access to the state, local, and tribal regulatory structure that banks use to conduct business across all 50 states. Less friction, quicker innovation, and perhaps even a new model for financial inclusion that bypasses intermediaries as we’ve traditionally known them. However, old-school banks believe that this would establish a risky precedent. Digital-asset companies have yet to demonstrate that they can handle risks such as money laundering, cybersecurity attacks, and market fluctuations under real-world banking conditions, they say. Adding a similar federal designation for such companies could create fissures in the system that allow companies that don’t take deposits or maintain reserves to benefit from the same kind of national footprint and credibility as banks. They have fear that transcends compliance. Crypto companies like Coinbase can already serve millions, if not tens of millions, of customers with relatively little physical infrastructure, relying solely on technology and automation, as opposed to branches or complex legacy systems. This efficiency may pose a threat to the typical business models of banks.

The initiative, which runs until November 13 at 04:00 (UTC), is designed to encourage increased activity on the platform through a mix of trading, staking, and referral-based participation. Overview of the Campaign The event, titled “Your Chance to 420,000 XRP”, gives both new and existing users multiple ways to earn XRP rewards. Participants can qualify by engaging in three key activities: trading and depositing XRP, staking their holdings, or joining Bitrue’s new XRP launchpool to multiply returns. To be eligible for rewards, users are required to complete Bitrue’s Level 1 Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification. The platform also clarified that any withdrawals during the campaign period could impact eligibility. All rewards from the event will be distributed within two weeks after the campaign concludes. Deposit and Trading Event The first component of the campaign centers on deposits and trading. Bitrue is offering incentives to users who deposit and trade at least 100 XRP on its spot market. A dedicated 250,000 XRP prize pool has been allocated for this event. Additionally, Bitrue will provide a 20% welcome bonus to the first 500 new users who meet the trading and deposit requirements. The exchange defines “new users” as individuals who registered on Bitrue after January 1, 2025, and have not made any previous deposits. Users can further increase their earnings by inviting others to join the platform, with referral bonuses of up to 50 XRP for each qualified trader introduced to Bitrue. Staking Opportunities The second part of the promotion focuses on staking rewards, offering users flexible and fixed-term options depending on their registration status. New users can access a seven-day flexible staking plan with an impressive 80% annual percentage yield (APY) and guaranteed returns. Existing users can participate in a 15-day fixed-term staking option that offers 3% APY. These staking programs are designed to encourage long-term participation while providing steady incentives to holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Launchpool for Multiplying Rewards In the campaign’s third stage, Bitrue introduces a new XRP launchpool, which officially goes live on November 4. Both new and existing users can participate and earn up to 50% APY through this feature. The launchpool allows participants to increase their XRP holdings without active trading, providing another route to accumulate rewards during the campaign period. Bitrue has consistently positioned itself as one of the most XRP-friendly exchanges in the digital asset industry. Since listing the token in 2018, the platform has steadily expanded its XRP-related offerings , introducing over 90 trading pairs by March 2024. In addition to regular trading services, Bitrue has previously hosted several XRP-specific promotions, including a $50,000 XRP giveaway in March 2024. The latest 420,000 XRP campaign reinforces Bitrue’s ongoing confidence in XRP’s role within the broader crypto ecosystem and highlights the exchange’s commitment to fostering engagement within the community. Through this event, Bitrue not only rewards active users but also continues to strengthen its connection to the XRP ecosystem, a relationship that has remained consistent through fluctuating market conditions.

With sellers pushing toward the $102,000 zone, BTC is now at a moment that may mark the final washout before a major rebound. The coming days could be decisive in determining whether Bitcoin finds its footing or continues its decline. Bitcoin Faces Pressure Below $108,000 As Bears Regain Control Crypto analyst Crypto Candy shared insights into Bitcoin’s latest price action, noting that the flagship cryptocurrency tried to hold the $107,000–$108,000 support zone but ultimately failed to do so, closing below that level. This development signals a potential shift in market dynamics, as the $107,000–$108,000 zone may now act as a strong resistance area. Related Reading: Head And Shoulders Pattern Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $100,000 Crypto Candy further explained that if the downward momentum continues, Bitcoin could retrace deeper toward the $99,000–$101,000 range, an area viewed as a critical support zone where fresh buying interest might emerge. A dip into this range could also help clear out weak positions and create healthier conditions for a long-term rebound. However, the analyst added that if Bitcoin manages to reclaim and hold above the $107,000–$108,000 zone, it would signal that bullish strength is returning to the market. Such a breakout could restore confidence among investors, paving the way for renewed upward momentum and possibly another push toward higher targets. $102,000: The Ideal Flush Zone Before The Next Big Move In his latest BTC daily update, Super฿ro emphasized the critical role of the $102,000 support zone, describing it as an ideal area for the market to flush out remaining leveraged long positions. This kind of shakeout is often necessary to clear weak hands and set the stage for a more sustainable bullish continuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A ‘Do-Or-Die’ Level As Cycle Faces First Real Test: Analyst Super฿ro further noted that once this cleanup phase concludes, Bitcoin could see a sharp rebound, primarily fueled by a short squeeze from traders caught on the wrong side of the market. As shorts begin to close their positions, buying pressure could intensify, creating a rapid upward move that reclaims lost levels. That said, the crypto analyst has warned that a break below the $101,000 level would not be ideal, as it might signal that market weakness is deeper than anticipated. Still, he maintains confidence in the broader picture, highlighting that high-timeframe (HTF) indicators remain supportive of a potential rebound. Presently, the price of BTC is hovering around $104,000, indicating a more than 3% decline over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, its trading volume has picked up pace, rising by over 79% in the same time frame.

54039754,620273,1762300847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54039754.jpeg,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: 28,600 BTC Sold At A Loss",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-capitulate-28600-btc/,"Bitcoin has slipped below the $105,000 level, signaling mounting selling pressure and a notable rise in volatility as the market enters a critical phase. After months of strong resilience and repeated defenses of key support zones, bulls are now on the back foot, struggling to regain momentum while bears attempt to force BTC toward the psychological $100,000 threshold. Despite the sharp pullback, Bitcoin is still trading near important demand levels that previously acted as a base for significant upside movements — placing the market at a pivotal crossroads. According to data highlighted by top analyst Darkfost, short-term behavior is intensifying the sell-off. Short-term holders (STHs) continue sending Bitcoin to exchanges at a loss, with around 28,600 BTC currently being realized at negative profit. This aligns with heightened capitulation pressure, where newer market participants are exiting positions amid fear and short-term panic rather than a conviction-based strategy. While long-term on-chain metrics remain relatively stable, the market is now watching closely to see whether demand absorbs this wave of selling — or whether momentum shifts decisively in favor of the bears. With macro uncertainty still looming and liquidity thinning across major assets, the next few sessions could determine Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Short-Term Holders Remain Under Pressure According to Darkfost, the short-term holder (STH) cohort remains the key source of sell-side pressure in the current phase of the Bitcoin market. The analyst highlights that we can still expect a stronger capitulation from STHs, as their SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) continues to hover around 1 — a level that historically reflects indecision and stress. When SOPR hovers around parity, it indicates that short-term holders are either selling at break-even or only slightly above or below cost, suggesting little conviction and a lack of willingness to hold through volatility. This behavior also aligns with another critical pattern: each time Bitcoin approaches the STH realized price, roughly around $112,500, the market sees waves of profit-taking or break-even selling. Instead of holding through potential reversals, short-term participants are consistently exiting positions as soon as the price recovers toward their entry level. This repeated supply response near the STH cost basis has effectively become a rotating ceiling for BTC, preventing clean continuation and creating a structurally heavy price environment in the short term. Darkfost notes that this behavior signals doubt, fatigue, and heightened sensitivity to drawdowns among recent buyers. While long-term holders remain largely steady and are not contributing meaningfully to sell pressure, the STH cohort continues to react to every bounce with caution — a dynamic that often precedes final shakeouts or deeper wick-down events before trend continuation. BTC Tests Weekly Support Zone as Momentum Weakens and Sellers Tighten Control Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a decisive shift in momentum, with price sliding toward the $103,000–$105,000 support area and testing the 50-week moving average after a period of sustained weakness. The market has now posted several lower highs from the peak near $127,000, signaling a gradual transition from strong uptrend behavior to consolidation — and now, potential trend vulnerability if buyers fail to defend current levels. The recent weekly candle shows a sharp wick to the downside and increased selling volume, reflecting panic-driven exits and short-term capitulation. Despite this, price remains above a key structural support zone that held during previous pullbacks earlier in the cycle, making this level crucial for bulls to protect. A decisive break below the 50-week MA could accelerate downside momentum and open the door to deeper retracement targets toward $95,000 or even $88,000 if risk aversion intensifies. However, macro trend structure still leans bullish over the long term as the 200-week moving average continues to trend upward and sits comfortably below the current price. For now, eyes remain on whether BTC can reclaim $110,000 in the coming sessions — a move that would signal absorption of selling pressure and prevent further deterioration of market sentiment.

With 26.2% early-stage gains already locked for the earliest swarm members, the conversation around the best 1000x crypto in this cycle just got itchy. As anchors like Cardano bleed red and Aster rides billionaire backing, a tiny meme insect is quietly building a hive, growing its swarm, and sneaking toward attention in a market where underdogs can break the internet faster than anyone refreshes a chart. Yes, the memes are loud. Yes, the mosquito wings are whirring. And yes, crypto watchers are wondering whether this bug is preparing a sting that turns tiny entries into oversized bags. Time for a Mosquito Moment? La Culex Flexes Meme Mischief and Math La Culex ($CULEX) calls itself crypto’s mosquito, and somehow the branding works. Memes show mosquitoes wearing aviators, mosquitoes chasing moon rockets, and mosquitoes refusing to let bags sleep. Tiny but relentless. Annoying but impossible to ignore. The project mixes meme humor with staking, referrals, and token burns designed to shrink supply and amp loyalty rewards. Early holders already see 26.2% gain in Stage 4, backing the idea that early swarms eat first. With over 500M tokens sold and a La Culex presale tally crossing $11,000, this insect is collecting more buzz than a Bitcoin halving thread during bull season. The token supply structure aims for fairness instead of stealth launches and secret VC seeds. A community-first flight path means new holders join the swarm rather than chase whales. Memes are half the story. Referrals and staking APY are the other half. Because even mosquitoes want sustainable feeding cycles. $7,500 Bag Scenario at Listing Price now: $0.00002458 Projected listing price: $0.007 $7,500 buys approximately 305,185,244 tokens. At $0.007 listing, that bag values near $2.13M. Not financial advice. Just math. Math that makes traders choke on coffee and start checking mosquito memes twice. Cardano Dips Hard While Bulls Look the Other Way Cardano investors woke up to a chart that needed tissues. According to Investing.com, ADA dropped 10.11% in a single day and remains down 82.29% from its $3.10 all-time high. That is not just a dip. That is a flashback to 2022 PTSD territory. Volume hit $1.5392B, yet price slid to $0.5489 while traders searched for green somewhere else. In the last 7 days alone, the coin shed 17.64%, turning excitement into eyebrow raises. ADA still holds massive long-term fundamentals and academic-grade blockchain architecture, but right now, short-term nerves are real. With Bitcoin dominance tightening at over 60% and Ethereum wobbling, the capital rotation into microcaps and early memes feels familiar. It is the historic pattern where oversized blue chips stagnate, and micro-cap weirdos with strong community energy take off while everyone debates logic. Aster Pumps With CZ Fuel as Hype Spreads While Cardano was feeling the pain, Aster rode a rocket on social feeds after Binance founder CZ publicly posted about buying ASTER. The market jumped over 30% in minutes, and trading volume exploded, according to Bitget Academy. CZ saying “I buy and hold” hit harder than a bull run meme. Wallet trackers saw a swarm of traders rushing in, and some compared the moment to his early support for BNB. Aster has real-world DeFi mechanics, leveraged trading, and a zero-knowledge upgrade coming, giving it actual depth beyond hype. Still, people are watching to see whether the rally sustains or sees short-term traders dump in waves. Final Thought: Best 1000x Crypto Bite Point? Cardano has history, Aster has backing, and La Culex has culture and early math that refuses to sit still. As the next wave of meme cycles gathers force, smart investors watch for new community sticks of dynamite. Small caps often explode hardest during rotation phases. The mosquito narrative taps into humor, simplicity, and those “what if” energy moments that spark wild runs. Crypto never rewards those waiting politely. It rewards the projects that show up flapping wings with conviction. If curiosity is a mosquito bite, this one is itching right where hype lives. No wonder La Culex is named the best 1000x crypto .

La Culex combines memes with staking, referral systems, and burn mechanics designed to support sustainable growth beyond humor. How risky are early meme tokens? Meme tokens carry high volatility and risk. They can surge fast, but they can also correct sharply. Research is key. Why is Cardano down lately? Cardano has faced market selling pressure, dropping 17% in the past week amid broader sentiment shifts and altcoin rotations. Why did Aster rally recently? Aster surged over 30% after Binance founder CZ disclosed buying $2M worth of ASTER tokens, boosting confidence and volume. Glossary Presale: Early token sale before public listing APY: Annual percentage yield for staking rewards ROI: Return on investment Burn Mechanism: Token removal to reduce supply Meme Coin: Crypto driven by culture, humor, and community energy ZK Tech: Zero-knowledge proofs for blockchain privacy Swarm: La Culex community nickname Summary La Culex is emerging as a surprising meme-based contender in the hunt for the best 1000x crypto as major chains like Cardano struggle and Aster rallies on CZ backing. In Stage 4 of its presale, La Culex has already delivered 26.2% gains for early buyers, selling over 500M tokens and crossing $11,000 in funding with more than 80 holders. With a $0.00002458 price and a $0.007 listing target, speculative ROI math fuels community interest, supported by staking, referral rewards, and token burns. Meanwhile, Cardano fell over 10% in one day and remains down 82% from its all-time high, while Aster surged over 30% following CZ’s public investment. The article examines sentiment rotation into smaller meme-driven assets, evaluates early-stage token mechanics, and emphasizes risk transparency. The tone blends humor and research, highlighting a unique narrative shift where a mosquito-themed token gains traction amid shifting market cycles.

54039757,621493,1762301853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54039757.jpeg,Bitcoin Experten reden Tacheles: Saylor und Kiyosaki geben ihre Jahresprognosen ab,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-experten-prognose-saylor-kiyosaki/,"Michael Saylor und Robert Kiyosaki erwarten eine deutliche Bitcoin-Rally bis Ende 2025. Beide verweisen auf langfristige Trends und die Bedeutung von emotionaler Disziplin in volatilen Märkten. Trotz kurzfristiger Schwankungen und Rücksetzer bei MicroStrategy zeigt sich das langfristige Vertrauen stark. Bitcoin sorgt erneut für Schlagzeilen. Zwei der bekanntesten Stimmen im Kryptomarkt senden bullische Signale – und das, obwohl der Kurs nach Rekordständen zuletzt korrigiert hat. Michael Saylor und Robert Kiyosaki bleiben überzeugt, dass BTC noch ganz am Anfang seiner Reise steht. Ihre Botschaft ist klar: Wer jetzt Nerven zeigt, könnte später belohnt werden. Prominente Prognosen für eine neue Bitcoin-Rally Bitcoin polarisiert wie kaum ein Asset und legt ein weiteres Kapitel intensiver Debatten hin. Nachdem der Kurs sein Rekordhoch erreicht hat, folgte eine scharfe Korrektur. Dennoch treten zwei der lautesten Fürsprecher auf den Plan und setzen ein Zeichen des Vertrauens. Michael Saylor und Robert Kiyosaki sind überzeugt, dass die Kryptowährung weiter steigen wird und neue Höchststände erreichbar sind. Während viele Anleger verunsichert reagieren, bleiben diese prominenten Marktbeobachter optimistisch. Sie sehen die aktuelle Phase als normalen Zyklus in einem langfristigen Aufwärtstrend. Ihre Prognosen spiegeln nicht nur Hoffnung wider, sondern basieren auf historischen Mustern und neuen Marktstrukturen. Für sie ist der Rückgang kein Signal zur Panik, sondern eine Chance zum Handeln. Michael Saylor sieht strukturelle Stärke im Markt Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman von MicroStrategy, betont die wachsende Stabilität des BTC-Ökosystems. Trotz des jüngsten Schocks von Milliardenliquidationen sieht er eine robuste Marktstruktur. Laut Saylor bleibt der Aufwärtstrend bestehen, da Volatilität sinkt und institutionelle Nutzung zunimmt. Sein Kursziel von $150.000 bis Ende 2025 basiert auf Analysten-Konsens und langfristiger Fundamentalanalyse. Er geht sogar weiter und spricht von einem möglichen Anstieg bis hin zu siebenstelligen Beträgen innerhalb weniger Jahre. Seine Firma setzt diese Überzeugung in Taten um und kaufte zuletzt erneut hunderte Bitcoin. MicroStrategys Strategie bleibt klar: Bitcoin als primäres Wertaufbewahrungsmittel. Dass die Aktie von MicroStrategy parallel zur Korrektur fiel, zeigt die starke Bindung an den Kryptomarkt. MicroStrategy bleibt auf Einkaufskurs Die jüngste Akquisition von 390 BTC unterstreicht das Vertrauen des Unternehmens. Mit über 640.000 Bitcoin hält MicroStrategy eine Position, die im Krypto-Sektor nahezu einzigartig ist. Trotz Kursverlusten von rund 13% im Aktienpreis bleibt die Strategie unverändert. Für Saylor ist Bitcoin ein langfristiges Anlagevehikel, das traditionelle Finanzsysteme herausfordert. During the Strategy earnings call Saylor said that MSTR is a 10 year hold when a few minutes earlier the CEO presented figures based on BTC hitting $150k in…. checks watch ….60 days. You couldn't make this up! pic.twitter.com/NVbptYHLdZ — Skag (@superskag) November 1, 2025 Die Marktreaktion zeigt jedoch, dass Anleger kurzfristig sensibel auf Preisbewegungen reagieren. Der Rückgang bestätigt die enge Korrelation zwischen Bitcoin-Preis und Unternehmensbewertung. Dennoch sieht Saylor diese Schwankungen gelassen. Sein Fokus liegt klar auf langfristigen Wertzuwächsen und strukturellem Wachstum des Bitcoin-Netzwerks, nicht auf täglichen Kursbewegungen. Kiyosaki setzt auf emotionale Stärke und Kursziele Robert Kiyosaki, Bestseller-Autor und bekannter Investor, teilt eine noch aggressivere Prognose. Auf X erklärte er, dass BTC bis Jahresende $200.000 erreichen könne. Er betont jedoch nicht nur Zahlen, sondern das emotionale Management beim Investieren. Angst sei laut ihm der häufigste Grund, Chancen zu verpassen. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Kiyosaki erklärt, dass Anleger mehr verlieren, wenn sie aus Furcht handeln statt rational. Er selbst hält nach eigenen Aussagen BTC im Millionenbereich. Seine Sichtweise spricht besonders Kleinanleger an, die sich in volatilen Märkten schnell verunsichern lassen. Für ihn ist Bitcoin ein Werkzeug zur finanziellen Freiheit und Absicherung gegen Inflation. Marktdaten zeigen gemischtes Stimmungsbild Bitcoin handelt aktuell nahe $111.000 und liegt damit unter seinem Allzeithoch. Handelsvolumen und Futures-Finanzierung haben nachgelassen, was auf geringere Marktaktivität hinweist. Gleichzeitig zeigen institutionelle Zuflüsse, dass das Interesse großer Anleger weiter besteht. Analysten sehen den Rückzug daher eher als Mid-Cycle-Korrektur, nicht als Trendbruch. On-Chain-Daten bestätigen verstärkte Akkumulation, da mehr Coins von Börsen abgezogen werden. Niedrigere Liquidität erhöht zwar kurzfristiges Risiko, doch langfristige Anleger nutzen Rücksetzer zum Kauf. Diese Dynamik stützt die These eines gesunden Marktumfeldes. Geduld und Strategie scheinen derzeit wichtiger als schnelle Entscheidungen. Langfristige Perspektive trotz kurzfristiger Schwankungen Sowohl Saylor als auch Kiyosaki verweisen auf die Bedeutung des langfristigen Blicks. Ihre Einschätzungen beruhen auf strukturellen Trends, nicht auf tagesaktuellen Charts. Beide gehen davon aus, dass BTC weiter wachsen wird, gestützt durch institutionelle Nachfrage und klare Angebotsstruktur. Die aktuelle Unsicherheit sei temporär und Teil des Zyklus. Für Anleger bedeutet dies: Ruhe bewahren, Risiken kennen und langfristig denken. Emotionale Disziplin wird zum Schlüssel in einer hochdynamischen Anlageklasse. Wer BTC als langfristige Investition betrachtet, könnte von zukünftigen Kursanstiegen profitieren. Die Vision bleibt klar: ein digitaler Wertspeicher mit globaler Reichweite und enormem Wachstumspotenzial. Bitcoin Hyper: Profiteur eines prognostizierten Anstiegs von BTC Viele Experten prognostizieren für dieses Jahr einen deutlichen Anstieg von BTC. Mit steigendem Interesse und institutioneller Teilnahme gewinnt BTC weiter an Bedeutung. Bitcoin Hyper baut direkt auf dieser Entwicklung auf: Es verbindet die Sicherheit von Bitcoin mit der Geschwindigkeit von Solana und macht BTC anwendbar – nicht nur ein Wertaufbewahrungsmittel. Gelangt Bitcoin in eine neue Wachstumsphase, steht Bitcoin Hyper bereit, davon zu profitieren. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für BTC Hyper! $HYPER: Wenn BTC steigt, könnte Hyper mitsteigen $HYPER ist der Token, der diese Erweiterung möglich macht. Steigt BTC wie von Experten erwartet, steigt auch der Bedarf an Lösungen, die BTC nutzbar machen. Hyper erfüllt genau diesen Bedarf – und $HYPER könnte von dieser Dynamik mittel- bis langfristig profitieren.

This move would position Gemini among the many financial firms entering a new field of prediction markets. Reports highlighted that this market will provide a controlled method for betting on outcomes of elections, sports games, and other events. The launch represents Gemini’s effort to diversify its offerings amid a competitive crypto exchange market. Gemini aims to remain competitive in the crypto space Recently, Gemini has been making significant moves to strengthen its position in the crypto space . To begin with, the firm applied for regulatory approval to establish its own derivatives exchange, which is designated as a contract market. This update followed discussions by the cryptocurrency exchange’s officials about using this exchange for trading prediction contracts. The application is still under review. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that securing approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a new exchange can take a considerable amount of time, often spanning months or even years. The delays may also occur if a government shutdown takes place. Another significant milestone in the ecosystem is that several exchanges and retail investment brokers have decided to collaborate with existing prediction market platforms that already hold the necessary licenses, rather than starting from scratch. An example of these platforms is Robinhood, which offers its clients event contracts from Kalshi Inc. If Gemini moves forward with its plans, the company can compete against key players such as trading exchange Kalshi, which is already registered with the US derivatives regulator, and Polymarket, which seeks to resume operations in the US soon. Trump Media and Technology Group also entered the growing trend of prediction markets, partnering with Crypto.com. The predictions are expected to be integrated with Truth Social , Trump’s social media platform. Truth Social will use Crypto.com Derivatives North America as a clearinghouse, tapping a CFTC-registered platform. The initial testing of Truth Predict, the new market, is expected to commence soon. Prediction markets face significant regulatory challenges. Following the growing trend among companies to participate in prediction markets, established exchange companies such as CME Group Inc. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. have reportedly entered the prediction market. Moreover, Gemini’s major competitor in the crypto industry, Coinbase Global Inc., pointed out in recent earnings calls that it aims to branch out into event contracts. According to the company, this move is part of its expansive goal to become an “Everything Exchange” for different financial products. On the other hand, Gemini announced in a regulatory filing that it intended to launch event contracts for predictions connected to sports, finance, politics, and economics before its initial public offering in September this year. Since going public, the firm’s stock has drastically declined by 40% from its debut price. Its IPO prospectus explained that Gemini is not currently profitable. The legal document also highlighted that the cryptocurrency exchange only accounts for a small portion of crypto trading in the US. This situation prompted a Needham analyst to comment on the matter. The analyst acknowledged that the prediction markets present an ideal opportunity for Gemini to expand its services beyond what it currently provides. However, reports noted that prediction markets still face major regulatory challenges. For example, while CFTC has granted Kalshi permission to introduce new markets, state gaming regulators, who usually manage sports betting, have opposed this decision in court.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new DeFi token that is growing popular among investors and may turn into one of the most successful ones to follow in 2026. The project is a combination of both practical use in the real world and potential of investing earlier, and its presale has already attracted the attention of the industry. Mutuum Finance emerges as one of the most discussed new crypto coins of the year and its price is still under $0.05 but a novel protocol launch is also coming, which promotes the gradual increase in the popularity of this project. Presale Gains Momentum The presale of Mutuum Finance has demonstrated a consistent increase up to 2025. The current phase of the project is Phase 6 and the MUTM tokens are traded at $0.035 each. The following step will involve increasing the price to be charged at $0.04 and price at launch will be at $0.06 which will give an early buyer an advantage of around 100-500% MUTM appreciation. The value of the token has also increased by 250% since the very first offer when the presale stood at a low price of just $0.01 US. To illustrate a bigger picture, 790 million tokens have already been sold, so 85%of Phase 6 is already allocated. Mutuum Finance also raised more than $18.4 million and had over 18,000 holders, which shows increased confidence of the retail and institutional investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The prototype of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is non-custodial. It considers giving an effective and direct lending system where users will be able to lend, borrow and make yield without the intervention of any intermediaries. Users are awarded the interest-based tokens into the protocol when they deposit crypto, which are called ports that continue to generate yield as the borrower pays interest. As an illustration, when a user deposits ETH, he/she is awarded with the mtETH which accumulates value over time as interest is paid. The other star attribute of Mutuum Finance is that of the buy-and-distribute model. Since the tokens of the Mutual token can be bought on the open market with some platform fees, they are relocated to the users who hold staked mtTokens. Roadmap Plans In addition to the presale, Mutuum Finance is also designing a USD based stablecoin which is expected to be over-collateralized by in-ecosystem loans. The stablecoin will be minted and burnt on demand, and this will generate an elastic supply system to improve the liquidity and stability throughout the platform. The integration will also facilitate long-term sustainability and provide an even greater yield to the treasury. The project is also going to use the power of oracle infrastructure which may be combined with Chainlink which would provide timely and precise price feeds. Oracles play an important role in loan health, liquidations and accuracy of Mutuum Finance is evidence of its institutional-grade DeFi infrastructure. It is estimated that MUTM has the potential to achieve $0.30 to $0.40 within the first year of its debut as per the forecasts made by various analysts. V1 Intake and Whale Partaking The second milestone that will be significant to Mutuum Finance is the release of V1 protocol , which is scheduled in Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet. The platform will debut the basic capabilities of the platform, which include Liquidity Pool, mtToken system, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot all of which constitute fundamental elements of the decentralized lending framework. Phase 1 of the roadmap which is audits, platform architecture, and initial outreach to the community has been done. The group is currently in Project Phase 2 that will be concentrated on product development and the launch of the testnet prior to the launch of the mainnet in 2026. The fiction on whales has grown and a number of large purchases have been made to the presale within the past two weeks. Analysts interpret this initial participation of the whales as being a signal of institutional or high-net-worth confidence. The Reason Investors Are Watching Mutuum Finance is one of the potential best crypto to follow in Q4 in the year 2025 because of the combination of a low presale price, utility-driven model, and good roadmap implementation. Although major players like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are sound, their huge market values deny them chances of making immediate gains. Conversely, MUTM is still in its infancy with a low valuation of only $0.035 and its development is pegged closely on DeFi yields- which is a huge upside. The two-lending structure of the project, revenue structure founded on buy-and-distribute, and open communication with the communities, explains why the analysts call it one of the most promising new crypto-projects that have a price less than $0.05. With Phase 6 already sold of 85% and with exceeding 18.4 million funds raised and the V1 Testnet coming into play, the months ahead of time may play a crucial part in making MUTM one of the highest-performing DeFi tokens of 2026.

54040781,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=848542,1762304419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54040781.jpeg,Crypto Isn’t Topping Yet: Arthur Hayes Says Stealth QE Is Near,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-isnt-topping-yet-arthur-hayes-stealth-qe/,"Arthur Hayes argues that the next leg of the crypto cycle will be driven not by a headline pivot to quantitative easing, but by a “stealth” version executed through the Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF). In a new essay titled “Hallelujah” published on November 4, 2025, the former BitMEX CEO lays out a balance-sheet-driven case that persistent US fiscal deficits, hedge-fund demand for Treasuries financed via repo, and the Fed’s need to cap funding stress will translate into incremental dollar liquidity that ultimately “pumps the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos.” As he frames the core mechanism: “Government issued debt grows the money supply.” Hayes’ logic chain begins with an observation on political incentives and the arithmetic of public finance. Governments can fund spending with “savings or debt,” and in his view elected officials “will always favor borrowing from the future to get re-elected in the present.” For the United States, he contends that the trajectory is already set: “Here are the estimates from the TBTF banksters, and a few US government agencies. As you can see, the estimates are for ~$2 trillion deficits funded by ~$2 trillion of borrowing.” In his model, once one accepts that “Yearly Federal Deficit = Yearly Treasury Debt Issuance Amount,” the next critical question is who actually buys that debt, and on what financing. Fed’s Stealth QE Will “Pump Crypto” He dismisses foreign central banks as dependable marginal buyers after the US sanctioned and immobilized Russian reserves in 2022. “If Pax Americana is willing to steal Russia’s money… then no foreign owner of treasuries is ever safe,” he writes, concluding reserve managers “would rather buy gold than treasuries.” He likewise downplays the capacity of the US household sector given that “the 2024 personal savings rate was 4.6%” while “the US federal deficit was 6% of GDP,” and he argues the largest US money-center banks have increased their Treasury holdings by only “~$300 billion” in fiscal 2025 against issuance of “$1,992 billion,” making them meaningful but not decisive. Related Reading: Caution In The Crypto Market: Expert Warns Of Bearish Phase Unfolding This November Instead, Hayes positions relative-value hedge funds—particularly those booking positions via Cayman vehicles—as the marginal, price-setting bid for US duration. Citing a recent Federal Reserve study, he quotes: “Cayman Islands hedge funds purchased, on net, $1.2 trillion of Treasury securities… [between] January 2022 and December 2024… [and] absorbed 37% of net issuance of notes and bonds.” The trade architecture is straightforward: “Buy a cash treasury debt security vs. sell the corresponding treasury futures contract,” then lever the tiny basis through repo funding. Because the edge is “measured in basis points,” the trade only works if leverage is cheap and predictable every day. That funnel leads directly to the SRF. Hayes lays out the Fed’s short-rate corridor—“Upper and Lower Fed Funds; currently these equal 4.00% and 3.75% respectively”—and the policy plumbing that keeps market rates inside it: the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) at the lower bound for money-market funds (MMFs) and banks, interest on reserve balances (IORB) for banks in the middle, and the SRF at the upper bound as the emergency spigot. Lower Fed Funds = RRP < IORB < SRF = Upper Fed Funds,” he summarizes, adding that the target, SOFR, normally oscillates inside the band. Stress occurs “when SOFR trades above the Upper Fed Funds,” which he calls “a problem” because “the filthy fiat financial system shuts down” once participants can’t roll overnight leverage at a stable rate. In his telling, the cash supply that cushions SOFR is structurally thinner than it was when the Fed began quantitative tightening in early 2022. MMFs, he says, have drained the RRP to zero because “the T-bill rate is so attractive,” making them less available as repo cash providers. That leaves banks, who will supply liquidity so long as they have ample reserves, but “banks lost trillions in reserves since the Fed began QT.” Set against that diminished supply of cash is relentless demand for repo financing from RV funds, whose “marginal” Treasury purchases must be levered. If SOFR threatens to pierce the ceiling and repo becomes unreliable, the Fed’s SRF must backstop the system to prevent a funding accident. “Because a similar situation occurred in 2019, the Fed created the SRF,” Hayes writes. “The Fed can supply an infinite amount of cash using its printing press at SRF as long as one provides an acceptable form of collateral.” His conclusion is blunt: “If the SRF balances are above zero, then we know the Fed is cashing the checks of the politicians using printed money.” Hayes labels this dynamic “Stealth QE.” He argues the optics of outright balance-sheet expansion via asset purchases are now politically toxic—“QE is a dirty word… QE = money printing = inflation”—so the central bank will prefer to meet marginal dollar demand via SRF lending rather than by visibly creating excess reserves. What This Means For The Crypto Market The result is functionally similar from a liquidity standpoint, in his view: repo credit distributed by the Fed against Treasuries still increases spendable dollars in the system to finance government borrowing. “This will buy some time, but eventually the exponential expansion of treasury debt issuance will force the repeated use of the SRF,” he writes. “Stealth QE will begin shortly. I don’t know when it will begin. But… the SRF balance must grow as the lender of last resort. As SRF balances grow, the amount of fiat dollars in the world expands as well. This phenomenon will reignite the Bitcoin bull market.” He also sketches a near-term tactical backdrop that helps explain recent market tone across crypto. While auctions are pulling cash into the Treasury General Account, he notes, fiscal spending has been temporarily impeded by the government shutdown, producing a net drain in private-sector liquidity. Related Reading: Crypto Bull Case Vs. Bear Case: These Forces Divide The Market “The Treasury General Account is above the $850 billion target by ~$150bn,” he writes, arguing that this “extra liquidity won’t get released into the markets until the government reopens,” contributing to “current softness in the crypto markets.” In other words, the same fiscal engine that ultimately forces the Fed’s hand via the SRF can, in the very short run, sap liquidity when issuance front-runs outlays. Hayes’ rhetoric remains intentionally sharp. He describes Treasuries as “dog shit” at prevailing real yields, calls the buy-side “debt shit eaters,” and opens with a hymn to Bitcoin’s monetary properties—“Praise be to Lord Satoshi that time and compounding interest exist regardless of who you are.” The provocation serves the point: if the marginal financing of US deficits increasingly relies on opaque backstops rather than transparent reserve creation, then crypto’s native, non-sovereign liquidity cycles will key off the same hidden plumbing. He distills the investment upshot in a single sentence: “Treasury Debt Amount Issued = Increase in Supply of Dollars.” The essay is not a calendar call. Hayes refuses to timestamp the inflection—“I don’t know when it will begin”—and he warns that “between now and when stealth QE begins, one has to husband capital. Expect a choppy market,” especially with shutdown dynamics distorting flows. But he is unequivocal on direction once SRF usage becomes persistent: “Stealth QE will begin shortly… [and] will reignite the Bitcoin bull market.” For crypto investors conditioned to watch CPI prints and FOMC dots, the message is to track money-market microstructure instead. In Hayes’ framework, when SRF balances stop being a rounding error and start trending, that is the tell that dollar liquidity has quietly flipped—and that crypto isn’t topping yet. At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.41 trillion.

The listings include both futures-based and spot-based products, suggesting that the first U.S. spot XRP ETFs may debut this month despite ongoing regulatory delays. Related Reading: Market Maker Balancer Compromised: Key Facts Behind The $128 Million Hack While a DTCC listing does not automatically mean trading has begun, it represents a key preparatory step toward launch. Futures ETFs, such as UXRP, XRPI, XRPT, and XXRP, are already live, while spot-focused funds like TOXR, XRP, XRPC, and XRPL await the final approval. Notably, the review process stalled due to the October U.S. government shutdown, which froze more than a dozen altcoin ETF filings, including those tied to Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano. However, with Canary Capital removing delaying amendments and setting November 13 as the automatic effective date for its XRP ETF, analysts now expect trading to begin within days. Bitwise and Grayscale Fast-Track XRP ETFs Without SEC Approval Major asset managers Bitwise and Grayscale have confirmed plans to roll out their XRP ETFs under newly adopted SEC listing standards that allow automatic effectiveness after 20 days if no objections are filed. This means both firms could list their funds without explicit SEC approval, a move that marks a significant regulatory shift in the U.S. Bitwise has set a 0.34% management fee for its XRP ETF, while Grayscale’s proposed fund carries a 0.35% fee, the same rate as its Dogecoin ETF. Both issuers are replicating their successful Solana ETF strategies, which drew over $56 million in first-day trading volume, signaling robust institutional demand. According to Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, “The launch of spot XRP ETFs marks the end of an era of anti-crypto regulation.” If approved, XRP could soon join Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as a core asset class in the ETF landscape. Analysts Eye a Breakout as XRP Holds Above Key Support Despite short-term weakness, XRP continues to hold above the $2.25 support zone, a level analysts view as pivotal for the next bullish leg. Market watcher Dominus recently predicted XRP will “print the largest green candle in crypto history,” citing the convergence of ETF-driven demand, institutional adoption, and on-chain strength. Meanwhile, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has surpassed $1 billion in valuation, further solidifying the company’s ecosystem strength.

The government says the action is needed to protect the integrity and stability of the $2.1 trillion fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, amid escalating political tension over Israel’s war in Gaza and U.S. diplomatic pressure. The Norwegian government’s finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, stated on Tuesday that Norway’s parliament had passed an urgent measure to suspend the ethics council, pending the country’s review of rules for ethical investing. He said that the current system could have compelled the fund to divest from major technology companies over their alleged roles in Israeli military operations and surveillance programs. Stoltenberg stated that an independent body could potentially compel the fund to sell its holdings in some of the world’s largest companies, noting that such a move would compromise the fund’s objectives of remaining broad and globally diversified. Among the funds managed by Norges Bank Investment Management — an arm of Norway’s central bank that manages the Government Pension Fund Global, and which acquired shares in more than 9,000 companies, U.S. tech giants among them- Alphabet shares ranked fifth in value, behind stakes in Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc. These are the top companies that account for over 15% of the fund’s combined equity holdings. To be compelled to withdraw from them would leave the fund with a significantly more unbalanced picture globally, and the economic foundations of Norway’s state welfare arrangements, which rely on revenues from the fund for around a quarter of its annual budget, would also suffer as a result. Tensions rise over Israel and U.S. pressure The freeze comes after months of wrangling in Norway over how to respond to the fund’s links to Israel. It sold off shares of Caterpillar Inc. in August, after bulldozers manufactured by the company were shown to have razed Palestinian properties in the West Bank and Gaza. That decision was said to have raised alarms in Washington, where U.S. officials cautioned further exemptions aimed at American entities could put a strain on diplomatic and commercial relations . A UN report by Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese was published in July, adding to the pressure. The report blamed Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet for offering cloud services and AI technologies that grant Israel virtually government-wide access to surveillance and other sensitive databases, which could support military and security operations. The ethics council was about to consider these companies when the government intervened abruptly and halted the process. The move was passed in parliament thanks to the support of Norway’s two largest centre-right opposition parties. Left-wing groups, who are critical allies in the passage of the national budget, wasted no time in denouncing the decision. Critics argue that suspending the ethics council casts Norway, which has a history of principled divestments from areas such as corporations engaged in corruption, arms production, or environmental harm, as failing to uphold its reputation as a global leader in responsible investing. However, supporters argue that the fund’s primary mandate is financial stability, not moral enforcement. Norway reassesses fund’s ethical rules The government stated that the pause was temporary and would remain in effect until a comprehensive review of the fund’s ethical guidelines is completed in 2026. This review will also examine whether to relax the ban on investing in defense companies, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus, and BAE Systems, which are currently prohibited due to their links to nuclear weapon manufacturing. A former head of NATO, Stoltenberg, said Norway’s policy now amounted to “a paradox” because Norway relies on the protection offered by nuclear weapons as part of NATO even though its own fund is forbidden from investing in firms that make them.

54041364,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=853183,1762305396,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54041364.jpeg,Franklin Templeton updates XRP ETF filing for imminent launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/franklin-templeton-updates-xrp-etf-filing/,"Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has taken a significant step in introducing the Spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The company submitted an updated S-1 registration statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week, removing language that likely stood in the way of approval. The change is indicative of a strong commitment to completing the fund sale in short order — as soon as this month. The amendment is primarily designed to eliminate the “8(a)” delay clause, a technological artifact of ETF filings under which the SEC can prevent the effectiveness of a registration statement from taking effect automatically until it affirmatively approves it. By deleting this provision, Franklin Templeton secures the right to render effective the filing of the Registration Statement automatically upon fulfillment of all other conditions. This development positions Franklin Templeton as one of the most ambitious asset managers to file for a crypto ETF amid the current market flow. It replicates an approach that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers previously adopted, expediting approvals and listings when the 8(a) clause was removed. The timing of this change is crucial. Analysts say it betrays a confidence that the SEC will not register additional complaints against XRP-related products — especially as the market continues to mature and regulatory infrastructures around crypto ETFs take clearer shape. For Franklin Templeton, which manages assets worth more than $1 trillion globally, an XRP ETF would be a significant addition to its cryptocurrency investment offerings. The firm already offers exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum through similar products, indicating an increasing confidence in digital assets as an emerging investment asset class. Other asset managers race to launch XRP ETFs Franklin Templeton isn’t the only one seeking to launch an XRP ETF. Other asset managers, such as Canary Funds and Bitwise, have also revised their S-1 filings in recent weeks. Canary Funds has withdrawn its operating company’s delaying amendment and is seeking to go live in mid-November, subject to exchange approval. Bitwise, another major player in digital asset management, announced that it would list an XRP ETF on a prominent U.S. exchange. The company has already made public fees and custodial arrangements — the last steps generally completed when an ETF is on the verge of a launch. The surge in amended filings indicates growing industry optimism that the SEC may approve several XRP ETFs for marketing around the same time. For investors, this would provide new, regulated access to one of the world’s most widely traded cryptocurrencies, without the need to hold a token directly. Investors prepare for ripple effect on markets The competition to offer an XRP ETF demonstrates the next step toward institutional involvement in digital assets. If approved, these funds would provide investors with a straightforward, regulated way to gain token access to XRP price movements through traditional brokerages. An XRP ETF could also onboard new retail investors and boost the liquidity and trust of the asset, similarly to what spot Bitcoin ETFs achieved earlier this year. Those funds attracted billions of dollars in inflows within a matter of weeks, a subtle indication of the pent-up demand among institutional and retail investors. The SEC, which has become more receptive to digital-asset ETFs after approving products including Bitcoin and Ethereum, is still carefully weighing every filing. Final approval will be based on full disclosure, custody, and transparency of how pricing is happening through the base market. Still, market participants view the update in Franklin Templeton’s filing as their strongest sign yet that they are poised. With a swift response from the firm and news of other competing funds, this should mean that we don’t have long to wait for the first XRP ETF — marking another key turning point in crypto’s journey into traditional finance.

The company pulled in $83.5 million in revenue for Q3, nearly double what it made in the same quarter last year, which was $43.7 million. And it’s not just numbers on a spreadsheet. They’ve got boots on the ground and shovels digging. The company is building 1.5 gigawatts worth of new data center capacity across the U.S. Out of that $83.5 million, a massive $70 million came from the compute business. That includes hosting revenue from its crypto mining arm American Bitcoin (ABTC) and the high-performance compute segment. The rest came from its power generation and managed services unit ($8.4 million) and digital infrastructure offerings ($5.1 million) for other clients using its hosting services. Hut 8 expands buildout across Louisiana, Illinois, and Texas Hut 8’s net income exploded to $50.6 million, up from just $0.9 million in Q3 last year. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $109 million, compared to only $6 million in Q3 2024. At the end of the quarter, Hut 8 had 1.02 gigawatts of total capacity under management. Now, management says it’s aiming to take that number to over 2.5 gigawatts in the years ahead. To do that, four new sites are in play across three U.S. states. One of them is the 300 MW River Bend location in Louisiana, which was first announced back in August. There’s also a 40 MW facility in Illinois, along with two sites in Texas, one at 180 MW and another beast-sized 1 GW location. The Texas sites haven’t been named yet. CEO Asher Genoot laid it out in the Q3 report : “In the third quarter, we reached an inflection point in the scale and maturity of our development flywheel.” He continued: “We advanced 1,530 megawatts of capacity from exclusivity into development… Subject to commercialization, this portfolio has the potential to expand our Energy Capacity Under Management to more than 2.5 gigawatts.” To fund the expansion, Hut 8 opened a $1 billion at-the-market offering. On top of that, they locked in a $200 million revolving credit line from Two Prime. That helps give them near-term cash to keep pushing the buildout forward. As of now, the company holds 13,696 bitcoin on its balance sheet. Meanwhile, its mining arm American Bitcoin, which became public in September after merging with Gryphon Digital, is still operating strong. At quarter-end, it was running about 25 EH/s of hashpower across Hut 8 facilities. American Bitcoin itself holds 3,865 bitcoin in its own treasury.

The entry point that matters here is around $89,613, which is the blended price where the average U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF investment sits, according to Bloomberg. That $89,613 has now become the line where gains turn into losses for the everyday buyers who entered during the heavy inflows earlier in the year after Trump’s second inauguration. Billions moved into these ETFs throughout the year. That demand helped lift Bitcoin to a new record high before the recent drop. But the coin is now down more than 20% from its peak. Most ETF buyers are still above break-even, but the cushion is getting smaller. This same level also lined up with a reversal in April when Bitcoin hit its low of the year and then bounced higher. Vetle Lunde, the head of research at K33, said, “It was very interesting to see how the April reversal coincided with the cost basis.” Many ETF buyers didn’t buy the top. They added exposure during that selloff. If Bitcoin tests that zone again, those positions could quickly turn negative. ETF participation grows while volatility returns Supporters of Bitcoin ETFs have argued that these products bring in more patient investors. They say people using ETFs are less likely to trade on every price swing and are more comfortable holding through corrections. They also argue that ETF flows have reduced some of Bitcoin’s extreme volatility. But the recent drawdown is showing that volatility has not disappeared. Newer investors who entered through regulated ETF products are learning that the price of Bitcoin can still move sharply, even with Wall Street in the picture. Market sentiment has weakened. Bitcoin fell more than 6% on Tuesday and traded under $100,000, its lowest level since June. The coin is now down 20% from the high it reached last month, which in traditional markets would count as a bear market move. Ether and smaller altcoins have fallen even harder. A large part of the selloff is tied to low market participation and fear left over from the October liquidation event that wiped out billions in leveraged positions and left long traders with little momentum to defend recent gains. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF remains the largest Bitcoin ETF, pulling in more than $27 billion this year and holding around $85 billion in assets. But even with major asset managers involved, Bitcoin remains a market that moves in cycles. James Seyffart at Bloomberg Intelligence said , “This asset and these ETFs move forward in this two-steps-forward one-step-back move.” He added that crypto remains a very volatile asset class and there is no certainty whether this is a small retracement or the beginning of a larger downturn. Hedging rises as Bitcoin moves with tech stocks Options traders have been preparing for further declines. Put contracts expiring in late November with $80,000 strike prices are getting the most interest on Deribit, the crypto exchange owned by Coinbase. That positioning suggests that traders are protecting themselves against deeper losses or are positioning to profit if Bitcoin falls toward that level. Bitcoin’s drop this week is also moving in line with the performance of high-growth tech stocks. Companies tied to AI trends, such as Palantir and Nvidia, have seen their share prices fall as traders question whether valuations became too stretched. Bitcoin has often been viewed as a proxy for speculative appetite. It is now once again trading in sync with the mood of the wider equity market instead of acting as a hedge or separate alternative.

The kind that turns ordinary investors into crypto legends overnight? As markets hum with anticipation and altcoins flash green once more, analysts are asking which projects could define the next big wave. For anyone looking to buy top cryptos this month, momentum is everything, and right now, three names are dominating headlines for very different reasons: Chainlink, Polygon, and a meme-fueled titan-in-the-making, BullZilla. BullZilla is a cinematic token saga that blends utility with myth, tokenomics with storytelling, and community power with raw DeFi mechanics. Built on Ethereum, its presale structure and deflationary burns have captured serious attention among retail and pro traders alike. From a 2,235% ROI trajectory to a 70% APY staking furnace, BullZilla is showing the kind of growth pattern that early DOGE or SHIB holders would recognize instantly. For those planning to buy top cryptos this month, this beast is the next apex pick. Final Countdown: Grab BullZilla at $0.00022573 Before It Mutates to Stage 9C Chainlink ($LINK): FTSE Russell Partnership Brings On-Chain Benchmark Data Chainlink has been the backbone of decentralized data feeds for years, but its latest move might redefine on-chain finance altogether. In a first-of-its-kind partnership, FTSE Russell — the global index provider- has joined forces with Chainlink to bring equity, FX, and digital asset benchmarks directly to blockchain networks. Through Chainlink’s DataLink service, this integration connects FTSE Russell’s regulated data with over 2,000 applications across 50+ blockchains, creating an unprecedented bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. This collaboration effectively turns benchmark indices into programmable financial primitives, accessible to developers and institutions worldwide. With Chainlink’s infrastructure providing secure, verifiable feeds, the move could usher in a new era of institutional-grade on-chain finance. However, as this transformation unfolds, the LINK price dropped 7.44% to $14.85 in the last 24 hours, hinting that the market might still be digesting what could become one of the most consequential integrations in crypto’s evolution. Frequently Asked Questions About Chainlink Why is Chainlink in the spotlight this week?

Jared is an eccentric billionaire, who founded of Shift4 and commanders two private spaceflights. But Jared is also known to be close, long-term friends with Elon Musk, whose companies hold major influence in the U.S. space industry. In the statement shared Tuesday on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Jared’s passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.” That post marked the formal reinstatement of Jared’s nomination. The first nomination was withdrawn in late May after tensions between Trump and Elon, who at the time was involved in a White House effort to cut the size of federal agencies. Trump said the withdrawal was due to reviewing Jared’s “past associations,” but he did not explain further. Reports suggested the reference pointed to Jared’s earlier donations to Democrats, though nothing was confirmed from the White House. Isaacman reorganizes Shift4 and prepares for Senate confirmation Days after the pulled nomination, Jared addressed Shift4 investors. He wrote that his “brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience.” He then announced that he would step down as CEO and instead become executive chairman of the company he founded in 1999 at age 16. He had been planning to leave the CEO role if the Senate confirmed him to lead NASA, but the confirmation process did not take place at that time. Since July, NASA has been led temporarily by Sean Duffy, the Transportation Secretary, as interim administrator. That arrangement continues while the government remains shut down. The shutdown began at the start of October, but the Senate is still able to vote on presidential nominees. Jared will need Senate approval before he can officially take control of the agency. Jared has a long background in aerospace and military contracting.In 2012, he co‑founded Draken International, a Florida defense aviation company that operated one of the largest fleets of privately owned fighter jets. The company trained U.S. military pilots and managed defense contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Jared previously stated that the model saved taxpayers billions. Isaacman lays out NASA direction and answers questions in Senate hearing During nearly three hours of testimony, Jared described how he would reshape NASA around a “mission‑first” structure, with an emphasis on efficiency and stronger coordination with commercial partners. He supported Artemis II and III, which rely on the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft, but questioned their timelines and expenses. Jared asked, “Why is it taking us so long, and why is it costing us so much to go to the Moon?” He called for a data‑based review of these systems to determine whether they remain viable for long‑term space exploration. Jared said he would support extending the International Space Station through 2030, while increasing research output through public‑private research agreements. He also opposed a proposal from the White House to cut 50% of NASA’s science budget and 20% of its overall budget starting in 2026. Senators questioned Jared about NASA’s strategic reasons for potentially pushing toward Mars., and he responded that he would operate with transparency and would pursue a dual‑track strategy for the Moon and Mars. Senator Ed Markey asked Jared about his relationship with Elon Musk. Jared replied that they were not close and said he did not share NASA plans with Elon. He confirmed that he was interviewed only by Trump when offered the job. But when Markey asked whether Elon was present during that interview, Jared refused to directly answer.

The company, which already trades in Shanghai, priced its Hong Kong shares at HK$131.50 apiece, the top of its marketed range, but still 22% below its latest Shanghai closing price. More than 300 investors took part in the offering. Shares of Seres surged in gray market trading on Tuesday, showing early demand ahead of the formal listing. This IPO adds more fuel to a city already having its strongest year for new equity deals since 2021. In total, $51 billion has been raised through public offerings in 2025 so far. For Seres, listing in Hong Kong is about expanding its footprint outside the mainland, especially after the company’s stock posted a stunning 1,600% gain over five years in Shanghai. Seres climbs from minivans to luxury EVs with Huawei’s help Seres was founded in 1986, back when it only made springs and shock absorbers. Over time, it moved into motorcycles, then minivans. Now, the company sells one of China’s top-selling luxury electric cars, the Aito M9, thanks to its partnership with Huawei Technologies. The Aito brand, developed jointly by both companies, has helped Seres jump ahead of legacy brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz in the Chinese luxury auto segment. Even though the company has underperformed this year compared to the local benchmark, that didn’t stop its long-term rally.Seres has been listed in Shanghai since 2016, but this year’s intense price competition has weighed on all Chinese automakers. “Seres has achieved success through its Aito brand in partnership with Huawei,” said Eugene Hsiao, head of China equity strategy at Macquarie Capital. “Investors looking for a premium auto proxy may be interested in the shares.” The company’s Hong Kong move comes just as the city tries to rebuild its status as a financial hub. Paul Chan, Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary, said this week that the local economy grew 3.8% in the third quarter, driven by stronger exports, higher domestic spending, and surging tourism numbers. That puts Hong Kong on track to hit its 2% to 3% full-year growth goal. On top of that, its wealth management sector is growing fast; private banking assets have jumped 15%, and Bloomberg Intelligence expects the city to overtake Switzerland this year as the world’s largest cross-border finance hub. Beijing price war hits EV sales, BYD takes a hit While Seres enjoys the spotlight, the rest of China’s electric vehicle sector is feeling pressure. The Beijing government has called on automakers to stop cutting prices to win sales. The push is aimed at ending the aggressive competition that’s been squeezing margins and raising concerns about declining product quality. The impact of this crackdown has been limited so far, but many expect the industry to rush sales through the end of the year, before tax incentives and subsidies start getting phased out. One company that’s already feeling the pinch is BYD, the biggest EV maker in the world. In its latest earnings report, BYD said third-quarter net income dropped 33%, falling to 7.82 billion yuan or about $1.1 billion. It also reported that total revenue fell 3% to 194.98 billion yuan, far short of estimates for 216 billion yuan. Vehicle deliveries dropped 1.8% from the previous year, with the company shipping 1.15 million new energy vehicles, including both fully electric and hybrid models. In contrast, rivals like Geely Automobile and Chongqing Changan posted large sales gains in the same quarter, up 96% and 84%, respectively. Both are stepping up their push into EVs while the market remains volatile. But even with that momentum, the industry remains shaky. China’s leaders are still trying to rein in the ongoing price war, worried that a race to the bottom could ruin the long-term health of the domestic auto market.

SHIB is recognized by Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell as… pic.twitter.com/8jBpKkP9PL — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) November 2, 2025 Inclusion Signals Institutional Recognition Based on reports, the FTSE–Grayscale framework was launched in 2023 to sort crypto assets into clearer groups for investors. The framework covers five niches, and Grayscale’s latest report lists SHIB among the assets that meet the SEC’s Generic Listing Standards (GLS) criteria. The GLS rules, approved in September, let exchanges list crypto ETPs under a set of generic requirements rather than seeking individual sign-off for each token. That opens the door for more straightforward pathways to spot ETPs, although a token still needs an effective registration statement to trade as an ETF. Shiba Inu Among A Few Eligible Tokens Reports have disclosed that at least 11 cryptocurrencies across four sectors meet the GLS thresholds. In the Currencies sector, XRP, Litecoin, Stellar, and Bitcoin Cash are named. Smart contract platforms that qualify include Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche. Chainlink stands alone in Utilities & Services. In consumer and culture, only Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are recognized. Solana and Litecoin ETFs are already trading in the US, while Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash are still awaiting approvals. Valour Inc. has issued a SEK-denominated ETP tied to SHIB in Europe, and asset manager T. Rowe Price has mentioned SHIB as a candidate for inclusion in its Active Crypto ETF, but SHIB does not yet have a standalone spot ETF filing in the US.

54043351,620422,1762308053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54043351.jpeg,Bitcoin Loses $105K Level As SSR Signals Fresh Capital Ready To Deploy – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-loses-105k-level-ssr-signals-fresh-capital/,"Bitcoin has broken below the $105,000 level, deepening market fears as selling pressure accelerates across the crypto landscape. The sharp move lower comes at a time when confidence is wavering, volatility is rising, and traders are bracing for possible further downside. Yet beneath the surface, a key on-chain indicator suggests that a critical liquidity shift may be approaching — one that has historically preceded major rebounds. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) has now fallen back into the same low zone seen just before Bitcoin’s earlier recovery this year, hovering around the 13–14 range. This indicator measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s market capitalization and the total market cap of stablecoins, offering insight into the amount of “dry powder” available on the sidelines. When SSR declines, it typically signals that stablecoin liquidity — potential buying power — is increasing relative to Bitcoin’s valuation. Historically, this zone has often acted as a turning point, where capital quietly builds before re-entering risk assets. SSR Signals Hidden Liquidity — But With a Cycle-End Twist According to CryptoQuant analyst Woominkyu, the behavior of the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) offers critical insight into Bitcoin’s current position in the market cycle. When SSR drops, stablecoin liquidity — effectively the dormant “buying power” sitting on the sidelines — rises. This dynamic often precedes market recovery phases, as capital quietly prepares to rotate into Bitcoin. Conversely, when SSR climbs, it typically reflects liquidity being deployed already, aligning with overheated markets and distribution periods. Right now, SSR is retesting its yearly lows while Bitcoin trades near $104,000 and attempts to consolidate. This alignment has historically marked powerful turning points, suggesting that fresh capital could be preparing to re-enter. In previous cycles, similar setups preceded relief rallies and, in some cases, explosive upside continuation. That makes the current environment particularly intriguing, even as bearish sentiment dominates and fear spreads across the market. However, Woominkyu highlights a key nuance that traders cannot ignore: each SSR rebound zone in recent cycles has shown diminishing strength. In other words, while liquidity is accumulating, the magnitude of these signals appears to be weakening. This could mean that crypto’s liquidity engine — once driven heavily by rapid stablecoin expansion and speculative inflows — is slowing. If this interpretation holds, Bitcoin may still see a recovery rally from current levels, potentially even one final push toward euphoric highs. But it also suggests the possibility that the market is gradually transitioning into a new phase — one defined less by aggressive liquidity cycles and more by maturing capital flows, institutional participation, and slower reflexive momentum. Bitcoin Slides Toward Key Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin’s price action continues to deteriorate as market volatility rises, with BTC now trading around $104,000 after breaking below the $105,000 level. On the 8-hour chart, the structure remains fragile, and the series of lower highs and lower lows highlights persistent bearish momentum. Attempts to reclaim the $110,000 region earlier in the week were rejected near the cluster of moving averages, reinforcing that sellers currently control the market. The highlighted consolidation zones around $109,000–$111,000 and $106,000–$108,000 have flipped into resistance, providing a visual map of where supply continues to overwhelm demand. Now, price is approaching a critical demand zone near $102,000–$103,000. This area has historically attracted dip buyers, but if it fails, Bitcoin may be exposed to a deeper retrace toward psychological support closer to $100,000. Volume has noticeably increased on recent red candles, suggesting panic-driven selling and forced liquidations rather than calm distribution. Meanwhile, moving averages are starting to roll over, and the 50-EMA has turned sharply lower, signaling momentum loss. Bulls need to defend this current support region to avoid further downside acceleration. Until Bitcoin reclaims at least the $108,000–$110,000 zone, the market bias leans bearish, and traders should expect volatility and caution as price compresses near these key levels.

According to Rector, the rapid integration of blockchain technology into global finance positions XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to capture a share of an emerging market potentially valued at up to $30 trillion within the next decade. Tokenization: The Next Major Financial Shift Rector highlights the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), such as real estate, commodities, debt instruments, and private equity, as one of the most significant developments in modern finance. He cites estimates from Ripple and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) suggesting that the total value of tokenized assets could reach between $12 trillion and $23 trillion by 2033, with a conservative upper range of $20 to $30 trillion moving on-chain over the next ten years. He explains that XRP’s future growth will likely depend less on retail speculation and more on its ability to bridge tokenized assets, support liquidity, and provide settlement mechanisms for institutional-grade financial activity. In his view, this represents the next evolution beyond XRP’s established role in cross-border payments. The Role of Regulation and Institutional DeFi A key factor in Rector’s forecast is the introduction of clearer regulations, referred to broadly as the upcoming Clarity Act , that would define how digital assets interact with traditional finance. Rector argues that such legislation would give institutions the confidence to adopt decentralized finance (DeFi) frameworks built on the XRP Ledger. He believes large-scale institutional DeFi has yet to emerge on XRPL because most holders have focused on accumulation rather than liquidity provision. However, once clearer compliance standards are in place, he expects financial institutions to develop regulated DeFi products and settlement tools, leading to a gradual but steady expansion in XRP utility through 2030 and beyond. Ripple’s Expanding Institutional Network Rector also points to Ripple’s recent acquisitions and partnerships as critical steps toward positioning XRPL within global financial infrastructure. He notes that Ripple Prime (formerly Hidden Road) will enable institutional clients to move post-trade settlement onto XRPL, potentially handling very large transaction volumes at minimal cost.

Other collaborations, including with Securitize, BlackRock, and VanEck, involve projects to tokenize money market funds and allow on-chain redemption through Ripple’s dollar-backed token, RLUSD. Rector interprets these moves as groundwork for real-world utility beyond retail trading. Liquidity Is the True Value Driver Rector cautions that tokenizing assets alone will not automatically raise XRP’s price. Instead, he emphasizes that liquidity and transactional demand will determine the token’s value. He notes that the combination of Ripple’s partnerships, XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX), and new automated market maker (AMM) features could enable the ledger to handle large-scale institutional liquidity. In his view, the long-term outlook for XRP depends on whether these liquidity flows materialize and whether XRPL continues to attract major financial players seeking compliant, low-cost settlement solutions. While Rector describes his projections as optimistic, he maintains that the convergence of regulation, infrastructure, and institutional integration could position XRP at the core of a new era of financial tokenization. He concludes that XRP’s success will ultimately depend not on speculation, but on how effectively it serves as the liquidity engine of a tokenized global economy.

At the same time, Chinese AI bots outperformed ChatGPT in crypto trading, reinforcing confidence in AI-driven strategies.

Australia’s new cryptocurrency laws, which promote investor protection and transparency, further boost market confidence. Expanding ETF access boosts demand worldwide and institutional inflows, making this launch favorable for BTC. To support Bitcoin’s price rebound from its recent decline to $102,250, analysts anticipate fresh buying pressure. China’s Budget AI Bots Beat ChatGPT in Crypto Trading In a worldwide cryptocurrency trading competition , two inexpensive Chinese AI models, QWEN3 MAX and DeepSeek beat OpenAI’s ChatGPT demonstrating China’s increasing advantage in AI-driven finance. Each bot in the Alpha Arena-hosted event received $10,000 to trade on the Hyperliquid market on its own. Whereas all other models including ChatGPT concluded with losses ChatGPT losing 57% of its capital QWEN3 stood out with a 7.5% profit ($751).

The confidence about AI’s potential to improve market forecasts was strengthened by its winning strategy. Due to QWEN3’s long BTC attitude, which showed a strong belief in a price rebound, this achievement increased investor confidence in BTC. As AI-powered trading tools become more widely used, traders see opportunities for more intelligent, data-driven Bitcoin tactics, which will boost the market sentiment for the cryptocurrency. BitMine Buys $294M in Ethereum as Tom Lee Predicts Major Bitcoin Rally BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) has increased its ETH holdings to 3.39 million ETH or roughly 2.8% of the total supply, by adding $294 million to its treasury. Under the direction of Chairman Tom Lee, the company now has more than $12.5 billion in Ethereum, making it the second-largest cryptocurrency treasury after Strategy’s $69 billion in BTC. Lee is still very hopeful, even though ETH fell 6.9% to $3,617 and BMNR’s stock fell 25% in a single month. Strong fundamentals, such as increased stablecoin volume and record on-chain revenues, indicate an impending rise, he told CNBC. Lee sees the recent $19 billion liquidation as “a market reset” and predicts that Bitcoin could reach $150K–$200K and Ethereum could reach $7K by year’s end. The market’s mood has improved due to BitMine’s aggressive ETH acquisition and Lee’s optimistic outlook, which has strengthened belief in the ability of both Ethereum and Bitcoin to rebound. Bitcoin Technical Forecast: $97K in Focus as Bears Dominate Bitcoin price prediction is bearish as BTC trades near $101,300, extending losses after a decisive breakdown from a symmetrical triangle that’s guided price action since mid-September. The failed rebound from $106,300 confirms resistance, while both the 50-EMA and 200-EMA slope downward, signaling continued bearish control. A three black crows pattern highlights strong selling momentum, and the RSI near 28, though oversold, shows no bullish divergence yet, implying weakness may persist. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key support rests at $100,400, with the next downside target at $97,600, where historical buying interest could emerge. A daily close below $100K would confirm a deeper correction, while a recovery above $103,500 could spark a short-term bounce toward $106K–$108K. For now, the path of least resistance remains lower, but this extended selloff may mark a late-stage shakeout, potentially paving the way for Bitcoin’s next major rebound as long-term accumulation quietly builds.

Bitcoin slid to a five-month low on Wednesday, briefly breaking below $100,000 as investors reacted to the prolonged US government shutdown and fresh signs of slowing growth. Ether led losses, falling more than 12% to $3,179. The drop leaves Bitcoin near its weakest level since May, roughly 20% below its early October peak above $126,000, as enthusiasm fades and liquidity thins. Liquidations accelerated. About $2.09b of crypto positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours, CoinGlass data showed, including $1.68b from longs. The tally remains far below October’s record $19b washout, yet traders have turned more cautious since that rout. Markus Thielen, CEO at 10X Research, told Cryptonews: “The issue today isn’t excessive futures leverage, it’s the long spot holders stepping back.” “Powell’s signal that a December rate cut is not guaranteed removed a key pillar of confidence just as mega-whale selling began to outweigh whale buying, a dynamic that emerged immediately after the FOMC meeting,” he added.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their largest one-day declines since Oct. 10, with tech weakness setting the tone as the market reassessed stretched valuations tied to the artificial intelligence boom. Executives at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs cautioned on bubble risks after a series of all-time highs for the S&P 500. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon earlier warned of a significant correction risk over the next six months to two years, citing geopolitical tensions. Longest-Ever US Shutdown Freezes Data as Markets Search for Direction The government shutdown, driven by a congressional impasse, is nearing a record at 36 days. With official statistics on hold, investors are leaning on private gauges such as the ADP National Employment Report due Wednesday, while parsing Federal Reserve commentary for policy signals in a data vacuum. Sector moves were stark. Tech shares fell 2.3% to pace declines across the S&P 500’s 11 sectors, while financials led the gainers. Futures later pointed to a softer US open, adding to nerves. Asia followed Wall Street lower. MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8%, dragged by a 4.1% slide in South Korea’s Kospi. US e-mini futures eased another 0.4% after the S&P 500’s 1.2% drop overnight. Flows remained selective, with buyers stepping back on strength and bids thinning on weakness. Traders Cite Trump’s China Rhetoric, Liquidity Strains, and Fed Doubts as Pressure Builds Macro cross-currents kept pressure on crypto. Traders cited President Trump’s ongoing trade fights, including a recent threat against China that preceded October’s record liquidations, along with worries about liquidity and fading confidence in a possible third US rate cut in 2025. Still, there are potential upside markers. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, said Bitcoin could test $115,000 to $120,000 if macro signals improve, while Ether may rebound toward $4,200 on layer-2 scaling gains and a firmer DeFi backdrop. “Key catalysts to monitor include upcoming Fed rate decisions, ongoing ETF inflows, and regulatory clarity from global bodies such as the SEC, all of which could accelerate mainstream integration,” he said. “That said, geopolitical tensions and unexpected inflation prints remain key downside risks that could trigger abrupt pullbacks.” The post Asia Market Open: Crypto Markets Tumble, Bitcoin Slides to 5-Month Low as Global Stocks Flash Red appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-05 02:58:53

Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Loses Key Support Amid 8% Drop, Risks Major Correction To This Level Bitcoin Plunges To Physiological Barrier On Tuesday, Bitcoin saw a 9% drop from its weekly opening, dropping to the $100,000 area for the first time in months. The flagship crypto has been trading above $105,000 since late June, hovering between $108,000-$120,000 over the past four months. During the early October correction, BTC’s price briefly deviated below these crucial levels, hitting a three-month low of $102,000 before recovering. Since then, the cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim the mid-zone of its local range, falling to the $106,000-$108,000 area multiple times in the daily timeframe. As the price retested the $100,000 level, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted that Bitcoin has now broken below its 10th of October low, which was “the last major level before the $98K low from the Middle Eastern war fud back in June.” Analyst Ted Pillows highlighted that BTC has two massive liquidity clusters on the longer timeframes. Per the chart, the first cluster sits around the $90,000 level, which also coincides with an open CME Gap from Q2. Meanwhile, the second cluster sits around the all-time high area at $126,000. “Given that the market is looking weak now, a dump to fill the CME gap before reversal could happen,” the market watcher warned. However, Ali Martinez suggested that a 5%-11% rebound from the current area is possible. The chart shows that Bitcoin has been trading between $101,300-$124,000 price range since May, bouncing from the lower boundary each time it was retested. If BTC holds this area, it could surge to at least $106,500 or $112,000, the analyst asserted. BTC Retests 50-Week EMA Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC had reached the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The analyst explained that after closing below the 21-week EMA, Bitcoin was deviating below its range lows for the fifth consecutive week. The 21-week EMA has served as crucial support during pullbacks since late Q2. However, it was lost amid the recent market volatility. Last week, multiple analysts warned that closing above this level was crucial to turn it back into support and prevent a larger pullback. Per the Tuesday post, the 50-week EMA, sitting around the $100,000 level, “would probably only get tagged on confirmed breakdown from $108k,” meaning that the flagship crypto will need to close the week above this level to maintain its current price range. Similarly, Crypto Bullet pointed out that the 50-week MA retest was “the moment of truth” for BTC. Notably, the cryptocurrency has retested this indicator three times this cycle, marking the bottom of each corrective phase and the start of a new rally to a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Is Crypto ‘Boring’ Now? Bitwise CEO Says The Market Is Changing The market watcher warned that losing this level would mean “it’s lights out” for the flagship cryptocurrency. However, a rebound from this area could set the stage for a price recovery and a potential bullish rally in late Q4. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $100,356, a 6% decline in the daily timeframe.

Reports have suggested that co-founder Charles Hoskinson blamed the Cardano community for the blockchain’s DeFi stagnation. However, Hoskinson has now publicly refuted those claims, calling them a misrepresentation of his comments. In a fiery response on the social media platform X, he criticized crypto media outlets for twisting his words, noting that he never blamed users for ADA’s DeFi struggles but instead highlighted a participation imbalance within the ecosystem. Hoskinson’s Clarification: I Never Blamed Anyone In a video on X addressing the controversy, Hoskinson expressed frustration at what he described as “fundamentally dishonest” reporting. He stated that the headlines portraying him as blaming Cardano users for the network’s DeFi woes were entirely false. He insisted that his initial comments were meant to identify a structural issue within the ecosystem. The structural issue is based on the difference between those who stake ADA and those who engage in decentralized finance, and it is not to assign blame. According to Hoskinson, over 1.3 million users actively participate in Cardano staking, while far fewer engage with the blockchain’s DeFi protocols. This disparity, he argued, explains why ADA’s total value locked (TVL) is modest compared to other networks . He estimated that if the same level of engagement were mirrored on both sides, Cardano’s DeFi TVL could range between $5 billion and $10 billion. Hoskinson pointed out that this observation was not a criticism of the community but an analytical point about user behavior and ecosystem growth patterns. “There’s not a single person in the Cardano ecosystem who I am blaming for our DeFi situation,” he said. A Closer Look At Cardano’s DeFi Sector Hoskinson went on to explain that the problem lies not in lack of community engagement, but in the absence of proportional participation between governance and DeFi. According to him, Cardano’s large user base and strong staking participation prove the network’s health and scale, and this contradicts claims that it only has between 10,000 and 50,000 active users. The real challenge, he said, is understanding why the majority of participants who stake their ADA are not also contributing to DeFi liquidity. These challenges could be factors such as slippage, fees, user experience, yields, and education. Despite the controversy surrounding the misinterpretation of Hoskinson’s remarks, there is still an underlying issue of Cardano’s sluggish DeFi growth. On-chain data still shows that ADA’s daily active addresses have dropped from over 32,000 in mid-October to around 24,000 in early November. According to data from DeFiLlama , the Cardano network currently has the 26th largest TVL, with only about $243.2 million in 60 protocols. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.5417, down by 6.2% in the past 24 hours. However, the decline is not limited to Cardano alone, as the entire crypto market is currently down by 4% in the past 24-hour timeframe.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano network|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson|defillama|Total Value Locked|TVL,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-05 03:00:47

The sell-off hit fast and without hesitation, wiping gains from some of the most crowded trades in global equity markets. Japan’s Nikkei 225 plunged below the 50,000 mark on Wednesday for the first time in weeks. The Topix index also weakened, sliding 2.27% as large-cap technology backers like SoftBank absorbed heavy losses. Advantest, which supplies semiconductor testing equipment, lost more than 8%, and Renesas Electronics dropped 5.48%, adding to downside pressure on Japan’s tech-heavy indices. Asia tech and chip stocks saw heavy selling across markets South Korea’s Kospi fell 5.97%, with chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix posting losses of over 7% and 8% respectively. The small-cap Kosdaq shed 5.39%. The downturn also hit Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, which slipped 2%. In China, Alibaba dropped more than 3%, and Tencent was over 2% lower. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index lost 1.36%, and the CSI 300 in mainland China plunged by 0.9%. Even Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 saw declines, falling 0.77%, though its exposure to AI-linked firms is smaller than the others. Investors traced the Asian sell-off to losses in major U.S. AI and cloud names the previous evening. Palantir fell about 8%, despite reporting stronger-than-expected third-quarter results. Oracle slid 4%, AMD dropped nearly 4%, and Nvidia and Amazon both moved lower as well. Traders focused less on earnings beats and more on how stretched valuations have become. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio has climbed above 23, its highest level since 2000, raising concern that the market may be replaying the conditions leading up to the dot-com bubble. Meanwhile, Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, disclosed new short positions through Scion Asset Management targeting Nvidia and Palantir. Both companies have become key symbols of the AI boom and its sky-high valuations. The sell-off was also influenced by cautious remarks from Wall Street. CEOs of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley said this week that investors should prepare for a potential market drawdown over the next two years. Their comments landed at the same time that Capital Group suggested the “everything rally” had run too far. Andrew Jackson, head of Japanese equity strategy at Ortus Advisors, summed up the day’s sentiment clearly: “Finally, a sell-off hits the tape as the ‘everything rally’ takes a breather after comments from the CEOs, and Capital Group that markets were due a correction.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Business|Softbank,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-05 03:31:35

If approved by the US derivatives regulator, Gemini would compete with dominant players, including Kalshi and Polymarket. Sources noted that the billionaire brothers-run crypto platform has discussed launching products “as soon as possible.” Gemini Awaits US Regulatory Approval, Which May Take Months or Years The exchange, in May, applied to create a designated contract market with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Gemini is considering listing prediction-based derivatives contracts on the platform. However, the US derivatives regulator can take months or years to approve a new exchange. Additionally, the recent government shutdown could further delay the approval process. Gemini closed its initial public offering (IPO) in September, pulling in $425 million, marking one of the strongest debuts for a digital asset platform. At the time, the New York-based firm teased this new venture in a filing that it intended to launch event contracts for “economic, financial, political and sports forecasts.” Prediction Markets See Massive Demand The move comes amid growing demand for prediction markets, driven by platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket showing record volume growth . Kalshi is already registered with the US CFTC, while Polymarket is considering reopening in the US soon. An analyst from investment bank Needham told Bloomberg that Gemini’s plans would expand beyond its current offerings, as prediction markets offer an “attractive opportunity.” Elsewhere, platforms like CME Group have made their own moves into the arena. Meanwhile, crypto exchange behemoth Coinbase said in a recent earnings call that it would expand into event contracts to broaden its offerings as part of “Everything Exchange.” Further, Robinhood said that it is launching a prediction market where users can trade on the outcome of games. James Newman, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Chiliz, the sports blockchain, told Cryptonews at the time that the launch is the latest signal of a growing adoption of blockchain-based fan engagement platforms. “This is indicative of a trend we’re seeing where more and more industry players are taking notice of the prediction market space,” Newman told Cryptonews. “The challenge is how we can integrate into prediction markets sustainably, while balancing innovation with responsibility.” The post Gemini Exchange Prepares for Prediction Market Contracts Launch: Bloomberg appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Gemini|Winklevoss Twins,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-05 03:57:24

Related Reading: CryptoQuant Head Reveals Reason Behind Bearish Bitcoin Trend The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Active Addresses,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on a given network every day. When the value of this metric rises, it means more users are making transfers on the blockchain. Such a trend implies trading interest in the cryptocurrency may be on the rise. On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline suggests investors may be shifting their attention elsewhere as they are reducing their transaction activity on the network. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator for Ethereum, the largest of the altcoins, over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Active Addresses metric was at a high of 589,000 in late July. Since then, activity on the network has gone downhill, with there now being 488,000 addresses making transactions, around 17% lower than the peak. “Fewer users interacting on ETH indicates weaker on-chain demand, a pattern seen in past bear-market phases,” explained Sentora. Solana, another prominent altcoin, has been showing a similar trend. How the monthly value of the Active Addresses has changed for SOL over the last few years | Source: Sentora on X From the chart, it’s clear that the monthly version of the Active Addresses witnessed a notable decline for SOL during Q3 2025. More specifically, active users on the blockchain dropped by about 30% in this period. “Solana has been the out-performer this cycle, but momentum is cooling,” noted the analytics firm. Memecoins have been hit hard in the recent market downturn, and the same has held true for their on-chain activity. Dogecoin, the largest meme-based token, has only witnessed a slight decrease in Active Addresses, but Pepe has gone through a drawdown of 85%. “This drop shows how quickly speculative user bases can evaporate,” said Sentora.

The metric is still relatively strong compared to other cryptocurrency-related indicators, but a change in direction is apparent. With the crash in prices and downturn in on-chain activity, is the altcoin sector entering a season of winter? “It’s too early to tell but the current data echoes past cycles,” noted Sentora. “We are already 6+ months into an altcoin slowdown, with winter signs popping up.” Ethereum Price Ethereum has plunged alongside the rest of the market during the past day as its price has retraced to $3,300.

The integration marks a pivotal expansion of Ripple’s enterprise capabilities, positioning it more firmly within the institutional blockchain space. Palisade’s infrastructure will now form a key component of Ripple’s next-generation custody and payments architecture, providing a secure and scalable framework for digital asset management. The acquisition consolidates Ripple’s control over the digital asset lifecycle, bringing together three essential elements of its ecosystem: XRP for real-time settlement, RLUSD for institutional liquidity, and Palisade’s technology for multi-asset custody. This comprehensive integration extends Ripple’s reach beyond traditional fintech tools into foundational infrastructure for institutional blockchain operations. BREAKING: @Ripple just acquired @palisadeinc and this is massive. Palisade’s wallet-as-a-service platform will now power Ripple’s next-generation custody and payments infrastructure, unlocking enterprise-grade wallet tech for institutions across the globe. The same team.… pic.twitter.com/nI4Y9wjaHJ — Pumpius (@pumpius) November 4, 2025 Institutional Impact and Ecosystem Integration According to crypto commentator Pumpius, the move signifies more than an expansion of Ripple’s service suite; it represents a strategic evolution toward full-stack financial architecture. Palisade’s technology, now operating within Ripple’s global network, provides enterprises with the tools to manage, transfer, and safeguard digital assets with heightened efficiency and regulatory readiness. The addition of secure wallet infrastructure enhances Ripple’s ability to serve institutions seeking compliant, reliable, and interoperable blockchain solutions. By leveraging Palisade’s proven expertise, Ripple can now offer enterprises an end-to-end solution covering custody, liquidity, and settlement — all under one ecosystem. The alignment between XRP , RLUSD, and Palisade demonstrates a deliberate strategy to unify payment execution and asset management under a single operational model.

Commenting on the development, a user described it as a “strategic win,” highlighting how the combination of XRP, RLUSD, and Palisade strengthens Ripple’s hold on enterprise infrastructure. The integration signals Ripple’s intent to be not merely a participant but a central architect of institutional adoption in the digital asset sector. The acquisition also reinforces Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand its suite of products beyond payments, focusing on end-to-end financial solutions that meet institutional standards of custody and settlement. With this move, Ripple demonstrates an ambition to define the operational backbone for the next phase of blockchain finance — one in which speed , security, and scalability converge to support global financial systems.

Cynthia Lummis says the Clarity Act will create the first full legal system for crypto stablecoins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lummis-calls-clarity-act-the-biggest-in-u-s/,"Sen. Cynthia Lummis stated that the Clarity Act is the largest crypto law in U.S. history, providing clear rules for the crypto industry after years of uncertainty. The Wyoming Republican said she and her staff work every day to garner support from both parties because the bill could significantly impact the U.S. financial system. Lummis works with both parties to get support from Senate Democrats for the bill Senator Lummis said her staff meets with Democrats almost every day to discuss the bill, as lawmakers who don’t understand or agree on the text before the committee vote may cause problems in the full Senate. She explained that the process is very different from the GENIUS Act because it covers most crypto assets , not just stablecoins, so lawmakers from both parties needed to agree on every part fully. Executives from major crypto companies also met with lawmakers multiple times in recent weeks, but disagreements over timing and leaked documents regarding the regulation of DeFi slowed down the talks. Senators also disliked how some lobbyists criticized the Democratic draft instead of working quietly to find solutions. But despite this feedback, Lummis says the bill is moving in the right direction because her team is working on building understanding and trust between Republicans and Democrats. She wants the Banking Committee to vote on the bill before the end of the year so that the full Senate can begin debates early next year. The Clarity Act could change how the U.S. regulates digital assets The Clarity Act will provide guidance to crypto companies on their responsibilities and limitations, enabling them to operate safely and protect both investors and consumers. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will serve as supervisors under the new ACT. Senator Lummis even praised SEC Chair Paul Atkins for using flexible programs so that crypto companies continue providing services even when the bill is still in progress. The bill also addresses the ongoing tension between traditional banks and crypto companies, as community banks have long complained that crypto exchanges offer rewards that they cannot match. The Senator informed the banks that the Clarity Act would enable them to provide custody and management services for digital assets legally, allowing them to compete fairly with crypto firms. Lummis also talked about the recent Custodia Bank case and said she was very disappointed that a federal appeals court ruled that the Wyoming-based bank could not access the Federal Reserve’s full payment system. She, however, noted that the Fed made a significant step forward when it created a “skinny master account” for special-purpose banks, as it demonstrates that they are beginning to recognize the importance of digital assets in the financial system. On related development, Lummis posted on X reiterating her comments that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is the only solution to offset the United States’ national debt. She noted , “I truly believe the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is the only solution to offset our national debt. I applaud @POTUS and his administration for embracing the SBR, and I look forward to getting it done.” Highlighting the federal government’s staggering $38 trillion debt , Lummis argues that Bitcoin’s scarcity, immutability, and storability render it an optimal long-term asset for the nation’s resilience. She recently stated that, according to the best available modeling, if Bitcoin is held for two decades, America can reduce its national debt by half.

He made the remarks in a televised interview, saying China “is getting into it very big right now,” and arguing that the US must act to keep its edge. US Vs China Crypto Stash According to figures cited in recent reports, the US is estimated to hold about 198,012 BTC , valued at roughly $21.32 billion, while China is estimated to hold about 194,000 BTC, worth about $20.89 billion. Those numbers are widely shared in media accounts, but analysts stress they are estimates based on available on-chain research and public data. The true picture may include private holdings that are not visible on public ledgers. Trump’s comments framed the issue as part of a wider contest over new finance and tech tools. He said the US should not cede ground, and he warned that overly heavy rules at home could push business and jobs elsewhere. Based on reports, his tone blends economic concern with national strategy. Trump doubles down on digital dominance: “I only care about one thing — will the U.S. be number one in $crypto ? China is getting into it very big.” pic.twitter.com/M5cG5KsqYk — COACHTY (@TheRealTRTalks) November 3, 2025 Mining And Supply Links Reports have disclosed that Chinese manufacturers of mining equipment — names such as Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT — remain central to the global supply chain. Some of those firms have moved to set up manufacturing footholds outside of China, including in the US, a step that industry watchers say is meant to blunt trade pressure and meet demand from large buyers. This shows that influence over hardware and infrastructure can matter as much as who holds coins. Market players have been watching a mix of signals. Policy talk in Washington, trade moves, and public comments by political leaders have all fed into market swings. The Challenge Of Estimating Crypto Holdings Price moves can be sharp when headlines raise the prospect of tariffs, export controls, or broad new rules. That volatility affects investors and companies that are planning long-term projects. Analysts who study crypto holdings note that country-level estimates often rely on tracing flows and known addresses tied to exchanges or firms. Based on reports, those methods give useful hints but leave gaps. Some assets are held by private investors, trusts, or entities that do not disclose their positions. As a result, any single figure for national holdings should be treated with care.

54046646,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88615,1762318979,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"If XRP Reaches $10,000, a Single Drop Would Still be Worth Just 1 cent",https://timestabloid.com/if-xrp-reaches-10000-a-single-drop-would-still-be-worth-just-1-cent/,"Black Swan Capitalist founder, Versan Aljarrah, recently explained a key point about XRP’s scalability. Aljarrah noted that each XRP can be divided into 1 million units called drops, meaning that even if XRP were to reach $10,000 , a single drop would still be worth only one cent. According to him, this ensures XRP remains practical for everyday transactions regardless of price. Aljarrah linked this comment to his article, “How XRP Will Consolidate the Global Financial System,” in which he outlined why he believes XRP is positioned to become the backbone of global payments . He described XRP not as a speculative asset but as “the foundation of a multi-hundred-trillion-dollar financial framework” developing through infrastructure, adoption, and necessity. Each #XRP can be divided into 1 million units, known as drops. This means that even if one XRP were to reach $10,000, a single drop would still be worth just one cent. This ensures scalability at any price level and guarantees that XRP can be used for everyday transactions. https://t.co/MJmdrKewD3 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 2, 2025 Building Global Payment Corridors In his article, Aljarrah credited Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity product as the real driver of XRP’s growth. He explained that traditional payment systems like SWIFT rely on nostro-vostro accounts that trap capital and slow settlement. Ripple’s solution uses XRP as a bridge asset , enabling banks to convert and transfer value across currencies. These corridors, already active across several regions, form a growing network of regulated payment routes. Aljarrah emphasized that each new corridor increases the amount of XRP required for liquidity. As Ripple’s infrastructure expands, the token’s role in replacing legacy systems strengthens. He sees this as a steady transition, saying the system is evolving “corridor by corridor,” not through speculation but through operational progress. Regulation and Institutional Adoption A major section of his article focused on regulatory clarity. Aljarrah argued that Ripple’s legal victories and global licensing give XRP a distinct advantage. He referenced frameworks such as the EU’s MiCA and Abu Dhabi’s FSRA, stating that XRP already aligns with their standards. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that a U.S. federal judge’s ruling that XRP is not a security provides the legal foundation for banks and institutions to adopt it. This clarity, he said, is what enables sovereign and institutional integration. By securing compliance in multiple jurisdictions, Ripple positions XRP as a legally recognized settlement asset suitable for large-scale financial use. XRP’s Scalability Advantage Aljarrah’s post highlights the technical foundation that allows XRP to scale effectively at any valuation. By being divisible into 1 million drops, XRP can maintain transactional efficiency even if its value increases dramatically . This model ensures that the asset remains usable for both micro and institutional transactions, a critical feature for a global settlement layer. In Aljarrah’s view, such scalability is what enables XRP to realistically function as the core infrastructure of the evolving financial system.

Dogecoin barely budged at first, then slipped with the broader market. By early Nov. 5, DOGE traded lower on the day near $0.16, while Bitcoin and Ether were also in the red as risk appetite weakened. Speculators instead latched on to DOGE-1, a meme token that shares a name with a planned CubeSat mission funded in Dogecoin. Musk’s post was a reply to Dogecoin community member DogeDesigner (@cb_doge), who wrote “No Highs, No Lows, Only DOGE” and shared a 2021 screenshot of Musk’s promise that SpaceX would “put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon.” It’s time — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 3, 2025 On-Chain Data Shows Veteran Memecoin Trader Moving Into DOGE-1 Lookonchain noted DOGE-1 jumped about 300% after Musk’s post. But the token was last down 17.4% to $0.73 later in the session. On-chain traces pointed to one notable buyer. The trader known as god.sol, also called Mitch, spent roughly 100 SOL, about $14,800, to acquire 16.27m DOGE-1, according to wallet records. The wallet, which shows prior realized profits of about $2.8m from memecoin trading, has a history of short holding periods and rapid rotations. The DOGE-1 mission itself remains a real project. Developed by Geometric Energy Corporation and financed in Dogecoin, the payload is set to fly on a SpaceX Falcon 9. Filings indicate a late 2025 target after several delays. Elon Musk( @elonmusk ) once again said ""It's time"" to send Dogecoin to the moon. The memecoin DOGE-1 has since surged ~300%. Smart trader ""god.sol aka Mitch"", who previously profited $2.8M trading memecoins, just spent 100 $SOL ($14.8K) to buy 16.27M DOGE-1.… pic.twitter.com/tIGDuVCT6K — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 5, 2025 Musk Rekindles Dogecoin Talk, but Traders Are Sticking to Caution Musk’s Dogecoin connection runs deep. He has called it “the people’s crypto,” joked about a Martian currency, and once changed his X bio to “Former CEO of Dogecoin.” In 2021 his posts helped fuel a surge that pushed DOGE’s market value above $80b at the peak. This time, the backdrop looks tougher. Crypto opened November on the back foot after a bruising October, with liquidations and thin liquidity muting the familiar Musk effect. Bitcoin tumbled about 10% on Wednesday. Traders described a risk-off tape where rallies fade quickly and dips attract only selective bids. Rotation Into Safer Tokens Explains Diverging Moves Across the Meme Complex Macro also weighed on sentiment. Markets parsed hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve and a shaky global tone, a mix that has drained momentum from high beta tokens and pushed rotation into larger caps when volatility spikes. That rotation helps explain the split reaction. Dogecoin tracked the majors lower, while DOGE-1 became a short-lived target for momentum flows before profit taking knocked it back. The fast round trip fits a market laser focused on liquidity and exit lanes. For now, the trade is tactical. If broader conditions stabilize, meme pockets can reawaken quickly, especially when Musk posts. But with Bitcoin defending key levels and funding resetting across derivatives, many desks prefer tight risk and quick hands. As ever with meme tokens, the key tells sit on-chain. Watch wallets like god.sol for adds or exits, monitor exchange liquidity for DOGE and DOGE-1 and track SpaceX chatter that could revive speculative interest around the mission’s timeline.

Meanwhile, semiconductor firm Sequans sold 30% of its Bitcoin holdings to repay half of its debt, and called it a strategic move to strengthen its balance sheet. The decision sent Sequans’ shares tumbling more than 16%. Bitcoin Loses Steam Bitcoin’s price seems to be losing momentum after weeks of consolidation, which casts some doubt on the more optimistic predictions that it could surge toward $250,000 before the end of 2025. The world’s leading crypto slipped to a four-month low of around $100,800 this week, and analysts are now divided on whether the current cycle still has enough strength to produce another major rally before the year is out—or if the next real uptrend will only arrive in 2026. ShapeShift analyst Houston Morgan said in an interview that he does not expect Bitcoin to climb higher than $125,000 in 2025, which falls just short of the $126,000 all-time high that was reached on Oct. 4. Morgan suggested that Bitcoin’s recent price action has become too dependent on political headlines, particularly those tied to US President Donald Trump, and that a genuine bull run may not resume until the asset decouples from such macro correlations. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) At the same time, data from Bitfinex shows deepening selling pressure as long-term Bitcoin holders continue to distribute their coins. The exchange’s analysts pointed out that this ongoing outflow reflects “broader signs of exhaustion” in the market and warned that unless Bitcoin can recover above $116,000 soon, the price could face more downside into the end of the year. Historical trends show that when prices stagnate for prolonged periods, sentiment deteriorates and forced selling becomes more common—a risk amplified by the current market mood. In fact, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell sharply to 21 out of 100 on Tuesday, signaling “Extreme Fear” among traders. At press time, the score stood at 23, which also falls under the ‘Extreme Fear’ category. Crypto Fear and Greed Index Despite the gloom, some people in the industry still hold out hope for an explosive finish to the year. BitMine chair Tom Lee and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes reiterated on the Bankless podcast that they believe Bitcoin can still hit between $200,000 and $250,000 before 2026. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz , however, warned that such a move will require “the planets to align.” Looking ahead, analysts are still split on 2026’s outlook. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expects it to be a strong recovery year, while Andrew Lokenauth predicts a bear market similar to previous mid-cycle declines. Veteran trader Peter Brandt also recently added to the cautious tone by suggesting Bitcoin could even revisit levels as low as $60,000. Sequans Sells Bitcoin to Cut Debt Shares of semiconductor firm Sequans tumbled more than 16% on Tuesday after the company sold 30% of its Bitcoin holdings to redeem half of its convertible debt. The move was described by the company as a “strategic asset reallocation,” and it raised questions about its long-term Bitcoin accumulation plans, which previously aimed to reach 100,000 BTC over the next five years. Sequans CEO Georges Karam said that the sale was a tactical decision made to strengthen the company’s balance sheet amid challenging market conditions. “Our Bitcoin treasury strategy and our deep conviction in Bitcoin remain unchanged,” Karam stated. “This transaction was a tactical decision aimed at unlocking shareholder value given current market conditions.” He added that the sale “strengthens our financial foundation and removes certain debt covenant constraints,” which allows Sequans to focus on strategic initiatives while still maintaining Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. The sale reduced Sequans’ Bitcoin holdings from 3,234 BTC to 2,264 BTC, with proceeds used to cut its debt from $189 million to $94.5 million. However, investors still reacted negatively to the announcement, sending shares in Sequans (SQNS) down 16.6% to $5.92. The stock is now down close to 89% from its 2025 high of $53.90. Sequans share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) The sell-off now adds to growing skepticism surrounding corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies, especially for firms without strong underlying financials. While many companies initially saw share prices surge after announcing Bitcoin purchases, a number have since declined sharply as enthusiasm cooled. Sequans’ recent sale was first identified by crypto analysts last week after a 2,264 BTC transfer was spotted on-chain. The company now ranks as the 33rd largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, slipping four places since its previous acquisition in mid-July.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-05 05:30:00

After losing support above $4,000, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now showing more signs of a breakdown that could trigger a spiral. Multiple analysts have already shared where they see the Ethereum price going, and we take a look at two that look at both ends of the spectrum. A Recovery And Then A Crash Crypto analyst Melikatrader highlighted an important structure that the Ethereum price has formed recently, and that is a clear structure of recovery. This comes after the cryptocurrency completed a liquidity sweep around $3,700, which is referred to as a “Hunting.” Related Reading: Head And Shoulders Pattern Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $100,000 Now, with the liquidity sweep completed at this level, the analyst believes that this creates a potential base that could see the Ethereum price correct upwards. Amid this, the altcoin has also seen some consolidation between $3,700 and $3,800, making this range an important area of interest. If bulls are able to claim and hold this level, then it could put Ethereum on the path of another uptrend. It would put an end to the accumulation trend and kickstart another bullish run. Such a run would send the Ethereum price into the next supply zone, which lies at $4,080-$4,180, before seeing any major downward correction. Despite expecting the price to climb, the crypto analyst also highlights the fact that Ethereum is still flashing a bearish market structure. With the ascending trendline on the move, the price is expected to hit resistance around $4,100. If bears are able to successfully reject the price from this level, then the Ethereum price is expected to crash back below $4,000. Analyst Calls The Top For Ethereum Price While many in the space believe the current downtrend is only temporary, crypto analyst CRYPTO Damus believes that this could actually be the cycle top. In the post on X, he compares the current trend to that of the 2018 and 2021 cycle tops using the weekly chart. Related Reading: Here’s What Happens To The Dogecoin Price After The Consolidation Phase Ends Damus points out that there are similarities between the previous cycle tops and that the Ethereum price is currently following a similar playbook. This comes after consistent green candles, followed by red candles on the weekly chart, ending in a bear market. The analyst explains that it is possible that this time could be different, given the deviations in the market cycles so far. However, if it is the same trend from the last two bull cycles, that would mean that the bull run is over for Ethereum, and investors should brace for a crash.

The economic think tank claimed that Reeves will require an additional £50 billion ($65 billion) in her upcoming budget to stabilize the nation’s finances and cushion against future shocks. It warned that with interest costs rising sharply, the chancellor must run primary surpluses to keep debt from rising. Chancellor Rachel Reeves suggested she may increase taxes The last time the UK ran a primary surplus was in 2001–02, under Tony Blair, a period when the economy was growing much more rapidly and debt was only 30% of GDP. Public debt is now perilously close to 100% of GDP. In her pre-budget speech, Chancellor Reeves hinted at significant tax increases to patch up the UK’s strained finances. She did not necessarily certify that they would stick to the promises made in Labour’s election manifesto, not to hike income tax , VAT, or national insurance. When journalists asked if the pledge still held, she deflected, saying that she was “setting the context for Budget.” She added, “The choices I make in this Budget, this month, will be focused on getting inflation falling and creating the conditions for interest rate cuts to support economic growth and improve the cost of living.” She also vowed to craft a budget for growth rooted in fairness, targeting NHS backlogs, high debt levels, and the rising cost of living. However, many analysts and government leaders believed her address did not provide much clarity. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, branded the speech “one long waffle bomb,” arguing it left businesses completely in the dark. Reeves has yet to clarify which taxes could rise, though she seemed to rule out resigning if income tax were increased. When asked on LBC whether breaking the pledge should prompt her to step down, she replied, “I’m not going to walk away because the situation is difficult.” David Aikman says the next shock may result in a rise in debt David Aikman, director of NIESR, has warned that the UK’s public debt path is becoming “unsustainable,” and could surpass 100% of GDP unless stronger measures are introduced. Despite a £40 billion($52 billion) tax rise in her first budget, Reeves now faces an even bleaker debt picture, with much of the deterioration blamed on weaker productivity forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. NIESR expects the OBR to put the fiscal gap at between £20 billion and £30 billion, a smaller figure than its own, but argues that Reeves should go further and create a £30 billion ($39 billion) safety buffer. Aikman explained that the next economic shock would almost certainly push debt even higher, stressing the need to start reducing the debt ratio now to preserve the government’s ability to respond to future crises and invest effectively. The think tank also anticipates GDP to rise 1.5% in 2025 and 1.2% next year, though it noted that Reeves’s efforts to rein in the deficit could limit economic growth. Additionally, it forecasts that the Bank of England will make two 0.25% rate reductions next year, as inflation remains over 3% through next spring before returning to the 2% goal. Meanwhile, other influential think tanks have published proposals on how taxes can be made fairer and economic growth improved without worsening the budget shortage. They argued that outmoded and unequal tax policies have led to restricted investment and production. Additionally, they recommended the removal of stamp duty, a reduction in VAT, and an increase in the goods subject to levy. Moreover, they are encouraging the merging of income tax and national insurance.

In a brief video, the Cardano founder said media outlets misrepresented his prior comments about participation patterns across the ecosystem, stressing that his point was a structural “mismatch” between who stakes and governs versus who takes part in DeFi—not blame. “I never once blamed anyone from the Cardano ecosystem for the DeFi [woes],” Hoskinson said , naming The Crypto Basic as an example of outlets whose framing he called fundamentally inaccurate. “I’m sorry crypto media that you guys are and you just want clickbait headlines. You guys have to cut this the […] out.” He added that there is “not a single person in the Cardano ecosystem who I am blaming for our DeFi situation right now.” Cardano’s DeFi Gap Is A Participation Mismatch Hoskinson’s core claim is numerical and directional rather than accusatory. He argued there is a demonstrable divergence between Cardano’s high participation in staking and governance and its lower participation in DeFi protocols, which depresses total value locked. “I pointed out in a video that there is a mismatch between the people who participate in staking and governance and the people who participate in DeFi. And if there was proportionality there… our TVL would be at least five to 10 billion,” he said. He characterized the recent headlines as “materially wrong and factually wrong” because they attributed intent—“blaming users”—that he explicitly disavowed. The founder anchored his point in a specific user count comparison. Some third-party measurements, he said, “are asserting that Cardano has only 10,000 to 50,000 actual users when there’s 1.3 million who are using staking.” For Hoskinson, that delta underscores that Cardano “has a large population, a large wallet base, and a lot of users as evidenced by the enormous level of participation in both governance and staking,” even if those participants are not currently “deploying to the other side of the aisle, to the TVL side, to the DeFi side.” He repeatedly emphasized that diagnosing the participation gap is an ecosystem responsibility, not a morality play. “I’m not blaming them for not participating,” he said. “Never once said it’s their fault and they’re bad people and they’ve done something wrong.” Instead, he called for a frank community conversation about the drivers behind users’ choices. “It could be slippage. It could be fees. It could be user experience. It could be yields. It could be safety concerns. It could be education. There could be 150,000 different reasons for that. But we as an ecosystem have to have that discussion.” The remedy, in his view, is a coordinated governance agenda rather than a media narrative. He urged Cardano stakeholders to treat the participation gap as a 2026 workstream and to fund targeted initiatives through delegated authority. “We as an ecosystem have to ask why that mismatch exists and how can we correct that mismatch… as a 2026 governance agenda, and get some delegated authority funding and effort to correct that,” he said. If the proportionality problem were addressed, Hoskinson argued, “that alone can get our TVL up 5 billion to 10 billion,” potentially placing Cardano “in the top ranks of TVL, the top five to top 10.” The dispute originated, he said, when media took a narrow, data-driven observation about where Cardano users allocate capital and translated it into a blame narrative. “People say something very specific, very targeted, and then it gets misinterpreted, and then everybody judges you based upon the headlines,” he said. “I’m not going to allow the crypto media to go ahead and put words in my mouth.” He reiterated the same point multiple times for emphasis: “I did not blame the Cardano ecosystem. I did not blame the Cardano users for anything. I was very careful, guarded, and specific in the things that I said.” Hoskinson coupled the clarification with a broader critique of crypto media practices. “If you continue to broadcast, you’re lying to people,” he said, adding, “I expect that from the crypto media because they are scum. They do lie. Everything’s sensational. Everything’s clickbait.” He framed his intervention as a corrective to prevent a headline cycle from hardening into accepted fact: “The record has been corrected.” Beyond media criticism, the practical substance of his message focused on mobilizing existing users rather than conjuring new ones. “We have the users. We have the capital,” he said. “For some reason, those users with their capital are not participating in DeFi.” While he acknowledged having personal “suspicions” and hearing “frustrations” from ecosystem participants, he stopped short of diagnosing root causes, instead calling for an open, data-first process to “systematically chip away” at barriers that deter stakers and governance participants from crossing into DeFi activity. Across the video, Hoskinson’s throughline never deviated: the issue is proportional participation by an already large user base. “There is a mismatch between the people participating in staking and governance—of which it’s seven figures over a million people—and the people participating in DeFi ,” he said. “We have to get to the bottom of that mismatch as an ecosystem… But I’m not blaming the Cardano users for that mismatch. I’m not saying it’s their fault. I’m not saying that they did something wrong.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.538.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-05 06:00:23

Its outlook points to growing trader interest in early-stage tokens showing real progress before the broader rally starts. One of those projects is Noomez ($NNZ) , now in Stage 2 of its presale and drawing massive attention for its transparent structure and fast-paced growth among retail investors. The Next Crypto Bull Run: Why Analysts See Early Signals Forming Market sentiment is slowly turning positive after months of sideways trading. Bitcoin and Ethereum are stabilizing near key levels, and analysts like Claude believe this steady base could set the stage for the next major rally. Institutional inflows through ETFs have increased, stablecoin supply on exchanges is rising, and retail participation is starting to recover. These are early signs of renewed risk appetite. Historically, such conditions have preceded major breakouts by several months. According to on-chain data, accumulation wallets are growing, and long-term holders are adding positions instead of selling. When asked when is the next crypto bull run expected , most analysts point to early to mid-2026 as a likely start, assuming macro stability and consistent liquidity inflows. If these trends hold, early presales like Noomez ($NNZ) may already be positioned to capture the first wave of speculative energy before the market’s next expansion phase. Why Presales Often Lead Market Recoveries Before Major Coins Rally Early-Stage Advantage Presales tend to outperform in the months leading up to a market recovery. Smaller tokens attract buyers who want higher potential returns before liquidity floods back into large caps. During these quiet phases, traders look for transparent projects with visible progress and fair tokenomics. This early accumulation phase often builds the foundation for explosive growth once confidence returns. Community Accumulation Before each major market cycle, retail communities gather around low-cap projects that feel accessible and exciting. Unlike top-tier coins, presales allow small investors to participate from the ground up. This mix of accessibility and community hype has historically triggered the first sparks of every bull market. Historical Trend Analysts reviewing past cycles note that presales from 2020 and 2021 delivered massive gains months before Bitcoin’s all-time highs. The next crypto bull run prediction follows a similar pattern, with structured presales like Noomez ($NNZ) positioned to benefit first as optimism builds. Noomez Emerges as the Standout Presale Heading Into 2026 Among the few presales showing real traction, Noomez ($NNZ) is an impressive project for its structured, transparent approach. The project is built on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) and operates with a fixed supply of 280 billion tokens , removing the risk of hidden inflation. Its presale spans 28 stages , starting at around $0.00001 and ending near $0.0028 , offering early participants clear price visibility. Each stage closes within seven days or once sold out, and any unsold tokens are permanently burned , tightening supply as the project progresses. The live Noom Gauge visually tracks presale completion, showing investors each milestone in real time. With Stage 2 now active and filling fast, the project has already attracted insane retail attention. Its mix of visible progress, deflationary design, and fair entry pricing has positioned Noomez as one of the strongest early contenders ahead of the next market recovery. How Noomez Could Set the Tone for the Next Retail Wave The growing interest in Noomez ($NNZ) isn’t just about price; it’s about structure. The project rewards participation through its Noom Recruit referral program, giving both the referrer and the new buyer a 10% token bonus on every confirmed purchase. This system is fully automated, tracked in real time on the dashboard, and backed by a fixed 5% allocation, ensuring the total supply remains intact. Beyond referrals, the project will open staking pools after launch, allowing holders to earn rewards for locking tokens between 30 and 365 days . What’s next for Noomez: Post-launch, Noom Engine to distribute partner tokens automatically. Vault events at Stage 14 and 28 with major token rewards and burns. Full liquidity lock at launch for verifiable security. Together, these steps demonstrate that Noomez is a carefully planned system designed to sustain value, attract retail attention, and potentially lead the first wave of the next bull run.

Key Takeaways: Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race, becoming the city’s first Muslim mayor. Polymarket traders accurately predicted Mamdani’s victory, continuing their strong record in major political forecasts. Mamdani’s cautious stance on crypto signals tighter oversight and consumer protection for New York’s digital asset sector. According to unofficial results from the city’s Board of Elections , Mamdani secured just over 50% of the vote, defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who captured around 40%. The Associated Press officially called the race for Mamdani on Wednesday. Polymarket Traders Score Again After Predicting Mamdani’s NYC Mayoral Win Data from Polymarket, the blockchain-based prediction platform, showed that 92% of traders bet on a Mamdani victory before election day , including a $1 million position that pushed implied odds close to certainty. The result adds to Polymarket’s growing track record after correctly forecasting both Donald Trump’s presidential victory last year and New York’s Democratic mayoral primary in June. Mamdani, 34, a Ugandan-born, Queens-raised progressive and self-described democratic socialist, becomes New York’s first Muslim mayor. His campaign centered on affordability, including tackling rent, childcare, and public service funding through higher taxes on the city’s wealthiest 1%. While Mamdani’s victory represents a breakthrough for New York’s progressive movement, it also raises questions for the city’s crypto and fintech sectors. Unlike previous mayors, including Eric Adams and Cuomo, who voiced open support for digital assets, Mamdani’s stance has been cautious. As a member of the State Assembly, he co-sponsored Bill A7389C, seeking a moratorium on proof-of-work crypto mining using on-site power generation, citing environmental and community concerns. “When crypto companies collapse, it isn’t the rich who suffer,” Mamdani said in 2023 after the Terra and FTX meltdowns. “It’s small investors from low-income and communities of color.” Andrew Cuomo could’ve spent the years since his resignation making amends and helping New Yorkers. Instead he hounded the women who spoke out about his serial harassment, fought to keep his book deal millions…and advised a foreign crypto exchange that broke US law. pic.twitter.com/kBxkNGdrgA — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) April 2, 2025 The mayor-elect has consistently emphasized consumer protection and transparency over industry expansion. His comments align with New York Attorney General Letitia James’ push for stronger oversight, including the proposed crypto transaction tax projected to generate over $150 million annually. Crypto Titans Clash with Mamdani as Billionaires Fund Anti-Mayor Campaigns Despite limited direct engagement with crypto issues during his campaign, Mamdani’s critical remarks toward the industry, and toward Cuomo’s advisory role for crypto exchange OKX, which later paid $500 million in penalties, drew backlash from prominent tech and finance figures. Gemini’s Tyler Winklevoss and Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire were among those who criticized Mamdani, while billionaire Bill Ackman poured funds into anti-Mamdani PACs. Mamdani brushed off their opposition with characteristic wit. “He’s spending more money against me than I would even tax him.” As Mamdani prepares to take office on January 1, all eyes are on how his administration will navigate the balance between progressive policymaking and the city’s influential financial and crypto sectors.

The debut of U.S. spot price ETFs was a big deal for the cryptocurrency market at large, so much so that it incited a major bull run in 2024. Looking back today, the bets on crypto ETFs were right. BTC and ETH ETFs have become a big part of the crypto market, controlling over $175 billion in assets in just one year. In this article, we will explain in detail why crypto ETFs are such a big deal and the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, among other things. Why Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Are in the Spotlight The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs was met with intense euphoria among crypto investors because it was believed they would essentially bridge crypto to Wall Street and bring about institutional and regulatory acceptance. How ETFs Bridge Traditional Finance and Crypto First of all, an ETF or exchange-traded fund is not unique to the cryptocurrency space. It started from traditional finance and has been used for decades to invest in mutual funds and a basket of different assets. Now, one of the roadblocks that decelerated the adoption of crypto by traditional investors is the complexity in managing cryptocurrencies. Not many investors know how or want to deal with the friction and risks of buying and storing BTC and other crypto assets. The listing of crypto ETFs basically waived off these concerns, bringing down crypto to an instrument that most TradFi investors are already familiar with. 2024–2025 ETF Boom — Spot Approvals and Market Impact The success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw a rush in the applications for other crypto assets, including SOL, XRP, DOGE, and other major altcoins. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has even made it easier for more crypto assets to gain ETF approval, and much faster. In September, the regulator approved generic listing standards for spot crypto ETFs, removing the need for lengthy case-by-case approvals. That implies more crypto assets could make it to Wall Street, which would translate to more capital inflows from institutions, financial advisors, and retail investors in TradiFi. Institutional Demand for Regulated Crypto Exposure Spot ETFs widen the door to institutional demand for underlying crypto assets. As stated earlier, financial institutions, wealth managers, hedge funds, and retail investors are more likely to engage with crypto through these ETFs because it is a familiar product. There are other benefits that come with it, such as ease of access and regulatory comfort attached to it. Institutions that wouldn’t dabble in the crypto market directly are now doing so through ETFs. In August, top universities Harvard and Brown revealed holding $116 million and $13 million in Bitcoin through ETFs. What Is a Bitcoin ETF? A Bitcoin ETF is simply an investment fund that tracks the value of Bitcoin. It’s traded on traditional stock exchanges, similar to how Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and shares of other companies are traded. Investors who buy into Bitcoin ETFs indirectly gain exposure to the largest crypto without needing to worry about securing the asset. All that is handled by the fund issuer and the custodian firm designated for that particular ETF. How Bitcoin ETFs Work There are two categories of Bitcoin ETFs: spot and futures, and each works differently. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are based on the real-time market price of BTC. That means the issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, etc., would need to buy and hold the actual Bitcoin. So, in this sense, owning a share of a spot Bitcoin ETF is similar to holding a fraction of BTC, without needing to deal with the actual coin. The Bitcoin backing the shares is usually held with a regulated third-party custodian, not the fund issuer itself. For instance, Coinbase and Anchorage are the custodians of BlackRock’s Bitcoins. When there is high demand for the spot ETF shares on the stock exchange, the issuers like BlackRock buy more BTC to create new shares. And when investors want to sell the ETF shares back to the fund, the issuer will need to sell a corresponding amount of BTC to redeem the shares. On the other hand, a futures-based ETF is based on futures contracts that bet on the future price of Bitcoin. They are usually traded on a regulated exchange like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Spot vs Futures Bitcoin ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer the closest exposure to the largest cryptocurrency than the futures-based products because they directly invest and track spot BTC. With the futures ETFs, there may be price deviations due to market dynamics. And since issuers only hold futures contracts, there is usually no need for a custodian. Spot Bitcoin ETFs generally have a lower expense ratio, i.e., operating expenses, compared to futures ETFs. For instance, BlackRock’s IBIT, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, has a 0.25% expense ratio, whereas ProShares’s BITO, the largest futures Bitcoin ETF, charges 0.95%. Key Issuers of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Below are five of the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF issuers by assets under management, as of October 2025. 1. BlackRock BlackRock is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF and also the world’s largest asset manager. The firm’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) currently has $64.3 billion in cumulative total net flow and more than $89 billion in AUM. 2. Fidelity Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) is currently the second-largest, with $12.6 billion in cumulative total net flow and $22.84 billion in AUM. 3. Grayscale Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) comes third, with over $19 billion in AUM. It has a negative total net flow of -$24.6 billion. 4. Ark & 21Shares ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) takes the fourth place, with $2.11 billion in net flow and $4.75 billion in assets under management. 5. Bitwise Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) is the fifth-largest spot Bitcoin ETF, with up to $2.39 billion in net flow and $4.59 billion in AUM. Underlying Asset Exposure — BTC Holdings and Custody As mentioned earlier, spot Bitcoin ETFs are intended to closely reflect the price of the underlying BTC. As such, the issuers have to purchase or sell BTC from their treasury to issue or redeem ETF shares in response to demand. The responsibility of managing or securing the holdings is usually outsourced to a third-party digital asset custodian. Interestingly, Coinbase happens to be the primary custodian for most of the spot Bitcoin ETFs trading in the U.S. market. Bitcoin ETF as “Digital Gold” Investment Vehicle Bitcoin ETFs brought about another channel for investors to buy into BTC, a store of value, similar to how people are also trading gold ETFs. The “digital gold” narrative for Bitcoin is based on shared characteristics of scarcity with gold. The supply of gold is limited by the amount that can be mined from the earth. Likewise, Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins. No more than that number of BTC will ever exist. What Is an Ethereum ETF? An Ethereum ETF tracks the value of Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency. Buying shares of an Ethereum ETF gives investors indirect exposure to ETH. How Ethereum ETFs Differ from Bitcoin ETFs The first and obvious difference between Ethereum ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs is the underlying asset. The former is based on BTC, while the latter is based on ETH. BTC is primarily perceived as a store of value due to its fixed supply. ETH, meanwhile, functions as programmable money for smart contracts and DeFi. Also, BTC is based on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, while ETH is based on Proof-of-Stake (PoS). That means, Ethereum ETFs can passively earn investors staking rewards, but Bitcoin ETFs cannot. So, investors can only make a profit from capital appreciation with BTC ETFs, while ETH ETFs can offer both capital appreciation and staking rewards. Spot vs Futures Ethereum ETFs Ethereum spot and futures ETFs work the same way as their respective Bitcoin counterparts. The only difference is in the underlying asset. Spot Ethereum ETFs directly invest in the actual Ether, while the futures ETFs invest in Ether futures contracts. Holding the spot ETF shares gives you direct exposure to the price of ETH, while the futures allow you to speculate on the price. Ethereum’s Unique Features — Smart Contracts and Staking Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a Turing-complete blockchain, which means it can, in theory, execute any arbitrary computational instruction or program. That is primarily the reason Ethereum is able to support smart contracts, DeFi, and dApp protocols. However, Ethereum wasn’t initially designed to support staking. It started out as a PoW blockchain, before finally transitioning to PoS after a major upgrade in 2022 dubbed “ The Merge .” That transition led to a chain split, birthing the current Ethereum network, which is secured by validators staking their coins, rather than miners. ETH ETFs and Staking Yield — A Layer of Passive Income Since Ethereum now allows staking, it means Ethereum ETF issuers like Grayscale and VanEck can stake their holdings to earn staking rewards. As of October, the annualized staking yield for Ethereum was 2.87%. The issuers can choose to distribute the yield to shareholders as a form of cash dividend or distribution, similar to how bond or stock ETFs distribute income. Another way they can manage the staking reward is by reinvesting it into the fund. When that happens, the funds are added back to holdings and so restaked to earn more returns. Also, putting back the reward to the funds could lead to a higher Net Asset Value (NAV) per share, which is good for investors. Earlier in October, Grayscale rolled out staking for its spot Ethereum ETPs, covering Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. Approved and Pending ETH ETF Issuers Here are the five biggest spot Ethereum issuers based on assets under management as of October. 1. BlackRock BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) is currently the largest spot Ethereum ETF, with more than $1.2 billion in traded volume and $15.68 billion in AUM. 2. Grayscale Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) comes second with $117.9 million in traded volume and $4 billion in AUM. 3. Fidelity Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) comes third with $110.5 million in traded volume and $2.97 billion in AUM. 4. Bitwise Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) is in fourth place with $22.4 million in traded volume and $473 million in AUM. 5. VanEck VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV) comes fifth with only $11 million in traded volume and $254 million in AUM.

Market data shows these ETFs now account for billions in daily trading volume. Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume and Liquidity The listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market has led to a substantial increase in overall Bitcoin trading volumes, especially concentrated around U.S. market hours. Market data from SoSoValue shows that more than $4 billion in volume was traded in a single day (October 24th), with $90.60 million inflow. The chart shows that the trading volume has been on a steady climb since the first batch was approved. More precisely, in just 18 months after launching, spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume. As of October, the number sits at $1.14 trillion. Cumulative Spot Bitcoin ETF Volumes. Source: Newhedge All U.S. Bitcoin ETFs now account for $149.96 billion worth of BTC in assets under management, according to market data from SoSoValue. That is equivalent to about 6.78% of the BTC market cap. Ethereum ETF Market Uptake Since Launch Ethereum ETFs have also had a similar trajectory to Bitcoin ETFs. However, the volume is lower than that of Bitcoin. Data shows Ethereum ETFs have only amassed $271.7 billion in cumulative trading volume since their inception a year ago. Clearly, the volume for Ethereum ETFs is not as strong as Bitcoin’s, but they seem quite correlated. Cumulative Spot Ethereum ETF Volumes. Source: TheBlock In the period that Bitcoin ETFs recorded $4 billion in daily traded volume, the Ethereum ETFs only brought in $1.82 billion in trading volume. So far, spot Ethereum ETFs account for $26.39 billion in assets under management, which is equivalent to 5.55% of ETH’s current market cap. Price Correlation — ETH Following BTC or Decoupling? The price of BTC has gone from $46,600 to the current price of $113,911 since the ETFs launched. That represents a whopping 144% increase. Similarly, the ETH price increased from $3,439 to the current price of $4,124, but has seen a slight gain of 19% so far. But despite the diverging returns, there has been, in fact, a strong price correlation between BTC and ETH. It didn’t just start. The correlation can be traced back a couple of years and has continued to persist even with the launch of the spot ETFs. BTC and ETH price trends. Source: TradingView Institutional Allocation Trends There’s no question that Bitcoin is the darling digital asset of most institutions. This is already evident in the volume of ETFs traded, including spot coins accumulated by publicly traded companies and other institutional players alike. However, some are beginning to ease up on diversifying into Ether as an income-producing growth asset, so to speak. With Ether, institutions make gains from both price appreciation and staking rewards. That is giving firms more reason to diversify or hold Ether as well in their portfolio. Over the past months, more companies have come out to accumulate ETH as a digital asset treasury, a move that started with BTC back in 2020. Staking: The Game-Changer for Ethereum ETFs Not just for the ETFs, staking is one feature that has given companies more reason to hold ETH. But it’s not all that rosy. How ETH ETFs Integrate or Exclude Staking Rewards Ethereum ETFs’ staking has yet to kick into high gear. In fact, most issuers are yet to enable staking, other than Grayscale, which only began supporting it in early October. According to the filing, Grayscale intends to stake its ETH through its custodian, Coinbase, and third-party staking providers. Grayscale said it will distribute Ether (or cash from the sale of Ether) received as yield to investors under certain conditions from time to time. Each of Grayscale’s ETH-based ETFs , i.e., Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: ETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: ETHE), uses a different reward approach. ETHE will pay distributions for those who like cash flow, while ETH will roll staking returns into NAV to compound the reward. Other issuers are likely to use either of these approaches to integrate staking rewards into their funds. SEC Considerations and Custodial Complexity Staking has always been met with fierce resistance from the SEC. Many issuers had to tell the regulator they wouldn’t participate in staking as part of the conditions for approval. “Neither the trust, nor the sponsor, nor the custodian, nor any other person associated with the trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the trust’s ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,” a 2024 Cboe filing reads. However, more issuers began to push for it again after the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance said in May that certain staking activities don’t constitute an offering of securities. Besides, ETFs require daily liquidity for investor redemptions, but staked ETH is subject to an unbonding period. That could add an extra layer of complexity in the management of the assets. Impact on ETF Yield, Taxation, and Total Return Staking can boost the total return of Ethereum ETFs, but it can also pose a big challenge with respect to taxation. Funds that allow staking will return approximately 3% annualized yield to investors, which is an added benefit to the price growth of the potential increase in the price of ETH, compared to funds that don’t support it. But staking could be treated as an income-making activity, and that can affect how Ethereum ETFs are classified and taxed. At any point, the issuer, like Grayscale, gains “dominion and control” over the staking rewards; that is, once they are able to sell or transfer the rewards, they become ordinary income and are taxable. Regulatory Landscape and Compliance SEC Approval Timeline for BTC ETFs 2013: Winklevoss brothers filed the first-ever application for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. 2017: The SEC rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust proposal, citing concerns about market manipulation. 2018: The SEC rejected Winklevoss’s second application for similar reasons. 2021: The first Bitcoin futures ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), began trading. October 2021: Grayscale applied to convert its Bitcoin trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF. 2022: The SEC turned down Grayscale’s request and that of other issuers, including Fidelity. June 2022: Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC for denying its application. May 2023: Cathie Wood’s ARK Investments filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF. June 2023: BlackRock followed suit, with other asset issuers like Fidelity. August 2023: U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit unanimously ruled in favor of Grayscale, stating the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious.” January 10, 2024: The SEC approved the applications to list and trade shares for 11 spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). January 11: The approved spot Bitcoin ETFs officially began trading on U.S. exchanges. Custody and Transparency Requirements As we already know, traditional ETFs are heavily regulated, and so, crypto ETFs are not left out. They are subjected to similar requirements. The SEC requires that the underlying cryptocurrency of spot ETFs be held by a regulated and trusted custodian, which is why most of the issuers had to always state their designated primary custodian in their applications. For transparency sake, the SEC also requires that crypto ETF issuers file annual audited financial statements on Form 10-K and quarterly financials on Form 10-Q, similar to a traditional public company. Jurisdictional Differences (U.S., Canada, EU, Asia) The regulatory approaches to BTC and ETH ETFs vary across global financial hubs, especially the U.S., Canada, the EU, and Asia. The U.S. regulators were previously known to be hostile towards cryptocurrencies. It wasn’t until after the Trump administration stepped in that policies eased up for crypto and stablecoins, with the U.S. government even announcing a national Bitcoin reserve. Canada happened to be more friendly to crypto. Canada was reportedly the first country to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF under a clear regulatory environment. The EU has also begun to clear up regulatory hurdles for crypto, with the recent passing of the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which provides a unified framework for crypto-asset markets across member states. Regions like Hong Kong also put Asia on the map. Hong Kong actually sped up approval of Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs in a bid to beat the U.S. to it. However, places like China continue to maintain a strict stance with bans on cryptocurrency trading and mining. Which ETF Fits Your Investment Strategy? Investors buy BTC and ETH as a store of value or passive income, and that also influences their choices regarding investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin ETF — Conservative Store-of-Value Exposure Bitcoin is perceived as a store of value due to its fixed supply, which creates a sense of scarcity. And based on the economics of scarcity, many people purchase Bitcoin and its related funds as a good long-term investment and even as a hedge against inflation. Ethereum ETF — Tech-Driven Growth and Yield Ether would appeal more to people who believe in Ethereum’s future as a decentralized computing platform and the concept of Web3 at large. ETH and its funds are better assets to hold, especially for investors looking to earn passively from their idle stash. Balanced Portfolio Approach — BTC/ETH Split Strategies A general rule of thumb with investing is never to put all your eggs in one basket. Balancing your portfolio would mean having both BTC and ETH exposure. Although BTC and ETH have a high correlation, some analyses suggest that a 70/30 or 50/50 allocation might offer a better risk-adjusted return profile than an exclusive holding of either. Key Considerations: Risk, Liquidity, Time Horizon Liquidity, risk, and time horizon, including fees, are some of the factors to consider when deciding which ETF to hold. BTC is often less volatile than ETH. Also, as we explained earlier, Bitcoin ETFs have more liquidity than Ethereum ETFs. Management fees can be higher or lower depending on the issuers and underlying assets. The Future of Crypto ETFs Multi-Asset and Index Crypto ETFs As the crypto ETF market matures, we could begin to see more entrants of multi-asset and index-based crypto ETFs. These funds offer investors exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies, rather than a single asset. Something equivalent to the S&P 500. Integration of DeFi and On-Chain Yield Products The integration of on-chain activities like staking and DeFi lending into the ETF structure is another key trend that could play out in the future as a way to enhance income features of the funds. But that could be met with heavy regulation. Institutional Entrants and Expanding Access Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are only a year into the U.S. market. It’s not far-fetched to expect more institutional exposure to BTC and ETH through the funds, which means more capital flow and demand for the assets.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides|BTC|ETH,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-05 06:02:21
